Choose your main astringent.,
Choose a secondary astringent.,
Choose an emollient.,
Decide whether you want to put in a styptic.,
Add any fragrances or essential oils.",How to Make Aftershave1," An astringent is a substance that shrinks body tissues — in this case, your pores. When they shave, most people use warm water, which opens up the pores. Using an astringent in your aftershave is important because it reverses that process. Astringent also sterilizes any cuts or nicks you accidentally give yourself while shaving.


Many DIYers choose rubbing alcohol because it's cheap and readily available. It usually has an ethanol content of 70-99%, making it effective but rather harsh on the skin.
You can also use potable spirits as your main astringent. Increasingly, people are turning to vodka, rum, and even the incredibly botanical gin for astringents. These astringents are usually a little more forgiving on the skin than rubbing alcohol, but will also end up more expensive.;
, Because alcohol is usually very hard on the skin, a second, more mollifying astringent is usually paired with alcohol to offset some of the stinging. Witch hazel is a great secondary astringent.


Witch hazel is made from the bark of a plant. Distilled, the witch hazel contains tannins which help soothe irritation, fight redness, and even fight acne-causing bacteria.Unlike alcohol, witch hazel does not sting on skin and has a very refreshing feel.

, An emollient is a substance that softens and moisturizes the skin simultaneously.Not only do emollients help skin retain water, they also reduce itching, redness, and flakiness that is common after shaving. Some emollients that you might consider in your aftershave recipe include:


Glycerin.Glycerin is a great emollient that is used in virtually every high-end shaving product. Pre-shave soap? Glycerin! Pre-shave lotion? Glycerin. Shaving cream? Glycerin! Glycerin is cheap and makes skin feel silky smooth.
Lanolin.Lanolin usually comes in a wax. If using for an aftershave, be sure to look for liquid lanolin. Otherwise, your emollient and other ingredients won't coalesce.
Mineral oil.Probably the least popular of the three, but nonetheless workable, mineral oil is odorless, tasteless, and is commonly used as a laxatives (yikes!) in addition to an emollient.

, A styptic is any substance that, when applied to the skin, staunches bleeding. If you or your man often cuts himself during the shaving process, it may be a good idea to introduce a styptic into the aftershave. A great styptic that dissolves easily into aftershaves is potassium alum. Also used as a deodorant, and a possible treatment for acne, alum staunches small nicks and cuts with a magical effortlessness.

, As of now, your aftershave likely doesn't smell like much, or very good. Essential oils are a great way to add fragrance and kick up the medicinal content another notch. Especially if used in combination, essential oils need only be used sparingly.



Eucalyptus oil produces a wonderful cooling and tingling sensation, and has a very distinct aroma.
Menthol is a signature scent that never fails to cool. Very nice when used in combination with eucalyptus.

Lavender oil has a rich, grassy smell that instantly smacks of summer. Very versatile, and supposedly great for the skin.Citrus oils are known for their acne-fighting properties; they are graced with a sweet, fresh scent.
Cedarwood oil, redolent of smoky, sweet wood, is known for its antifungal properties. It makes a great oil to experiment with.

Buy the correct wax.,
Make sure your hair is the correct length.,
Create a waxing schedule.,
Don’t bother with numbing creams.,
Undress and clean the area with soap and water.,
Heat the wax.,
Find a comfortable environment.,
Test the wax.,
Decide how you want to look.,
Start waxing.,
Remove extra hair and extra wax.,
Keep your skin smooth.,
Soothe your burns.,
Fix any redness.",How to Wax Your Bikini Area at Home," Your bikini area has very sensitive skin and very coarse hair. This means waxing the area can be very painful. Choosing the wrong wax could lead to more pain than what is necessary. There are different types waxes that have different benefits and disadvantages, but for avoiding pain, hard wax is your best choice. It does not grab any skin and is best for the coarse hair you have in your bikini area. Cold wax strips are warmed up in your hands and are great to avoid mess. But sometimes you need to go over spots more than once to remove all the hair, so it is not recommended for avoiding pain. Soft wax is put on with paper strips and is better for finer hair. It is best for large, non-sensitive areas so it is not recommended for your bikini area. ;
, It is important not to try to wax if your hair is too short or too long. Your hair should be about ¼ inch when you wax. If your hair is too short, there will not be enough hair for the wax to grab. If your hair is too long, the wax will grab too much hair. The long hair will also be coming from various directions, causing more pain. If your hair is too long you can trim it with an electric razor. , You should wax every three to four weeks. If you go longer than that, your hair will be too long and waxing will be more painful. Staying on a strict waxing cycle gets your hair used to the pain and builds tolerance.


Don’t wax before your period. This is when you are the most sensitive to pain. , Purchasing creams that promise to take away the pain are just a waste of money. As nice as it would be to be able to numb your bikini area ahead of time to prevent pain, they don’t actually work and the waxing is still just as painful. Put baby powder on your bikini area beforehand instead. This will help remove moisture so the wax can grab the hair easier.
About 20-45 minutes before you wax, take an ibuprofen to help lessen the pain. , Before you start, take a shower and wash your bikini area with unscented soap and warm water. Make sure you are completely dry before you start waxing. Stay undressed, it will be easier to wax without underwear or clothes getting in the way. , You can heat the hot wax in a wax warmer or in the microwave. A wax warmer keeps the wax warm throughout the process, prevents the wax from getting too hot, and is less messy. If you don’t want to purchase a wax warmer, you can just use your microwave. , Don’t try to wax in the living room or a shared space of your house. Go somewhere you can be completely alone and are comfortable. Wait until everyone is gone so there is no chance of someone walking in on you. You want to be able to take your time and be able to relax while you work.


You can wax on your bed or on your floor (with a towel laid down) so you are comfortable.
Have a mirror in front of you so you can see what you are doing. , Make sure you test the wax before you start applying. If the wax is too hot you can burn yourself. Take a wax applicator stick and stir the pot of wax. Scrape off any extra wax and dab the inside of your wrist to check the heat. , There are many options for bikini area looks. You can wax your bikini line (the area that shows when you have a swimsuit on), you can create a shape (landing strip, triangle, and heart are the most common), or you can do a Brazilian wax and remove everything.


If you want to create a shape, you can purchase stencils or use a bright lip liner to outline the area you don’t want to wax. , Carefully smear the wax in one section (about an inch wide and up to three inches long). Make sure to put the wax on in the direction of your hair growth. Wait for 30 seconds for the wax to harden then pull off the wax in the opposite direction of your hair growth. Since it is hot wax, you can directly pull the wax without paper.


Start with your inner thigh and work your way in and then back until you are finished waxing.
Pulling the wax off is the only way to remove it once you apply it.
Pull your skin tight in the area you are waxing to help with pain. , When you are finished, remove any remaining hairs with tweezers. Any small pieces of wax that did not come off can be taken off with wax remover or baby oil. , When you are finished waxing, rinse off to help sooth discomfort. When you are rinsed off, exfoliate your bikini area to help prevent uncomfortable ingrown hairs and to keep your bikini area stay soft and smooth. If you get ingrown hairs don’t pop them, they could get infected. Use hydrogen peroxide or alcohol free astringent to help prevent infection. , If you burn yourself on the hot wax, get a wash cloth wet with clean, cold water. Press the wash cloth on the burned area for 15 minutes. Put aloe vera gel on the burn to help with the discomfort and inflammation. If the burn blisters or swells go to a doctor. , It is possible your bikini area will be very red after you wax. If this happens, microwave milk in a bowl. Soak a wash cloth in the warm milk and press on your bikini area until the redness fades. If you are at home or have privacy, take your underwear off for an hour or two when you are finished. This helps fix any redness. Even if you aren't red, you might want to do this anyway to prevent irritation. "

Find your ideal shaving cream.,
Examine your razor.,
Prepare your shaving station.,
Pre-trim if necessary.,
Wet the shaving area.",How to Get the Perfect Shave1," Depending on your skin type, the shaving cream you are using can be the difference between a close shave and razor burn. The best shaving creams are those that are formulated with many lubricants and moisturizers. The ideal lather these should give you should be rich and creamy, without much foam.A quality shaving cream can also save you money on razor blades. The less resistance your razor meets while shaving, the longer your blades will last.;
, Safety razors become dull over time and must be replaced. If you notice that your razor has dull edges or no longer shaves as well as it did initially, you should change your razor.Depending on the thickness of your hair, you will want to change your razor every 3 to 10 shaves.Disposable razors can be expensive. To make your razors last, you may want to use a pair of jeans to prolong the life of this tool. Run your razor up and down the entire length of your jeans 10 to 20 times in the opposite direction you would normally shave with your blades. Some users claim this technique has kept safety razors sharp for several months.You may want to use an old pair of jeans to keep your blade sharp as running your blade along the fabric may cause it to break down over time.

, To get the best possible shave, you'll need to have the right tools and quality shaving products. A shaving brush, while not necessary for a good shave, is a handy shaving utensil that raises your hair, creates a thick lather, and exfoliates - all of which help you get a better shave.A list of useful shaving tools follows:


After shave lotion (optional)
Clippers or scissors (for trimming long hair only)
Safety Razor
Shaving brush (optional)
Shaving cream (or soap)

, If the hair your are about to shave is long, you should trim it short with some clippers or hair cutting scissors before you shave. Long hair will collect in your razor more quickly, requiring you to rinse more regularly. It can also cause your razor to dull sooner than it might have.


Trim the hair you are about to shave as short as you can to prepare the area you are about to shave for lathering.

, Hair that is wet is easier for your razor to cut, and will help you achieve the best possible shave. A shower beforehand is a good idea to ensure the area you will be shaving is sufficiently dampened, but if this is not possible, warm water splashed on your face from the sink and/or a hot towel can prep your dry hair for your shave.Heat is important for opening up the pores on your face before you shave. The warm towel method has been employed by barbers for ages, and might be useful for you as well. Shaving your face cold or dry can result in razor burn and shaving rash."

Lather up.,
Shave with the grain.,
Repeat for a closer shave.,
Protect your skin.,
Use an after shaving moisturizing lotion.At your local drugstore, pharmacy, or even supermarket, you should be able to find a lotion that is formulated for use post-shave.",How to Get the Perfect Shave2," If you have a shaving brush, apply your shaving cream to the end of the bristles of the brush and circular motions to apply the cream to your face, ending the motion in an upward direction.This can also be accomplished with your hands. Massage the cream with your fingers into the shaving area, again using circular motions that end in an upward direction.Shaving cream creates a lather that helps your razor to glide with little resistance while preserving the moisture locked in the hair you are trying to shave.This will make the hair easier to shave and result in the best shave possible.
Soap should be worked into as thick a lather as possible and then can be applied in the same fashion as shaving cream.

, The direction in which your hair grows is also referred to as the ""grain"" of your hair.By shaving with the grain you lower the chances of cutting yourself, causing irritation, or getting razor bumps.


If you are shaving your face, being with the sides, as these are generally the easiest part of the face to shave. After you've finished with the sides of your face, you can move to the mustache area and finish at the chin.Use a light touch and short strokes.Pressing too hard with your razor can cause razor bumps and razor burn. Long strokes can build up hair, shaving cream, and skin, causing your long stroke to end in a less than perfect shave., You should avoid shaving too much or using too many strokes when shaving as this can cause razor burn, irritation, or razor bumps. However, if the hair you are shaving is particularly thick or has an irregular grain, applying another layer of shaving cream and shaving your face one more time might be necessary.

, Due to that fact that over the course of your shaving you have removed the top layer of dead skin from your face, your skin will be more vulnerable to bacteria and clogged pores.Rinse your face with warm water to remove any excess shaving cream, and then use a cleansing facial wash with antiseptic properties.


You should consider using a solution that has tea tree oil and witch hazel. Both of these natural ingredients have antiseptic, astringent, and soothing properties, which will help defend your freshly shaved skin.

, Up to two layers of skin can be removed by your razor over the course of your shaving.A moisturizing lotion will help keep the skin you are shaving healthy so you can show off your perfect shave.

"
Be patient from the outset.,
Prepare your face for shaving.,
Use the right angle.,
Go against the grain.,
Prioritize sensitive areas.,
Take note of your technique while shaving.,
Maintain your electric razor.",How to Get the Perfect Shave3," Most electric razors require at least 2 weeks of use before your face becomes accustomed to your shaving tool and your shaving tool becomes accustomed to you. The natural oils of your face will coat your electric shaver over time, resulting in less friction and a closer shave., Though some still recommend showering before you shave to soften the bristles of your hair and remove dead skin and oil, most agree that classic electric shavers work best when your face is dry and the hair stiff.Some newer models of electric razor are designed for use in wet or dry environments, on wet or dry skin. If your model claims to have this ability, you should experiment with different degrees of wetness to find what works best for you.

, For the best results for most electric razors, you'll need to attack the hair you are shaving at a right angle, forming an ""L"" shape with your razor and face. With your free hand, pull your skin tight to make the hairs stand up straight, making it easier for your shaver to do its thing., Those who started shaving with a bladed razor might think it best to shave with the grain, but the opposite is actually true where most electric razors are concerned.Shave in the direction opposite your hair grows naturally to get the best shave out of your electric shaver.

, The mechanism of your electric shaver can build up slight heat while you are shaving. This can lead to minor irritation on sensitive areas of your face, like the back of your neck. Don't press too hard with your shaver and aim for sensitive spots first to prevent irritation., This is especially important if you are making the change from a bladed razor to an electric model. Any difficult areas should be targeted first and shaved with light pressure.If you have irregular growth patterns where you are trying to shave, you should use your fingers to determine the direction of growth.


Run your fingers across your skin. The direction with the least resistance is the direction in which you hair is growing.

, Hair, gunk, and oil can build up in the moving parts of your electric razor over time, causing it to perform less efficiently. Cleaning your electric razor regularly will help your shaver perform to a higher standard, and will keep it running longer as well."

Look to see what type of razor you have.,
Inspect your razor blade.,
Discontinue use of razors that are damaged or rusty.,
Strop to polish and reduce bacteria on a blade.,
Know that stropping is different than sharpening.,
Identify a razor strop.,
Find a safe location.,
Secure your strop.,
Lap your razor against the strop.",How to Know if Your Razor Needs Stropping," Only straight razors require stropping. However, the amount of stropping depends on the type of blade, the strop itself, and the condition of the blade. Most razors people use today are not straight razors and do not require stropping.


You may choose to strop disposable razor blades. By stropping a disposable blade, you’ll increase its life and effectiveness. However, make sure to get a strop designed for disposable blades. Some of them are made of denim.;
, One of the best ways to figure out how much stropping a blade needs is to look at the blade itself. You’ll notice a lot when you look carefully at a blade. Blades that need substantial stropping may:


Have small pieces of hair, water, and other debris.
Have many tiny imperfections in the razor blade itself.
Produce uneven or dull shaves., While stropping does have the effect of improving the efficiency of razors, you’ll receive no benefit by stropping damaged razors. Thus, you should stop using, fix, or throw away problematic razors.


Straight razors that are dull will require sharpening.
Straight razors with rust or other issues may need to be repaired or restored.
Straight or disposable razors that are rusty or damaged should no longer be used., The action of stropping a blade against a flexible material results in a polishing effect that removes debris from your blade. It also helps:


Minimize the chance of rusting.
Align the blade so you get a straighter shave.
Remove skin, soap, grime, and bacteria from the blade of your razor., Both are different activities that address unique issues. By knowing the difference between stropping and sharpening, you’ll learn to appreciate the benefits of both and the complexities of shaving with certain razors.


Sharpening a razor is also called “honing” and is done to ensure close, clean, and quick shaves., A razor strop is a utensil or instrument used to align a razor. Razor strops come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and are made of many different materials. This includes:


Canvas
Leather
Denim
Other flexible fabrics or materials., By nature, stropping can be a somewhat dangerous task. This is because you’ll be moving a razor back and forth through the air. If someone or something interrupts you, you could lose control of the blade and hurt yourself or someone else.


Lock the bathroom door while stropping.
Avoid stropping around small children or animals., Before stropping your razor, you need to make sure it is secure. By securing it, you’ll make sure there is tension in strop and it effective aligns and removes dirt and moisture from the blade.


If you’re using a strop that requires it to be tied or fastened to something, fasten it to something that won’t move.
You may be able to lay certain, heavy-duty, strops on top of a cabinet or table., Lapping is the process in which you take your straight razor and wipe it against the strop. By lapping your razor, you’ll straighten and align the blade so you get a better and more effective shave.


Position the blade against the strop so the angle is flat or at about 180 degrees.
Move the razor away from your body.
Avoid applying too much pressure against the strop.
Try to move relatively fast, but make sure you can maintain control of your hand and the blade.
Most people agree that 40 to 60 laps against a strop is more than sufficient after you sharpen a straight blade. In addition, people generally agree that 20 laps should be enough for daily stropping."

Disposable razors are cheap and — no surprise here — disposable. They are best purchased in bulk and discarded after five or fewer uses, after which time the blade or blades become dull.;
, These razors are usually outfitted with interchangeable, disposable blade cartridges; sometimes, the entire razor (including the handle) can be thrown away after use. Between brands and models, there can be significant differences in usability, durability, efficiency (more blades at least make more passes in less time, and may even arrange hairs for better cutting than with multiple single-blade passes.








Multi-blade razors are touted as more durable than disposable razors, although this is sometimes disputed. Multi-blade manufacturers say that their blades last up to a month and a half, although many only get about two weeks worth of shaving out of their blades.If you're concerned about price, multi-blades may not be the best bet for you. Packages of multi-blade refills can regularly put the customer back $25-$50. If affordability is your goal, stick with disposable razors.
The handle's blade mounts may differ, but a new handle for a superior blade type may rapidly pay for itself in less-frequent blade changes. You can also purchase more high-end mounts that fit with commercial multi-blades.

, These blades are currently enjoying a resurgence in popularity amongst men.Even though multi-blade razors are technically safety razors, this is what people usually refer to when they say ""safety razor."" Razors with a single-edged blade are very outdated, and rare.


Purchase the handle separately. These can be found anywhere from $10-$1000 for more fancier handles. Usually, the handle will be the more significant investment, as the blades themselves are relatively cheap.
Purchase the double-edged blades in bulk. You should be able to get them for considerably less than $1 per blade. The handle of your safety razor unscrews, and you fit your blade into the handle manually.
Double-edged blades usually last for about five shaves. Because they are cheap, it's recommended to change them every week if you shave daily.
Double-edged blades are quite sharp and often leave nicks and cuts on the inexperienced user. Shaving with the grain and making multiple passes is highly recommended on safety blades.

, Most electric shavers are designed to be used on dry skin. They do not produce as close a shave as a safety razor would do.The advantage of an electric razor is that; you don't need to fill up the bathroom sink with water, or use shaving foam.


Inexpensive electric shavers in particular are slow because unlike safety razors, they do not get all the hair with each pass.
They may not be cheaper than safety razors over time, because the heads do wear out and can be as expensive as safety razor cartridges to replace.
Some electric shavers can be used with water or lather; these will be cordless, conspicuously marked, and expensive.

, These have fallen out of favour since the emergence of the safety razor from the 1900s onwards, and the invention of electric shavers; because they require considerable skill to use.


Straight razors are probably the sharpest razor out there. (They also have more heft than your average safety razor.) Shaving with straight razors will probably leave you with more cuts than your average shave with a safety razor, if you're inexperienced. In the hands of an experienced barber, straight razors offer the closest shave.

, Washing removes excess oil and dead skin cells, which can interfere with the razor or irritate your gently-scraped skin while simultaneously reducing bacteria that could cause infection. Washing also moisturizes the hair about to be shaved, softening it and making the shave easier.









Use warm water when washing your hair pre-shave. Warm water will help soften your follicles and encourage your pores to open, making for a closer shave.
Try shaving after you shower. If you shave in the morning, shaving after your shower will give your whiskers time to absorb the water from the shower and should make for a smoother shave.

, Shaving skin directly with a razor is a no-no: You'll end up looking like you just had a date with Freddy Krueger. The razor should never contact your skin without some kind of lubricant mediating the encounter. Otherwise, the blade will drag the skin rather than skim along its surface.








Apply shaving cream (or gel) liberally over your entire face. Shaving cream softens the hair and moisturizes the skin, but if you're in a pinch, you can also shave with conditioner or even with soap (only if you're really in a pinch).
If you're using a shaving brush and shaving cream to work the shaving cream into a lather, put a small dollop of shaving cream the size of a dime into a coffee mug, bowl, or other receptacle. Wet your shaving brush with cold water. Whip the shaving brush around your bowl in a circular motion, agitating the shaving cream. Adding more cool water as necessary, whip the shaving cream into a light lather with soft peaks. This should take 2-3 minutes. Use the shaving brush to work the cream onto your face in a circular motion, going over your entire face multiple times.

, If you can afford to let the shaving cream rest on your face a while before you attack it with a razor blade, you'll notice the difference. The shaving cream will continue moisturizing your whiskers, leaving them soft and wet., If you're using a multi-blade razor, which seems to be the most popular kind, hold the razor with your index finger extended near the top of the shaft, resting the head flat of the razor against the skin. The handle should be raised at an angle of 30 degrees or so.


If the cartridge is assisted by a spring to hold flat against skin curves, start shaving with the handle raised enough to compress this spring just a little into its range.
Drag the razor handle-first across the skin to shave. Applying pressure is not necessary; pressure or sideways movement can cause cuts. Try to bring the razor as lightly as possible across the surface of your skin.
As you practice, you'll be able to set down the razor, pull it across the skin, and raise it up at the end of a stroke in a smooth motion. A rolling razor like a ""Headblade"" can maintain the proper angle in hard-to-reach areas., On the first pass, always shave with the grain. This usually means shaving downward, but not always. Going against the grain (shaving the opposite direction that the hair grows) makes for a closer shave, but it also produces the most irritation and cuts. If you have a tendency to get bumps or rashes, or if you often get ingrown hairs, or if you simply consider your face too pretty to abuse, start shaving with the grain. A couple things to consider as you shave:









If you have a lot of whiskers on your face because you haven't shaved in a while, trim your beard before you shave. With a razor, it's easier and quicker to shave a beard that's one or two days old than it is to shave a beard that's one or two months old.
Each individual has their own unique facial hair pattern. If you're unsure of the direction your beard grows, don't shave for a couple days and observe the angles that your beard grows into. Different parts of your face can grow in different angles. This means you'll need to move your razor around and shave in different directions in order to shave with the grain.
It's okay to make several passes at your beard. When you shave with the grain, you'll notice that you don't cut off as much beard as you do when shave against the grain. (You'll also notice you don't bleed as much.) It's perfectly acceptable to shave once, apply another coating of lather, and shave again. It won't make you any less manly — or womanly.
For a closer (but safer) shave, on your second time around, try moving the blade across the grain in a kind of sideways swipe. If you hair grows down, shave from left to right (or right to left). This will give you a closer shave without as much irritation as shaving against the grain.
Some people shave in all four different directions. This gives a closer shave because hairs can grow in different directions even within a patch.

, You want your blades as clean and uncluttered as possible. Whenever you think there's possible buildup between or underneath your blades, dip and swirl your blades under water. It's usually a good idea to soften the water by adding soap (this will make the water go scummy, but will help protect the blade from the scratchy minerals that tend to dry on after use).

, You don't have to actually stretch the skin, but if your skin is loose in any way, it helps to create a flat, firm surface for the razor to cut across.


If you're shaving your underarms, for example, lift your arm as high as you can so that the skin under your arm is pulled tight. A multi-blade razor with a ridged or, better, rubbery leading edge will help pull skin tight for you right before shaving it.
Right beneath the jawline is a problem-area for many men because it is contoured. When you shave this area, lift the skin on your cheek up so that the skin that was right below your jawline is now right above it. Shave with the grain.

, You should not need to press down or apply pressure with the razor. If this is necessary, then the razor is probably not sharp enough. A sharp razor will cut hair cleanly at its base level with the skin.









Pressing the blade down may cut the hair at a slightly lower spot, but it will also bring the blade in contact with the sensitive skin that surrounds the other side of the follicle.
Applying pressure only makes it easier for a dull blade to tear the hair rather than cut it. Instead, guide your razor with minimal pressure against the skin. Keep the razor as flat to the skin as possible, so the sharp edge is not scraping against the skin more than necessary.

, Since electric shavers work by shearing the whiskers instead of shaving them, you want your hair to be upright and brittle.


""Lectric Shave"" or other, alcohol-based pre-shave lotions remove excess oil and help the hairs on your face stand up, making for an easier dry-shave.

, Unlike razors, where it's hard to shave against the grain, it's possible to shave against the grain with an electric razor.









If you're using a rotary (round) shaver instead of a foil shaver, work the shaver around your face in small, circular motions.
Use gentle pressure. Don't press down too hard, or you'll shear off some of your skin. Don't move too quickly, however, and let the shaver do the hard work for you.
Shave sensitive areas on your face first. This is because the shaver will generate heat after being on for a while, and heat can cause irritation. Best to go over the sensitive areas first and the hardier areas second.

, Because the electric shaver shears instead of shaves, it can take multiple passes to capture the hair in the small perforations on the shaver head. Be patient as you go over the desired areas, and remember not to press down too hard.

, Your electric razor will have hair and dead skin will be caught in the device. Lift the head and dump the refuse into a trash bin.


Optionally, put a small amount of metal lubricant on the head of the shaver after it's cleaned out. This will make the head of the shaver run smoothly over the surface of your skin.

, Washing your face post-shave will help you slough off all the dead skin that might have accumulated during the shave.


Facial scrubs that contain tea tree oil and witch hazel are especially good, as they protect against pimples and soothe irritated skin, respectively., Cold water will help soothe your newly-cut mug, as well as reduce bleeding caused by cuts by constricting the blood vessels., Don't rub with a towel, as that can irritate the freshly shaved skin. Use a generous amount of moisturizer that is free of perfumes and other potential irritants (e.g. baby oil) if you suffer from dry facial skin. Never apply deodorant, anti-perspirants, perfume, or anything that stings on just shaved skin.


You may use aftershave as a coolant or light perfume on your skin post-shave, but it could irritate your face. If you apply aftershave and it stings an area of your face, you know that you irritated that area during your shave. Take special caution next time you shave that area.

, Remove any hair or buildup that's accumulated while shaving. This avoids contaminants and minerals in the water from drying onto the blades making the blades blunt. Stainless steel blades may also oxidize to some degree when they come in contact with water. Slow the oxidation process by thoroughly drying your razor blade after use. Blades can also be 'stropped' on denim jeans by rubbing the blade in the non cutting direction about ten to twenty times or so; this dries and polishes the front of the blades and allows them to last many times longer.

Longer hair is more likely to clog a razor. Using a safety razor will work better than scissors and it will cut the hair shorter. If you use a clipper make sure you use a 0 or 1 blade on it, if you do it will cut almost as close as a razor blade.


Avoid using an electric razor that has rotating heads/trimmers on the scrotum. The skin of the scrotum is so thin and loose that it can be caught by the shaver, and this is extremely painful. Trimming the hair in this spot should be done with scissors.
If you decide to use a men's electric razor, avoid shaving down the underside of the penis and on the center of the scrotum. Getting a cut in those areas will be excessively painful.
After you trim your long hair off your scrotum the first time in the bathroom, you can trim your scrotum hair more easily by lying on your bed on your back. The same applies to shaving.;
, These are products that ""melt"" the hair away. Many men avoid using products like NAIR and other bikini area hair removal creams due to the sensitivity of the scrotal area. If you do want to try it, however, test the hair removal cream on the inside of your elbow before applying to your private parts. Then test a small amount of the cream on your genitals before going all the way. When applying it, do not allow any of the cream to get on the head (if uncircumcised, you can try to pull your foreskin well over your glans).

, Ensure the room you are using for shaving will be private for at least an hour (or however long you think the process will take). This is not something you want to rush through! Consider shaving late at night.


Consider shaving sitting in a very shallow hot bath. The hot water in the bath will prepare the area for shaving better than showering. Your body will be very stable (you are sitting down) and your genitals are very accessible. You also have a handy source of water in which to rinse the razor. If this is not possible consider shaving sitting down, ideally on the floor for ease of access and stability.
If you use the edge of a toilet seat to sit on, letting your pubic area sit over a garbage can while shaving, the mess will be next to nothing to clean up. If you're using an electric razor, it can drop in the toilet so it's best to do it somewhere else.
If you prefer standing, try shaving in your shower. Just make sure to stand out of the water to avoid watering down your shave lather, and constantly rinse your blade. By shaving at the start of the shower, you will let any cuts close themselves and thus avoid any stains in your clothes.

, Lather the area with the best shaving cream intended for sensitive skin, such as Taylor Bond Shaving Cream. Avoid menthol or heavily scented creams since they are a known irritant. This is going to minimize the number of cuts you get by adding in moisture throughout it. Complementing it with a shaving brush will help with loosening and softening the hair follicles, more than water can alone.


Some electric razors are supposed to be used on dry skin. Read the manual of the electric razor to see if you should shave wet or dry.

, Using a new safety razor, shave each area using short, very light strokes. The key in shaving the genital area is to always make sure the section of skin you're shaving is taut; shaving loose skin can lead to cuts because the skin will move with the razor and create an uneven surface. Rinse the blade by submersing it in water after each stroke. You may also want to pull out very large hairs that may have been left over from inadequate trimming.


Apply as little pressure as possible. If you just glide over the skin without applying pressure you won't cut yourself.
The following tips are for shaving against the direction of growth (""against the grain"" - which produces the smoothest shave) but note that if you first shave in the direction the hair is growing, you will shorten most of it. Then shaving in the opposite direction will be easier, but some people find it sufficient to just shave in the direction of growth and stop there. This is especially true because shaving against the grain is more likely to result in ingrown hairs and razor bumps.

, Pulling the penis downward, shave from the top of the penis upward to the navel.

, Holding the penis to the side, shave inwards in the sides of it and in the sides of the scrotum.

, Holding the penis upward, shave downwards carefully from the penis to the lower part of the scrotum. It may be easier to shave while the penis is erected since the skin will be more extended and the penis is easier to handle

, The scrotum is much easier to shave if the skin is extended. The scrotum should be shaved from the middle front part of it to the sides, with extreme care. It is best to shave when the scrotum is ascended - meaning tight against the body. The piece of skin that goes between the shaft and the sack may be especially problematic.


One thing you can do is take an ice cube into the shower and rub it on the scrotum to tighten things up. It can help get rid of that flap of skin between the shaft and the scrotum.

, Rinse off and wash the area you shaved using mild soap. Clean the room that you shaved in too: having others find stray shaved pubic hairs can be unpleasant for them and embarrassing for you.

, Be gentle. Rubbing with the towel will increase irritation.

, If you are shaving the first or second time it will most likely irritate the skin, once the hair starts growing back. This can lead to itching and redness. This will be gone within a week roughly and once you start shaving more often it will stop.


You can apply baby powder to shaved areas that rub against each other, like the inner thighs, to minimize friction.
Use some antiseptic cream to minimize skin irritation.

, Take a few tips from the ladies and do things like exfoliating after a day or two. This resets the hair shaft, preventing ingrown hairs and significantly reducing itch as the hair grow back in. You should also thoroughly moisturize the skin with unscented lotions or ointments. A good option for men is Bag Balm, which is very good for your skin but does not have a feminine smell.


Baby oil is another option. Some people find that applying baby oil to the area immediately after shaving helps tremendously with the itch and irritation.
You can also lather up and run a pumice stone over the shaved area to soften up the sharp edges of the hairs created by the razor blade. This will prevent it from becoming itchy when growing back.

Instead of a regular moisturizer, though, you want to use something that offers more intensive hydration. That’s why it helps to apply an oil at least 24 hours before you plan to shave. You want to give the oil enough time to fully absorb into your skin.Make sure to use a rich oil, such as argan or olive oil. It’s best not to use coconut oil because it’s so lightweight that it absorbs too easily into the skin.
The oil that you apply may come off on your clothing, so be sure to wear an old shirt that you don’t mind staining. You may prefer to apply the oil to your underarms before you go to sleep when you’ll only be wearing pajamas.;
, You probably shave whenever it’s most convenient in your schedule, but choosing the right time to do can help you get a smoother shave. Shaving removes several of the skin’s protective layers, so it may be more easily irritated and prone to infection afterward. Doing it at night is the better option because you can give your underarms time to calm down before you start applying deodorant and other personal care products in the morning.Shaving your underarms at night usually allows you to take more time with the process, which means you’re less likely to rush and make a mistake.
If you notice that your underarms have a reaction to your deodorant, body spray, or perfume after shaving, it’s especially important to shave at night when you don’t use those types of products.

, Whenever you shave, it’s a good idea to exfoliate first to remove dead skin cells. That helps bring the hair under your arms closer to the surface so you can get a closer shave. Use a mild exfoliating scrub or some body wash on a washcloth to gently exfoliate your underarms before shaving.When you’re applying the exfoliator to your underarms, use circular motions, making sure to cover the entire area.
If you prefer natural body products, you can create your own body scrub for the under arms by mixing 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, 1 tablespoon honey, and 1 teaspoon lemon water., Before you pick up a razor, it’s important to dampen your underarms. Splashing them with warm water not only helps plump the skin, but it can actually help soften your underarm hair, so it’s easier to cut. The easiest way to wet your underarms is to shave while you’re taking a shower.Shave at the end of your shower. That gives the moisture and heat plenty of time to soften your skin and hair.

, While moisturizing your skin ahead of time can help give you a closer underarm shave, you’ll need extra lubrication to ensure that the razor glides over the skin. Apply a moisturizing shave gel or cream to your underarm area. Because the shave gel helps the razor move easily across the skin, you need to use less force to cut the hair, which means you’ll have less irritation.If your underarm area is prone to irritation, be sure to choose a shave gel or cream that’s formulated specifically for sensitive skin.

, For the smoothest shave under your arms, you want a sharp razor, so be sure to change yours regularly. It also helps to use a razor that has multiple blades and a pivoting head when you want a close shave. Some razors are actually designed specifically for the underarms, so read the packaging carefully.To ensure that your razors are sharp and clean, replace them after every four or five uses.
Look for a razor with a rubber handle that’s easier to grip. That allows you to follow the contours of your underarm area more easily.

, When you’re ready to move the razor over your underarm area, it helps to make the surface as smooth as possible. Try to pull the skin as tautly as you can, so there are no wrinkles or creases for the razor to skip over.It can be difficult to pull your skin taut when you only have one hand free as you’re shaving. To pull the skin tighter, stretch the arm that you’re shaving as far over your shoulder as you can.

, For the closest shave under your arm, it’s important to move your razor in the right direction. Underarm hair doesn’t grow in a single direction so you need to move the razor in multiple directions to get the smoothest shave. Start by working the razor in a downward motion over the underarm. Next, move the razor from one side of the underarm to the other.Be sure to move the razor as firmly as you can. If you use too light a hand, you can wind up slipping and cutting yourself.
Shaving against the grain of hair growth gets you the closest shave. However, if you have sensitive skin, you should avoid going against the grain because it can cause irritations.

, Each time you move the razor across your skin, it picks up shaving cream, hair, dead skin cells, and other debris. Leaving all of that on the blades can make it more difficult for the razor to cut the hair, so you don’t get as close a shave as you’d like. Rinse your razor with hot water after every stroke if possible.Shaving with a dirty razor can also spread bacteria, which may cause an infection or other irritation in your underarm area.

, Shaving your underarms can leave the skin tender and slightly irritated. The best way to help soothe and condition your skin is to apply a moisturizer after shaving. It’s best to use an unscented body lotion or cream to prevent irritation. However, you can also use coconut oil if you prefer natural skin care products.Some deodorants contain moisturizing ingredients, such as avocado oil, sunflower seed oil, or glycerol, so you can eliminate the need for a separate moisturizer for your underarms.
Avoid deodorants that contain harsh ingredients, such as alcohol or dyes. They can irritate your skin even if you use a moisturizer.

, If you’re prone to ingrown hairs in the underarm area, try to prevent them before they happen. There are a variety of products designed specifically to fight ingrown hairs or razor bumps that you can apply after shaving. Typically, they contain exfoliating ingredients, such as salicylic or glycolic acid, that remove dead skin to prevent the hairs from becoming trapped beneath it.If you have sensitive skin, it’s best not to use a leave-on product under your arms. Instead, use a body wash that contains salicylic acid on the area. You rinse it away, so it won’t sit on your skin too long and irritate it.

, If your underarm area is bumpy and irritated after a shave, the clothes that you’re wearing may be a factor. Tight shirts and dresses that are made of synthetic fabrics have a tendency to trap sweat and dirt, encouraging the growth of bacteria that leads to a rash or other irritations. Instead, opt for loose-fitting clothing made of breathable fabrics that allow air to circulate in the area.Breathable fabrics include cotton, linen, and chambray.
Make sure to wash your underarm area every day to prevent the growth of bacteria.

Although this may not be true for everyone, men’s legs tend to be just as hairy (if not hairier) the farther up they go, which makes knowing when to stop difficult.Think about the reason why you’re shaving your legs: is it for aesthetics or a practical purpose? Then take a look at yourself naked in the mirror and decide where would be a suitable place to stop.


Consider how much of your legs and above will be visible to other people. Are you going to be wearing shorts in the near future? Do you change clothes in locker rooms frequently? Is someone special going to be seeing you naked?
If you’re shaving for aesthetic reasons (dancing, bodybuilding, modeling, or plain old preference), you will most likely want a very smooth shave along your entire legs and possibly your genitals and rear as well.If it’s for a practical purpose, like swimming, running, or preparing for medical treatment, you don’t have to worry so much about how you look. However, depending on how long you plan to keep your legs shaved, you still may want to consider their appearance if this is going to be a long-term practice.;
, If this is your first attempt at shaving your legs, use scissors or an electric groomer to shorten your hairs before using a razor, which would clog up pretty quickly if you were to shave your legs immediately. For a quick and easy job, use an electric groomer if you have one. If possible, go outside in your shortest pair of shorts, since this will be messy. Otherwise, spread one or more large towels on the floor and stand on those for an easy clean-up afterward.If you live in the middle of nowhere with no neighbors for miles, feel free to take care of your private areas in the great outdoors, too. If not, retreat inside once your legs are done and then finish up with a towel spread on the floor to catch the falling hairs.
If you’re only shaving your legs for athletics, this step alone may suffice for your purposes.Depending on how thorough you wish to be, this may also be all you need to do as far your private areas go.
Remove the groomer’s skin guard for the closest shave possible.

, Rinse off any trimmed hair that may still be clinging to your legs. Hydrate the remaining leg hair to weaken it for an easier shave.Remove any dirt or grime that may clog your razor or possibly infect any shaving nicks. Exfoliate your legs by rubbing a loofa over your skin in soft circles.Pay special attention to your thighs and any other sensitive area.
If a shower is unavailable, wash, exfoliate, and rinse your skin with a bowl of water. Then wrap your legs with warm, wet towels and let them hydrate your skin for a couple of minutes. , Use a five-blade manual razor to reduce the chance of cutting yourself.Start off with a brand new blade, since you will most likely have a whole lot of hair to get rid of.Keep a few extra replacement heads on hand in case the original blades begin to dull during your shave.


Rinse the blades under hot water before you start. This will lubricate them and provide a smoother shave., Take another shower while you shave. Or draw a bath.Or simply sit on the rim and use the tub to catch your hairs as you shave them off. This way, all you have to do to clean up is simply wash the hairs down the pipes.


Although you could also use the tub to catch your hairs when you first trim them with the scissors or electric groomer as part of your prep, these longer hairs are more likely to clog your drain.

, Use a shaving cream that forms a nice, thick, easy-to-spot lather. Avoid thinner, translucent, or transparent creams, which may make it easier for you to miss spots. Remember that, unlike your face, you will be shaving areas that you will have to bend and twist to see. Make the job easier by using a product that catches the eye.If this is your first time, shaving both legs will probably take a while. To keep your lather from drying out, break each leg up into parts (left calf, right calf, etc.). Only lather the area that you plan to start with. Then, once that area has been shaved, lather and shave the next, and so on.For best results, pick a product that is rich in lubricants and moisturizers. Avoid lower-tier brands that create excessive foam., With so much area to cover, this project is going to take time. Consider how well you handle lengthy projects in general. Come up with an attack plan. Think about the following:


Thicker areas will likely clog and/or dull your razor right from the start. Starting with the thinnest patches of hairs will probably extend a blade’s usefulness.Unlike shaving your face, you will be dealing with areas that are hard to see.Also, if you are shaving your genitals along with your legs, you undoubtedly want to treat these with extra care. If you tend to rush projects as you approach the end, start with these more delicate tasks and leave the easy stuff for later.

, Keep your strokes short to prevent your blades from clogging. Rinse the razor frequently under hot water to remove hairs and shaving cream.Keep your pressure on the blade as light as possible.Replace the blades if you are unable to remove hairs without applying a great deal of pressure, since this probably means they are either too dull or too clogged to be any good.To avoid nicks, razor bumps, and irritation, shave with the grain, in the direction that your hair grows.But if what you want is the closest shave possible, shave against the grain.Use a handheld mirror to see what you’re doing when you reach the back of your thighs and higher., Drain the tub if you took a bath. Turn the shower back on if it isn’t already running, or stand up and dump water over your legs. Remove shaved hairs clinging to your legs, as well as leftover shaving cream.Run your hands over your legs to test their smoothness. If needed, repeat the shaving process over areas that need more work, and then rinse off again.


Always rinse off before shaving again. Minimize clogging your razor with hairs that have already been shaved, or being fooled into thinking that they are hairs you missed the first time.

, Prevent any nicks or other infections from becoming infected. If possible, use body wash with tea tree oil and/or witch hazel as ingredients, which will help soothe and heal your skin.Exfoliate again with a loofa, rubbing your legs gently in soft circles., Use a clean towel to prevent bacteria from infecting cuts and other irritations.Pat your legs dry with the towel. Avoid rubbing them, which can further irritate sensitive areas., Rub an antiseptic post-shave conditioner into your skin. Destroy any possible bacteria that may still linger in sensitive areas.Moisture your skin to help it recuperate.Use a moisturizer designed specifically for men. Since men’s skin typically produces more natural oils than women’s, using women’s products may lead to clogged pores.
Continue to moisturize your skin daily to avoid irritation as your hairs grow back., Now that your legs are shaved, check how they look in natural light. If your leg hair was quite dark and your skin is pale or fair, consider using a self-tanner in the short term, since the contrast may now be striking. If you’re going to keep your legs shaved for the long term, consider sunning them regularly."

Try exfoliating.,
If that doesn't work, use salicylic or glycolic acid.,
If that doesn't work, use a needle and tweezers, or a rotatable medical device to release the embedded hair.,
Don't shave the irritated area.,
Avoid products with alcohol.,
Use products with lidocaine and bacitracin.,
Don't scratch!",How to Treat Razor Bumps1," What you're really dealing with is a cluster of ingrown hairs. They may look like acne, but they're not. To lessen the problem, first try exfoliating. That will rub off the top layer off skin, possibly freeing the hairs from their derma-prison.


Make sure what you're dealing with is razor bumps. If they're pink or red (or dark if you can see the hair) and itchy, then razor bumps it is. They also may resemble whiteheads if pus has formed on top. B-E-A-utiful!;
, So, since we're dealing with ingrown hairs here, what you've gotta do is remove that layer of skin on top. Salicylic and glycolic acid do just that.


These two products quicken the turnover of dead skin cells -- that is to say, the layers you shed will be shed more quickly when this stuff is applied to your skin. Though it may not expose the ingrown hair, it will speed up the process.

, Make sure the needle is clean first! Sterilize it with rubbing alcohol if it's not brand new. Insert it into the top of the bump (blood or pus may come out) and switch to your tweezers. Carefully coax out the hair like you would a splinter -- plucking it straight off may lead the next hair to be ingrown, too.This needs to be done very carefully. It can potentially damage the skin and in the absolute worst cause scenario, result in scarring. Almost as bad as the bumps themselves!

, Hopefully, this seems logical to you. Shaving is how you got the bumps in the first place, so shaving more will just exacerbate the problem. If you can, avoid doing so. And if there's a no-facial-hair requirement you have to meet for work or school, consider getting a doctor's note to get around the rule.

, That stuff just irritates and burns your skin, dries it up and leaves it worse for the wear. And if you have razor bumps, that's a recipe for disaster and pain. If your normal lotion has it, you'd be wise to toss 'er out.


The only, only time you should use alcohol on your skin is the cleanse the area before using a needle. And then you should use rubbing alcohol -- no other kind.

, Many aftershave products have lidocaine in them. That's the ingredient that prevents itching and irritation. Bacitracin is the stuff found in products like Neosporin and is used to kill bacteria. You probably don't need an explanation as to why these two things are beneficial!


These products can be used on bumps and on unaffected skin. They're good treatments and preventative measures.

, The razor bumps may become infected if you do. You're just spreading around bacteria and mixing it in with the stuff on your hands (clean as they may feel). In general, staying away from your face entirely is your best bet.

Scrub your face twice a day with a facial cleanser or a bump brush.,
Apply an anti-razor bump cream.,
Shave with the grain.,
Use the right aftershave.,
Consider laser treatment or electrolysis.",How to Treat Razor Bumps2," Keeping your face clean is a large part of the razor bump battle. You want to keep bacteria at bay and also keep the top-most layer of your skin fresh.


If you're shaving (...which you shouldn't be doing on the bumps), use warm water to soften the hairs and loosen the follicles. Cold hair just tightens up your skin and won't do you any favors.

, Do this twice a day, in the morning and at night. There are a solid half a dozen products on the market to choose from, and all should be of similar quality. A quick visit to your local drugstore (Wal-Greens, CVS, Boots, or Waitrose) should be all you need to take.If you'd rather look for something that may already be in your bathroom cabinet, a hydrocortisone cream or other antibacterial cream can help lessen inflammation and redness, too. Retin-A cream works as well., Against the grain may feel like it results in a closer shave, but shaving with the grain will keep the hairs aligned. When the hairs are aligned, they're less likely to curl up and become ingrown.

, Avoid putting chemicals like alcohol, or treatments that contain alcohol, on the shaved area. Your skin is super sensitive at this juncture, so it's best to use non-perfumed, no-alcohol substances. Read the label if you have any doubt.


Go for one that's super moisturizing. Choose an alcohol, fragrance and oil-free moisturizing lotion to make sure the skin doesn't get irritated. According to the department of Dermatology of the Langone Medical Center, products that contain salicylic or glycolic acid are the most effective in treating razor bumps. These ingredients clear the pores, moisturize and prevent infections.

, If desperate times call for desperate measures, you do have more permanent ways out. Consult a registered, experienced dermatologist for more advice on the matter.


Depending on your hair type and how much hair you'd like removed, laser hair removal may not be as expensive as you think it is. A session for just the neck could be as little as $150. It may be worth looking into!

Exfoliate all the time.,
Use creams and lotions to fight the redness and itch.,
Change to waxing (or don't shave!).,
Wear loose underwear.,
Whip up a home remedy.",How to Treat Razor Bumps3," Exfoliating prior to shaving and after should become integral to your shaving routine. The first step aligns the hairs and gets rid of dead skin cells to get a smoother more even cut and the second time around wipes away all the up-churned bacteria and skin that can clog otherwise clean pores.


So if you have razor bumps already, exfoliating will force away the very top layer of dead skin cells, in time exposing the hair that is curled up underneath. The more you exfoliate, the quicker this process will go.

, Every time you shave, you should finish off with a moisturizer. Aloe vera, baby oil, or any non-scented, non-perfumed lotion will do. But to treat razor bumps, consider also using a razor bump cream or other, anti-inflammatory cream.


Hydrocortisone creams, retin-A creams, and products like Neosporin will reduce redness and itch. Products with salicylic acid or glycolic acid (for in razor bump creams) will eliminate the top layer of skin, to get rid of the ingrown hair.

, Some people have very sensitive skin, especially around their pubic area. To avoid the razor but still be hairless, switch to waxing. However, know that waxing can lead to histamine reactions and ingrown hairs, too -- so take the pain with a grain of salt.


The other option is not to shave. Yeah, yeah, yeah, not an option. But really, would you rather have some hair growing in or little red bumps? Because right now it's one or the other. Try skipping a few days between shaves if you shave often. You'll live.

, You want to avoid as many possible irritants as possible when you've got a case of the bumps, and tight clothing is at the top of that list. Wearing tight undies doesn't let your skin breathe and as a result, the skin clogs, bacteria gets trapped, and the problems get worse. No thank you!


Go for loose clothing if you can, too. The bumps around your thighs won't benefit from tight jeans or leggings. If anyone asks why you're wearing sweats, well, for starters it's none of their business. But you can tell them you're running a wikiHow experiment. Results inconclusive, but you'll keep them posted when you know.

, If you're out of creams in your mom's medicine cabinet and out of gas in your car, search the kitchen for other possible alternatives. Razor bumps have been around for ages and there are treatments to prove it.


Make a ""mask"" out of pureed cucumber and milk (1:2 ratio). Apply it to the area for 10-20 minutes and then rinse it off. The redness should be greatly reduced.Douse the bumps in cornstarch and let it sit for 20 minutes. Then, rinse off thoroughly. It should dry up the redness and shrink the bumps."

Quickly shaving your face can lead to razor burn and skipping important prep steps can make all the difference in your shave., A wet shave requires a high-quality razor, not disposable blades or cartridge blades. There are two main kinds of razors recommended for wet shaves:









Safety double-edge razor. This is easier to use than a straight razor and you can switch out the blades depending on which one is best for your skin.Straight-edge razor. This is a more expensive and more dangerous option. Professional barbers use them in barbershops. You should probably wait until you are more experienced before using a straight razor, even though it delivers the closest shave.Also keep in mind that this razor requires care and upkeep, such as sharpening and stropping., There are many reasons to use a brush. It lifts hair follicles up while exfoliating your face by removing dead skin cells.Plus, it not only creates a thicker lather, it creates a lather more efficiently than your fingers would, so your product will last longer.There are different kinds of brushes you can use, but you may want to use the best one.


Badger brush. This brush is made from the hair of a badger and is generally considered the best for a close-shave. They range in price, but you can probably buy a mid-range one that will be just as good as an expensive one. Even among badger brushes there are different gradients of badger hair that vary in price and quality.
Boar brush. A boar brush is a cheaper option than a badger brush. Unlike badger brushes, boar brushes do not absorb water so you will need to soak it in warm water ahead of time.Horse brush. This brush is made from the hair of a horse’s mane and is also generally cheaper, and may be good for beginners.Synthetic brush. These brushes are generally cheaper, and are a good option for someone who is vegan, uncomfortable using animal hair, or allergic to animal hair., Foams or gels are not good for wet shaves. A good cream will prevent shaving rash and razor burn. You will want a glycerin-based gel since an alcohol-based gel will dry your face out.,, Wash your face, after a shower, or make sure it is wet. Consider putting a hot wet towel around your beard and neck area. This trick will help soften the hair follicles and make it easier for the razor to take off the hair and will be easier on your skin. The towel step is optional as long as your face and beard are warm and wet.

, Use a few drops of oil (like sunflower, olive, or coconut oil) on your beard and/or facial hair. It will moisturize and help soften the hair before shaving. It also works as an antiseptic and as lubrication for the blade., Pick your brush out of the warm water and hold it over the sink until it is finished dripping. Now gently swirl it in your shaving gel until it is covered with a light lather.








Only use a small amount of shaving gel. The brush should lather it up plenty, and it will make your cream last longer if you just use a little.
Use a circular motion and go lightly, making sure to cover every single place that you want to shave. Continue until there is a light, opaque lather around your entire face., The grain of the hair is the direction it grows. This generally means shaving up to down, or North to South.









Place the razor on your face at a 90-degree angle. Then, as you start to shave, move it down at 30-45 degree angle.Do not apply pressure. If you are accustomed to using cheaper, disposable razors, you probably pressed down when you shaved. However, now you are using a high-quality blade that does this work for you. Pressing down will cause knicks and cuts.Once you are better at wet shaving, you can re-shave against the grain for a closer shave.

, This will keep the blade clean and the stroke sharper., That's right—all of it. Shaving oil, shaving gel, etc. You will need to prep your face again for contact with the blade if you want to avoid irritation and razor burn.A second pass is when you can consider shaving south-to-north, or down-to-up, just be prudent.







, The warm water from earlier was meant to open your pores and relax your face. Now you want them closed so they can regenerate.







, After-shave isn't a vanity product, it also helps heal and moisturize your skin after the shave and adds a layer of protection since you just lost hair and skin cells.Avoid alcohol-based products as these will actually dry your skin out, cause a “burning” sensation, and cause your face to secrete oils, which can lead to ingrown hairs.







, Be gentle and do not rub it dry—rubbing will increase irritation.







, Rinse all the lather of your brush. Store it handle down with the brushes in the air so it will air dry.This is a crucial step to ensure your brush will last for a long time—it's a big investment, and if you take care of it, it will take care of you!

Bring the razor back down the strop.",How to Strop a Straight Razor," These are relatively simple to get. You can get cheaper models from general stores online. These might cost you anything from $5 to $25. If you’ve been using a straight razor for a while, you’ll want to invest in a strop that will last longer. You can get these from stores that sell straight razors. These will usually by at least $50.

There are three types of strops. The most common type is the straight strop, which is a strap that you hang up. The paddle strop is essentially a wooden paddle with a piece of leather attached to it. Loom strops are similar to paddle strops, except the leather runs around a wooden frame like a drumskin rather than being attached.;
, You should hold the strop so it points downwards and towards you at about a 45 degree angle. This makes stropping the straight razor simpler and makes you less likely to cut into the leather (especially if you’re a beginner.)The specific location of the anchor point doesn’t really matter; you just need to make sure it won’t move while you strop. Examples of a good anchor point include door handles and towel bars.If you’re using a paddle or loom strop, you’ll instead want to lay one end of it on a stable surface. Hold the handle and lift so the strop is at about a 30 degree angle., The blade’s spine should be pointing away from you and the edge toward you. You should keep the blade lifted slightly, so the edge is making contact with the strop at a slight angle. Use light pressure as you push the razor away from you., Once you’ve reached the end of the strop, flip the razor so the spine is now pointing towards you. Try to make sure the blade is always touching the strop as you roll the razor between your fingers to flip it. It takes some practice, but eventually this will make stropping the razor quicker and more efficient., Pull the razor, spine first, toward the bottom of the strop. Don’t use any more pressure than you did on your way up the strop. Maintain a slight angle with the razor, so the edge makes contact with the leather the whole way down.

Once you reach the bottom of the strop, flip the razor and and bring it back up the strop. Repeat this stroke for 10-15 more passes.
Some people suggest passing the razor over the strop’s preparation side first. This side is usually cloth or canvas. If you decide to do so, you’ll use the same kind of stroke, about 10-15 times., These models typically aren’t wide enough to cover the razor’s blade. This means that, as you slide your razor up and down the strop, you’ll also need to slide it sideways to cover the entire blade. The simplest method involves moving the blade towards your right as you push it away from you, and towards the left when you bring the razor back., While stropping will help remove excess moisture, you don’t want to soak your strop in water and shaving cream. Pass the razor under warm tap water until all shaving cream has been rinsed away. Shake excess water off of the razor., You want to avoid using the strop’s leather side after a shave. This can cause metal chips to break off of the blade and embed themselves in the strop. This will make the strop rougher and can damage your blade., The edge should be facing towards you, the spine away from you. Hold the razor at an angle, no more than 15 degrees, so the edge rests against the strop., Glide the razor lightly; too much pressure and you’ll cut into the strop. Cuts and nicks in the strop will prevent your razor from gliding well., Roll the razor in your fingers, flipping the blade upwards and away from you. The edge should end up facing away from you, while the spine will now be pointed toward you. Hold the razor at a slight angle., Using a similar motion as before, slide the razor back towards you, keeping the edge angled against the strop. This will get any moisture or small hairs off of the edge and onto the cloth.

Repeat this back and forth motion about 10 more times."

You can buy razor cartridges to replace worn out razor heads.

While these razors can be more expensive, they often have built in moisturizers or lubricants, such as vitamin E, that’re great if you have sensitive skin., Disposable razors are a great idea if your skin isn’t sensitive or if want to just pitch the entire razor when it’s worn out.Disposable razors also tend to be a cheaper option.

, It’s important to choose a razor with more than one blade, since single blade razors are more likely to drag against the skin. Three blades is typical for a razor.Razors come with as many as six blades! You should experiment and see what number of blades feel best on your skin.

, You need a lathering agent to help the razor glide easily over your skin. Using a shaving cream or gel will help prevent razor burn, or red bumps that are caused by shaving. Shaving cream also reduces the number of nicks you give yourself shaving.


Don’t want to purchase shaving cream? Hair conditioner is a great alternative that’s also much cheaper.If you have sensitive skin, avoid shaving creams that contain alcohol. The alcohol will dry out your skin., The warm water of your shower softens your leg hair and opens your follicles, which makes shaving easier.

Make sure you’re holding the razor with the handle pointed down towards your toes., Shaving with the grain, or down the leg, is best for your first shave. Because your leg hair will be longer, going with the grain of your hair will reduce the possibility of irritation.

Shaving against the grain, or shaving up the leg, is okay once your leg hair is shorter.
If you have sensitive skin, always shave with the grain, or down the leg., Shaving around the knee and ankle are the trickiest parts of shaving your legs for the first time. Go slowly and apply less pressure as you shave over these areas, so you don’t cut yourself., Be sure to rinse your razor every 2 to 3 strokes. If you continue shaving with shaving cream or hair that’s clogging the blades, you’ll be more likely to cut yourself., After you’ve finished shaving, rinse your legs off with cool water, which will close up your pores., After shaving you should always apply a moisturizing lotion or after-shave oil that will help keep your legs smooth. It also softens the hair, leaving you less exposed to infections that are caused by hair getting trapped below the skin., If you did happen to nick yourself shaving, it’s easily fixed. Razor cuts are difficult to stop bleeding, but if you dry the area and dab on some Vaseline, the bleeding will stop., If you’ve wound up with the tell-tale red bumps of razor burn, take care to treat it, so the bumps don’t turn into scars. Put a warm compress on the area, which will relax the hair that’s trapped below the skin of the bump., You should replace your razor at the first sign of dullness, which usually occurs between 5 to 10 shaves.

Go over the area with tweezers.",How to Shave Your Pubic Hair," Razors are designed to shave fairly short hair and will quickly clog and become dull if applied to long hair. To trim it, gently pull the hair up, away from the body you and then cut it back with small, sharp scissors, clippers, preferably, some equipped with safety guards. Alternatively, use an electric scissor-action trimmer without rotating heads. Aim for hair that is shorter than 1/4"" (0.6 cm).


If you are new to pubic styling, you may want to leave your hair short for a couple of days, as this will allow you to get used to the feeling of being bare down there.
Your nickname is ""butterfingers,"" huh? Then you may want to avoid taking scissors to such a precious area. You're going to need to get super close, so if the idea of a snip snip here and a snip snip there makes you a little nervous, opt for the electric trimmers. With these, the blade can only get so close to your skin.;
, This will make the coarse pubic hair a lot easier to shave off. It may seem like a superfluous step, but it'll make the somewhat lengthy process much more manageable.


Ain't nobody got time for that, you say? Then simply cover the area with a warm, thoroughly wet washcloth for five minutes or so to get the same effect.Those connoisseurs of the art of pubic hair shaving will tell you it's important to exfoliate both before and after shaving, though most advice will only be to do it after shaving. Doing the exfoliation before will help all of the hairs get properly aligned outwards while stripping away the dead skin, allowing for a closer shave and reducing the chances of the razor catching and scratching you. So if you've the time, exfoliate prior to lathering up.

, Use unscented shaving foam, cream, or gel to lather your pubic hair. It is recommended that you use shaving foam or cream that is designed for shaving pubic hair rather than facial hair. Apples and oranges, folks. And just like your mother should've told you, never shave your pubic hair without lubrication.



Always test the shaving cream on another part of your body before you start applying it to your pubic hair, as some people suffer from allergic reactions to certain products.
Just because a product is marketed to females doesn't mean it's only usable by those of the fair sex. Shaving cream for women is generally gentler than men's. Moreover, men's shaving cream is often scented, which can lead to irritation and stinging.No thanks. If you're a dude, make a late night undercover trip to the store or steal the girlfriend's/roommate's/sister's. She won't notice.

, It's new, right? The newer it is, the better it'll work. Hopefully, it has lots of blades and something fancy and gel-like on the sides to lessen your lubrication needs. Who cares if it's pink or blue? If it's sharp with three or more blades, it'll be not only easier for you, but safer on your skin.


Not interested in buying razors all the time? Then make sure to take care of the ones you reuse. Have one just for your pubic hair and make sure to clean it after you're done. Don't leave it wet, though— water can accelerate corrosion of the blades, dulling them.

, If it's loose, you'll end up cutting yourself. Razors can only do their job well on nearly flat surfaces. With your free hand, stretch your skin tight and hold it firmly, giving you a clear target.


Make it easy on yourself and start below your navel, pulling the skin just above your foamed up hairline upwards. Where you go from there is up to you. Chop it all off? Make a figure 8? You are your canvas and art imitates life, after all, though after a few hours of barricading yourself in the bathroom doing hair calligraphy, you'll probably start getting asked questions.

, There are two things to keep in mind here: shaving with the grain will prevent irritation and ingrown hairs and shaving against the grain will result in a closer (by a landslide) shave.Knowing these two things, take into account your situation. If you have mega-super-ultra sensitive skin, you may want to stick to shaving with the grain, even if it takes you twice as long to get the results you want.


As you transition to getting a closer shave, try working across the grain of the hair; if the hair is growing downwards, for example, shave to the left or right. Get used to feeling the hair growth rather than trying to see it.— Not relying on your eyes makes the whole process much faster.

Do not over-shave. Shave an area only as much as you need to remove the hair. If you go over it too many times, it will likely become inflamed.
In the early stages of shaving, you will probably find that shaving your pubic hair two days in a row causes red bumps and/or itching. Skip several days between shaves until your skin grows used to the change.

, If you've ever been to get your nether regions waxed, you know the feeling when you think the lady is done pouring hot wax onto your parts and then she giddily tells you to ""flip over."" Ahh, that's right. She's gonna get into that crevice you so conveniently forgot about. Well, that applies to this situation, too, if you're gonna bare it all.


Do a once or twice-over with your free hand. That mirror in front of you may look like you've gotten everything, but have you really? If you want to be completely hair-free, that means top, bottom, inside, outside, back, front, and everywhere in between.

If you are baring it all, know that having zero pubic hair can increase your chances of getting and spreading an STD or two (namely, HPV and molluscum contagiosum). Though the latter doesn't sound like a traditional STD, it, technically, is., If you leave a clogged drain full of your pubic hair in the communal bathroom, you'll be excommunicated or put on garbage duty for weeks, and become the butt of all your roommate's jokes from now until Hanukkah. Avoid the embarrassment, be polite, and clean up after yourself.


It's easiest to trim over the toilet and easiest to shave in the shower, at least in terms of clean up. After you're done, take a gander at the drains, the floor, the towels, and your razor. Zero evidence should be found at the scene.

, This removes all the dead skin chillin' on the surface after shaving in addition to lining up your hairs and helping to prevent them from becoming ingrown. With your normal body soap, gently cleanse your pubic area. This will help to remove anything that might block your pores and lead to ingrown hairs and resulting infections. What's the point in shaving if all you have to replace it are little red bumps?


Here's a tip from the pros: Use a sugar scrub as your exfoliate to leave your skin smooth as a baby's bottom. If you don't have that on hand, whip up a baking soda paste. It, too, will put the finishing touches on the job.

If you are a woman, do not get soap beyond your labia. Your vagina is naturally regulated by your body and doesn’t need to be cleansed with anything other than water. In fact, soaps often upset the pH balance (which is, by nature, low to ward off unfriendly bacteria), making the vagina more susceptible to infection., Egg oil contains several bio-actives which prevent infections or inflammations and help the irritated skin recover faster to it's original shape.


Massage egg oil well into the shaved area twice a day for a week.
Leave it on until your next shower. There is no necessity to wash it off as it is easily absorbed into the skin.

, Aloe Vera, baby oil, or moisturizers designed for sensitive areas can be used. Egg oil containing immunoglobulins can avoid rashes due to micro-abrasions. Avoid moisturizers that may contain fragrances and coloring agents.


Whatever it is, just make sure it's unscented and isn't full of possibly irritating perfumes. And definitely avoid men's aftershave— that's just burn in a can. Think Home Alone...on your genitals.Bag Balm is the duct tape of moisturizers. It's available at Walmart, CVS, Walgreen's, and everywhere in between. Think Carmex, but for your entire body.
Baby oil can deteriorate latex condoms. If you're planning on having sex afterwards, use something else., Powders absorb the sweat and oil around the pubic area, which can reduce irritation and bumpiness. However, extra care must be taken not to get any of this powder onto the very sensitive areas of the vagina or penis. Moreover, you should avoid smothering the skin, which can clog pores and may encourage pimples.



Women should never put talc on their genital areas, as this is associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer.In fact, talc is no longer used to dry-lubricate surgical gloves because it is believed to become toxic when applied to mucosal tissues.

, Even the most seasoned shaver and expensive razor will miss a hair here or there. Grab the tweezers and go to town, picking up wherever your razor left off. The pain lasts a matter of seconds. You can handle it.

Using water-soluble skin cream may be kinder to your skin than traditional shaving cream; it also frees you from having to buy gender-based shaving supplies.








, Begin at the bottom of your leg, and with long strokes upwards, shave the hair against the grain. Don't rush; this is not a race to the finish line. It's more important to make smooth, even strokes than a speedy chop.

Hold the razor flat against your leg.",How to Shave Your Legs2," You want your hairs moisturized and stood upright, ready to be mowed down.








, Dirty shavers will not cut as well, and could pull hairs, leaving red marks along with several ""ouchies"" and expletives. Always use a clean shaver.

, Make sure all the heads touch your leg together. This will give you the closest shave with minimal wear.









You don't need to apply much pressure while shaving—with just a gentle touch, let the shaver glide along your skin. If you use too much pressure, you'll flatten the hair, which results in an uneven, stubbly shave. It will also make the blades dull quicker.
A gentle touch makes shaving easier and helps avoid possible skin irritation.

, Holding it at an angle could result in skin irritation and stubble.

, A couple of days before you wax your legs, use a mildly abrasive body scrub to exfoliate them. Do this ahead of time to avoid possible skin irritation problems.

, Just before you wax, sprinkle talc or baby powder on your legs. The powder will absorb any oil on your skin, and the wax sticks more easily to the hair.








, Heat the wax as directed by the manufacturer. Be sure not to overheat the wax—the resulting wax burns can be very painful.








, Have a seat on a surface that can be easily cleaned—waxing can be messy. Apply the wax carefully in a thin, uniform layer. Hold the applicator at a 90° angle, and apply the wax in the direction of hair growth. Don't forget the feet!








, Make the skin taut with one hand, and remove the strip with the other. Pull the strip in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Pull quickly—the slower you pull, the longer the pain.









Keep your hand as close to the skin as possible when you're pulling. It'll be less painful that way. Remove all the wax.
Apply a damp cloth over your legs if needed, to soothe any irritation.

, Soak a cotton pad with a bit of body oil, and apply it on your legs.

, Apply a warm washcloth to your legs to soften the hair. Moisten the hair for about three to five minutes. Dry your legs when done.








, Don't rub into the skin: the depilatory is designed to work without that.








, Leave the depilatory cream on for as long as the instructions tell you. Don't leave depilatory cream for longer than the time specified—it could irritate, or even burn your skin.


Keep a timer handy so that you don't go over the limit. If your legs feel like they're burning before it's time to remove the cream, rinse it off.

, After you've finished, remove the product generally by scraping the residue with the plastic tool (if one is provided) and rinsing off whatever is left.









Use a damp washcloth in a downwards motion. This will clear away any straggling hair, and finish cleaning up your legs.

Allow at least a few days in between shaves.",How to Shave Your Bikini Area Completely," Choose the option that makes you feel the best. You have a few options:



Shave it all off. There are no health risks to shaving all of your hair off as long as you do it hygienically, use a new razor, use an anti-septic after shaving and don't cut yourself.

Use a stencil. You will place a stencil, like a small heart, over your pubic area. Then, you'll shave around the stencil to leave a section of hair with a fun shape over your pubic area. You can find stencil kits at most adult stores or online.

Create a landing strip. Your landing strip, or a line extending up from your labial part toward your belly button, can be either whisper thin (good for thick, unruly hair) or slightly wider (for thin, sparse hair).;
, Your razor may be gel-filled and have more blades than a small child can count, but you still need to be nice to it. Any longer and it won't work as efficiently.


To trim the most efficiently, pull the hair toward you and cut in small sections. It doesn't all have to be even, it just has to be short.
If the idea of taking scissors down there...gives you the heebie jeebies, use electric trimmers that don't have rotating heads. The blades can only get so close to your skin.

, You can also soak in the tub for a little while before standing up in the shower to shave the area. Getting the follicles soft will make the hair easier to shave on the first go-round. If you want to wash the area, clean it before you start shaving to avoid irritating your exposed skin later.


If you're away from a shower (and have a desperate, desperate need to shave your bikini area -- maybe you're stranded on a desert island?), take a wet washcloth and leave it on the area for 5 to 10 minutes. The same effect can be garnered from this, too.

, You're probably going to come across people or places that tell you to lather, shave, and exfoliate -- in that order. But if you wanna be a pubic shaving pro (and who doesn't?!), exfoliate before and after. It'll align your hairs all in the same direction, making your razor's job ten times easier. It also removes that extra dead skin, freeing your razor to get even closer to the hair's root.


Just use your normal shower exfoliate for this part. Grab your loofah and go to town like you usually do!

, This part is imperative. Never shave without some sort of lubricant. If you don't use shaving cream, you will find yourself in the midst of a red, bumpy, unattractive mess. Nobody wants that.

It's best to use unscented shaving cream designed for the bikini area. If you have particularly sensitive skin, test an area before you apply it all over. Once in a while, people have allergic reactions.

Shop for a transparent, non-foamy shower gel so that you can see what you're doing while you shave.



, The more blades, the better -- the fewer it has (and the older it is), the more times you'll have to go over the area (and that doesn't include time spent reapplying shaving cream). Get one with those fancy lubrication pads on it, too, for good measure.


You can reuse your razor if you take good care of it but preferably use a new disposable razor each time. Make sure you wash it after you're done, but don't leave it wet -- water will erode the metal of the blades, tarnishing and weakening them.

, This cuts each hair straight across so no sharp pointy bits dig in. Put your hand onto your stomach just above the mons pubis to make sure the skin over your mons pubis is smooth and taut.

When shaving, let the blade do the work. Avoid pressing down into your skin. Keep the number of passes of the razor low; each pass removes surface skin, too.
If you have thick, curly hair and you're having a tough time shaving it, try using an electric razor to trim it down even more before you use the handheld razor for the finishing touches.
Rinse your razor between strokes if it becomes clogged with hair.

, Try starting with the side opposite your dominant hand (e.g., if you're right-handed, start with your left side). Generally, that side is much easier and quicker to do. Bending over will help you to see the area clearly. Prop your raised leg on the shower wall or sink if you need to.

The process for this section is the same as the one outlined above when it comes to exfoliating and whatnot. However, razor burn and ingrown hairs are less likely to show up down here, so the hardest part is over.

, Take care not to get any gel or other shower products in between the labia. If you find it running off under the shower water, you'll need to reapply.

, That is, if you're shaving your left side, shave from left to right. Use a light touch. Stop each stroke before the end of the labium in the center. Rinse any excess shaving gel when you are done shaving the first side.


You may want to spread your legs further apart to keep the skin you're shaving taut, so that you won't run into any folded or wrinkled skin while you're shaving.
Shave the other side of your labia and your other inner thigh crease following the same technique.

, You're probably thinking, ""This again?"" Yes. This again! Exfoliating after gets rid of the dead skin your razor whipped up and aligns your follicles preventing ingrown hairs (which are the worst).


A sugar scrub at this point can work wonders. If that's not in your bathroom, make a baking soda paste to leave your skin smooth to the touch. This is obviously bikini shaving to the extreme -- warranting the absolute most top-notch results.

, Don't rub your bikini area vigorously, or you may irritate the delicate skin. It's just been through a lot!

If you notice any stray hairs, grab a pair of tweezers to put the finishing touches on the area. Sometimes you can spend what seems like hours down there shaving and you've still missed a few.

, Use something that is non-scented as perfumes can be irritating, especially to freshly shaven skin. Aloe vera and baby oil are good standard options.


Avoid coloring agents, too. If you use lotion, make sure it's the plainest kind you can buy. You can spray on some scents later if you'd like.

, You may also apply baby lotion to the area to reduce irritation. Just don't go overboard! Smothering the area won't let your skin breathe, leading to pimples and the like. Make sure to only apply these products externally.

, For a constantly hair-free look, you may have to look at other hair removal techniques, such as waxing or laser hair removal. Shaving works, but it requires constant upkeep.

Shaving after a shower is a good option. Alternately, wipe a towel dampened with hot water over your neck before you shave. This will help open up your pores.For an even smoother shave, apply shaving lather to your neck before shaving.

, A straight razor will allow you to get a closer, smoother shave than a disposable razor. Set the blade at a 30-degree angle to your skin. Change hands as you move from one side of your face to the other., Don’t rush the process. Razors are sharp, and shaving too fast could cause you to injure yourself. Use long, slow strokes to shave your neck when growing a beard., If you accidentally cut your neck while shaving, splash cold water on the cut.

Be very careful.,
Plan ahead.,
Use a mirror.,
Try using a razor extender.,
Go slowly.,
Clean up afterwards.",How to Shave Your Back1," This task is doable but difficult. If you're shaving your own back without any help, you may have a hard time reaching the entire area. This might lead you to shave at strange angles, which can heighten the risk of slicing the skin. You may not have full visibility of the region that you're shaving, and you may not be able to tell easily when you've missed a spot. Consider finding someone else to do it: probably a partner or a paid professional.


Use the safest razor possible. Choose a razor with a lot of blades, and ideally a razor with built-in safety features. A quality electric razor may be better for your back than a cheap manual razor.
Keep a towel on hand in case you cut yourself. If you slice your back while shaving, it probably won't bleed too profusely – but it will be painful. Use the towel to blot the blood in the case of a mishap.;
, Give yourself plenty of time to get the job done right. Choose a space that is private, well-lit, and easy to clean up. A bathroom is ideal: a bright space with a mirror, running water, and a tile floor. Make sure that you have plenty of water and shaving cream to make the shaving process easier on your back.


Use a shaving cream or shower gel that contains exfoliating ingredients. This may help keep you free of ingrown hairs and razor burn.
If you rush yourself, you might be more likely to make a mistake. Not only can slipping up be painful and embarrassing – but it can open you up to the risk of infection.

, If you are going to shave your own back, you need to make sure that you can see the entire area that you're working on. Use a large, clean mirror, and try to angle it so that you have a clear view of the back. If possible, use two mirrors. Consider using a hand-held mirror to focus on specific sections at at time.


Not only will a mirror make the process of shaving much safer, but it will help you know when you've finished. You may need to hold the mirror very still and very close to your back to tell whether you've ""missed a spot.""

, There are products that are specifically designed to help you shave your back. These extra-long handles will hold your razor and dramatically increase your reach. Research products before you buy. Decide whether this is something that you will realistically use again and again.

, Take your time, and use plenty of shaving cream. Shave with long, unbroken strokes across your back, and don't be afraid to take multiple passes at the same spot. Go against the ""grain"" or growth of your hair. Overlap your strokes to make sure that you get everything. Be patient.As you go, continue to apply liberal amounts of shaving cream and water. Depending on your hair coverage, you might need a lot.
Take special care when shaving around your spine and shoulder blades. Ridged areas provide an uneven surface, which might make your razor more likely to jump.

, When you're done shaving, take a shower to wash the wet hairs and shaving cream off of your back. Dry your back gently with a clean towel, being ginger and gentle with any spots that you've nicked. Consider rubbing lotion into your skin – your back may feel raw and slightly painful from the shave, and your back skin may not be used to the stress.

Consider having your back professionally waxed.,
Look into laser hair removal.,
Try using a depilatory cream.",How to Shave Your Back2," Find a salon that offers body waxing, and go in for an appointment. It is generally safer than shaving, it lasts longer, and it shouldn't cost much more than $30. You won't need to shave your back every few days to keep the stubble down, and over time your back hair should even start to grow in thinner!Waxing removes hair from the root. If done well, a back wax may last as long as six weeks – much longer than any shave.Avoid trying to wax your back at home. If you do this, make sure that you have help, and that both of you know what you're doing. Waxing done poorly can be even more dangerous than a botched shave.

, This solution permanently removes the hair from your back, making it much more long-term effective than either shaving or waxing. It is usually a very safe and professional procedure, although it may be somewhat more expensive than your alternatives. Consider whether a permanently hair-free back is worth the cost.The price of laser hair removal will depend on the particular salon and the hairiness of your back. As a general rule, however, you can expect the procedure to cost about $400-500 per session, over as many as eight sessions. This means that you might wind up shelling out $3,200-4,000 for the entire treatment plan., These products dissolve your hair at the surface of the skin, and the hairless effect usually lasts about twice as long as shaving.Be aware that these creams can be difficult to apply yourself, so you may need to ask a friend or a partner to help out. This can be a quick, easy, and relatively cheap solution – but it is not nearly so long-lasting as waxing or laser hair removal.

Make sure that you trust the person, and that you are very close. Consider asking your significant other, if you're in a fairly serious relationship. If you're single, you might try asking a close friend. You may even find it easier to pay a professional for the job.

, If you have electric clippers, this step is as simple as having your friend plug in the clippers and trim down the hair on your back. If you don't have clippers handy, have your friend use a comb and scissors to trim down your hair. Removing the thick hair first should make shaving your back quicker and easier. Rinse off afterwards. Hop into the shower and rinse the trimmed hair off of your back. Once you've rinsed off any loose hairs, you are ready to start shaving.

, Before you shave, ask your friend to rub shaving cream onto your back. Make sure that they cover the entire area that you want to be shaved.

, Be sure that your friend is not applying too much or too little pressure while shaving your back. Have him or her rinse the razor after each stroke for more effective shaving.


For the smoothest shave, your friend should be shaving in the opposite direction of your hair growth.
Don't go over the same spot too many times. Over-shaving may cause a rash or cut.

, Once your back is shaved, hop in the shower and rinse off the excess shaving cream. Gently towel dry. Rub lotion into your skin to keep your shaved back from stinging or drying out. Be sure to thank your shaving partner for the favor!


Check in the mirror to make sure that your friend didn't miss a spot. Reapply shaving cream and shave off any spots that might have been missed.

Shave often for good skin.",How to Shave Your Face," You should take into account the coarseness of your beard hairs, the texture of your skin, your preferred shaving method, and other details when choosing a razor. Generally speaking, for heavy-bearded men with more sensitive skin, it is generally good to use a traditional multi-blade razor.


Electric razors are convenient and quick, requiring less preparation before shaving than safety razors, and are somewhat gentler on sensitive skin. For some types of hair, however, they tend to leave an uneven or patchy shave on the face. More traditional razors work well on all types of skin and for all types of hair.
Individuals who get shaving bumps can use specially designed razors, typically marketed towards men with coarse hair. The key is for the razor not to cut too closely, so that the hair does not fail to emerge from the skin as it grows. Use of a pre-shave, liquid or talc, and a post-shave treatment for shaving bumps also can help.
If you have acne and need to shave an area, try both an electric and a safety razor to see which is more comfortable. Soften the hair with warm soap and water and then shave as lightly as possible.;
, Shaving with a dull razor is how cuts happen, and it makes the skin very irritated. Only shave with sharp, clean razor blades.


Before you shave, it's common to fill the sink with cold, clean water to use for rinsing the blade. Hot water will only make the blade expand and dull up, so it's common to use cold water on your razor., If you've got a beard, it's important to use clippers or scissors to trim the hair as short as possible before going using the razor. Electric clippers are best for this purpose. Take the guard off and trim your beard away completely.









Never lather up a full beard and attempt to use a razor on it. This will be extremely painful and ineffective at removing the hair.

, Use a good, natural exfoliant face wash and wash your face with warm soapy water. Blot dry.








, Shaving oil is used to nourish the skin and lubricate the razor as it glides across your face. It's a different product than shaving cream. Put a few drops of shaving oil in the palm of your hand and rub it into your beard before applying a hot towel and shaving cream, allowing the razor to glide across your skin evenly and comfortably. This will help to reduce razor burn.








, Traditionally, barbers would heat mens' faces with hot towels to open the pores and soften the beard hairs for a closer and more comfortable shave. Today, some people like to use a hot flannel at home to simulate the same effect. The heat and moisture will help to soften your beard (if you have one) and lift up the hairs, as well as open your pores.









Be careful that the water isn't too hot. Hot water slackens skin and pulls moisture away. The towel you use should be comfortably warm, but not piping hot.

, While it might seem old-fashioned, applying shaving cream with a brush will further help to soften your beard and exfoliate your skin. It also helps to float the whiskers out away from the blades while you are shaving.









If you're short on shaving cream, gel or foam, use conditioner or speciality shaving oil. Letting the lubricant sit on your face for up to a minute can amplify it's effects. Avoid using a bar of soap, as this can leave a residue on the blade, dulling the edge and eventually causing rusting; even on stainless blades. At a push, you can use a liquid soap as these are formulated differently.
Natural shaving creams are preferable to glycerine-based creams or gels, which can tend to dry out the skin and leave it irritated. Go for shaving creams made of all-natural oils and other products for the best and most comfortable shave.

, When you finish washing your face, you should start right away before your pores have a chance to tighten up and your skin is still damp. This is the best way to get the closest and most comfortable shave possible. Don't wait around while you do other morning rituals. Shave immediately.







, Hold your razor in your dominant hand and use your other hand to pull your skin tight and create as smooth a surface as possible for the razor to glide across. This is especially helpful when you're working around hard-to-shave areas like the nasolabial folds between your mouth and nose, as well as your jawline.

, Run your hand across your face. One direction will make the hairs stand up (against the grain), the other will make it lie flat (with the grain). You want to shave in the latter direction. Keep the flat of the blade almost parallel with the face to remove the bulk of the hair.


Use short, light, downward strokes while you're shaving to keep the blade sliding across the foam and removing the hairs tidily.

, Your shave should be a slow, comfortable, and thorough process. It's not something to rush through while you're driving to work. Start with one side of your face and work steadily towards the other side, doing small sections at a time and completely shearing the hair off of each section before you move on. It saves you time and aggravation to do it right the first time.








, Swirl it around in the filled sink and tap the razor against the side of the sink to free up clogged hairs. It's especially important to keep multi-blade razors from clogging with shaving cream and little hairs, or it'll be less effective at shaving your face.

, Run your fingers over your face to find any rough areas that you may have missed. Look for missed patches near sideburns, around your mouth and near your nostrils.









Apply shaving cream and gently pass the blade over the area across the grain, but not directly against the grain. Pay special attention to hairs on your neck and jawline, which generally do not grow straight up or down, but in many different directions that simple up-and-down motions can miss.

, Applying cold water as soon as possible after your face has been shaved is the best possible way to close your pores and finish the shave. Cold water also helps to close up the cuts and stop bleeding.









If you've cut yourself, you can then apply witch hazel to soothe the cuts and prevent razor burn. Then add small pieces of moistened kitchen paper or toilet roll to the cuts that still bleed.

, Shaving balms based in aloe and tea tree oil can help prevent dry skin and razor burn. Use all-natural products to keep your skin moisturised and healthy, applying a small amount and working it thoroughly around your beard area.









Remember the scene in Home Alone where he slaps aftershave on his face and screams? Yeah. It burns. But only if the aftershave is alcohol-based. It's important to avoid alcohol-based aftershaves, which dry out your skin considerably and really irritate the face.

, Rinse and dry your equipment thoroughly, and store in a dry place. Clean equipment is less likely to introduce bacteria and infection to your open, freshly shaved pores. Change the blades as needed. A dull blade will leave your face feeling raw and sore, and is much more likely to cause razor burn.

, Shaving once every couple days can help prevent your hairs from thickening, and making your next shave more irritating. The more consistently you shave, the better the quality of your shaves will be, and the better your complexion. Shaving removes dead skin and keeps pores from clogging, especially if you practice good hygiene after shaving.Use a styptic pencil if you are susceptible to nicks and cuts. When using a styptic pencil, simply wet and gently spread across the area where the nick occurred. The material on the pencil will constrict the blood vessels near the cut, and prevent anymore blood from coming out.

Examine the shaving mechanism.,
Prepare your skin.,
Keep the skin taut.,
Be patient.,
Maintain the electric razor.,
Try different products.",How to Shave Your Armpits2," Some newer models can be used with wet or dry skin, but the typical electric razor is designed only for dry use. Review the packaging to be certain which kind of razor you have.


If you are unsure, try dry shaving first.
Electric appliances should never be used in the shower or bath. Wet shavers can be used on wet skin, but should not be used while you bathe.

, If your razor has a rotary mechanism then it will be most effective if you move it in a circular motion.

Wet the area of the skin that you are going to shave.,
Choose a soap to use.,
Lather soap onto your skin.,
Start shaving.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Shave Without Shaving Cream1," It's always important to use water to help lather soap onto your body. Shaving without water or any moisturizing agent can cause your razor to glide unevenly and create burns or cuts on your skin.


If you're not in the shower or bath, you can get a wet wash cloth or cotton pad and dab it where you want to shave.
For best results, shave 10 to 15 minutes after you've been in the bath or shower. The water and heat helps to soften your skin and open up your hair follicles for a better, closer shave.You can also exfoliate your skin before shaving using exfoliating scrubs, a wash cloth or a loofah.;
, The trick is to choose something that is able to lather and cover your skin completely. It is also best to choose something that is moisturizing to help glide your razor across your skin smoothly to prevent burns and irritation. You can use soap products like:



Hair conditioner: Conditioner smooths and softens hair and is a great moisturizing agent.

Shampoo: Shampoo lathers quite well and can get rid of pollutants and grease from your skin.

Body Wash: Body wash acts similarly to shampoo and lathers better than conditioner. For best results, choose a body wash that uses body butter to better moisturize your skin.

Dish washing soap: When you've run out of body and hair soaps, dish washing soap is a good alternative that lathers very well. It is a low skin irritant but can be quite drying.

, Form a nice thick layer of soap to coat the skin. The coat not only helps glide your razor across your skin but can also serve as a tool for letting you know areas where you haven't shaved yet.









Add a few drops of glycerin to help increase lather and also moisturize your skin. Glycerin is a clear, odorless liquid that can be found at local drug store in the skin care or medicine aisle. It is typically used to treat and prevent dry, itchy and minor skin irritations, As you shave, be sure to rinse your razor often to get rid of soap and hairs.









Always shave with the grain. If you shave against the grain, you risk pulling hairs off your skin harshly and getting your razor's blades stuck on your hairs.
Shave slowly in sensitive or curved areas such as your neck, under your nose, armpit, genital area, the curve of your ankles and under your knee.
Razors with multiple blades will shave closer to the skin. Choose the best razor for your skin type.

Choose whether you want to dampen your skin or not.,
Trim long hairs.,
Rub oil onto your skin.,
Start shaving.,
Wipe away excess oil on your skin.",How to Shave Without Shaving Cream2," Since oils are already quite watery and apply well to skin dry, you don't necessarily have to wet your skin. Water might even repel oil from your skin since oils don't mix well with water. Instead, you can wet a wash cloth with hot water and place it over your skin to open up your hair follicles and soften your skin.


It's best shave 10 to 15 minutes after you've been in the bath or shower. The water and heat helps to soften your skin and open up your hair follicles for a better, closer shave.

, Shaving can be made easier if you trim your hair before shaving. It won't clog up your razor when you're shaving and you will use less product in the end.

, Be generous and thorough when rubbing oil into your skin. There are many types of oil that can be used to shave. The oil acts as a lubricant to help glide your razor across your skin while also moisturizing your skin. Some oils you can use are:



Coconut oil: It can come as liquid or as a solid. Simply rub the coconut oil between your fingers or hands to melt the solid coconut oil and apply it to your skin. Coconut oil is very moisturizing, safe to use and keep on your skin, and has anti-fungal and antibacterial properties to help protect sensitive skin.

Olive oil: Olive oil is known for its many health benefits. For skin in particular, it's studied to play a protective role against skin cancer development.Baby oil: Baby oil has no odor and often contains aloe vera extract which helps with inflammation and soothing skin irritations.

Everyone’s hair grows at a different rate and has a different texture so be aware of what features benefit you most.


While electric shavers are mostly used for dry shaving, new models can also be used for wet shaving as well. However, new wet models may be pricey.
Consumer sites can help you determine which shavers suits your price point. Some shavers may be overpriced based on added features that you do not need for your specific hair type.;
, Warm water, a hot shower, or a warm face cloth will help soften your beard and thus make it easier to get a clean shave.

Wet a washcloth with hot water if you don’t have time to shower. Hold it to your beard/stubble for a few minutes.

, It usually takes about 2 weeks to adjust to an electric shaver but during this time, the oils from your shaver will blend with those of your face., Alcohol based products will remove dirt and your skin’s natural oil (sebum) from your skin and make your facial hair stand straight up.A powder version can be used if you find alcohol to be an irritant.


Most pre-shave products include ingredients like vitamin E to ensure that your skin is protected and irritation is reduced.There are some products like pre-shave optimizer and pre shave oil that can improve the effectiveness of an electric shaver.Consult a skin care specialist to find out what best works for your skin. Stick to your skincare routine once you’ve found what works for you.

, Rub the places where your facial hair grows and the direction that feels smooth is the direction that’s ""with the grain."" This other direction will give resistance when you rub it. This is ""against the grain.""


It does not matter whether your facial hair is straight, curly or coarse, learning the direction it grows allows you to avoid irritation and in-grown hairs., Whether you want to save time, avoid mess, or get a close shave without irritating your skin, there are basically two types of electric shaver to use: rotary and foil. Rotary shavers utilize a revolving motion that guarantees a closer shave.This is a very popular choice because it doesn’t pull hair and provides a comfortable shave.


The three rotating mechanisms of a rotary shaver can help with hard to reach areas. Flexibility can depend on the brand so do your research to accommodate the contours of your face.
Titanium blades that form part of the rotary mechanism aid in painless shaving.A foil shaver has oscillating blades behind steel foils that lifts the hair out of the face as opposed to cutting it. These electric shavers have 3 to 4 blades and more blades means a reduced shaving time but can also be more noisy . The large head allows you to cover more area so this choice may be right for you if you want a quick and efficient shave., Foil shavers need the foil replaced every 1 -2 years depending on the toughness of your stubble. If you end up pressing harder to get a decent shave, chances are that you forgot to change the foil. Rotary blades needs to be replaced once a year.Skin irritation is another sign that you need to change the foil.
Don’t throw away the manual as details of how to replace parts and valuable manufacturer contact information will become invaluable the longer your keep your shaver., Understand that each shaver utilizes a different method to remove hair so optimize your shave by moving in a supplementary direction.


When using a rotary shaver, make small circular motions with the shaver head on your face but remember not to press hard or go over the same spot repeatedly to avoid irritation.Foil shavers work best when you shave with back-and-forth strokes., Debris can easily build up, especially if you have thick facial hair so be sure to regularly clean your shaver. Do not bang your shavers or use tools that aren't specific to cleaning shavers.


Foil shavers by Braun, Panasonic or Remington can be cleaned by lifting the head frame off and gently brushing out the whiskers from the under side with the cleaning brush supplied by the manufacturer. Do not touch the screen because it is very fragile.Philips rotary head shavers can be cleaned by lifting off the razor head assembly and brushing out the under side of the three cutters and the razor chamber. Don’t tap the heads on the sink as it may dent or damage the precision-made combs.Remove each cutter and comb the retaining plate of your rotary shaver every other month, or more if you have thick or fast growing hair, by brushing the whiskers from the cutters and soaking them in liquid cleaner and lubricate., It is recommended that you replace these at least once a year, or you will fail to get a good shave, and may end up irritating your skin.

, For example, if you use your right hand to write, also use it to shave. Use your off hand to hold your skin tight as you go over your skin with the shaver. Make sure to shave against the grain if you want a closer shave but careful to take your time for best results.


Hold the shaver at right angles to your face as your other hand pulls the skin taught to ensure hairs stand upright. This will also create maximum skin contact which reduces shaving time and minimizes snagging., This will help you get the closest shave possible.

, Shave with the grain, usually from the top towards your jaw.


Shaving against the grain gives a closer shave but is an easy way to cut yourself and you run the risk of cutting hair below the skin level, which creates ingrown hairs. These are also known as razor bumps because the whisker grows into the surrounding tissue instead of out of the pore, which causes inflammation and possible infection., Make sure to look at the mirror at a level angle to ensure both sides are even.


Put down the shaver and use both index fingers to help give you some perspective of which side is longer by placing each finger at the bottom of each side burn. For example, place your left finger at the bottom of your left side burn pointing towards your reflection in the mirror. Do the same with your right finger at the same time to get a sense of which side burn is longer and adjust accordingly.

, Use your index finger of your non-dominant hand to lift up your nose and force your upper lip downward to provide more surface area for you to shave.


You can also try moving your upper lip away from the direction that you are shaving. For example, shave downward and to the left as you move your upper lip toward the right. This will help flatten out your skin and expose your shaver to more of your hair.

, Bite and suck in your lower lip to maximize the surface area that the shaver touches. Go slowly around your lip to make sure you don't cut yourself.


You can also try moving your jaw away from the direction of your shaving stroke. For example, shave downward and to the left as you move your jaw to the right. This will flatten out your skin and expose your shaver to more of your hair.

, This area is the most sensitive and the trickiest so take your time. Tilt your head up and move closer to the mirror to get the best visual angle.


Many men with sensitive skin should shave the most tender areas, like the neck area below the jawbone, first, and then move to tougher spots like between the ears, nose and mouth because some shavers generate heat that can cause irritation., Electric shavers may leave small patches in hard to reach areas so it's best to take a look in the mirror before putting away your shaver.


Wash away and wipe off any loose hair and use your finger tips to feel if there are any loose strands remaining.

, This is especially important if you use alcohol based pre-shave, as the alcohol dries your face out.


Consult a skin care specialist to find out what after shave works best for your skin type.
Aftershaves, eau de toilets, and colognes are used for different purposes. Aftershave helps to give you a fresh scent after shaving while moisturizing and medicating your skin. Be aware of your surroundings in case coworkers or others in close proximity are sensitive to the strong smell that these products may provide.

, In many models you can lift off the head of the razor. You should then brush the whiskers out of the cutter and cleaning brush.

, A small amount of lubricant should be sprayed on the screen while the razor is running. Do not wipe it off when you're done.


Consult the user's manual for what lubricant works best for your model. Do not use a lubricant meant for other tools as it may contain harsh chemicals not meant to touch your skin.
Consult a skin care specialist immediately if a rash or irritation happens after applying a new lubricant. Chances are you’re having either an allergic reaction to the lubricant or a combination of the lubricant and other skin care products.

Otherwise, rinse the area to be shaved and apply a warm, wet towel for a few minutes, allowing your hair to grow wet and weak., Use enough to cover the entire area to be shaved. For thicker and/or coarser hair, apply more as needed. Work it in to ensure your roots absorb as much as the rest of your hair. Give your hair a minute or two to absorb it.Do your research. Conditioner serves as an adequate substitute for shaving products in a pinch. However, since it was not designed for this specific use, it may not have been tested for it.For long-term use, do some comparison-shopping. Check labels for any warnings, recommendations, or red-flag ingredients like sodium lauryl sulfate, which dehydrates the skin and removes natural oils.For best peace of mind, use a toxin-free product made with natural herbal ingredients.

, Avoid the nicks, cuts, and ingrown hairs that are more likely to occur when shaving “against the grain.”, Shave only a short stretch at time to avoid clogging your razor.Rinse the blades after each stroke to remove hairs, conditioner, and gunk.

, Resist pushing the razor hard against your skin and hair, which will increase irritation and the likelihood of razor burn and bumps. Replace the blades if you’re unable to shave without pressing hard, since this probably means the original blades are too dull., As you near the end, add more to thicker, coarser hair if the original application seems to have worn off.

You’ll open up your pores and soften whiskers, making shaving much easier. You may also wrap a hot towel around your face like barbers do for their customers. Soak a small towel in hot water and hold it firmly against your face until the towel cools., A good pre-shave oil can help make shaving easier. Look for products containing natural oils such as jojoba, coconut, olive, or sunflower. These oils help soften your beard without stopping your razor., Fill your shaving bowl or mug with hot water. Make sure the water is hot so it softens the bristles on your brush. Leave the brush to soak for a minute or two. Afterwards, pick up the brush and flick your wrist to get rid of excess water.The highest quality shaving brushes are made of badger hair. Boar bristle brushes are cheaper, and synthetic brushes are of the lowest quality.
You may work the soap or cream into your whiskers with your fingers, but a brush makes it a lot easier.

, Dump out the water in your mug or bowl. Replace it with nickel-sized dollop of shaving cream or the entire soap cake. Soaps are the cheaper option and are made with a high fat, vegetable oil glycerine mixture. Creams are similar to soaps and you should look for ones with natural essential oils like jojoba or coconut oil.Avoid common shaving gels and foams. Although you can use these, they won’t give you as good of a shave as quality soaps and creams.

, Place the dampened brush in the mug. Stir to work the soap or cream into a lather. The more you stir, the thicker your lather will be., Use the brush to pick up the lather. Move in circular motions over the area you wish to shave, taking care to cover every single hair. Once you’ve applied enough lather to cover the area, use a few brush sweeps to smooth over any peaks.

, Even though the razor has a wood or plastic handle, you don’t hold it. Instead, place your thumb under the blade on the shank (the piece of metal connecting to the handle). Your index, ring, and middle fingers go on the opposite side of the shank. Finally, place your pinky on the tang, which is the small piece of metal on the outside of the handle.This is the basic grip, and many people adjust it over time for greater comfort or directional control.

, The blade should not be flat against your skin or directly pointed at it. Instead, turn it slightly so the sharp part of the blade points downward at your skin. The handle should be out near your nose., Start with one side of your face. Use your free hand to pull up on your skin to make it flatter and smoother. Do this for every area you shave, since it gives you a smoother shave with less nicks., Hold the razor at the proper angle and start at the top of your cheek. Since the hair grows downwards here, work downwards towards your jaw and chin. Gently stroke the razor downwards in one smooth, controlled motion. Rinse off the blade and continue where you left off. Rinse off the blade after every stroke. Do this for both sides of your face.Even experienced straight razor users make mistakes from time to time. When starting out, you will cut yourself. Don’t be discouraged. Press the skin together for a few minutes to stop bleeding or apply styptic powder.

, The easiest way to get your chin is to continue on from the sides of your face. The skin here is easy to cut, so use short, gentle strokes to move towards your point. Pull your lips tight to cut around them., The rest of your face is done the same way as the sides. Tilt your head back, pull up on your jaw with your free hand, and stroke downwards to get the area under your jaw. Once you’ve taken care of your jaw area, move down your neck., Wash off your face and lather up as you did before. This time, you need to cut from side to side. Press more gently than you did the first time. Move from your ears to the center of your face. Rinse after each stroke.When you’re first starting, consider finishing by doing a second pass with downwards strokes. This way, you can get used to handling the blade without the extra risk of cuts.

, Rinse off again and re-lather with hot water and soap or cream. The third pass will give you the closest shave possible. Work up from the bottom of your neck. Be as gentle as possible to avoid cuts., Cold water will moisturize your skin while closing the pores. You may also apply aftershave, such as those with witch hazel or bay rum, to reduce irritation. Pat your skin instead of rubbing water or product into it., Wipe off the blade with a soft cloth. Even toilet paper will work here. It’s important to remove all moisture so the blade doesn’t rust. Store the blade away from all moisture, including shower steam.When storing the blade for a longer period of time, cover it with a blade oil such as camellia oil.

, Hanging strops have a hook you can attach to a solid surface, such as a bedpost or knob on a bathroom drawer. After every shave or honing, you should take time to strop your razor. It’ll smooth out the edges and give you a better, more comfortable shave.The canvas side works well enough between shaves. After honing, use the leather side.

, Pull the strop tight with your free hand. Move the blade to the far end of the strop. Hold the blade by the shank, keeping the sharp edge pointed away from you.

, Make sure the strop is pulled tight, or else you’ll end up with a rounded blade. Stroke the blade all the way towards you while holding it against the strop. Make sure you use light pressure and don’t lift the blade at all., Roll the blade over on its spine. Don’t let the sharp edge touch the strop. The edge should now face towards you. Run the blade along the strop to the other end the same way you did before., Usually you will need about 30 strokes, which amounts to 15 for each side. You can’t strop the blade too much. When you begin, move slowly and gently. As you learn you will be able to move faster and find that stropping takes no time at all., First, towel off the whetstone or ceramic hone to remove any residual debris. Lubricate the whetstone by covering it with cold water, oil, or your shaving lather. This lubricant protects against heat and particles that can damage the blade.Whetstones, such as the Norton 4,000/8,000 Grit Combo, can be found at hardware stores. Don’t use a cheap wetstone that you’d use for a knife.
Ceramic barber hones must be bought online through sites like eBay. These are not as coarse as whetstones.

, Find the side with the higher grit count or coarseness. This is the one you want to use to give your razor the proper sharpness., Start at one of the short sides of the whetstone. Both the sharp and blade edge of the razor should touch the stone. Keep the sharp end pointed away from you. Hold the shank with the tips of your fingers. Set a fingertip on your other hand to control the blade., Use your fingers to push the blade along the whetstone. Keep moderate pressure on the blade as you work. If the blade is wider than the stone, you’ll have to sweep it forward as you move it. Start with the bottom of the blade. Push the top part of the blade onto the whetstone as you stroke., Roll the razor over onto its back. Don’t touch the whetstone with the bladed edge. Instead, set the razor so that edge faces towards you. Bring the blade towards you with the same steps you used before., You’ll need to stroke the blade about ten times in each direction. Test the blade by lightly dragging it across a moistened fingernail. If it digs in without sticking, it’ll be honed. Don’t continue to sharpen a honed razor or else you’ll damage it. Strop it first before you use it to shave.

Your blade will stay honed for six to eight weeks. Stop the blade after every shave to maintain the sharpness until honing is needed again.

Allow the area you shave to be wet for at least two to three minutes before you start because shaving dry skin can be very irritating.Shaving after or during your bath or shower is a great way to ensure that your skin is soft.;
, Look for a shaving cream that is formulated for sensitive and/or dry skin. Avoid creams that contain alcohol, menthol, and peppermint as these ingredients can irritate your skin. If your skin is especially sensitive, consider shaving products that are fragrance free.Let your shaving cream sit for a few minutes before you begin shaving.If you are ready to shave, but you do not have any shaving cream, use hair conditioner or body wash. Bar soap will not provide enough lubrication and can cause your skin to be irritated., Exfoliating your skin removes dead skin cellsand dry skin. These dead skin cells can trap the hairs on your skin and cause red bumps and ingrown hairs.Those with sensitive skin should limit exfoliating to once or twice a week.You do not want your skin to be irritated before you shave.


Exfoliate the night before you shave instead of right before or the day you shave., If you are able to, allow your hair to grow a little longer in between shaves. Instead of shaving everyday, try shaving every other day or every couple of days.Shaving less often will decrease your chances of getting razor burn or ingrown hairs. On the days that you do not shave, it is important that you keep your skin moisturized and soft.

, If using a disposable razor, choose four or five blade razors instead of single blade razors. Single blade razors will drag against your skin more. If you shave with a reusable razor, change your blade after 5 to 10 shaves. Dull and/or old blades are more likely to cause bumps, redness, and contain bacteria.If you are prone to ingrown hairs, try an electric razor or clippers. Hold the razor or clipper slightly away from your skin when you shave.If you are using a disposable razor, you should replace it after it has been used for 5 to 7 shaves. This will keep your skin from getting irritated.Look for razors with moisturizing strips that contain Acai or Jojoba oil.
Only safety razors should be used to shave pubic hair., Shave your hair in the same direction that your hair grows.Although you will get a closer shave by shaving against the grain, you will increase your chances of irritating your skin.If you want a closer shave, you can shave against the grain once you have gone over your skin by shaving with the grain. Your skin may be able to tolerate it if you do it this way.


Do not pull your skin super tightly as you shave.Shave lightly if you are shaving over acne blemishes. Never try to shave off your acne with the blade.Shaving with the grain will also help prevent ingrown hairs.Rinse your blade after every stroke as well., Be gentle and shave slowly. You are more likely to cut yourself if you are rushing. The razor should be doing the work. You should not have to press the razor down too hard.If you feel like your razor is not working or you have to go over your skin repeatedly, it's probably time to get a new razor or change the blade.

, Once you are finished shaving, thoroughly rinse your skin with water and pat your skin dry. Make sure all of the shaving cream is gone. If you notice any rough spots or areas with hair remain, you can reapply the shaving cream and shave the area again. However, multiple strokes increases your chance of irritation., Apply lotion or an after-shave balm to your skin once you are finished. Avoid products that contain alcohol or any fragrance as these products can dry out and irritate your skin.Look for products that are moisturizing and are formulated for dry and/or sensitive skin. This step is critical because shaving dries out your skin.


Aloe vera is soothing to sensitive skin and can be applied after you get done shaving., If you experience ingrown hairs, razor burn, bumps, and/or cuts after you shave, you must take care of your skin to prevent further irritation. A warm compress can be applied to bumps and ingrown hairs. For ingrown hairs, a sterile needle can be inserted under hair loops to lift the hairs as well.If your skin is consistently irritated after shaving, take a look at the products and razors that you are using.


1% hydrocortisone cream can be used for itchy skin. Apply the cream two or three ties a day.
To treat razor burn, look for products that contain Wheat Germ, Yeast Extract, Vitamin E, Soybean Oil, Shea Butter, Jojoba Seed Oil, Evening Primrose Oil, and Silicones.Wait until your skin has healed before shaving again. If your skin does not get any better, you should see a health care professional.

, It is easiest to feel the grain if you haven't shaved for a couple of days. Run your fingers along your face. The direction that feels the smoothest and easiest when you rub is the direction you should shave. Every face is different, take the time to find out how your hair grows.Your blade should travel the direction with the least amount of resistance.
Moustache and chin hair typically grow downwards.
Neck hair typically grows upwards.
The grain may change around your jawline as well.

, If you feel the need, use a pre-shaving medium before you apply your shaving cream. A pre-shave lotion will soften your hair and protect your skin. Pre-shaving and shaving products for men should contain ingredients such as Camphor, Clove Flower Oil, Glycerin and Sodium Hyaluronate, Wheat Germ Extract, or Yeast Extract.This step can really make a difference in how your skin feels after you shave.


If you are shaving the same area twice, you will need to re-apply your pre-shave and shaving cream again.

, Apply your shaving cream with your hands and then use a brush to lather the cream. The brush will lift your facial hair and allow the cream to better coat your hair.Badger brushes are best for shaving. These brushes hold more heat and water than other materials. Use circular motions to lather your face and neck.

, A sharp blade will cut your hair more effectively. Dull blades will tug at your hair and require you to put more pressure on your skin to get a close shave. This can cause your skin to become irritated.In addition to using sharp blades, use razors with one or two blades.If you have acne, try both electric and disposable razors to see which one works best for you.Electric razors do not shave as closely and will prevent you from getting as many nicks and cuts as you might get from a safety razor., Look for pre-shave, shaving cream, and after shave products that are hypoallergenic and do not have fragrance. If you typically develop razor bumps after you shave, use products that contain glycolic or salicyclic acid. These ingredients will unclog your pores."

Choose a razor.,
Make sure your razor is clean and free of hair.,
Make sure your blade is sharp.,
Clean your environment.,
Exfoliate your skin.,

Press the razor firmly against your skin.,
Make short, smooth strokes.,
Rinse your razor between strokes.,
Splash the area with cold water.,
Dry your skin.,
Apply lotion or aftershave.",How to Shave Using Only a Razor and Water," You want a razor that’s comfortable to hold and sharp.There are several different types of razors to choose from.


The straight razor is the sharpest option and usually takes the most time and skill. This razor might not be the best option for shaving with water unless you’ve been using it for a while.
The safety razor (or a double-edged razor) is another option if you want a close shave. It’s also usually used with shaving products, but you can use it with water if you know how to use it.Disposable razors are probably the best option for shaving with water. They’re easy to clean, and you can dispose of the blades (or entire razor) after a few uses.
Electric razors can easily be used on dry or watered skin. The trade-off is that you won’t get as close of a shave as you would with any of the other options.;
, If it’s not, unclog the blades by giving it a quick rinse under a running faucet, or wipe it down with a cloth or small brush.

, If you aren’t sure if your blade is sharp enough, you can test it with a few methods.


Wet your thumbnail and drag it across the edge of the razor, without applying pressure. You should be able to tell how sharp it is by feel. This test isn’t as reliable as some others, but it’s quick.You can also drag the pad of your thumb across the edge of the blade to test its sharpness. If it’s sharp, you’ll feel a sticking sensation. Be careful not to apply too much pressure or you’ll cut yourself.Shave a section of your hair to see how many strokes it takes to get a clean shave. It shouldn't take many (1 or 2)., You’re dealing with open pores that are vulnerable to bacteria.A clean environment will help avoid bacteria getting into your pores.

, If you want an especially close shave, exfoliate your skin before shaving. It scrubs off dead skin that clogs your pores and exposes your hair follicles., Cover the whole area you’re shaving. The warm water will help open up your pores, making it easier to pull the hairs out of their follicles when you shave.You can also place a warm cloth on your skin for a few minutes.
Another option is to shave in the shower with the water falling onto your skin.

, Don’t press hard enough to draw blood, but give enough pressure to remove the hair at the follicle.


Angle your razor so that the blade is not placed at a 90-degree angle to your skin. Something closer to a 45-degree angle is what you’re aiming for.

, Shave in the direction your hair grows. This will cut down on ingrown hairs and rashes, and help provide a more precise shave. So, if your hairs grow toward the floor, pull your razor downward, toward the floor.First shave the sections that don’t have any tricky corners or crevices.
Shave the tricky spots last. For these areas, you might need to stretch the skin with your fingertips.
You don’t have shaving cream to show you where you’ve shaved, so pay close attention. You might have to go over some spots twice.

, Lift the razor from your skin between strokes and rinse it under running water to unclog the hairs from the blades.There’s no shaving cream to show whether the blades are clean, so pay careful attention.

, This helps remove loose hair and closes up your pores, preventing bacteria from getting in., Use a clean cloth or paper towel and dab the extra water from your skin.

, If you have sensitive skin, you can apply lotion, aloe, or an aftershave gel to your shave to moisturize your skin.


Some aftershaves include antibacterial properties, which help keep your shaved area healthy."

Trim your chest hair outside of the shower.,
Take a warm shower.,
Apply a moisturizing shaving gel, lotion, or foam.,
Use a fresh razor blade.,
Hold the skin taut.,
Shave using short, gentle strokes.,
Rinse the blade often.,
Avoid sensitive areas such as nipples.,
Reapply shaving gel or foam as needed.,
Lower the water temperature.,
Pat dry with a clean towel.,
Use lotion or moisturizer on your chest.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Shave Chest Hair," You wouldn’t take a cartridge razor to your beard before trimming it down, and the same can be said for shaving any body hair. Start with a trimmer on the shortest setting to give you better visibility and necessitate fewer strokes when you go for the razor.








Make sure you trim with completely dry skin and hair. Wet hair will stick to your chest making it harder to trim, and it can also stick to the trimmer.
Depending on your level of chest hair, this can cause quite a mess. Putting down a towel or trimming in a dry bathtub basin can help keep the process tidy.;
, With the hair down to an appropriate shave length, get in a warm shower. The heat will soften the chest hair and open the pores and hair follicles, making the hair easier to shave.








You want the shower to be warm and steamy but not scalding. You definitely do not want to irritate your skin before you even start shaving.

, A shaving product will help lubricate the skin for the razor blade to pass more easily, and it will also cut down on shaving irritation.









You may prefer a clear product that goes on smooth as opposed to a rich-lathering shaving cream that can cover chest contours and make it more difficult to see what you’re doing.

, Especially if this is the first time shaving your chest, you want to use a fresh razor blade that will require fewer passes, which translates into less shaving irritation.








, You’re more likely to cause cuts and nicks on fleshy areas, so use your free hand to stretch the skin, giving yourself a flatter surface to shave.







, You only want to apply a soft amount of pressure against the razor blade and use short strokes. A man’s chest hair grows in different directions, so you won’t really have the same with-the-grain or against-the-grain concerns that you would with shaving your face. No matter which direction you shave it will be with the grain of some hairs and against for others, so use the direction most comfortable to you.








, Hair will bind up the blade to make it less effective and require more strokes. To avoid this, rinse the blade under the running water after each pass.








, Nipples are much softer and fleshier parts of the skin, and you should avoid trying to shave over them because you are much more likely to cause cuts and nicks.









To help avoid nipples, you can use the fingers of your free hand to cover a nipple while holding the skin taut as you cover that area of your chest., You should try not to pass over each area more than twice to help reduce irritation. For the best results, reapply shaving product before returning to any areas that need a second pass.








, The same way men splash their face with cool water to close pores after a typical morning shave, lowering the water temperature just before getting out will feel soothing, and it will close chest pores.








, Don’t rub the area dry since that can lead to additional irritation. Instead use a fresh towel to pat the area dry.








, Before dressing apply a lotion or moisturizer for your skin type and allow it to dry. Chafing from shirts can lead to more irritation or even ingrown hairs, but a moisturizer will help reduce this risk.








, Adding the process to your shower regimen once or twice a week will keep the area smooth and stubble free. It will also negate the need to use a trimmer beforehand since you'll be maintaining the hair at such a short length.

Gather a pair of old jeans for sharpening.,
Place your jeans on a flat, clear, sturdy surface.,
Clean your razor blade.,
Dry your razor completely.,
Run your razor along your jeans.,
Run your razor along your forearm for jeans-less stropping.,
Strop your razor again for very dull blades.",How to Sharpen Old Razor Blades1," A traditional strop is made of leather, but an old pair of jeans will work almost as well. You should use old jeans as opposed to new jeans or jeans you wear regularly. You'll be using the cloth to rejuvenate the blades on your safety razor, but doing this could cause the fabric of your jeans to fray or deteriorate over time. Use old jeans so you don't do damage to a good pair of jeans!, A table or the counter top of your bathroom sink should be suitable as a sharpening surface. Clear the area first; an uneven surface could negatively impact your sharpening, and clutter might obstruct your sharpening motion.


You should also make sure the area is dry when using this sharpening technique. For the best results, you'll want to sharpen your blade when it's dry., This can be done in a cup of warm, soapy water. Dish soap should work well for busting up any razor gunk that's accumulated on your blades. For best results, you may want to allow your razor to soak for 15 to 30 minutes, swirling your razor in the water occasionally.


You might also use a specifically formulated razor blade cleaning solution. These are designed to work especially well on skin and hair buildup. Explore the shaving section of your local pharmacy or online vendors to find a razor blade cleaning solution., You can remove much of the excess moisture from your razor by holding it firmly and shaking it into the basin of your sink. Then, to ensure the blade is completely dry, you should use a cloth to wipe away remaining moisture. Do this by running your razor along the cloth with a motion that follows the direction of the blades.


To prevent fuzz or lint from building up, you might consider using a lint-free or microfiber cloth to dry your razor., You'll want to do this with the direction of the blades and not against the blades. Do this about approximately 20 times in one direction with short, quick strokes. This process, called stropping, will remove burrs and irregularities from your blades, honing your razor's edge.


To evenly and completely strop your blades, you'll want perform the same motion in the opposite direction (on the same section of denim) as well. Switch directions and run the blade along the jean fabric around 20 times in the same fashion you did previously.Use light pressure when stropping. Pressing too hard can actually cause damage to the edge of your blade., Be careful while doing this; you don't want to cut yourself while sharpening! Use moderate pressure and run the blades of your razor along the straight part of the top of your forearm with the direction of the blades and not against. Use quick, short strokes, and perform this motion about 10 - 15 times.


Your arm is very similar to an old fashioned leather strop, which is a piece of leather used for sharpening blades. In the same way a strop sharpens a blade, so should your arm.Since you are running your razor with the blades and not against, your safety razor shouldn't cut the hair on your forearm. Be careful not to slip and run the blade side-to-side, as this could result in you cutting yourself., Especially dull blades might require more strokes for best results. With the same motion you used for your first stropping, run your blades along the jeans with and not against the direction of the blades. Use light pressure and short, quick strokes for roughly 20 strokes, running your razor back and forth along the jeans, always in the same direction of the blades."

Clean your razor after shaving.,
Dry your razor always after using it.,
Consider using a skin safe blade lubricant.",How to Sharpen Old Razor Blades2," Your skin has natural oils that protect it from the environment, but these oils can also harm the quality of your blade over time. Shaving cream and decaying hair can also lead to your razor dulling rapidly. Clean your razor thoroughly after each use to maintain the sharpness of your blades.


A good way to remove gunk and grime thoroughly is to use a toothbrush to lightly scrub your razor when you are finished shaving. Then, rinse away the gunk under running water., When your razor is wet, the metal is vulnerable to corrosion and rust. This will cause your razor to dull more quickly. Thoroughly dry your razor when you are done shaving to prevent this.


Many approaches can work for drying your razor. For example, you might use a blow dryer or blot your blades with a towel.
Always exercise care when drying your blades. Rushing while blotting your blades with a towel might cause you to accidentally run your fingers along the sharp part of the blade, which could cut you., You might consider using a mineral oil or a small amount of cooking oil on your blade after drying it. This will coat the outer surface of the blade, making it less susceptible to moisture in the air, airborne dirt, and other environmental factors that can lead to a dull razor.


Some companies offer special formulated oils designed to prolong the life of your blade. Search for these in the shaving section of your local pharmacy, or online through a shaving vendor."

Start with a trimmer.,
Apply a pre-shave product.,
Pull the skin tight with your free hand.,
Shave according to your shaver’s design.,
Apply aftershave.",How to Shave a Mustache1," Most electric shavers are designed to tackle stubble not long, thick facial hair, so you will need to use a beard trimmer to trim away most of the mustache., Apply a pre-shave product to dry skin. These products differ for electric shavers. Instead of pre-shave oils one might use with a cartridge or safety razor, most electric pre-shave products are alcohol based or powders. These products help the hair stand straight up to get a closer shave with less irritation.If you have naturally dry or very sensitive skin, you may prefer pre-shave powders to alcohol-based products.

, Use your fingers to pull down around the edges of your mouth gently. This makes a nice taut surface over your upper lip for the electric shaver to pass., For rotary electric shavers, you’ll use small circular motions to get the best result. For a foil electric shaver, you will use straight strokes.


Regardless of the shaver type you use, make slow passes to give each hair plenty of time to pass across the cutting surface.
Though discouraged with razor blades, shaving against the grain with an electric shaver can yield the closest shave results since it helps raise the hair.

, The aftershave product you need depends on your skin type. For people with dry or sensitive skin, they may prefer aftershave balms, whereas those with oily skin will likely opt for an aftershave splash with a toner.

Trim your mustache.,
Clean and prep the skin.,
Apply a pre-shave oil.,
Apply a shave gel or soap.,
Shave in short strokes with the grain of your mustache.,
Rinse face with cold water.,
Apply aftershave.",How to Shave a Mustache2," You want to start by trimming the mustache with a pair of clippers or a small pair of scissors. The shorter hair is less likely to catch in the razor, and you’ll also have a clearer view with which to work.

, Whether in the shower or just over the sink, you should clean the skin and then apply heat. If you do not shower, then the best way to apply heat is with a wrung out, warm towel over the mustache for about a minute.


The heat both softens the hair and opens the pores, which means a closer shave with less irritation.

, Pre-shave oils give you both an extra layer of lubrication and protection against skin irritation when wet shaving. Apply a small amount to the skin around your upper lip that will come in contact with the razor., Whether you prefer canned shave gels or mixing your own shaving soap in a mug, you need to work it into a creamy lather and apply it to your face. Regardless of which type you use, applying with a shave brush helps exfoliate the skin as well as lifting and softening the hair., Using a fresh razor that has been heated with warm water, make short strokes in the same direction as the grain of the hair. Since hair does not typically grow at right angles out of a man’s face, you can test the grain direction for your particular mustache by running your fingers over the scruff to find the direction it feels smooth as opposed to prickly.


For safety razors, you want to hold the razor at about a 30-degree angle, and you do not want to apply pressure. Simply allow the weight of the razor to slide across the skin with your hand guiding it instead of pulling it.For cartridge razors, keep the plane of the cutting surface parallel with the skin. The close spacing in multi-blade cartridges will likely require rinsing the blade after each short stroke.
Stretch your upper lip downward to give yourself a taut, flat shaving surface.
Especially if you have a thick mustache and didn’t trim it very short to start, this may take several passes. Be thorough, but also be aware that many passes can lead to more nicks and shaving irritation. Reapply shaving gel or soap as needed.

, A nice cold water rinse when you have finished will soothe the skin and close the pores that you opened with the shower or warm towel.

, As with an electric shave, you will want to apply an aftershave the complements your specific skin type.

Apply shaving soap.,
Shave in slow strokes with the grain.,
Rinse with cold water.,
Apply aftershave.",How to Shave a Mustache3," Though a straight razor can cut through the hair regardless of length, it takes much more skill on behalf of the shaver if a full mustache is involved, so begin by trimming the mustache down significantly with a trimmer or a small pair of scissors.

, When using a straight razor, the natural oils of your skin can actually help lubricate the shave, so you may prefer not to wash your face until after shaving. To prep the skin simply wring out a towel after running warm water on in and place it over your mustache for a minute.

, Like with a safety razor, a small amount of a good pre-shave oil will help provide an extra layer of lubrication to protect again cuts and irritation.

, You do not want to use a canned gel with a straight razor. Apply shaving soap with a good brush and work it into a rich lather over your mustache.


Brushing against the grain of your mustache will help raise the hair and exfoliate your skin.

, You want to hold the straight razor at a 30-degree angle with your little finger on the tang—the little curved bit—and your other three fingers on the back of the shank with your thumb on the front of the shank beneath the blade.This will give you the most control and precision with the straight razor.


Do not apply pressure. Allow the weight of the blade to do the cutting and use your hand to guide it rather than to apply any pressure.
To form a taut surface flatten your lip downward. You can also use your free hand to tilt your nose up slightly, which will additionally tighten the skin on your upper lip.
Never under any circumstances use the blade in a sawing motion.

, As with other wet shave methods, the warm towel or shower to start opens your pores, and a splash of cold water when you’re done helps close them.

, Apply a small amount of the aftershave of your choice based on your skin type.

Don’t spend too much time in the shower. 3-5 minutes should suffice.
Make sure you dry off well.
Fully rinse off any soap or body wash.;
, After you’ve showered and dried off, make sure to apply some sort of pre-shave product. Of course, such a product will depend on where you are shaving.


If you’re shaving your beard, make sure to use a facial scrub or something that will clean and soften your beard before removal.
If you’re shaving a more sensitive area, consider pre-shave oils or gels.
Don’t substitute with products (soaps and other products) not intended for these uses., Shaving your facial hair is the one constant that almost all men have to deal with. As a result, we’re pretty familiar with what we need to do. Consider the following:


If you have a beard, take a trimmer with a low guard, and remove as much hair as possible.
After you’ve trimmed, or if you don’t have a beard, moisten and lather your face with water and shaving cream.
Take a razor and shave with the grain. Although shaving against the grain might give you a closer shave, it could also damage your skin.
Rinse and moisturize.

, Shaving your back is one of the most popular things for men to shave. It is also relatively difficult due to obvious constraints. When shaving your back, you might just need an assistant to get hard to reach places. But with or without an assistant, you need to follow some of the same procedures:


Take your trimmer with a low guard and trim your back hair.
Moisten and lather your back with water and soap/shaving cream.
Take a razor and remove the remaining hair.
Rinse and moisturize.

, Some men prefer to shave their chest and stomach entirely. If you prefer to shave your chest or simply trim excess hair, you’ll follow similar directions. Make sure you have a good pair of clippers, don’t cut corners, and don’t rush.


Make sure your hair and skin are dry.
Shave or trim in the direction of the natural grain of your hair.
Shave or trim all the way down. Don’t leave any hair untrimmed or unshaved as you move down your chest and stomach.
Apply lotion afterwards., Most experts agree that many men don’t need to bother removing all of their armpit hair. Typically, if you’ve got a lot of armpit hair, you should just trim it. If you want to remove it all for one reason or another, do so. Consider the following:


If you’re trimming, trim with a long attachment on a clipper. You can also do this with scissors.
If you’re going to shave it all off, trim first with a shorter attachment for a clipper.
When you’re done with the trimmer, moisten and apply shaving cream if you want.
Use a razor to remove the left over hair.
Moisturize afterward., Men who wish to groom their arm and shoulder hair can also either shave it all off or just trim it. Tending to your arm and shoulder hair will compliment your overall look if you choose to go for a more bare and clean cut look. However, shaving your arms and shoulders should be done with care.


Shave your shoulders and biceps bare. Start on the shoulder with a trimmer and no guard.
As you move down toward your elbow, use longer guards. This is because most men won’t want to completely shave their arm hair off.
Make sure there are no hard hairlines when you are moving down from the biceps to the lower arm.
When you’re done with the trimmer, moisten your arms and apply shaving cream if you want.
Use a razor to remove the left over hair.
Moisturize afterward.

, Like with other parts of their body, men have two choices when it comes to grooming their leg hair. They can either shave it all off or trim it. Both follow the general rules set forth on other parts of the body.


If you’re trimming, make sure you use a clipper with a moderate attachment. Start with a longer attachment, and move smaller until you find the desired length.
Try to trim most excess hair off with a short attachment.
Moisten and lather your skin.
Take a razor and shave off the rest of the hair.
Rinse and moisturize afterward., The groin area – and all of the parts there – is the most complicated area to shave. A general rule is to take a moderate sized clipper guard and remove all of the excess hair that you can get with it. After this, you need to decide whether you are completely shaving, or just trimming. If you’re trimming, just adjust to a smaller clipper guard and trim until you get to the desired length of hair. If you’re shaving, you need to consider:


Remove as much hair as you can with the shortest clipper guard possible. For hard to reach areas where you can’t maneuver a clipper, use small scissors – be careful!
After removing excess hair, moisten your skin with water.
In order to get the rest of your hair, take a new/sharp razor and use slow and small strokes to remove the rest of the hair.
Don’t use shaving cream or lather as you might not be able to see the hair you need to remove.
Moisturize afterward.

, Many men prefer to take all of the hair off of their butt. If this is you, then your method is fairly simple. Take your clipper with no guard, and just shave everything off. Consider the following:


You most likely don’t need to use shaving cream, but you might want to moisten your skin with water.
You’ll need access to a large mirror so you can see those hard-to-reach places.
You’ll probably want a small mirror so you can maneuver it around to see harder-to-reach places.
Make sure to lift your legs up so you can get all of your hair. Don’t leave uncut swaths here and there – especially in that super-hard-to-reach place.
Moisturize afterward.

, Taking a short shower or bath is one of the final steps of your shave. Here, you’ll wash off any hair, pre-shave or shaving cream residue, and use water to relax your pores.


Do not use soap because it dries the skin.
Don’t spend too long in the shower.
Make sure to dry yourself thoroughly., After you’ve showered and dried yourself, make sure to put on an aftershave product on the areas you’ve shaved. Aftershave products are not really just for your face, but for any area where you’ve shaved. It will keep your skin from drying out and help repair any damage you might have done with the razor., Now that you’ve finished, you need to clean up your mess and make sure your razor and trimmer are clean and sanitary so you can use them next time. This is important, as you don’t want dead skin and hair on your razor and trimmer contributing to bacteria growth.


Take a cotton swab, cotton ball, or clean cloth rag and soap them with alcohol.
Clean the razor, trimmer, and trimmer guards with your alcohol-soaked rag.
Allow to dry and put away., Make sure your body hair grooming style fits your entire body and your overall look. You don’t want to contradict yourself and send mixed signals about the sort of person you are. A little forethought can save you a lot of embarrassment and awkward looks.


If you’ve got a beard or other facial hair, try not to completely share your chest and legs.
If you’re going for a fully-shaved look on almost your entire body, make sure you keep up with shaving your facial hair.
Consistency is key., Maintenance is the biggest factor that stops guys from shaving their body hair. After all, if you make the choice to shave, you’ll generally have to invest a lot of time keeping that look up., Different areas of the body present different challenges. As a result, figure out where you want to shave ahead of time. Avoid deciding to shave your entire body on the fly, as you might not have enough time or the proper supplies to complete your mission. Consider your:


Back.
Arms and legs.
Groin.
Posterior.
Chest.
Face.

, Shaving your body hair is not as quick as shaving your face. Part of the problem is that we don’t really shave our body hair often, so we’re not sure how to do it. As a result, you need to set a large chunk of time aside to get the job done.


Don’t have anywhere to go.
The more of your body you’ll be shaving, the more time you’ll need.
Don’t rush or cut corners., Shaving your body hair is an extremely messy endeavor. Once you get started, hair will be flying everywhere. Make sure you find a good place to shave that’ll be easy to clean up afterwards.


Consider the bathroom.
Showers or bathtubs work best.
If you’re not in a shower or tub, consider putting some towels down on the floor to collect your hair.
If you’re in a shower or tub, consider putting a hair blocker near your drain. Otherwise, you’ll be picking up some chemical drain cleaner to unblock your pipes in the near future."

Sharpen using a strop.",How to Sharpen a Razor1," A little soap and water is all you need. You can even let the razor soak in a cup for a few minutes. Then give a quick rinse to let the leftover gunk wash away., Shake away the excess moisture, then dab the razor on a soft towel. You can also use a blow-dryer or fan, or even just hang it upside down to let the water drip off., The easiest way to hone your disposable razor and get some more life out of it is to use a pair of jeans. The denim will align the indentations on your blade to create a smoother cut, and extend the life of your disposable razor.Lay a pair of jeans on a flat surface. You shouldn't be wearing the jeans when you do this.
Run the blades over the jeans. Draw the blade up the length of a leg. Move it in the opposite direction that you would use for shaving. 10 to 20 strokes should be enough to sharpen the blade.
The denim threads on jeans run in a diagonal direction, so to balance the work, drag the blade both up and down the leg, always moving in the opposite direction you would use for shaving.

, The skin on your arm is somewhat leathery, like a strop, and can help hone a blade. Run the razor along your arm from the elbow to the wrist about 10 to 20 times. Instead of pulling it along the arm as you would if you were actually shaving, push it along your arm with the sharp edge of the blade is facing away from you. Then, repeat in the opposite direction (wrist to elbow), again keeping the blade away from you., A strop is a thick piece of leather used to sharpen the blades of straight edge razors, though there are strops that can help disposable razors.

You can also use a blow-dryer or fan, or even just hang it upside down to let the water drip off., A strop is a thick piece of leather used to sharpen the blades of straight edge razors. They can be either the common hanging strop (just the leather with handles at each end), or the loom or paddle strops (with the leather attached to a block of wood for a flat surface.If you are using the hanging strop, make sure you attach one end to a fixed object, and hold the strap taught.
Hold the razor blade in your dominant hand with the back of the razor facing you, and the strop in your other hand. Applying moderate amounts of pressure, quickly pull the razor blade down the length of the razor strop. Apply 10 strokes to ensure sharpness.
Turn the blade over and pull in the other direction.
Let the razor rest. The strop works by realigning the imperfections in the blade. Let the blade sit for 24 to 48 hours before using again to let it straighten up. Razor strops should be used at least once a month for best results when it comes to keeping your straight edge razor sharp and effective.

, This is also called a ""whetstone"" or ""stone hone."" This is a flat stone used to sharpen straight edge blades. Different stones have different levels of grit, different strengths for sharpening different blade sizes and thicknesses.For your razor, you will want a very fine grit, 4,000/8,000.Place the stone on a flat surface. You will want it somewhere, such as a table or counter top, where it won't move.Wet the stone. A little bit of water, oil, or shaving cream will do the trick. This prevents the stone from heating up and warping your blade, and cleans it off before you use it.Drag the blade over the stone. Place one edge of the razor on top of the stone, and using diagonal strokes, pull it towards your body. Move at an angle so the entire blade makes contact with the stone. Flip the razor over so that the other side is on the hone, and repeat the process.
Unlike strops, you should only use the stone once every six to eight weeks. Using this tool more often can decrease the life of the razor blade."

Consider your current underarm shaving routine to determine what might be causing razor burn.,
Because underarm skin is delicate, shaving mistakes can lead to bumps and rashes.,
Make sure you have a blade that is in good condition.,
Plan to shave your underarms in the evening before going to bed.,
Apply shaving cream, gel or lotion to prepare your underarms for shaving.,
Shave your underarms in the direction of the growth of the hair.,
Some women have underarm hair that grows in several patterns.,
Press the razor lightly while shaving.,
Dip your razor in warm water to rinse hairs away from the blade as many times as needed while shaving your underarms.,
Wait at least 30 minutes before applying deodorant if you must shave in the mornings.

,
However, when possible, it is best to shave the night before and wait until morning to apply deodorant.

",How to Prevent Underarm Razor Burn,";
, Shaving before applying deodorant, using a dull blade and shaving dry underarms are all mistakes that can cause razor burn.

, Dull, old and rusty razor blades can all damage delicate underarm skin and lead to razor burn.


New razors are best for a smooth shave, and will require less strokes to remove all hair.

,


Small nicks and cuts that occur during shaving will have time to heal before time to apply deodorant when shaving at night.

,


These products will help the razor to glide over your underarms easily and reduce the risk of cuts and scrapes.

,


Because hair growth patterns vary with each individual, run your fingers over the hair stubble prior to shaving to feel the growth pattern.

, If your underarm hair is like this, shave in several different directions, following each direction of the growth pattern.

, Pushing down too hard can damage the skin and is one of the causes of underarm razor burn.

, This will also help soften the hairs as you shave.

Wait until after your warm bath or shower to shave.,
Exfoliate, exfoliate, exfoliate.,
Always use a shaving lubricant.,
Shave in the direction of your hair growth.,
Use short, light strokes.,
Rinse with cold water and pat dry.",How to Prevent Skin Irritation After Shaving1," Your warm (repeat: warm) shower or bath hydrates your skin, and it prepares your skin for shaving with a reduced risk of skin irritation. The softer your hair is, the easier it is to shave off cleanly.









Let your hairs soften and stand up from the warm water. The moisture and steam from your bath or shower cause your hairs to become soft and to raise against your skin. Softer hairs that are raised against your skin shave much more smoothly than areas that are not prepared for shaving.
Hold a warm, wet washcloth to the area for at least 5 minutes if you don't have the time or resources to shower.;
, Many people are guilty of skipping this super-imperative step. In fact, you should be doing it both before and after you shave. It may seem like a waste of time, but your skin will be smoother and less prone to redness and irritation.









When you exfoliate before, it aligns your hairs for a uniform shave and sweeps away the dead skin, allowing for a closer shave. When you do it after, it unclogs your pores (from the shaving and creams, etc.) and prevents ingrown hairs (that cause razor bumps).

, More on the specifics of creams and the like later, but using something to hydrate your skin is AN ABSOLUTE MUST. Do you feel like you're being yelled at? GOOD! ALWAYS USE SHAVING CREAM.









Crystal clear, right? Do not ever shave with just water. Soap and water is okay, but a cream designed especially for sensitive, to-be-shaved skin is best. And when you shave the same area twice, be sure to reapply.

, Use razor strokes that go downward. Applying pressure with your razor against the grain of your hair causes irritation and bumps. Generally, this means down.









Yep, shaving against the grain allows for a closer shave, sure. If that's what you want, go for it. But the likelihood of your skin getting irritated increases exponentially when you do so.

, The two sort of work in tandem, actually. When your stroke is short, you tend to be lighter on your skin. If the stroke is too long, you feel as if the razor dulls and you need more pressure to combat that. Resist!









You'll also be washing in between strokes -- so the shorter the stroke, the easier you are on your razor. That's good for your wallet and your skin!

, Just how warm water will open up the pores, cold water will seal them off, cinching the deal. After the cold water rinse, pat the area dry. Don't rub! Rubbing is just an invitation for disaster. You did it well -- don't mess it up!

Get a new razor.,
Men, purchase a badger brush.,
Use shaving cream with aloe or other ingredients intended for sensitive skin.,
Apply hydrocortisone cream or salve after shaving.,
Put on lotion after shaving.",How to Prevent Skin Irritation After Shaving2," Using a dull razor causes unnecessary irritation to skin under all conditions. Instead of gliding across your skin, a dull razor drags, which causes more irritation. Imagine it chipping away at your skin -- no thank you!








You can reuse your razor a few times if you take good care of it. Make sure to wash it after every swipe. Don't leave it wet though, as water can erode at the metal, too. Clean it with rubbing alcohol to kill all the bacteria for extra precaution., You may think lathering up is all you need do, but a badger brush really works in your shaving cream to the hairs, resulting in a cleaner, smoother shave.









You may also want to look into a safety razor. It's a single blade that provides a clean cut. The blades are cheap, too!, Wait until halfway through your bath or shower to apply the shaving cream. Allow it to sit on your skin for at least 3 minutes to soften the hairs. The aloe and other ingredients in the shaving cream create a surface that yields a smoother shave with less irritation.









Gentlemen, you may be better off with your girlfriend's shaving cream. Products marketed toward women's legs are often a bit more hydrating and skin-softening.You can handle a pink can, right?

, Do this immediately after shaving to reduce the sting and redness caused by your razor. The salve works to soothe the skin and heal any irritation.









Refrain from using hydrocortisone cream daily. Regular application causes skin to become used to it, which reduces its effectiveness. Regular use can cause skin to thin.

, Use a moisturizing, unscented, unperfumed lotion on the shaved area. Lotions reduce the impact of dry skin that results from shaving, which causes many skin irritation symptoms.









Bag Balm (available at places like Wal-Greens or CVS) is a great product for all things skin-hydrating. In reality, apply lotion all the time, not just after shaving.

Cease shaving.,
Utilize a depilatory to remove hair.,
Put benzoyl peroxide salve or a razor bump cream on shaved areas.",How to Prevent Skin Irritation After Shaving3," Stop shaving and allow the hair to grow. Try this for a short time, even if it's not possible to do this as a long-term solution. The less often you shave, the fewer chances you have to get irritated skin.









Even just a few days will help your skin heal itself. If you're in dire straits, get a doctor's note telling school or work that you're free to grow that beard. Or that leg hair -- whichever., Depilatories dissolve hair at its root within the hair follicle. Using a depilatory reduces skin irritation caused by shaving. However, watch for allergic reactions to depilatories. Depilatories are approved for sensitive skin, but skin allergies do occur.









In case it wasn't clear, with this you won't be shaving. That's certainly one way to avoid razor burn and bumps!

, Apply 2.5- to 5-percent benzoyl peroxide on your skin immediately after shaving to reduce redness, irritation or bumps. Benzoyl peroxide was originally created as an acne treatment, but it is now a common treatment for the avoidance of razor burn.









There are a whole bunch of razor bump creams on the market that can be found at your local drugstore, like Bump Stopper and Tend Skin.Use it as a preventative tactic if you are particularly prone to them.

, You can easily make your own sugar scrub with a simple mix of olive oil, sugar, and lemon. Or you can get a bit fancier and make a honey-based scrub.Since honey has antiseptic properties, it will help heal any cuts or nicks that you get while shaving.Other common ingredients include oatmeal, baking soda, and salt, all things that are probably already in your kitchen cabinets. There are plenty of great recipes out there, and once you have a good base, you can tinker with it to suit your needs.


Make sure you leave the scrub on for a couple of minutes before rinsing it off. You might want to just turn your shower off and soak in the steam while you let the scrub work its magic.

, Not all shaving creams are created equal—but they definitely beat using a bar of soap. Your shaving cream does two things. First, it lubricates your skin so you don’t get razor burn. And second, it moisturizes, making your legs feel soft as well smooth. If your shaving cream isn’t doing both of those things, try a different kind.


If you like being more natural or adventurous, there are alternatives to shaving cream. You can also use conditioner, baby oil, sweet almond oil, and cocoa butter or a similar moisturizing lotion. Just make sure that whatever you use is sufficiently thick and moisturizing. For example, coconut oil is often touted as a skin oil, but it might be too light to prevent razor burn if you use it while shaving., Razors can be super expensive (and ladies, no matter how cute that pink razor is, you can probably buy the same number of blades for less in the men’s section).But if you want to have fabulous-looking legs, you will probably have to fork over a little extra cash for something good. Whether you opt for disposable razors or refills, you want to use a razor with a minimum of three blades, and more is better. Also make sure to replace your razor as soon as it starts to get dull, because you increase your chances of cutting yourself.

, When you shave against your hair’s natural tendencies, you will get a closer shave. But to reduce irritation, it’s a good idea to start by shaving downward. , This step is optional, but again, it will probably give you a smoother final result. Depending on how sensitive your skin is, you might not want to reverse at all.


If you don’t mind shelling out the money for a wax or are fearless enough to do it yourself, then you might find that it’s a good way to stay fabulously hairless longer. Regardless, it's still a great idea to exfoliate a day or two beforehand and moisturize well afterward.

, For example, if you have dry skin, you may want a heavier moisturizing lotion with cocoa butter or shea butter. Or if you tend to get razor burn, look for a lotion with ingredients like calendula, witch hazel, almond oil, aloe, and tea tree oil, which are all soothing and may be naturally disinfectant.


Note that lotions containing alcohol or heavy fragrances may sting if you have nicks or cuts from shaving.

, Take the time to rub it in thoroughly. You can use this time as an opportunity to give yourself a mini calf massage if you want.

, You've probably had the experience of moisturizing and then trying to throw on a pair of leggings or skinny jeans right afterward. It's tough, because the lotion leaves your skin feeling a bit tacky at first. If you wait a half an hour before trying to don your clothes, it won't be as difficult or uncomfortable.

, Make it a regular part of your bedtime routine. While you're sleeping, your skin will drink up the lotion and you'll wake up feeling like a goddess with your incredibly soft legs.

, The goal is to have sexy, toned legs, but you only have so much time. When you figure out where to focus your efforts, you can maximize your work out. Maybe you like the shape of your calves, but you have heavier thighs. Maybe you think your shorts could use a little more end game. Or maybe you just want an all-over workout. The point is to make it work for you.

, Squats and lunges are the most common leg exercises. They’re great because they work out most or all of your major leg muscles and they can be easily customized to target specific areas. You can search for exercises that work a particular area, or you can just look for leg toning exercises and test them out to see where you feel your legs working the most.


For example, to give your inner thighs an extra workout, you can squeeze a medicine ball between your legs while squatting. Or to work your calves, you can bring your heels together with toes facing slightly outward, rise up on the balls of your feet, and go into a half squat.Even if you hate squats and lunges, there are other options. For example, bridge position is a good workout for your thighs and butt. Lie on your back on the floor with your hands down by your sides. Bring your knees up and place your feet flat on the floor. Keeping your arms flat for support, use your abs and glutes to slowly peel your butt and lower back off the floor, raising them until your torso creates a straight diagonal line. Hold for a few moments, then slowly lower back down with control. Repeat two more times.

You can also make this a little more intense. From the raised position, lift your right leg straight up in the air with your foot flexed. Pulse up and down 10-15 times in this position, then lower your foot and slowly lower down. Repeat on the other side. You can also do this from crab position if you want to get a little arm toning in too, but make sure you pulse from your knee and elbows instead of your waist., Pick some of your favorite, upbeat tunes and throw them together for a little extra inspiration. If you regularly use the same mix of songs, you may even find that it cues your focus and primes you for your workout so that you’re ready to go.

, For your toning exercises, you may not need more than a half an hour. Do give your workout priority status: whether you commit to doing your workout at the same time every day or prefer more flexibility, make sure that you’re giving yourself the time you need to reach your goals. Consistency is important here.

, You may want to get a pedometer, or you can use a pedometer app if you have a smartphone.Regardless of how you choose to keep track, set a goal to walk a certain number of steps every day. The extra activity will be great for your health, and it can improve your strength and fitness as well.

, The toning exercises are strength training, but you should also get in some cardio. These activities will elevate your heart rate and improve your physical fitness. Of course, you’ll also be getting in some extra legwork to help you meet your goals.

, Regardless of the activity you’re engaged in, make sure that you stretch properly before and after your workout. The point isn’t to injure your legs—it’s to take them from good to fabulous.

, The length of your armpit hair should be short enough to be manageable, and should not be visible or sticking out when your arms are at your sides., The amount you trim depends on your personal preference, but make sure you trim any chest hair that creeps out over the front and back of your shirt collar.


If you want to eliminate all hair from your chest, make an appointment with a salon that specializes in waxing. Removing chest hair using a razor can increase your risk for skin irritation, ingrown hairs, and itchiness., Waxing treatment will often last between four and six weeks, and is considered the most ideal treatment for hair removal on your back and shoulders.


If you have several stray hairs on your back, ask your partner or friend to remove the hairs using a trimmer or tweezers., Keeping your pubic hair to under an inch can help prevent irritation.

Try applying aloe vera.,
Use a licorice root extract.",How to Remove Dark Spots After Shaving1," Dark spots after shaving can be caused by hyperpigmentation or freshly shaved hair follicles peeking out from just under your skin. If your dark spots are due to subsurface hair, consider waxing or plucking the affected area to remove dark follicles.Dealing with hyperpigmentation takes a little more work, since it involves small spots of skin that change in color due to skin irritation or inflammation. Some common causes include acne, ingrown hairs, and bacterial infection.;
, Be sure to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen before going outside, especially if the affected area will be exposed to the sun. Choose a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. Unprotected exposure to sunlight will worsen your dark spots., Squeeze the juice of one lemon into a small container. Dip a cotton ball into the juice and use it to dab the affected area directly. Apply lemon juice to your dark spots twice daily to gently bleach them.Be sure to use fresh squeezed lemon juice instead of store-bought bottled juice.

, An over the counter vitamin C whitening cream will work much like fresh squeezed lemon juice. While using lemon juice is easier and less expensive, using a store-bought cream can help prevent drying or irritating your skin, which might occur if you just use lemon juice.Look for a cream at your local drug or convenience store marked “5 to 10% AA” or “5 to 10% vitamin C.”

, If you have an aloe vera plant, cut off a piece and scrape off the gel-like secretion from inside the leaves. If you don’t own one, purchase a 100% aloe vera gel from your local drug or convenience store. Apply the gel to the affected area, leave it on for 30 minutes, then wash it off with cool water.Apply to your dark spots twice daily.

, Look for a ready-made licorice root extract skin salve and apply it to your dark spots as directed.You can also prepare your own salve by bringing 2 tablespoons of dried licorice root and 6 cups (1.44 L) of water to a boil. Reduce heat, cover the pan, and simmer for 40 minutes. Apply to your skin using a cloth or cold compress.It’s best to check with your doctor before trying licorice root and other herbal extracts, especially if have existing health conditions, such as diabetes. You should avoid using licorice root if you’re pregnant or plan on getting pregnant."

Avoid shaving dry skin.,
Allow shaving cream to set for a minute before shaving.,
Use a sharp razor.,
Shave gently in the direction of hair growth.,
Wash your skin after shaving.,
Finish with aftershave balm or moisturizer.",How to Remove Dark Spots After Shaving2," Always shave after or during a shower or bath, regardless of the part of your body you’re shaving. Warm water weakens hair structure and raises it from the skin, making shaving less irritating. In addition, always apply a shaving cream or gel before shaving to lubricate your skin.Avoid shaving with just soap and water.

, After applying shaving cream or gel, wait a minute or so before you start to shave. This will allow the cream or gel to reach the base of each hair shaft. That way, each individual hair will be slightly raised, your skin will be moisturized, and your razor will be less likely to cause irritation or ingrown hairs., Avoid shaving with dull blades. Change your razor every three to six uses, or more frequently if necessary. Check the razor's lubricating strip before you start shaving, and use a new one if it's worn or whenever a razor feels dull when you start to shave., No matter where you’re shaving, also go in the direction that your hair grows. Shaving against the grain pulls hair, causes irritation, and can cut the skin. Be gentle, proceed slowly, and avoid applying too much pressure on your razor.Rinse the razor with hot water after every couple strokes to prevent too much hair from collecting between the blades.

, When you’ve finished shaving, you should wash your freshly shaved skin using a gentle cleanser. Rinse the area with cool water and dab dry with a towel after cleansing.Avoid skin cleansers that contain alcohol. If you want to go with a natural cleanser, consider applying witch hazel or tea tree oil to freshly shaved skin.   

, Moisturizing after shaving helps your skin recover and helps prevents irritation. Rub a small amount of moisturizer over the area, and try not to over-moisturize. Leaving too much residue behind can block pores and weigh down individual hair shafts, which leads to ingrown hairs."

Avoid high-concentration over the counter medications.",How to Remove Dark Spots After Shaving3," If your dark spots persist for several months and home solutions are ineffective, consider seeking a medical solution. Call your primary care doctor and ask them to recommend a dermatologist. You can also find a dermatologist by using the search tool on the website of the American Academy of Dermatology: https://www.aad.org/find-a-derm


Call your insurance provider to make sure any dermatological care you’ll need is covered. Ask them if specialist care needs prior approval and if they can provide you with in-network care providers.  

, Tell your dermatologist about your shaving practices, skincare routine, and any products you use. If your underarms are affected, ask the dermatologist about switching your antiperspirant or deodorant.You should also be prepared to discuss your diet, sun exposure and sunscreen use, and any over the counter whitening products you’ve used.

, Even if you’re sure that your dark spots are the result of shaving, you should work with your doctor and dermatologist to rule out other causes. Getting a complete blood count and discussing your patient history will help your dermatologist make an accurate diagnosis.Common causes of dark spots include ingrown hairs, minor and chronic bacterial infections, and hormonal and dietary imbalances. Your dermatologist will help you understand the best steps to take, whether it’s switching up your shaving routine or changing your diet.
Be sure to discuss any existing medical conditions, as they’ll help your dermatologist choose the best course of action.

, Your dermatologist might prescribe a cream containing either hydroquinone, mequinol, or a retinoid. The type of prescription and its concentration will depend on your skin type.These medications are often classified by insurance providers as cosmetic, so they may not be covered. Without insurance, they can cost from $100-$200 (U.S.). Ask your dermatologist about generic options and confirm your coverage options with your insurer to avoid overpaying.

, Some over the counter treatments contain hydroquinone or retinol, but you should only use them after talking to your doctor or dermatologist. In particular, you should avoid over the counter medications that contain a concentration of hydroquinone higher than 2 percent.Non-prescription, high-concentration hydroquinones are associated with a number of adverse side effects.

Clean the razor after each use.,
Dry your razor thoroughly after each use.,
Store the razor in a dry place.",How to Make Razor Blades Last Longer1," Salt from your skin will corrode your razor blade, causing it to dull faster. Don't stop at simply rinsing the blade, give it a good scrubbing. Using an old toothbrush, simply scrub across the blade a few times to clean away any leftover skin and hair, before rinsing it in water again.;
, The quickest way to wear a razor blade is to let it rust. When water causes the metal blade to oxidize, tiny particles of rust form on it. You may not be able to see them, but those particles corrode the blade, dulling it.


Pat the razor dry on a towel to remove loose water droplets. Be sure you don't wipe it with the towel, because the blade will likely catch on the threads, dulling the blade.Dip the razor into a dish of rubbing alcohol. The alcohol will cause any remaining water to evaporate when it hits the air. As an added bonus, it also sanitizes the blade., You will defeat the purpose of drying your razor if you then stick it back in the humid shower or next to the sink where it will be splashed with water. Store the razor in a dry location away from either possibility or keep it in a resealable plastic bag. You can even set it in a cup with leftover beads of silicon gel - the kind that come in those little square packages - in the bottom or store it in your freezer between uses.

Experiment with depilatory creams.,
Invest in an electric epilator.,
If you're serious, consider laser hair removal.",How to Get Smooth Legs," Make sure the shower (or bath) is warm to open pores, which will give you a closer shave. Avoid using hot water, which can dry out your skin and increase risks of razor burn. Take your usual shower, or bath, to allow the leg hair to soften.


You want to give your legs a solid 5 minutes or so taking in the hydration. So go about your routine, shampooing, conditioning, and hit your legs last. And if your shower doesn't have a nice ledge to prop your foot on, hop out of the shower and start shaving while your legs are still wet.;
, Use a loofah and an exfoliating cream to remove dead skin cells and align your hairs. This is very important; exfoliating reduces your likelihood of getting ingrown hairs. It will help your skin be clear and your leg hairs will be as exposed as possible for a close shave.








You can use an exfoliating body wash or, if you're feeling crafty, you could make your own sugar scrub! Just scrub it on, taking your time, wherever you want to shave and rinse it off.

, Squirt a nice, plump dollop into your hand and lather up on your legs as if it were shampoo. Be sure to cover every spot, including down to the ankle. Create a light layer over your leg; too thick a layer can clog your razor.









If you don't have shaving cream, you can always use soap, conditioner, shampoo, body wash, or shower gel. However, do note that shaving cream is best -- especially the moisturizing kind with aloe or jojoba.Gels are great for reducing cuts and nicks, but lotions take the crown when it comes to hydrating.The only time you should not be using shaving cream is if it comes built-in on your razor. Otherwise you have to, have to, have to use some type of protection for your skin against the blade.

, Most run-of-the-mill razors are good for about 5 times, depending on how well you take care of them. But your best shave will be when the razor is brand spanking new.









Shave up your legs, against the grain for a close shave. For a shave that has minimal risk of bumps and burn, shave with the grain. And you're best off taking short strokes -- the razor becomes more ineffective as the strokes get longer.Rinse the razor under a stream of water after each stroke. Be sure to tackle around the ankles and knees, adding extra shaving cream as necessary on these tricky spots.

, Cool water will close the pores (keep this is mind for the hair on your head, too!). Pat your legs dry, taking care not to rub them vigorously.









Take the time now to inspect your legs. If there's a place you missed, you can go back and do it now. The worst is finding a patch when you're already out and about!

, Use a thick moisturizer, such as body butter, if you have particularly dry skin. Rub in a generous amount, concentrating on the ankles and knees once again to keep them supple. This stage should also not be skipped -- you just took a blade to your legs, for Pete's sake! Give them back some moisture by rubbing on some lotion.








, While it hurts a lot more than shaving (unless you cut yourself badly, of course), the results last much, much longer. You'll have smooth legs for weeks -- none of this one or two day crap you get with shaving.If you find shaving to be a drag, waxing may be your best bet.


And good news! Many women say it gets less and less painful each time you do it. So bite the bullet now -- it'll pay off later.
Don't want to break the bank! Make your own at-home sugar wax and do it yourself!

, Technology is getting better and better and, thankfully, depilatory creams are, too. It used to be that they reeked like roadkill in a broken refrigerator and didn't really work, anyway. Now there are creams that smell like a field of daisies and can get your legs hairless down to the root. And it's much cheaper than getting a wax at a salon!


If you have sensitive skin, this probably isn't the way to go. There are harsh chemicals that eat away at your hairs -- obviously not the best route for skin that's delicate.

, They're a little expensive and a little painful, but it's a possible alternative. Electric epilators are devices that yank out the hairs from the root in groups, like a large, super-effective pair of tweezers. And because the hair is being taken out at the root, your legs are smoother for a lot longer than they would be if you just shaved.

, If none of these options trips your trigger and you've got a wad of cash you need to get rid of, why not do laser hair removal? Sometimes it's painful and usually more than one round under the beam is necessary, but imagine never having to worry about shaving again. Bliss!


Sometimes it's not always permanent -- you may have to go back for fix-ups, kind of like taking your car to the mechanic. While this method sounds almost magical, there are definite drawbacks that need to be considered before taking action.Talk to your dermatologist beforehand.

Prevent your razor blade from rusting by coating it in oil.,
Pour some oil on a rag or cotton ball and wipe it across your razor blade.,
Soak the razor in a bath of oil.,
Store the razor in oil.",How to Make Razor Blades Last Longer2," Even oxygen in the air can lead to rust on your razor blade. Coating it in oil will provide a barrier between the metal blade and the surrounding air. Choose from a variety of household oils, including olive oil, baby oil, vegetable oil or mineral oil., Ensure the blade is completely coated. Don't rub the film off or it will defeat the exercise.

, If you prefer, you can also pour some of your chosen oil into a small saucer. After you're sure the blade is completely coated, just remove the razor and set it down to dry on a paper towel.

Sharpen your razor blades in between uses.,
Push the razor along a denim surface such as blue jeans for 10 or 20 strokes in the reverse direction that you shave.,
Rub the blade across your forearm.",How to Make Razor Blades Last Longer3," You can make you blades last even longer with a quick sharpening. While you can't use a traditional sharpening tool on most modern razor blades, you can easily buff them with simple materials such as denim or even skin.

, The cross-fibers of the jeans do a bang-up job of both drying and sharpening the blades, keeping them pristine., Instead of using denim, you can actually sharpen your razor by rubbing it across your own forearm. Any time the blade begins to feel dull, as if it will soon need to be replaced, push it across your forearm, from wrist to elbow about 20 times. Make sure you push the blade in the opposite direction of how you would use it to shave."

Try using a non-comedogenic oil.,
Wash your skin with a soft bristled toothbrush or a soft washcloth.,
Dry off your skin with a cotton towel.",How to Get Rid of Ingrown Pimples1," Dermatologists recommend using gentle cleansers to wash your skin. Gentle cleansers are less likely to cause irritation, which is important because irritated ingrown pimples may seem bigger and more obvious. If you think your ingrown hair is caused by bacteria, however, you will want to use an antibacterial soap.


Look for a product that is labeled as “non-comedogenic.” Non-comedogenic means that the product will not clog your pores.
Products containing benzyl peroxide have antibacterial properties and help heal infected follicles. Apply to infected follicle twice daily.;
, There are some oils that are considered non-comedogenic as well. You can use these oils to cleanse your skin. You can find many of these oils in the beauty section of well-stocked grocery stores and health food stores. Some good choices include:Argan oil
Hemp seed oil
Sunflower oil
Shea butter
Safflower oil

Prevent infection and further irritation.",How to Get Rid of Shaving Rash1," Wrap an ice pack or ice cubes in a clean cloth and place them on the affected area as soon as you notice a rash developing. The cold temperature will reduce immediate swelling and redness, and might help reduce discomfort. Avoid rubbing the cloth along your skin. Instead, gently pat your irritated skin if the surface area is larger than your cold compress.You can also make a cold compress by soaking a towel in very cold water, or putting a wet towel in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes (before it has time to freeze solid).;
, To soothe the first signs of discomfort, irritation, and pain due to shaving rash, apply a thin coat of petroleum jelly. It will keep your skin hydrated, preventing further irritation, and relieve itchiness. Apply a coat to protect your skin, and repeat after a few hours or if the area has started to dry out., Try easing immediate discomfort and inflammation by crushing a couple aspirin in a few drops of water, and mixing it well to make a paste. Apply the paste to the irritated area for up to 10 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water. Repeat regularly up to three times a day if you continue to experience symptoms.If you have dry or sensitive skin, leave the paste on for a shorter period of time to avoid irritation.
Avoid using aspirin on your skin if you're allergic to it or any of its ingredients or experience problems with bleeding, such as the inability to form blood clots. Consult your doctor if you have any questions about any sensitivities to aspirin.

, You can purchase hydrocortisone from any convenience or grocery store. Dab a small amount onto your fingertip or cotton swab, and gently spread it onto the affected area so your skin absorbs it. Use it according to directions on its package, and avoid applying it to open wounds., Apply an antibacterial or antiseptic agent, like an antibacterial gel or an alternative such as witch hazel. Use the product according to its instructions to cut down on bacteria and help heal the rash more quickly. If no other antibacterial products are available, consider dabbing the area with a cotton ball dipped in alcohol.While rubbing alcohol and alcohol-based products will kill germs, they will also dry out your skin and may cause stinging upon application.

It is best to try to clear up the ingrown hair by keeping it clean before you try using a needle to remove it. If the ingrown hair is on your face, you risk scarring and disfigurement.
If you aren't comfortable doing this yourself, you can ask your doctor to remove the ingrown hair for you., Dead skin cells can build up over an ingrown pimple and cause the skin to look thicker and darker. Retinoids can get rid of dead skin cells, which may make ingrown pimples go away faster. Retinoids are available by prescription only, so ask your doctor if you are interested in trying them., Ingrown pimples can become red and inflamed, which may make them more noticeable. Using a steroid cream will not get rid of ingrown pimples, but a steroid cream can reduce redness and swelling. As a result, your ingrown pimples may blend in with the rest of your skin a little better., Because ingrown pimples are prone to infection, antibiotic ointments may help to control infections. If you develop a severe infection from an ingrown pimple, then your doctor may prescribe an oral antibiotic.Make sure that you follow your doctor’s instructions for using antibiotic creams and pills.

, Most ingrown hairs will go away on their own and your doctor may advise you to just leave it alone.If the ingrown pimple bothers you, then you can cover it with a loose band-aid until it heals.

Avoid using alcohol-based products as they will dry out your skin, causing further irritation.

, Consider using tea tree oil either on its own or blended with a skin product. Apply enough oil to saturate the the area you shaved immediately after hair removal. You can also add several drops of tea tree oil to the moisturizer or balm you use after shaving. Some people are sensitive to tea tree oil, so you might want to dilute it before applying. Mix a half teaspoon of it with three tablespoons of olive oil. Diluting with essential oils is not recommended., Rub a small amount of coconut oil onto your irritated skin.

Your skin needs a couple days to recover from the shaving process. Whether it’s removing facial or body hair that causes your skin irritation, give your skin a break when possible and use moisturizing and exfoliating products in between shaves.Do your best not to shave skin that’s already irritated: more shaving will make razor burn worse.If you are required to be clean shaven or your hair grows too fast for you to comfortably go without shaving for more than a day, consider using an electric razor, which is easier on your skin. Make sure any electric razor has new, well-oiled blades for the least irritation. , Shaving during or after a shower is preferable, but if you’re not showering, wash your skin with warm water and a mild cleanser before shaving. Use a clean, sharp razor and a shaving cream or gel to lubricate your skin.

Rinse and dry your face.,
Apply aftershave or balm.",How to Get a Close Shave," A quality razor blade means a quality shave. When proper preparation of the skin takes place, you will only need a single blade razor. However, picking a double or triple blade won't hurt your skin and can provide a closer shave.


Many razors have a pivoting head. This allows for the blade to move smoothly over the curves of the skin, helping ensure in a close shave.
A disposable razor can still be an acceptable razor. Though often low quality, a disposable razor will serve you well when used only once or twice.
If you desire a high-quality razor, check that the blade head is of similar weight to the handle by balancing the shaft on your finger. An off balance razor can lead to an unequal shave.
Pay attention to how the handle feels in your hand. If the handle doesn't feel natural to you, there is usually a better option. If the handle is plastic, it may feel too light, and you may overcompensate with additional pressure that can cut your face. A better alternative to plastic is a metal handle, which will feel more hearty and is environmentally-friendly.
Don't be afraid to replace those blades. When you select your razor, purchase extra disposable heads. Replace them often to prevent nicks, and scratches to your face.
To extend the lifespan of any razor, dry it after use. Not only will a damp blade harbour bacteria, but the moisture will damage the blade.;
, Creams are used to protect the skin from the razor blade. Shaving cream comes in varieties such as soaps, lather-ups, gel and foam. You may want to try them all to see what works for you.


Although it is not scientifically studied, many users find gels allow closer and more moisturizing shaves.
Lather-ups and soaps are a more traditional cream and should be used by expert level shavers.
Foams and gels come in a variety of forms that can be chosen based on your skin type and fragrance preference.

, Aftershave is used to reduce skin irritation and close pores. Many types of aftershave or balms are available depending on your skin type. Picking the right aftershave for you can take some experimentation.


If you have naturally dry skin, choose an aftershave in the form of a balm, gel or lotion. These aftershaves are moisturizing and gentle.
If you have naturally oily skin, choose an alcohol or toner based aftershave. These aftershaves remove excess oil but sting on open cuts., Soften the skin by taking a shower or by placing a warm, moist cloth and placing it over the skin. Massage your face in circles slowly to assist in pushing the hair out of the skin.Try steaming your face by hovering your face atop hot water, while your head is covered by a towel. The steam will encourage your pores to open and soften any tough hair. Be careful to avoid getting too close or steaming for several minutes at a time, as it may dry your face out.
Cleansing your face before exfoliation will help remove any dirt or bacteria that has been released from pores. If your face is not cleaned beforehand, the bacteria can be pushed down into nicks and cause ingrown hair or acne.

, Using the circular technique, use an exfoliation cream to lightly scrub your skin. This will prevent dead skin cells from clogging up hair follicles, which causes dreadful ingrown hairs. If you don't own an exfoliating wash, a clean, warm cloth can be used to gently scrub the skin.A gentle rubbing is key, as you do not want to rub your skin raw before shaving.

, Use a small, circular motion to evenly apply a layer of cream. You can use your fingers or a hair brush to apply the cream. Ensure to wash your hands before touching your face. Touching the face with dirty hands can cause acne, especially while your skin is in a fragile post-shave state., Facial hair will grow in different directions on different parts of the face. Try to note the directions before applying your shaving cream. Do not pull your skin taut when shaving as this can cause ingrown hairs.After each stroke, rinse the razor well. This removes any excess shaving cream, dead skin or hair build up from the blades.
Don't press the razor too hard. Remember that the blade does the work, not your muscles.
When shaving under the nose, it is common for hair to grow down towards the tip and outwards. To prevent cuts, tuck your top lip under your teeth. This will pull your skin taut and will allow better exposure in such a small area. Use the razor and do short, small strokes, while working from the outside towards the middle of the lip. Don't be afraid to only use the corner of the blade. Small strokes will allow for more accuracy and closeness.
Use a similar trick for shaving the chin, by pulling your lower lip up around your teeth. This will flatten some curves of the chin. When shaving the chin, use short strokes and try your best for for a slight over-lap. The overlap will catch any missed hairs. Don't be afraid to open your mouth and move your jaw in order to have optimum exposure on your chin.
Hair on the neck will often grow upwards. Use the razor in upward, smooth strokes. Keep in mind the neck can be a very sensitive area, so it is important to shave efficiently.

, If your skin is not overly sensitive, do one last shave gently against the grain of the hair. This will cut the stubble directly at the skin but is to be used with caution, as not all faces can withstand this contact.When shaving against the grain, the hair is cut as close to the skin as possible. This will give the closest shave possible, but will also remove extra skin. While removing some skin is a normal part of the shaving process, this extra step can cause irritation such as bumps, ingrown hairs, or rashes. Hence, this step may be unacceptable on more sensitive parts of your face.

, Use cool water or a gentle facial cleanser to remove any remaining cream or loose hairs off your face. When drying your face, make sure to use a clean towel. Patting your skin dry, rather than rubbing it, prevents the skin from facing further irritation.

, While your face is moist but not wet, squeeze or spray a small amount of your aftershave into your hands. Rub your hands together and gently apply the aftershave to your shaved face and neck.

Choose a good quality epilator.,
Shave your legs one to three days prior to epilating.,
Set aside at least an hour for your first session.,
Take a painkiller an hour before you begin.,
Exfoliate your legs in the shower.,
Decide whether to epilate wet or dry.,
Use the lowest setting first.,
Start on the inside of your lower leg.,
Hold the epilator close to the skin, but don't press down hard.,
Go slowly to make sure you get all the hair.,
Change to a higher setting once you're used to the feeling.,
Moisturize your legs when you're finished.,
Clean your epilator after every use.,
Epilate a few more times over the course of the week.,
Do touchups whenever you want.,
Use your epilator on other parts of the body.",How to Epilate Legs," The quality of your epilator matters. Pick a well-known, well-reviewed brand that you know you can trust. A cheap epilator may not work as well and it may be more painful to use. Since your epilator will last a long time (and you won't have to buy wax and fancy razors) it's worth springing for a good one.


Look for epilators in beauty supply stores. For an even better selection, check online stores. Pick an epilator with plenty of good reviews.
If your epilator is cordless, be sure to charge it completely before you begin. You don't want to be stuck with a job half finished when your epilator dies.;
, Epilators work best when your hairs are just a few millimeters long. If your hairs are too long, they can get tangled in the epilator; too short, and there's not enough for the spinning heads to grab as you work. Shaving a few days beforehand is the best way to ensure that your hairs are all the same length and ready to epilate., Once you get used to the process, you can probably do it in half an hour or so. For the first session, though, you'll want to give yourself plenty of time. The process is definitely slower than shaving, but the results will last much longer.


Many people like to epilate at night. Your legs will be red and a little swollen when you're finished. If you epilate at night, they'll return to normal by morning.
It's best not to epilate the day you have a big event or date, unless you're planning to wear tights or pants. Do it the day before so your legs won't be red and swollen when you go out.

, This is optional, but many find it helps to take an over the counter painkiller (according to the recommended dosage) to take the edge off. Epilating feels a lot like waxing; it hurts at first, but eventually you get used to the feeling and may even come to enjoy it.

, Getting rid of dry skin will prevent ingrown hairs from occurring later. Take a warm shower and exfoliate your skin using a loofah or body scrub. Rub your skin in a circular motion to gently slough away the dead skin.

, Some people like to epilate their legs when they're in the shower, feeling the heat from the shower makes the process less painful. Others prefer to epilate dry, since this allows the epilator to get a firm grasp on the hairs and do its work more effectively.


If this is your first time, you might want to epilate wet to keep your skin moist and warm the whole time. Try epilating in a shallow warm bath (just make sure you don't drop your epilator!). Use shower gel on your legs to help the epilator glide more easily.
If you want to do it dry, make sure your skin is completely dry. The drier your hairs, the better the epilator will be able to grip them; damp hairs will get slippery and sticky, making the process harder. After exfoliating, dry your legs and sprinkle them with baby powder before you begin., Many epilators come with two settings: low and high. When you're first starting out, use the low setting so you can get used to the feeling of epilating. Once you're familiar with the sensation, you can switch to the high setting and speed up the process.

, This is the least sensitive area on your leg, so it's a good place to start so you can get used to the feeling of epilating. Avoid starting near your ankles or right over bones, since these areas are more painful to epilate. Save the most sensitive spots for last, since by then your body will be accustomed to the feeling.

, Pass it lightly over your skin in a circular motion over the area where you want to remove hair. The spinning heads will grasp your hairs and pull them out. It will take about thirty seconds to finish epilating any given area.


Run the epilator against the grain of your hair growth. Check each section of your leg closely to see which direction the hair is growing before you epilate.
To make it easier for the epilator to grasp your hairs, run your hand against the grain of growth to make the hairs stand up.
You will definitely feel a pinch, and your legs may bleed a little. If you need to stop and take a break, there's nothing wrong with that.

, Epilators function best when they're used at a slow pace. Be patient as you epilate each patch of skin, going over it a few times to make sure you get all the hair. If you try to go to fast, you'll miss hair, which defeats the purpose.

, Switching to a higher setting enables you to go slightly faster and pass over each area fewer times. If the initial sting has passed and you're used to the feeling of hair being pulled out, go ahead and switch.

, Use aloe or a moisturizing cream to soothe your legs, which will be red and irritated for several hours. Once the swelling and redness are gone, your legs will be completely smooth and hair-free.


If your legs are very swollen, you can use an ice pack to reduce swelling when you're finished.If any spots are bleeding, clean the area and apply a bandage.

, If you use your epilator wet, you can rinse it under running water. If you use it dry, clean it with rubbing alcohol or use the cleaning kit it came with. This will prevent the epilator from getting clogged, as well as sanitizing it for the next time you use it.

, Hair grows in stages, so you may notice new growth a few days after your first session. Over the course of a week, you'll want to epilate your legs two or even three times to get all of the hair. After that, you'll be able to enjoy smooth legs for several weeks before you have to epilate again., If you see new hair growth come in before you're ready for another full epilating session, it's fine to do a touchup. Use the same process you would during a regular session, and be sure to clean your epilator afterward. After a few months, you'll find that your hair growth slows and touchups are less necessary., Epilators are great for legs, but they can also be used on more sensitive parts of the body. If you enjoy the process and the results you get by epilating your legs, try using your epilator on your arms or your armpits, too.

Gather your ingredients.,
Melt the shea butter and coconut oil.,
Stir in the olive oil.,
Add ten drops of essential oil.,
Chill the mixture in the refrigerator.,
Mix in the baking soda.,
Spoon it into a storage container.",How to Make Your Own Shaving Cream1," This shaving cream is made from natural oils that blend to create a smooth, nourishing shaving cream. Your razor will glide easily across your skin if you use this rich formula. You'll need the following ingredients:2/3 cup shea or cocoa butter
2/3 cup coconut oil
1/2 cup olive oil
10 drops essential oil of your choice
2 tablespoons baking soda
Jar with a lid;
, Both shea butter and coconut oil are solid at room temperature, so it's necessary to melt them in order to blend them properly. Measure out 2/3 cup shea butter and 2/3 cup coconut oil. Place the ingredients in a small saucepan. Melt them over low heat, stirring occasionally until they liquify, then remove the pan from heat.


If you're using coconut butter in place of shea butter, melt it with the coconut oil.
Don't let the ingredients come to a boil; use just enough heat to help them liquify. Boiling the oils will change their texture.

, Use a spoon or whisk to incorporate the olive oil with the melted shea butter and coconut oil.

, Certain essential oils are good for the skin in addition to having fresh scent. Customize your shaving cream to create the perfect scent for you. You can combine essential oils to give the cream even more depth. For strongly scented essential oil, use up to 20 drops.


Lavender, rose, grapefruit, fir, ginger, vetiver, and peppermint essential oils all make wonderful additions to shaving cream.
If you're sensitive to strong smells, add just five drops of oil or leave it out altogether.

, Pour it into a mixing bowl and cover it with plastic wrap. Place the bowl in the refrigerator for an hour or two, until the mixture is thoroughly chilled. The oils will slightly solidify, and the mixture should look pale yellow and waxy at this stage.

, Remove the bowl from the refrigerator, take off the plastic wrap and pour in two tablespoons of baking soda. Using an electric mixer or a hand whisk, beat the mixture until it becomes light, fluffy and creamy.

, A glass mason jar makes a great container for homemade shaving cream. You can use any container you'd like, as long as it has a lid. When you're ready to use it, just slather on a scoop of shaving cream wherever you need it.


Store leftover cream in a dark cabinet out of direct sunlight and heat.
Homemade shaving cream will keep for a month or two. If you want to preserve it for longer, try mixing in the contents of one vitamin E capsule; this acts as a natural preservative.

Melt the shea butter and coconut oil.,
Blend with the aloe vera, baking soda and liquid castile soap.,
Add ten drops of essential oil.,
Pour the mixture into the liquid soap dispenser.",How to Make Your Own Shaving Cream2," This blend contains castile soap, so the shaving cream has a nice foamy lather when you apply it to wet skin. If you like a sudsier cream to use on your face, legs or underarms, this homemade recipe is for you. Here's what you'll need:


1/4 cup coconut oil
2 tablespoons shea or cocoa butter
1/4 cup aloe vera gel
2 teaspoons baking soda
1/4 cup liquid castile soap
10 drops essential oil of your choice
Empty liquid soap dispenser (preferably a foaming dispenser)

, Both shea butter and coconut oil are solid at room temperature, so it's necessary to melt them in order to blend them properly. Measure out 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) shea butter (or cocoa butter) and 1/4 cup coconut oil. Place the ingredients in a small saucepan. Melt them over low heat, stirring occasionally until they liquify, then remove the pan from heat.

, Pour all the ingredients together into a blender. Blend on high for several minutes to fully mix the ingredients together; this will prevent the oil and soap from separating later. The resulting liquid should have the texture of thick liquid soap., Some castile soap comes with a scent, so you can skip this step if your shaving cream already has an aroma. If you want to add your own essential oils, stir in 10 drops of your favorite oil or blend.


You can add up to 20 drops of essential oil if you like a stronger scent.
Try one of these mixtures: rose and vetiver; sandalwood and orange; fir and mint.

, Your shaving cream is now ready to use; just pump some out as you need it. It will foam as you apply it to your face. If the mixture separates in the container, shake well to recombine the oils and soap.

Add extra ingredients if you'd like.,
Store your shaving cream in a squeeze bottle.",How to Make Your Own Shaving Cream3," The point of using shaving cream is to provide a smooth surface that allows your razor to glide easily over your skin and cut through your hair without snagging. You can achieve these results without using a fancy cream; all you really need are oil and a moisturizer. Here's what to get:1 cup oil, such as melted coconut oil, almond oil, or olive oil

Purchase an electric shaver.,
Clean your face.,
Keep your face dry.,
Consider trimming your hair first.,
Clean the shaver.,
Hold the razor at right angles.,
Keep the skin taut with your free hand.,
Start with the sensitive areas first.,
Let the razor cool.",How to Dry Shave1," Electric shavers are all either rotary shavers or foil blades. Rotary shavers have several spinning blades that are usually pivoted so they can adjust to various angles of the skin. Foil blades have a linear blades that move back and forth underneath a flat, perforated steel cover.Models are made for men and women that are designed to perform optimally for gender specific applications. Models that perform best over the flat surfaces of the legs will not work as well on the sharp angles of a face and vice versa.;
, Providing a clean surface will help your shaver perform optimally by removing debris and oils. Using a gentle cleanser prior to shaving will also help to soften the hairs., To get the best results from an electric razor, the hair should be rigid and as a dry as possible.Many dry shave products are designed to stiffen the hairs using alcohol and degreasers., If your hair is longer than .25"" you should consider trimming the hair first. Many shavers come with a trimmer attachment that can be used by flipping a switch on the device.

, Electric shavers are machines, and just like any other machine, they will perform best when they are well-maintained. Always check to be sure there are no remaining hairs in the blades prior to shaving. Rinse the blade for several seconds to clear away any dirt or hair.


You may also want to consider disinfecting the razor with alcohol before starting your shave.
Many shavers come with their own cleaning tools. Be sure to clean them after every usage so that they are ready to go the next time.

, This will create maximum contact between the blades and the skin. It will reduce shaving time and get more of the hairs with each pass over the skin. Foil blade shavers should be moved in long, straight strokes. Rotary shavers will work best when moved in a circular motion.

, Use your thumb and index finger to make your skin taut. This will provide a smooth, even surface to pass the shaver over. An flat surface will trim your hair more evenly.

, Sensitive areas of the face would include areas along the neck where razor burn most likely occurs. Starting here when the razor is still cooler and cleaner will give you a better, smoother shave. As the razor gets hotter and collects more hair particles, it won't perform quite as well and can be harsh on sensitive skin.

, Electric razors tend to get hot with use. Heat can irritate the skin and lead to razor burn. If you notice the razor is beginning to feel hot against your skin, shut it off for a few minutes. Once it cools down, resume your shave.

Consider trimming your hair first.,
Use a new razor.,
Apply your desired product to your face.,
Shave with the grain.,
Pull the skin taut.,
Glide the razor over your face.,
Let your skin rest.",How to Dry Shave2," If you have longer facial hair, it will be very difficult to dry shave. Trim any hair that is long enough with scissors or an electric hair trimmer, then you will have a manageable beard or mustache to dry shave.

, Old razors that are dull require a lot of pressure to cut the hair. This will increase the likelihood that you will get cuts or nicks while dry shaving.


Experiment with razors to find the one that shaves you the best. The moisturizing strips on many disposable razors only work in the presence of water, so they are useless for a dry shave.

, It's best to use just about anything between your skin and the razor, if you can. Water, soap, shampoo, olive oil, lotion, and hair conditioner will all do if you don't have anything that says it's for shaving., When dry shaving the goal isn't to get the closest shave, but simply to remove the hairs as much as possible without causing too much damage to your skin. Going against the grain (shaving the opposite direction that the hair grows) makes for the closest shave, but it also produces the most irritation. To reduce the risk of injury when dry shaving, always shave with the grain instead.

, You don't have to actually stretch the skin. Just use your fingers to create a flat, firm surface for the razor to cut across.


Start with the sensitive areas around the ankles and behind the knees. These areas are more likely to get nicked as the blade gets dull and collects skin and hair in the course of shaving.

, You should not need to press down or apply pressure with the razor. If this is necessary, then the razor is probably not sharp enough. A sharp razor will cut hair cleanly at its base level with the skin. Pressing the blade down may cut the hair at a slightly lower spot, but it will also bring the blade in contact with the sensitive skin that surrounds the other side of the follicle. Accept that a dry shave will probably not be as close as a wet shave.


Grip the razor handle at the very bottom with your fingertips, to apply the least pressure possible to your skin. More leverage means more likelihood of the blade cutting flesh, instead of hair.

, Don't rub with a towel, as that can irritate the freshly shaved skin. If you have a moisturizer, apply it to your skin. This will help to reduce any redness or irritation to your skin.

Acquire a new razor.,
Keep your skin taut.,
Shave with the grain.",How to Dry Shave3," Dull razors will force you to bear down harder to get a close shave. This can result in more nicks or cuts. New razors come pre-lubricated and will give you the best results.Select a razor with one or two blades max. More blades will pull hair and cut below the skin. This can lead to ingrown hairs or razor burn. A single-blade razor won't clog up as quickly as a razor with 2 or more blades.

, Use the hand that isn't holding the razor to stretch the skin slightly. Spread your thumb and index finger far apart and apply slight pressure to skin to make the skin into a smoother flatter surface. This will make it easier to apply the appropriate amount of force with the razor.

, Gently press the blade to your skin and glide it in the same direction that the hair grows. Use light, long strokes.


Shaving against the grain will likely result in painful razor burn that appears as bumpy, irritated skin.
Shaving with the grain will not be as close as it would with going against the grain, however you will be less likely to damage the skin.

"
Clean your razor.,
Splash your skin with cool water.,
Apply an aftershave to your face if desired.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Dry Shave4," Rinse the razor u/nder water to clean out any remaining hairs from between the blades. Tap the razor against the sink or tub wall to help dislodge hairs as well. Cleaning a reusable razor will prolong the life of the blade.


If you used a disposable razor you can simply throw it away.
Consider dipping the razor in rubbing alcohol to help dry out the blade and prevent rust from forming.

, Cup your hands under the faucet to catch some cold water, then splash it against your skin. Do this for 30-40 seconds. Cooling the skin down with water will help to close your pores and soothe the skin. If you have any nicks, the cool water will help stop the bleeding.

, If you shaved your face, you can apply an aftershave to tone the skin or moisturize it. Aftershaves are either made with a base of alcohol or witch hazel oil. Alcohol will add more tone to the skin, but can also dry skin out. Witch hazel is better at moisturizing the skin, but does not add as much tone as aftershave.

, Shaving can be rough on your skin, you can even lose some of your skin in the process. Keep your skin looking and feeling healthy by treating it with some non-alcohol and fragrant-free moisturizers.Simply place a dollop on your hands, then massage the lotion gently into your skin.

Gather the required items.You will need sea salt, white vinegar and an old toothbrush.,
Rinse the razor blade well with water.,
Fill a small bowl with white vinegar.Drop the razor blade into the bowl and allow it to soak in the vinegar for at least 30 seconds.,
Make a paste with the sea salt and vinegar.While the razor blade is soaking in the vinegar, dump a spoonful of sea salt into another small bowl.,
Load the toothbrush with the paste and scrub the blade well.Remove the razor blade from the bowl of vinegar.,
Rinse the blade clean with water.Use a clean towel to gently blot away the bigger chunks of paste.,
Blot the blade dry with a soft towel.",How to Clean a Rusty Razor Blade1," The acidity of the white vinegar will help to remove the rust from your razor blade. The sea salt will act as an abrasive ingredient that aids the vinegar in removing the rust.


Regular table salt is fine to use, as well, but the sea salt provides a little more grit for the scrubbing.
Have a few soft, clean towels on hand, along with rubbing alcohol and a few cotton balls for sterilization.;
, You don’t need to use soap, bleach or any other cleaners for this. Never use harsh chemicals. Simply rinse the razor blade with plain water straight from the tap. The temperature of the water doesn’t matter.


If you’re cleaning a shaving razor, be sure to turn it upside down and allow the water to run through the slots between the blades.

, You can leave it in the vinegar several minutes if you like, especially if you are dealing with very stubborn rust.


Make sure you’ve used enough vinegar so that the razor blade is completely submerged in it.

, Pour a small amount of vinegar over it. Use a spoon to mix the two substances together until a thick paste forms.

, Dip the toothbrush into the paste, making sure to load the bristles with plenty of it. Scrub the blade thoroughly. Reload the brush with more paste if necessary.

, Then run the blade under the tap, rinsing it clean of any remaining paste. Inspect the razor closely to make sure the rust is gone.


Don’t leave any rust behind, since it can spread.
Repeat the steps if any rust is stubbornly remaining behind.

, Once your blade is rust-free, gently blot it on a towel to remove any moisture, which is one of the major causes of rust forming in the first place. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade. This will accelerate the drying of any residual moisture and sterilize it for future use.


Leave the blade to air dry on a clean towel.
Store the blade away from moisture. If possible, store it somewhere other than the steam and humidity of the bathroom.Always blot the blade dry after using it.

Prepare your underarms.,
Wrap yourself up in an old towel.,
Powder your underarms.,
Heat up body wax.",How to Wax Your Armpits1," You can wax your armpits without making a lot of preparations, but if you take these easy measures the experience will be less painful and more effective:


Clean your underarms thoroughly. Wash them with soap or a good body wash, and scrub them a little to exfoliate the skin.If you use hot water, the hairs and surrounding skin will soften, making the hairs easier to remove.
Trim the hair. If the hair under your arms is longer than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm), you should trim it with a pair of barber or nail scissors until it's 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) long. This makes the waxing process less painful.;
, The wax is bound to spill and create a mess when you try to do it yourself, so it's best to be either naked or wrapped in something you don't mind getting sticky with wax.

, Any talcum powder would do. Take a big sponge and spread the talc over the area, making sure to remove the excess powder.








, Make sure you use wax that is intended to be used to remove leg and body hair, rather than wax intended for use on the face. Follow the instructions on the package and heat the wax in the microwave or in a wax heater. It's ready to use when it's completely melted and runny.


If this is your first time waxing, do a test on the back of your hand, where your skin is less sensitive, to make sure the wax isn't too hot.
Body wax kits are available at drugstores and beauty supply stores.
You can make your own sugar-based body wax using the following recipe: mix 2 cups of sugar with 1/4 cup water and 1/4 cup lemon juice. Heat the mixture over low heat on the stove until the sugar dissolves and becomes a sticky syrup. The mixture is now ready to use.

Gather the necessary items.You will need sea salt, one lemon and an old toothbrush.,
Rinse the razor blade with plain tap water.,
Cut the lemon in half.Take one of the lemon halves and squeeze its juice into a small bowl.,
Sprinkle sea salt liberally on the other lemon half.Make sure you sprinkle it on the fleshy side of the lemon, not the rind.,
Blot and rinse the blade with water.Use a clean towel to gently blot away most of the lemon pulp and sea salt.,
Use a soft towel to blot the blade dry.",How to Clean a Rusty Razor Blade2," You’ll want to have a few clean, soft towels on hand, along with some rubbing alcohol and a handful of cotton balls. You’ll use these items at the end to sterilize your blade.

, There is no need to use soap or cleaning products for this. Running it under plain tap water is all you need to do. Make sure that you rinse the blade very well, getting into any nooks and crannies.

, Drop the razor blade into the bowl and allow it to soak for a minimum of 30 seconds. You can leave it in the juice for several minutes, if you like.


Make sure there’s enough juice in the bowl so that the blade is totally submerged in it.

, After doing so, you can use the lemon half to scrub directly on the razor blade. The acid in the juice, coupled with the grit of the sea salt, will work to clean the rust from the blade.

, Run the blade under the tap to rinse it clean of any remaining pulp and salt. Examine the blade for any rust spots that haven’t been cleared up.


Repeat the steps if any of the rust is stubbornly remaining behind.
Rust can spread, so make sure to get it all.

, After you’ve removed all of the rust from the blade, gently blot it on a clean towel to get rid of any residual moisture, which is one of the main culprits of rust formation. Soak a cotton ball in rubbing alcohol and wipe the blade to sterilize it. Allow the blade to air dry on a towel.


Once it’s completely dry, store the blade away from moisture, either outside the bathroom or in a small ziplock bag.Always blot the blade dry with a clean towel after you use it.

Rinse your razor blade well after every use.,
Dry your blade thoroughly.,
Store your blade outside of the bathroom.,
Use mineral oil and rubbing alcohol on the blade.",How to Clean a Rusty Razor Blade3," It’s best to rinse it under hot water after one or two swipes to keep the blades clear of clogged hair. After you’ve finished shaving, hold the blade underneath a stream of hot water for 5-10 seconds.


If you still see clogged hair between the blades, turn it at a 45 degree angle and rinse it for a few more seconds., Moisture left behind on the metal will oxidize, leading to rust formation. The corrosion will also make your blade dull, requiring you to replace it more quickly.Make sure you dry it very well after each use. You can use a soft towel to gently blot – not wipe – it dry. Take care not to cut yourself.


You can also give your blade a quick blast with a blow dryer to remove moisture.About 10 seconds under the blow dryer should do the trick.

, The steam and humidity of the bathroom will accelerate rust formation on your razor blades. If possible, store them somewhere other than in the bathroom. Keeping them in a small ziplock bag will also suffice., After each use, dip the razor in rubbing alcohol. This will accelerate drying and sterilize the blade. If you are acne-prone, sterilization will help to prevent it. Then dip it in mineral oil, which will enhance the performance of your blade, protect it from the elements and make it last longer."

Exfoliate your skin.,
Reduce the chances of skin sensitivity.,
Wax in a warm environment.",How to Use Hair Removing Wax1," Whether you are using a premade wax strip, or if you are using hot wax that you heat up, you should exfoliate your skin about a day before you plan to wax.


Use a loofah or scrub to get rid of dead skin so the wax can grip the hairs better. Then, wash the area with a regular soap and water, and make sure it is completely dry.After cleansing your skin, sprinkle a bit of baby powder to the area about to be waxed. It'll absorb any excess moisture so the wax and cloth strip can adhere properly.
Waxing can be done on the upper lips, under arms, arms, legs, stomach, back, and bikini line.Any lotions or makeup on the skin may prevent the wax from removing the hair.;
, There are some simple tips that might make the waxing process less painful for you. You might want to explore more options for hair removal than waxing, too.If you have sensitive skin, you can take an ibuprofen half an hour before you begin. Be prepared to spend about an hour waxing as this is not something you want to rush.
If you menstruate, try not to wax right before or during your period; your skin may be much more sensitive, and it could be significantly more painful.

, A good choice would be to do the waxing in your bathroom after a shower.


If you wax in a cold environment, it’s going to be a more painful process. Warm air helps your follicles stay open, and the hair will slide out more easily. This applies to plucking your eyebrows, too!
Go several days without shaving the area you want to wax; you will have best results when the hair is at least 1/4 inch long.

Use a waxing stick to apply wax to your armpit.,
Apply a wax strip.,
Remove the strip.",How to Wax Your Armpits2," Load it with a good amount of hot wax, then swipe it on your armpit in the direction of your hair growth. Continue swiping, always in the same direction, until all of the hair is covered with wax.









Some people have hair that grows in more than one direction. If this is the case with you, you'll have to wax your armpit one section at a time.
Do not swipe the wax in the opposite direction. Your hair stands to get tangled up and won't pull out cleanly.

, Take one of the paper wax strips that came with your kit. Place it over the area with the wax and swipe it once with your hand, in the direction of your hair growth, to position it in place.









If you made your own sugar wax, use a clean piece of cotton cloth as a wax strip.
Leave the edge of the strip free of the wax, so you can grasp it to pull it off.
If you can't cover all of the wax with one strip, work one at a time.

, Grasp the strip by the free edge and pull quickly against the direction of your hair growth. The strip, wax, and hair should come right off. Repeat the process with the other armpit.









If the wax and hair don't come off, you'll have to try again. Use a fresh wax strip.
If the process is too painful, remove the wax with olive oil and warm water, and plan to shave instead of waxing.

Examine your armpits in the mirror.,
Remove excess wax with oil.,
Clean the area.",How to Wax Your Armpits3," If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.

, Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.








, Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging.









If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided.
Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.

Mix your ingredients.,
Heat your mixture.,
Let it cool down before using.,
Check the texture while you wait.",How to Wax With Honey1," In a pot or microwave-safe dish, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) honey. Add 1 cup (200 g) of white sugar, then 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. Stir to combine evenly.The texture will appear grainy when first mixed.;
, If you’re using the stovetop, turn the burner to low or medium heat and stir periodically as the mixture heats up. If you’re using a microwave, nuke it for 10 to 30 seconds. Then remove the dish, stir the mixture, and repeat as needed, for a combined cooking time of roughly a minute, depending on your microwave’s strength. In either case, remove the mixture from before it comes to a boil or starts to cook.If using a high setting on a microwave, stick to 10-second bursts in between stirring so you don’t overheat it.
Use a food thermometer to check its temperature. The mixture shouldn’t rise over 110 degrees Fahrenheit (43 degrees Celsius).

, Even though you didn’t bring your mixture to a boil, keep in mind that it’s still pretty hot. Give it a chance to cool down to the point that it’s still warm, but safe to touch. Give it 15 or 20 minutes at least before testing with your finger.Once that feels fine, apply a very small dab to the area that you’re going to wax to test it, just in case it’s more sensitive.
If you’d like, stir in a few drops of your favorite scented oil as it cools for a more fragrant wax.

, Give your mixture a stir with your spoon. The grainy texture should have thickened and grown smooth during heating. If it seems liquidy, stir in another tablespoon of sugar and return it to heat.Remember: since it’s already hot, it shouldn’t take very long for the extra sugar to melt and combine with the honey, so don’t overdo it.

Buy an at-home waxing kit.,
Clean the exterior surface of your ears.,
Apply a pre-epilation powder.,
Warm up the wax.,
Apply the wax to the inner lobe.,
Put the wax on your outer ears.,
Place the strips onto the edges of your ears.,
Pull the strips or wax away with a quick and clean motion.,
Repeat this procedure on the other ear.,
Clean your ears with warm water.,
Close the pores with cool water.,
Apply aloe vera to the waxed area.",How to Wax Ear Hairs," Purchase a wax that is designed to be used on sensitive areas. You can use heated or non-heated wax. Non-heated wax removal products often come with the wax already on a strip, which can provide a more precise application of wax on ear hairs. Heated wax is the most common method of waxing. Heated wax can reach too high a temperature and possibly burn the sensitive skin around the edge of your ear, so exercise caution when using heated wax.Many waxing kits will have artificial colors and fragrances, along with ingredients like tea tree oil and chocolate. Keep this in mind if you have any allergies. Always check the label.;
, Wash your ears carefully with a cloth and warm water. The wax and application cloths will not adhere as well to dirty ears. Let your ears dry completely before moving on to the next step., You can find a pre-epilation powder online or at a beauty supply store. A pre-epilation powder helps the skin absorb natural oils and moisture. This allows the skin to be in the best condition possible for waxing. Apply the powder to the parts of the ear you will be waxing.You can also use baby powder as pre-epilation powder.

, You should first read the instructions that came with your waxing kit. Most at-home waxes can be warmed up in the microwave. If the wax came in a jar, remove the cap and heat it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds. If the wax came in solid block, cut up a few 1-inch (2.5 cm) chunks and put it in the microwave for 20-30 seconds.

Test the wax on a small area of skin before use to make sure it’s not too hot.
Some waxes take a shorter or longer amount of time to heat up.

, It’s best to start with the most sensitive area first. Use the application stick to apply the wax to this section of the ear. Continue to apply it until you have a nice, solid buildup of wax. You can then leave it on or apply paper or cloth strips on top of the wax.If you’re using non-heated wax, you will usually just need to apply the strips directly on top of the ear hair.

, Apply the wax to the rest of your ears that you want to be waxed, including the inner lobes. Again, apply it with the application stick until you have a solid buildup. Use the wax sparingly, since ear hairs tend to be fine and not deeply rooted.If you do use a heated wax, make sure it has cooled off somewhat before applying it to the outer edges of your ears.

, If you don’t have strips, you can move on to the next step. If you do have cloth or paper strips, press the strips firmly into the wax. Smooth out any creases or edges that are not in contact with your skin. Keep the strips long and thin to conform to the shape of your outer ear., If you have strips, quickly pull it away in one motion soon after the application of the wax. If you aren’t using strips, dig your nail up under the wax once it is completely dry. Then, pull it off quickly once it has started to lift from digging your fingernails under it.You will experience some pain while doing this, depending upon the amount of hair that is removed with each pass.

, Move on to the other ear once you’ve finished waxing the first ear. You may have some spots that weren’t waxed properly, so go back and reapply the wax to those areas. If you’re using strips, you may be able to reapply the same strip two or three times in rapid succession, depending upon the amount of wax you use.Keep in mind that your ears will be sensitive after the first application, so you might want to wait before reapplying wax.

, Wet a soft cloth with warm water. Apply it to the areas you have waxed. The warm water should remove the leftover wax., After you’ve cleaned your ears, use cool water to close the skin pores and hair follicles. The cold water will also soothe the skin., Vitamin E, tea tree oil, grapeseed oil, and 1% hydrocortisone cream will also work to soothe the skin. Apply whichever product you have to the sensitive areas and rub it in. This will help to reduce irritation."

Consider buying honey wax/sugar wax/some kind of waxing-related hardening liquid.,
If you buy some wax, other than make it, most come with big cuttable cloth pieces.,
Get those ""Popsicle-stick"" like sticks that doctors use to check out your tonsils.,
Now that you have your supplies, consider having someone do it for you.,
Apply wax with ""Popsicle-stick"", or something you have chosen, and cut up a half-inch wide cloth piece, and make it about as long as ONE SIDE of your lip.

,
Apply cloth, and rub it in well, and wait for about 10 seconds, rubbing in as hard as you can without hurting yourself.

,
Know that the element of surprise is NOT needed here.

, This is for taking off the said hair.

, They work fantastically for applying wax.

, If it's too embarrassing, get a big plane mirror that you can have close to you, without having to hold it. You could sit it on your sink in the bathroom, or if you have one in your room, that works great!

Gather ingredients to create the wax.,
Combine honey, water, salt, and flour into a small, microwaveable mixing bowl.,
Stir the mixture till it is blended well.,
Heat the mixture in the microwave for 20-30 seconds.,
Let the wax sit for 10 minutes.",How to Wax Eyebrows at Home (Honey and Salt Method)1," This recipe is convenient because these ingredients can be found in every kitchen. You will only need some honey, salt, flour and water., You can use equal parts honey, flour, water and salt. Since you are only waxing your eyebrows, you shouldn't need more than 2 or 3 tablespoons of each.

, The yellowish fluid will likely seem too watery. Once the mixture is heated it will thicken quite a bit.

, Monitor the mixture as it will begin to boil up when it is ready.Remove the wax from the microwave.


Be careful, the wax will be hot.

, This will allow the mixture to cool so you do not burn your skin. The mixture will also thicken as it cools giving you a thick, sticky wax.

Warm the strip by rubbing it between your hands for several seconds.,
Apply the strip to the area to be waxed, and quickly smooth it down in the direction of hair growth.,
Hold the skin taut at the bottom of the strip, and quickly rip the strip against the direction of hair growth.",How to Use Hair Removing Wax2," Rewarm strips as necessary, and discard these when they are no longer effective.Next, slowly separate the layers, exposing the wax. The benefit of wax strips is that they don’t require you to heat up the wax.
The downside is that some people consider them more painful than hot wax because the wax remains cold.
Choose the right wax strips. If you are using pre-coated wax strips, make sure you are using the correct kind for the area you are waxing. You don't want to use a leg waxing strip on your bikini line or on your face.

, Put the strip wax side down.


For example, a wax strip applied on the legs should be applied with pressure moving downwards because leg hair grows downwards.
You want to press firmly on the strip, until the wax cools against the skin. This should just take a few seconds.

, Be sure to keep the strip as close to the skin as possible while removing it.


Don't wax the same place twice. Ripping the strip against the direction of hair growth pulls the hair from the root, ensuring thinner hair growth. The waxed region should remain hair free for about 2 weeks.
Keep the skin taut as the discomfort subsides. Any wax left over can easily be washed off later. Remove excess wax from the skin with baby oil. Some people develop rashes once waxed.

Warm the wax.,
Dip the applicator into the warm wax.,
Apply the fabric over the wax in the direction of hair growth, leaving enough free fabric at the end to grasp the strip firmly.",How to Use Hair Removing Wax3," If you are using soft wax in a pot, depending on the kind you use, you may need a wax pot to warm it, or you can simply warm it in the microwave. For a full jar, heat it about 15 to 20 seconds. For a half jar, heat for about 10 seconds. The consistency of the contents should be a little thicker than maple syrup.Make sure to follow microwaving directions to the letter to prevent the wax from getting too hot and burning your skin. Make sure it's not too hot, as it can burn you.If you have the tub of wax, you would need to get yourself some wax paper (which you can find at pretty much any grocery or dollar store), and a popsicle stick or two, preferably the thicker variety.You will also need muslin or other fabric strips to use with the wax. Always test your wax by applying a bit to the inside of your wrist to make sure it's at a comfortable spreading temperature. Too cold and it won’t spread; too hot, and you'll burn yourself.
Be sure to follow the instructions carefully, heating and stirring at intervals to avoid boiling the wax, as overheating can cause it to break down and not work as well for future uses.

, This usually comes with the wax kit. It looks like a tongue depressor. Or you could use a popsicle stick to spread some of the now warm and liquid wax on your body part of choice.


Apply a thin layer to the skin in the same direction of the hair growth. Quickly apply the cloth strip, and smooth down in the direction of the hair growth; you should have these ready so that the wax doesn't harden on your skin while you are fishing around for your strips.
The wax shouldn't be too thin or too thick, but the more the hair, the more wax you should use. The more wax you use, the more painful the process can be, though.

, Smooth the strip down with one hand. Pull the skin taut and quickly rip off the strip. You want to rip it off in the opposite direction of the hair growth.


You may immediately apply pressure to the skin with your hand to help soothe the nerve endings. Use another cloth strip to remove any leftover wax from the skin.
Don't go slow, as that's one of the worst things you can do. Brace yourself and yank fast.
If the hair does not come off, possible reasons include short hair (too short for waxing); too hot wax; or wax pulled in the wrong direction; not enough wax applied

Spread the wax.,
Apply your fabric.,
Strip the fabric from your skin.,
Repeat if necessary, then clean up.",How to Wax With Honey2," Use a butter knife or similar tool, like popsicle sticks or a spatula. Add just enough wax to lightly cover the target area. As you do, spread the wax down in the direction that your hair grows. For example, with your calf, spread it from your knee down to your ankle, not the other way.With each application, apply it in a fast, clean motion in order to spread it as thinly as possible. Dragging it too slowly over your skin may result in thicker deposits, which will be tougher to remove.This may take some practice, so consider making an extra batch just in case you mess up.

, Use cotton muslin strips of an appropriate size for the area you’re waxing, or slightly larger. Set it over the wax, with at least a couple inches (about 5 cm) remaining clear of the wax at one end, so you have a tab that’s easy to pull. Then gently rub the portion that’s stuck to the wax in the same direction that your hair grows, without pressing directly down into your flesh. Do this two or three times.Alternately, you can cut up an old t-shirt or other cloth and use strips of that. If you do, just make sure the material isn’t too stretchy. You want something nice and firm for easy removal.
The free end should be in the direction of your hair growth. For example, with your calf, it should be pointing toward your ankle, not your knee.

, With one hand, use your fingers to pull the surrounding skin away from the fabric, so it’s nice and taut. Then, with the other, take the fabric’s free end in between your fingertips. Quickly pull the fabric free of your skin in the opposite direction that your hair grows.For example, with your calf, you should pull the strip up toward your knee.
As you do, try to keep as straight as possible. Avoid pulling it off at an angle that’s different from the one in which it was applied.
Tear it off like a bandaid, in one quick, clean motion.

, Apply more wax and strips as needed to wax all of the intended area. Depending on how large an area you’re waxing, reheat the mixture if it cools off or hardens to the point that you can’t spread it easily. Once you’re done, wash your skin with warm to hot water.If needed, apply more wax to the same area and use a second strip. After that, use a tweezer to pluck any remaining hairs. Your skin will probably be too sensitive for a third waxing.Use soap if you want when washing, but it isn’t necessary. All you need is warm water, so stick with that if you used scented oil and want the smell to last.If your skin feels dried out afterward, apply baby oil after washing to rehydrate it.The fabric can also be cleaned with hot water, so you can use them again..

"
"
Wash and dry your skin beforehand.,
Grow your hair out first.,
Plan to wax often in the beginning.",How to Wax With Honey3," Use soap and water to remove any dirt, grime, or other substances that may prevent the wax from bonding to your hair. Rinse off afterward. Then dry your skin thoroughly, since any remaining water may thin the wax and weaken its bond with the fabric.Additionally, try dusting your skin with baby powder after drying. This will soak up any lingering moisture in your skin that might interfere with the wax bonding., If you’ve been shaving instead of using other forms of wax, be patient. Give your hair a chance to grow longer so it’s easier to remove when waxing. Wait at least a week or two after shaving before switching to waxing.After repeated waxes, you’ll only have to wait for your hair to grow about a centimeter long before doing it again.

, If you’re new to waxing, anticipate having to do it more often than people who have been doing it for a while. After your first wax, inspect your skin for hair growth. Younger hairs may have been too short for the wax to bond to the first time, so wax again as they grow out.Individual hairs fall out naturally, so each regrowth may be at a different stage than those around it. This means you have to wax numerous times the first few weeks.
Over time, the roots will lose their strength, at which point they won’t need to grow as long. As this happens, each wax should remove more hairs at once, so you won’t have to do it quite so often."

Wash your face with a gentle cleanser.,
Apply the wax to the hairs you would like removed.,
Apply pressure onto the wax by holding an old rag or cloth.",How to Wax Eyebrows at Home (Honey and Salt Method)2," This will remove some of the dirt and natural oils on your skin and hair. Starting with a clean face will help to remove more of the unwanted hairs during the process.

, Use a popsicle stick, spoon or a Q-tip to precisely apply the wax. Cover the hair thoroughly. Be extremely careful with this step, as it can be tricky. Avoid spreading the wax onto areas where you would not want your hairs removed.







, Running your finger over the cloth in the directions the hair goes. Leave the wax in place for 15 minutes.









You can make this easier by cutting the fabric into strips that can be placed over the wax. Having a small piece of fabric stuck to your face is much less of an impairment than a whole rag.

Pull off the cloth quickly.,
Find a new, clean cloth and dampen it with warm water.,
Check for any stray hairs that remain.",How to Wax Eyebrows at Home (Honey and Salt Method)3," Yank it in the opposite direction that the hair grows.This would be left-to-right on your left eyebrow, and right-to-left on your right eyebrow.









It will hurt a little. Just pretend you are yanking off a stubborn bandage.
Do not hesitate at this point. Determined hairs might hang onto your skin and it will hurt more than it should.

, Gently press it onto the area where you applied the wax. This step will prevent the skin from getting irritated.


You can also apply some Vitamin E lotion or moisturizing product to reduce redness or puffiness in just a few minutes., The wax should have pulled out most of them. If you find one or two, simply remove them with tweezers.

Remember that some shavers are designed to be disassembled easily.,
If your shaver came with instructions, use them.,
If your replacement blades came with instructions, use them.,
Check for instruction manuals online.,
Check this article's Tips section.",How to Disassemble a Shaver1," It may just be a matter of looking at the shaver carefully for markings which were put there to help you take it apart.


If you notice arrows, for example, simply place your fingers on them, squeeze gently, and pull in the direction they point. Disassembling your shaver might just be this easy.;
, These may include a section about disassembly. If so, read it carefully before starting.

, If the replacement blades are manufacturer-specific (most are), look for instructions in or on the packaging, and read them carefully before starting.

, Sometimes, instructions specific to your shaver will be available online at the manufacturer's website.

, Even if you have instructions, check out our Tips section below for a general idea of how to take things apart properly.

"
"
Make sure your shaver is not plugged in.,
Look for screws.,
Pull the shaver apart gently.",How to Disassemble a Shaver2," Simply turning it off is not enough. The last thing you (or we) want is for an electric current to be running through the shaver while you poke and prod its insides with metal tools.


If the shaver runs by battery, you do not need to worry about this, but it should still not be plugged in.

, If you can see that the shaver, or any part of it, is held together by screws, then this should be rather easy.


Simply find the appropriate screwdriver and turn the screws counter-clockwise to remove them.

, If you have unscrewed the blade, remove it carefully and without touching the sharp edge of the blade. If you have unscrewed the body of the shaver, pull the two halves apart slowly and carefully.

"
"
Find a small flat-head screwdriver.,
Identify the weakest point of your shaver.,
Slip the head of the screwdriver between the pieces.,
If the used blade is exposed, remove it carefully.,
Depending on the model of the shaver, there may be new blades stored inside.",How to Disassemble a Shaver3," Do not use scissors or any kind of knife, as these are designed for cutting, not prying.

, Typically, this will be at one end of the shaver rather than on the sides. Look for seams in the plastic, where two or more separate pieces of the shaver's body come together.


If the blade is held on with a plastic guard, the seam between this piece and the rest of the shaver's body is your target.

, Gently push the handle towards the shaver. This will pry the piece up, away from the shaver.

, You should ideally use the screwdriver for this, and avoid touching the blade's edge with your fingers.

, Once you remove the top guard, you can slip the razor blade(s) out of their setting and use them to replace the used one.

Wash the area.,
Apply a hot, damp towel.,
Choose an extra virgin olive oil.,
Lather with olive oil.,
Shave along the grain of the hair.,
Wash the area.,
Apply more oil to moisturize.,
Dip your razor in the oil.",How to Shave With Olive Oil," Make sure the area you are shaving is clean to prevent infection. Wash the area you want to shave with soap as you normally would. Try to use a high-quality soap for a deep clean.If you are shaving a particularly hairy area, like your head or your beard, trim off as much hair as possible beforehand using clippers.;
, Applying a hot towel will open your pores and allow for a smoother shave. Alternatively, you can take a warm shower., Extra virgin olive oil is best for your skin. It is the least processed form of olive oil, and therefore contains more anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds than other types, including pure and light olive oils.Consider buying a bottle solely for shaving purposes to avoid cross-contamination.

, Pour some olive oil into a cup for easy access. Then, dip your fingers into the oil and massage a thin layer into the area you want to shave. Use extra oil for areas with thicker hair growth., Shave with the direction of hair growth, as you normally would. One perk of olive oil compared to shaving cream is that it allows you to see the area you are shaving clearly. Use a damp cloth to keep the area moist. You can use any type of razor.You should discard disposable razors after one use, and clean electric razors after each use to prevent bacterial growth.
If you want a cleaner shave, apply more oil and shave against the grain of the hair.

, Wash the area again with soap, either in the shower or at the sink. This will remove dirt and excess oil.If you don’t want to smell like olive oil, be sure not to skip this step! Washing the area thoroughly is important for removing the scent of the olive oil.

, Instead of using a store-bought lotion to moisturize post-shave, try massaging a teaspoon of olive oil into your skin. It’s cheap, and you already have it on hand!Try to apply the oil while your skin is still damp--it’ll absorb better.

, Olive oil is a lubricant, and can prevent your blade from rusting. Coating the blade with olive oil after shaving will help it last longer. You can leave your blade in the oil until the next use, or store it in its usual spot.If you store your razor in a drawer or on your counter, you may want to place a towel under the blade to prevent the oil from spreading.

Find the right time.,
Explain why you want to shave.,
Be patient.,
Don’t argue.,
Offer a compromise.,
Try again.,
Ask her to take you shopping.,
Get a demo.,
Talk about maintenance.",How to Ask Your Mom for Permission to Shave Your Legs," If you want your mother to give you permission, it’s important to talk to her at a time when she’s receptive to a conversation. That means you probably don’t want to ask her about shaving after she’s had a long, frustrating day at home or work. Try to find a moment when she seems like she’s in a good mood, such as after she’s finished watching her favorite TV show.If you want to increase your chances of your agreeing to let you shave, try asking her right after you’ve done something that shows you’re responsible, such as offering to wash the dishes after a family meal or getting a “A” on an important test.
You may want to ask her just before an event or occasion when shaving would make you feel more comfortable, such as a trip to the beach. That may help your mother take the request more seriously.;
, If you tell your mother that you want to shave just because all of your friends or classmates are doing it, she’s probably going to say no. You need to give her convincing personal reasons why it’s important for you to be allowed to shave. It may even be a good idea to jot down a quick list before hand, so you’re prepared when you talk to your her.The key is to convey how uncomfortable your hair makes you to your mother. Point out how dark or plentiful it is, and share if it makes you too uncomfortable to wear shorts, skirts, and swimsuits even in warm weather.
If kids at school have teased you about your leg hair, tell your mother about the experience. That may make her more sympathetic to your situation.
It usually helps to keep your plea simple. For example, you might say, ""I feel really self-conscious when I have to wear shorts for gym class because the hair on my legs is so dark,"" or ""I've stopped going to the pool with my friends because I don't want anyone to see me in a swimsuit with all the hair that I have on my legs.""
When it comes to actually asking to shave, make it clear how it would help your situation. For example, you might say, ""Shaving my legs would really help me feel more comfortable and confident.""

, Your mother may not be prepared to give you an answer right away because she needs time to think about it. She may want to try to remember how old she was when she started shaving, or talk to friends to see when they allowed their daughters to start shaving. Let her have some time to think about your request without pressuring her.If you’re very anxious about getting an answer, you might ask your mother to schedule a specific time to finish the conversation. For example, you might say, “Can you let me know this weekend?”
Don’t ask your mother about shaving or hint at the topic at all in the meantime. Respect your mother’s need to consider the topic carefully without you bugging her about it.

, If your mother agrees to let you shave, it’s obviously easy to accept her decision. However, if she says no, you should still accept it without yelling or whining. Let her explain the reasons why she doesn’t think you should start shaving, and try to understand. By responding in a mature manner, it may help you be able to convince your mother in the future.It’s completely normal to feel frustrated, angry, or upset if your mother won’t allow you to shave. Instead of yelling at her, though, vent to your friends.
If she says no, you might say, ""I wish you would let me shave, but I understand how you feel. Thank you for considering the idea."" She'll appreciate the fact that you're respectful and mature.

, Even if your mother says no, you may still be able to reach some common ground if you’re willing to compromise. Tell your mother that you’ll only shave below the knees so you’ll feel more comfortable in shorts, or ask if you can just try shaving once for a special occasion, such as a beach party. You might also ask if you can use a hair removal cream instead of shaving.If your mother does agree to a compromise, don’t push the issue and try to ask for more. Be grateful for whatever amount of shaving or hair removal that she’s allowing.

, If your mother says no and isn’t willing to compromise, it can be very frustrating -- but it doesn’t mean that all hope is lost. Now that you’ve broached the subject, your mom is probably going to continue thinking about it, even if she hasn’t allowed you to shave yet. After a little time, ask her again to see if she’s changed her mind. If you responded maturely when she said no before, she may be more receptive to the idea in the future.It can be difficult to wait, but give your mom at least a month or two before you ask about shaving again.

, Including your mother in the shaving process may make her more inclined to allow you to shave, so it’s a good idea to ask your mom to take you to the store to buy razors and other shaving items. She’ll probably want to provide advice on what type of razor to use, so it’s easier to have her there with you when you’re picking one out and ensure that you have the right tools and supplies on hand before you begin shaving.Disposable razors are the least expensive, and usually offer the closest shave. However, they’re the most likely to nick you so you need to be extremely careful when you use them.
Reusable razors with blades that can be replaced are usually sturdier than disposable razors, but can offer just as close a shave. The initial cost of a reusable option is usually higher than disposable, but in the long run, you can actually wind up saving money. They're also better for the environment than disposable razors.
Electric razors are more expensive than disposal razors, but they’re less likely to cause cuts or nicks when you’re using them. Keep in mind that they don’t provide the closest shave, though.
If you choose to go with disposal razors, you’ll also need a shaving cream or gel to help lubricate the skin when you’re shaving. Be sure to choose an alcohol-free formula because it’ll be less likely to irritate your skin.

, Shaving may seem pretty straightforward, but it’s easy to cut yourself and irritate your skin if you’ve never done it before. Your mother may have some good tips and tricks for getting a nice, close shave, so it’s a good idea to ask her to walk you through the process before you do it for the first time. Don’t be embarrassed to ask questions either -- your mother will want to help. In fact, asking her to demonstrate can help reassure her that you know what you're doing, so she's more comfortable with the idea of you shaving.It’s usually best to shave in the shower or bath because the warm water help soften your skin, so it’s easier to glide the razor over your legs without cutting yourself.
You’re less likely to get razor burn or other skin irritations if you shave in the direction of your hair growth.
While it helps to have your mom to a demo, it’s okay if you want some privacy when it comes time to actually shave. Just be honest with your mother, and tell her you’ll check in with her when you’re done.

, Once you’ve shaved for the first time, you’re probably going to want to keep at it so your legs remain smooth and hair-free. Everyone is different, but you should ask your mom about how often she thinks you should shave. She may not want you to shave too often, so if you ask for her input, it may help convince her to allow you to shave.If you have light, thin hair, you may only need to shave once a week.
For dark, coarse hair, you may want to shave twice a week.
Keep in mind that hair grows faster as you get older. That means that you don’t necessarily need to shave several times a week just because your mother does.
Don’t forget to change your razor (or blade) either. If the blade is dull, you’ll be more likely to cut yourself. You can usually get five to ten shaves out of a single razor.

Rinse off the razor blade.,
Tap the razor against the edge of the sink.,
Use a brush to dislodge any remaining debris.,
Allow the razor blade to dry completely.,
Fill a shallow container with rubbing alcohol.,
Submerge the head of the razor in the alcohol.,
Leave the blade to soak for 5-10 minutes.,
Dry the razor.,
Clean the razor regularly.,
Keep your razor in a clean, dry environment.,
Replace dull or rusty razors.",How to Clean a Razor Blade," Hold the head of the razor under a powerful stream of water. If it’s necessary to remove the blade in order to clean it, do so very carefully. Direct the water over the backside of the head, where it will help flush out hair, shaving cream residue and other gunk that’s stuck on the blade (or blades). It may help to rotate the razor as you rinse to help the water hit it from different angles.Hot water works better than cold for loosening dried messes.
Most of the time, a simple rinse is all you’ll need to renew your razor blades.;
, A couple quick jolts can help shake off compacted debris. Give the razor a light tap periodically as you rinse. Be careful not to be too forceful, or you may break the head or frame of the razor.








Continue tapping and flushing until there are no particles left on or around the blade.Never use your hand to tap or manipulate the blade in any way. It can be very easy to cut yourself if you’re not careful.

, If water alone isn’t enough to clear out the blades, a special razor brush may come in handy. Glide the brush over the blade vertically using smooth strokes. The bristles of one of these brushes can reach deep into the spaces between blades to sweep out grime that’s otherwise inaccessible.








Razor brushes can usually be found at most pharmacies, supermarkets or wherever hygiene products are sold.
If you don’t own a dedicated razor brush, an unused toothbrush will also do the trick. Just make sure it’s clean before using it on your razor blades., Once you’re removed as much buildup as possible, set the razor aside somewhere out in the open to dry. It’s best to leave it in a well-ventilated space where it can be exposed to constant airflow. You can then put the razor away in its usual storage area.Prolonged exposure to moisture can cause rust to form on the blade, which is both a safety concern and makes for a far less efficient shave.Water-logged razors can also lead to unsanitary mold growth.
Accelerate the drying process by dabbing the blade with an absorbent microfiber towel or blasting it with a hair dryer on a low heat setting., The natural antimicrobial properties of standard isopropyl alcohol make it useful for eliminating bacteria on personal hygiene products like razors. Pour in enough alcohol to completely cover the head of the razor.








For best results, use an alcohol that’s at least 70% pure.
Rubbing alcohol is readily available, convenient and safe to use—to go the extra mile in disinfecting your razor, you’ll often have to look no further than your own medicine cabinet.
Distilled white vinegar or hydrogen peroxide will also make acceptable alternatives if you don’t have any alcohol on hand., Swish the razor back and forth vigorously. A few seconds should be all that’s needed to rid the blade of most pesky bacteria.








The movement of the alcohol through the blades will also help clear out any remaining debris.

, If it’s been awhile since the last time you cleaned your razor, or it’s suffering from extensive buildup, it may be a good idea to give it a more thorough treatment. The longer you let the razor soak, the more time the alcohol will have to break down serious messes.It’s okay to soak an entire shaving razor in the alcohol, vinegar or hydrogen peroxide solution. This will eat away at dried gunk around the handle and base of the blades, effectively cleaning it all over.

, There’s no need to rinse the blade after an alcohol soak. Instead, simply shake off the excess alcohol and place it on an open surface until dry, which shouldn’t take long. Rubbing alcohol evaporates quickly, which will allow your razor to dry out that much faster.








Unlike water, alcohol will actually stop rust from developing on the metal.
Find a safe place to stash your razor blades to prevent accidents.

, Get in the habit of rinsing your razor blades after each use. This will keep skin and hair particles, soap scum and other debris from building up in the first place. Consistent cleaning will go a long way in extending a razor’s lifespan, even if it’s of the disposable variety.
Once a week or so, disinfect your razor by soaking it in rubbing alcohol.

, The best way to store loose razor blades is in an enclosed case or similar container that shuts securely. If you use the razor to shave, you can rest it on a separate base or stand or position it upright in a cup to allow water to drain out of it. Keep the blade ventilated until it's dry, then put it away where it won't become damaged or cause an accident.Don’t leave your razor sitting on the edge of the sink or on the alcove in a dingy shower, where they’ll be in direct contact with soap scum and bacteria.
These places also tend to be more humid, which increases the likelihood of rusty blades.

, To get an idea of what kind of condition your razor is in, pay attention to the way it handles. If it doesn’t provide a clean cut on the first pass, or you experience any pulling, friction or irritation, it’s probably time to get rid of it. A good rule of thumb is to throw out your old razors every couple weeks and stock up on new blades or cartridges.








Some hygiene experts go as far as to recommend that you purchase replacement blades after every 6-8 uses.Even non-disposable razors will need restoring or replacing once they begin to show signs of wear.

Hold the shaver over your bathroom sink.,
Turn off and unplug the shaver.,

Reassemble the shaver.,
Shake hair out of the shaver regularly.,
Clean your shaver thoroughly once a week.,
Replace all cutting parts every 18-24 months.",How to Clean an Electric Shaver," Since you’ll be cleaning hair and dead skin cells out of your shaver, you may not want to do it over a floor. Cleaning your shaver over your sink will allow you to easily get rid of fallen hairs and skin with just a bit of water.;
, Some shavers have an on/off switch, whereas others have a switch you depress to activate the blades. Either way, make sure it isn’t running; you want to make sure there is no electric current running through the shaver before you begin. If water gets into the shaver, it could cause electrocution or damage the shaver.


If your electric shaver is battery powered, you may want to remove the batteries before cleaning it., While models will vary, most will have a snap off head. There should be a small clip at the bottom of the head; press on this with your finger and it should come free. Generally, this is the only disassembly required.









Electric shavers usually fit one of two categories: rotary or foil shavers. The disassembly is a bit different for each category, so refer to your shaver’s instruction manual for details.
Be careful with the pieces you remove from the shaver. Some are incredibly sensitive and shouldn’t be cleaned. Refer to the owner’s manual to know how far you should disassemble the shaver and what you should be cleaning., Since you’re about to clean it, you should take a moment to make sure there aren’t any cracks in the casing or damage to the shaver head, such as nicks in the blades. If you can see any seals or gaskets, make sure to inspect them for damage., Hold the shaver at an angle, the head pointed downwards over your sink. With one finger, tap the side of the shaver firmly. Tapping repeatedly will shake most of the the hair loose. Keep doing this until you don’t see any hair falling out.









Avoid tapping the shaver against the sink; the impact of the hard porcelain could damage the shaver’s more sensitive parts., Most electric shavers come with a micro-bush specifically designed for cleaning it. After removing the shaver head, you should be able to reach the mechanisms that a hair could get lodged into. Brush gently, to make sure you’re not causing any scratches or scuffs.









If your shaver didn’t come with its own brush, you can use a small paintbrush. Make sure there aren’t any pieces of dried paint latched onto the bristles, as these could scratch, scuff or otherwise damage the shaver’s mechanisms., Some electric shavers are specifically constructed to be cleaned with water without damaging the mechanism. For these, you can hold them under the tap and wash with hot water. You can also use soap if you need to clean any gunk or grime out of your shaver.









Not all shavers can be cleaned with water and some might be irreparably damaged. Make sure to check the owner’s manual before trying to clean your shaver with water., Wipe down the shaver’s body and parts with a towel, then allow it all to air dry. The last thing you want is to put everything back together with drops of water trapped inside., These are usually sold by your shaver’s manufacturer. They will lubricate and de-grease the shaver’s blades and other mechanisms.Instructions may vary depending on the cleaner, but usually you should just need to spray a bit of the cleaner into the shaver after removing the shaver head.








, The complexity of this step will depend on how thoroughly you had to disassemble the shaver. Reverse the order of your disassembly, until your shaver is put back together.







, After removing the shaver head, tap the body with your finger to shake out loose hairs. Because this is very simple and only takes a few seconds, you should do it after every shave, even if you’re not thoroughly cleaning your shaver.







, Daily maintenance doesn’t need to go beyond shaking out loose hairs. However, cleaning the shaver more thoroughly will involve brushing hair out of the motor and and cutting assembly. Leaving these hairs will cause more wear on your shaver., This ensures that your shaver will keep working optimally in the long run.Get replacement parts directly from your shaver’s manufacturer. It might seem expensive, but it’s a lot less expensive than having to buy a new shaver because yours was ruined by cheap parts.

Rinse your face with cold water immediately after shaving.,
Dry your face gently.,
Wipe your face with witch hazel.,
Apply moisturizer.",How to Apply Aftershave Splash1," Before you even consider applying aftershave, you want to make sure your face is completely free of shaving cream or leftover hairs. Fill your cupped hands with cold water and rub it thoroughly over the entire area that you shaved. The benefit of cold water is that it closes the pores of your skin which is best for aftershave application. Be gentle as your rub your face so you don’t chafe or irritate the skin., Use a dry towel and lightly dab at your face to dry it. Do not rub with a lot of pressure as this can irritate your freshly shaved face. It is also okay for your face to remain slightly damp, you just don’t want it dripping wet.

, This is not a mandatory step, but will be beneficial for the best use of aftershave. Take a cotton pad and dampen it with witch hazel and lightly wipe it across the entire area that you shaved. The purpose of this is to help remove any residue that the water rinse left behind. It is a helpful step to clean the face more thoroughly which makes it easier to apply the aftershave.You can usually purchase witch hazel in the same spot where rubbing alcohol is sold. Cotton pads are usually with cotton balls in the beauty section of stores.

, Shaving does more than trim the hairs of the face. It also takes off a layer or two of old skin. Because of this, your face can get dried out more easily. Aftershave tends to have alcohol, which also dries the skin out. To counteract this, it is a great idea to use moisturizer specifically designed for men’s faces to lock in moisture before applying aftershave. Besides promoting healthy skin, moisturizer also helps the aftershave stick to the skin better and last longer.Use a small amount of lotion, as you don’t want to make the face oily. Any regular lotion will work, but you can also get special men’s products by Dove or L’Oreal.

Pour aftershave into your palm.,
Rub your palms together.,
Let some of the alcohol evaporate.,
Massage the aftershave into your skin.",How to Apply Aftershave Splash2," There are a few ways that are recommended for how to do this. One way is to shake 2-3 drops of aftershave into your hand. Less is better than more in this case. The second option is placing your palm over the opening of the aftershave bottle, tipping the bottle upside down briefly, and turning it back upwards. The amount of aftershave this leaves on your hand is typically enough., You want to use both hands when applying the aftershave, but you don’t need to pour it directly onto both hands. Rubbing your hands together will transfer enough of the aftershave from one hand to the other. You don’t want to do this for so long that the aftershave all soaks into your hands, just enough to wet them both. 1-2 seconds is enough time., Since aftershave tends to have alcohol, which dries out your skin, it is good to let some of it evaporate before rubbing your hands on your face. Once you have the aftershave on both hands, leave your hands open for about 4-5 seconds. This will release some of the alcohol from the aftershave. Be sure not to let it dry for too long or you won’t have any to apply to your face.The purpose of this step is mainly to avoid some of the burning that tends to accompany applying aftershave, but it also keeps some of the alcohol from drying out your skin.

, Now it is time to actually put the aftershave to your face. Gently rub your hands in a downward motion from the top of your cheeks to your jawline. Then swipe each hand up your neck and under your chin. You can massage the skin a little in each area to make sure the aftershave soaks in.It may be necessary to apply a second coat of aftershave if you feel your face was not thoroughly covered, but you want to avoid applying too much. If you do apply a second coat, try to use slightly less than you used the first time.

Wash your new brush.,
Do not push down hard while lathering with your shaving brush.,
Use the entire area of the brush.,
Rinse your brush thoroughly after use.,
Store your brush in a dry open area.,
Use a shaving stand.,
Don’t ever boil your brush as this may harm it.

,
Deep clean your brush once a year.,
Use only shaving soaps and creams that are designed to go with a shaving brush.,
When traveling with a shaving brush make sure that it’s stored in either a closed container or a dopp/ toiletry kit.",How to Care for a Shaving Brush," While shaving brushes usually come sanitized from the manufacture, it’s a good idea to still clean the brush with soapy water or shampoo and conditioner before use as this will better prepare the brush for use and remove any loose hairs.;
, This is a common mistake, and probably the most important tip. Many men feel they have to push down hard to create an ultimate lather. This is not true; use the brush in light circular motions, letting the tips do the work. This tip is true weather lathering on your face, hand, in a bowl, mug, dish, or scuttle.

, Many men only use the center of the brush and avoid the outer edges. While swirling your brush in circular motions, make sure you’re utilizing the entire brush as using just the center will cause it to wear out faster and cause a dimple effect on your brush over time.

, Giving your brush a quick rinse may give the appearance it’s clean, but there’s actually a lot of soap or cream inside the bristles. Run the brush under warm water until the water running through the bristles is clear when it comes out the other side. Gently squeezing the bristles (without pulling) to help remove the soap and cream along the way.

, It is important to let your brush properly dry after each use to avoid mold build up. Try storing your brush on the bathroom counter as opposed to the medicine cabinet. If the cabinet is necessary make sure it has enough space, and pat it dry with a towel before placing in a cabinet.

, While not crucial, a stand will store your brush upside down so the water runs off the brush rather than into the handle. This is an important step however, for those using a wood handle brush.

,, Using borax or a 50:50 vinegar/water solution, let your brush sit in the solution for about two minutes to remove any soap or cream build up.

, Using creams that are not made for a brush usually contain chemicals that are harmful and wear out the bristles over the long term.

, Do not just throw your brush randomly in your suitcase.

Look at the size of the handle and the overall weight of the razor.,
Look at the top and make sure that there is equal blade exposure on both sides of the cutting head.",How to Choose a Safety Razor," You want a razor that is not too heavy in either the top or the handle so that it is off-balance in your hand. A well-designed razor should feel comfortable in your hand and be easy to maneuver around your face at the proper cutting angle. If the razor is too light, you could have a natural tendency to apply too much pressure and cut your skin; if it's too heavy, you may inadvertently apply too much pressure due to the weight of the razor.;
,


In other words, make sure the gap between the blade and the safety bar is even and consistent on both sides. Some razors may vary from model to model on how much gap is present, but they should always be equal on both sides. Frequently inexpensive razors can have uneven gaps, which increases your likelihood of cutting your skin during your shave.
Quality razors from reputable manufacturers, such as Merkur or Edwin Jagger, have quality controls in place to ensure that the cutting head is symmetrical and razors are made to precise standards.

Unscrew the head and comb from the handle.,
Fit a sharp razor blade between the head and comb.,
Fasten the razor blade between by screwing the the head and the handle together.,
Consider showering before you start shaving.,
Wash your face with warm water and facial soap or scrub.,
Work in a small amount of pre-shave cream into your beard.A small dab of pre-shave cream (often containing the aforementioned glycerin) softens the beard while prepping the surface of the skin for repeated contact with a blade.,
Draw some warm water in your sink for your shave.,
Lather up your shaving cream and apply it over your entire beard, making sure not to wash away any pre-shave cream.,
Wet your DE razor and position it at about a 30° angle to your skin.,
On the first pass, always shave with the grain.The direction in which the hairs of your beard grow out of your skin is called the grain.,
Frequently dip your razor into the bath of warm water and swirl it around.,
Shave using small strokes, letting the weight of the DE razor do most of the work.,
Hold your skin taut to promote easier shaving.,
Pay special attention to problem areas.,
Wet your face, apply another thin coat of cream, and take a second pass.,
Repeat this general process as many times as necessary to produce a clean shave.,
Clean your DE razor and splash your face with cold water.,
Consider briefly submerging your blade in rubbing alcohol to wick away excess moisture.,
If you used one, clean off your brush and make sure it's relatively dry.,
Apply an aftershave to the face if desired.,
Hydrate your skin with moisturizer.",How to Shave With a Safety Razor," Double-edged (DE) razors come in three parts — the head, which covers the razor blade; the comb, which fits between the head and the handle; and the handle itself, which you hold as you shave. Hold onto the head and comb as you unscrew the handle. This will unlock all three parts of your razor.;
, Place a razor blade between the head and the comb, making sure to line up all three holes in the head, razor blade, and comb.


Which razor blades should you choose? Your choice of razor blades will most likely depend on your beard. Thicker beards usually require sharper blades. Those with thinner beards will find that duller blades may be more forgiving, although they can tug at the beard instead of cutting right through them.

Feather blades, made in Japan, are the industry standard when it comes to sharpness. If you take your time shaving (which you should), these blades will offer casual and serious groomers alike the closest shave.

, Tighten the razor blade to its mooring between the head and the comb and you're ready to start shaving.

, Showering before shaving is an important step that many casual shavers forget but only some can get away with. Showering moisturizes and softens your beard, making the shaving process afterward easier, and producing fewer nicks and cuts., Over time, your face accumulates dead skin. Removing that layer of dead skin on your epidermis by washing before you take razor to skin often, if not always, results in a better shave. Scrubs, which contain small abrasives, do a particularly good job of sloughing off dead skin.


Many men use glycerin soap before shaving to contribute to a better shave.Glycerine soap does a good job of both removing dead skin and smoothing out the skin without robbing it entirely of moisture.

,


Some men prefer to work baby lotion into their beards pre-shave. The baby lotion may helps reduce irritation by providing a smooth surface for the razor to glide over.

, Warm water feels especially nice on the skin. It also does a good job of clearing away stubble and gunk from between your DE razor when you clean it in between passes.

, The casual shaver probably relies on shaving cream out of a can, as it's quick, cost-effective, and easy. This is perfectly acceptable. A new breed of men, however, are rediscovering the pleasure of lathering up shaving soap themselves with a badger-hair brush and a bit of warm water.


Start with a little dab of shaving soap, a wet shaving brush, and a shaving mug. Start working the shaving soap around in circular motions using your brush. Apply small amounts of water as necessary.
Mix your shaving soap vigorously for anywhere from 30 seconds to one and a half minutes, until the soap has been whipped up into an opalescent lather.
Take the lathered shaving soap and work it into your beard with your brush. Use a gentle circular pattern to do this. Using a brush to apply the lather to your face further softens your beard and ensures that the lather has penetrated every available portion of your face. When the lather is all worked into your beard, smooth it out with a few strokes of your brush., Submerge your DE razor in the hot water and then position it at about a 30° angle. This angle ensures a close shave but doesn't produce a lot of nicks and cuts.

, Shaving in the same direction as your hair grows — i.e. ""with the grain"" — chops off less beard, but is very forgiving. On your first pass, always go with the grain.


If you've never shaved before, it will take some time to get to know the direction your beard. Every man's grain is different, and often changes depending on the hair's position on the face.

, This dislodges hair and other gunk that gets caught in between the head, the blade, and the comb. Needless to say, a clogged safety razor will produce a less satisfying shave than a clean one.

, Ever notice how commercials advertising shaving products always show men shaving using long, continuous strokes? That's not how you shave. It may look nice in commercials, but it turns you into a blood donor in real life. Use small strokes, making sure not to press down with your razor onto skin.


The weight of your razor should be doing most of the work. If you feel like you need to press down with your razor onto skin in order to shave, either your blades aren't sharp enough or your razor isn't heavy enough.

, Holding your skin taut makes it easier for the razor blade to glide over your skin's surface. Holding your upper lip down, your lower lip up, as well as the skin beneath your jawline will give you a closer shave without as many nicks.

, Problem areas are areas that often produce nicks, cuts, irritation and redness. For many men, these areas include the above and below the lips, beneath the jawline, or any other place on the face that is contoured instead of flat. When shaving these areas, take your time and shave against the grain. Be patient and willing to take several passes instead of trying to remove all stubble with the first pass.

, The aim of the first pass is to remove most of your stubble, although there will still be some noticeable patches. The aim of the second pass is to shave away any remaining stubble without causing cuts or irritation.


On the second pass, shave using sideways strokes or against the grain, albeit very carefully. Sideways strokes will trim the forest of your beard down to a clean sand-dune without producing much irritation.
On the second pass especially, remember to unclog your razor, keep your skin taut, and always lather over areas you intend to shave for extra lubrication.

, All men have different beards and desire different shaves. Shave until you've achieved your desired level of closeness, keeping in mind that each extra pass you make increases your chance of producing nicks and irritation.

, Warm water pre-shave, cold water post-shave. Whereas warm water opens us your pores, cold water causes them to contract.Cold water on your face feels especially refreshing, and helps stanch any blood caused by nicks.

, Water on blades causes rust; rust causes additional friction; friction causes a less comfortable shave. If you want to increase the longevity of your razor blades, unscrew them from the razor, submerge them in rubbing alcohol, and remove. Place back onto the cleaned razor when dry.

, Rinse your brush under cool water to remove any remaining soap. Lightly shake the wet brush until most of the water is gone. Store in a well-ventilated area.

, Aftershaves help tone and sometimes hydrate the skin post-shave. Essentially, there are two different types of aftershave — alcohol-based and witch hazel-based:


Alcohol-based aftershaves are generally cheaper, but tend to sting and are prone to drying out the skin (much in the same way as they dry out the razor blade). They are the most widespread aftershave on the market.
Witch hazel aftershaves are cooling and don't sting the skin, but offer less of a toner to skin than alcohol-based aftershaves. They are very forgiving and increasingly popular in the post-shave routine.
If you're adventurous, you can even make your own aftershave. The process is straightforward and allows you to be creative.

, You've just poked and prodded your skin, tugging at and lumping off hair, probably along with some skin. In order to keep your face as healthy as possible, give it some nourishment in the form of moisturizer. Your skin will thank you.

Let the hair grow out a bit before shaving again.,
Resist the urge to scratch the area.,
Use a product that's designed to treat razor bumps.,
Treat infection with aloe vera then lotion, to leave your skin clear and smooth.,
Treat scarring with Retin-A.,
See a dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Razor Bumps in the Bikini Area1," Shaving over razor bumps will only irritate or tear them open, leaving them vulnerable to infection (and probably not removing much hair in the process). If you can, let the hair grow for a few days and see if it breaks out of the bumps on its own.;
, It might itch, but breaking the bumps with your fingernails can lead to infection and scarring. Try to hold off as much as you can.

, Look for something that contains salicylic acid, glycolic acid, witch hazel, aloe, or any combination of these ingredients. Some of these products might come in a roller bottle that's designed to go directly on your skin, while others might require you to put the solution on a cotton ball and dab it on your skin.


If you don't know what to buy, call your local waxing salon and ask what they recommend to their clients. You can probably purchase the product there as well, or look around online.
Apply the solution to your skin at least once per day, if not more. Aim to do it when you get out of the shower, before your skin has sweat or anything else on it.

, If you suspect that you have infected ingrown hairs, try using an antibacterial cream on them each day. Bacitracin, Neosporin, and Polysporin are all possible topical treatments.

, Retinoids, derived from Vitamin A, can help smooth over skin and reduce the appearance of scars or marks left by razor bumps.


You might need to see a doctor for a prescription.

Do not use Retin-A if you're pregnant or breastfeeding. It can cause severe birth defects.
Areas treated with Retin-A are more susceptible to sunburns. Cover up, or wear SPF 45 sunscreen.
Don't use Retin-A on any areas where you plan to wax in the future.— It can make the skin significantly weaker, leading to potential tearing during a waxing session.

, If your razor bumps persist for several weeks, and you haven't shaved again, consider booking an appointment with a dermatologist.

Don't pick at them!",How to Prevent Razor Bumps," A hot shower with frequent face scrubbing will cleanse your pores more thoroughly than splashing water on your face a few times, but sometimes the snooze button wins that morning time struggle. Use soap and warm water if you're washing your face. This will soften the hair and remove any grime or bacteria that clogs pores and leads to bumps.


This also opens the pores and cleanses the skin (it has to be warm, though). Not only will you be working to eliminate the bumps, you'll get a closer, cleaner shave, too.;
, A pre-shave oil is optional, but using some will add another layer of protection by moisturizing the skin and getting the hair to stand straighter off the skin. The straighter it is, the less likely it is to curl, grow in your skin, and form bumps. (This is why those with curly, coiled hair get razor bumps more commonly.)


Oddly enough, you can find pre-shave oils at health food stores. But don't eat it. It's made of silicone and is just used to cut down on friction and soften your hairs., The thicker, the better. Never shave dry! Some men find lathering up easier to do with a shaving brush. Reapply for every additional pass of the razor.


Choosing shaving cream is usually a matter of personal taste. However, the better creams on the market are glycerin-based and contain these ingredients: aqua, stearic acid, myristic acid, coconut acid, sodium and potassium hydroxides, and triethanolamine. It's best to avoid benzocaine and menthol, as those are both rather pore-clogging., A dull or dirty blade will cut your skin more often than a sharp one will. Replace your blade frequently, especially if you shave often. Cleaning the blade and removing any hair will extend the life of the blade. A blade with rust should be discarded immediately.


You can extend the life of your razor by taking good care of it. Wash out any hair trapped in the blades, but don't leave it wet -- the water will wear down the blades.

, That is, in the direction your hair grows. You may think shaving up or against the grain gives you a closer shave, but cutting the hair this way changes the way it grows back, increasing your risk of razor bumps and ingrown hair.


Use light pressure. Pressing the razor too hard against the face or shaving the same patch in multiple strokes will cause irritation.
Don't stretch the skin! For your pubic area this may be necessary, but your beard will do just fine on its own, thanks.

, You may think that the only culprit when it comes to razor bumps is, namely, your razor, but your shaving brush can be a bad guy, too. Make sure it's clean when you're done with it to prevent bacteria from starting their own little colony on your brush.


Hang it bristles downward so it drains after you're finished using it. The shape of the brush will stay more intact, but you'll also cut down on bacteria, cutting down on razor bumps.Everybody wins! Well, except the bacteria.

, Warm water opens your pores, which makes it easier for the razor to get the hair. Cold water closes your pores and makes it more difficult for bacteria to get inside. You started with warm water, right? So finish with cold.


You can also press a cold, wet cloth against your face for five minutes to really seal the deal. Really, the more time you take, the better.

, That's a bar that kind of looks like soap, but can be used as a blood coagulant. This can be purchased online or at any specialty shaving store and is more effective than cold water alone in closing open pores. This step is optional, but many men prefer to use one.


They are especially useful healing accidental cuts. If you get a quick nick, moisten the block and apply it to the area. It works as an antiseptic!, Either a splash of lotion or a smear of balm. Choose a product that has a scent you enjoy. Using aftershave will help prevent infection. If you're more of the Chuck Norris/MacGyver type, why don't you make it yourself? But it's best not to use gasoline as aftershave like Chuck Norris does.


This step is imperative to restoring moisture to your skin. Go for an alcohol-free one to stay derma-hydrated. If that wasn't a word, it sure is now.

You may wish to choose a product specifically made for sensitive skin. If you know yours reacts to everything under the sun, spend another dollar or two to go for the good stuff.



, If you're growing the Forbidden Forest down there, your razor doesn't stand a chance. Trim the hairs to about 1/4"" (.6 cm) before you go near the blade. Don't wanna use scissors? No one will blame you, that's for sure. Electric clippers are like the sippy cups of pubic hair trimming. Use them to avoid snipping your skin.


It doesn't have to be even and pretty, it just has to be short. Make sure to check the hard-to-reach areas too!

, If you took the time to read the above sections on beard grooming, this is the exact same process. You want to soak the hair follicles in warm or hot water to open up your pores. They'll be more receptive to shaving, resulting in smoother skin.


You can do this a number of ways. First off, the shower or bath is your best bet. The more time you spend under the water, the better. However, you could also take a wet washrag to the area if you're pressed for time.

, Thought that one was coming later, didn't you? If you want to get rid of the top layer of dead skin (relax, everybody has it) and align your hairs (both things aiding in a closer, better shave), you'll exfoliate now. Just your normal shower gel will work fine!

, Gentlemen, hate to break it to you, but you may want to swallow your pride and grab your girlfriend's shaving cream. Generally speaking, women's shaving cream is better for sensitive areas and doesn't contain any harsh perfumes.If you can handle the pink container, you'll be better off.


Don't use the same stuff you used on your face, if you can help it. Choose a product that's specifically made for pubic hair shaving (namely, scent-free). As you probably well know, your face is a completely different canvas than what's down there.

, Your (new) razor needs a smooth, even surface, so stretch it taut and shave with the grain to prevent irritation and razor bumps. Yeah, yeah, yeah -- shaving against the grain will get you closer -- but that's not what this article is about. If you really wanna avoid the bumps, you'll shave with the grain.


Use a good razor. Throw out the ones you use every few shaving sessions. They just dull and do a poor job after too long (and can actually lead to spreading bacteria, creating bumps and burn). Treat yours right by rinsing all the hair off and drying it when you're done -- water will erode away the metal.

, Now that your skin has been scalped and left to its own devices, it's time to exfoliate once more. With your normal soap (so you know it doesn't burn), rub down the area. You'll realign the hairs, wipe away the excess dead skin particles that were brought up by shaving, and unblock any clogged pores. Win to the third degree!


If you must choose one exfoliating process to do, choose this one. You don't want to leave your follicles all over the place, allowing for ingrown hairs and bacteria to spread. All that work for nothing!

, Now that the hard part is done, it's simply time to dry off and moisturize. Don't rub the area too hard as that may irritate it, but do pat it with a dry towel. Then, hit the unscented lotion, aloe vera, or baby oil. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, remember.


Do not go for aftershave. Do you want an ambulance to be called? Stick to alcohol-free, unscented creams and lotions. Baby oil is good if you're not planning on having sex after, as it can deteriorate latex condoms., You know when you wear tight clothes to the gym, sometimes after all the sweat and exercising, you get a few pimples? Well, loose clothing might've prevented that and the same goes for razor bumps. The area needs to breathe as much as possible -- aka a great excuse for sweatpants.


This actually goes for your beard, too, if you keep clothing around your face. On the off chance you're wearing scarves or turtlenecks to cover up the bumps, know that this could actually be making it worse!

, Not the sage wisdom you were hoping for, eh? But straight up, the less you shave, the less the top layer of skin from your face has to get ripped up and torn apart. If you can skip a day, do so. Your skin will thank you for it.


If you have razor bumps already, give 'em a chance to heal! Skip a few days of shaving to let them do their thing. You won't have to grow a hobo beard (but if you could, that'd also be useful), but do grow some stubble. They'll work themselves out.

, If you had a few razor bumps from before you embarked upon this safe, smooth, bump-free journey, wet a washrag with hot water and keep it on your bumps (your lovely lady bumps) for 5-10 minutes. This will open up the pore and kill the bacteria, which makes the bumps redden and more swollen.

, You can find some at most pharmacies. Salicylic acid is also effective. Apply it immediately after shaving and again before bed. You may experience a bit of stinging, but it should subside almost immediately.In a pinch, aloe vera or hydrocortisone should also help. These products are a little easier to find in your mom's/sister's/roommate's medicine cabinet, huh?

, Kinda like asking you to not look at a car crash, huh? But try your hardest. They may look like acne, but they're actually irritations that can get infected. Mixing in your finger oils won't make the situation any better.Don't rub them either. When in doubt, stay away. They'll go away with time. Patience, young Jedi.

Shave in the shower.,
Use shaving cream (or a substitute).,
Rinse off with cold water.,
Pat the area dry.,
Wipe deodorant over the area (optional).",How to Get Rid of Razor Bumps in the Bikini Area2," A dull or rusty razor can keep you from getting a clean shave, whether it's by snagging hairs instead of cutting them, or irritating the skin around the follicle.

, Shaving every day can irritate new bumps, so try to wait and only use a razor every second day. If you can, shaving every third day is even better.

, Exfoliation will clear off any dead skin cells or other material on your skin, paving the way for a close and clean shave. You can use an exfoliating scrub, loofah, mitt, skin care brush, or whatever works best for you.


If your skin is sensitive, consider exfoliating on your ""off"" day from shaving.
If your skin handles exfoliation with minimal irritation, try doing it right before you shave.

, Applying pressure can make the razor uneven on your skin. Instead, aim to hold it lightly and ""glide"" it over your bikini area.

, If you missed too much to overlook, make the second pass with the grain, instead of against it.


Shaving against the grain means to move the razor in the direction opposite of hair growth. For instance, most people are shaving against the grain when they run a razor from their ankle to their knee.
Shaving with the grain creates less irritation, but not as close a shave. Try to use this technique as much as you can if you're going back over an area you've already shaved.

, The steam from a warm shower serves two purposes: it makes the hair softer, and your skin less prone to nicks and irritation.


If you usually shave first, consider reorganizing your shower tasks so that you do it last. Try to give it five minutes before you start shaving.
If you don't have time to shower, wet a washcloth with water that's as warm as you can stand, and lay it over the area you're going to shave. Try to leave it for two or three minutes before shaving.

, Shaving cream can also soften hairs and make them easier to remove (as well as making it easier to track where you've shaved and where you haven't).


Find cream that includes aloe or other moisturizing compounds.
If you're in a pinch and have no shaving cream, use hair conditioner instead. It's better than nothing!

, Ending your shower with a blast of cold water, or using a cold washcloth on the area, will cause your pores to close up, leaving them less vulnerable to irritants and infection.

, Don't rub yourself dry harshly with a towel. Instead, dry your bikini area in small taps, saving your skin a load of irritation.

, Some people claim that putting deodorant over the bikini area when you're done shaving (as you would on your armpits) can help reduce irritation.

Consider waxing.,
Consider laser hair removal.",How to Get Rid of Razor Bumps in the Bikini Area3," You could still experience ingrown hairs after waxing, but the tip will be composed of finer new growth, instead of coarse hair that's merely had the top shaved off.


If you do decide to wax, aim to make an appointment every six to eight weeks in the beginning. You might be able to go for longer stretches without waxing later.
Choose a reputable waxing salon. Ask around, or search reviews online.
Know what to expect. Your skin will probably be a little red and irritated when you leave, but you shouldn't have open cuts or dark, widespread bruises. Additionally, if you notice that your skin is infected a day or two after your appointment, start applying an antibiotic cream and notify the salon immediately.

, Contrary to popular belief, laser hair removal won't completely remove your hair forever. However, it will significantly reduce growth.


Be aware that laser hair removal works best on dark hair and light skin. If your skin and your hair are too close to the same color (whether it's too light or too dark), you might not be a good candidate for treatment.
Laser hair removal is expensive, and you'll need at least four to six treatments. Price it out and watch for promotions.

, Shaving is fine, but these other hair removal techniques can reduce the effectiveness of the laser treatment. Also, the hair should not be bleached.

, This is usually a day or two before the appointment. The hair follicles should be visible, but it can be more painful if longer hair is present during the laser hair removal.

,, If you apply deodorant, it will be removed prior to treatment.

Wear clothing that will leave the treated area exposed or is loose fitting.,
Expect the laser technician to apply a topical anesthetic cream or a warm compress prior to treatment.,

Go for multiple treatments.",How to Get the Most Benefit from Laser Hair Removal," Laser hair removal works by targeting and breaking down the melanin (the pigment that gives hair its color) in a hair follicle, which makes that hair fall out.The process, therefore, works best to remove coarse, dark hair. It won’t work as well—or may not work at all—to remove red, blond, gray, or white hair. Laser hair removal likely won’t work for women with polycystic ovaries disease or other hormonal problems.If you are taking any medications, especially new ones or a course of antibiotics, talk to your doctor before undergoing laser hair removal.

To manage hair growth before your treatment, shave or use depilatories that only remove the hair above the skin., You want to be calm and relaxed before and during your laser treatment, but caffeine can make you more agitated and tense., When you go for your initial consultation, the technician will tell you exactly when to shave in preparation for your treatment, but most clinics recommend shaving one to two days beforehand.Although it may seem strange to shave right before a laser removal treatment, it’s an important step in the process: the laser targets hair in the active growing stage, and shaving encourages hair to enter this stage., Before leaving for your treatment, shower and wash your skin with a gentle cleanser. You want to remove all makeup, dirt, and oil from your skin. Avoid moisturizing before your treatment., Just as you protected your skin from tanning in the six weeks prior to your laser hair treatment, so too should you avoid the sun for the six weeks following it. Not only will your skin be sensitive,but it can also complicate the removal process and follow-up treatments., Shortly after your treatment, the targeted hair will begin making its way out of the hair follicle, making it look like it’s growing again.But within 10 to 14 days, your hair will reach the shedding stage and begin to fall out, at which time you can gently remove it with a washcloth in the shower or bath., During the shedding stage, your hair needs to fall out naturally, so don’t pluck, tweeze, or wax the targeted area.If there is any resistance from a hair, it means the root is still alive, and that hair will have to be targeted again in a follow-up treatment.You can shave after your laser hair removal, but avoid anything that pulls hair out by the roots.

, Laser hair removal only targets hair in the active growth phase, so many patients need anywhere between four and 10 sessions to achieve the desired results,Treatments generally occur every one to two months.After each treatment, you should notice less and less hair in the targeted area. The hair that does continue to grow should be finer and lighter in color."

Each state is responsible for regulating cosmetic treatments like laser hair removal. Some states do not require a licensed doctor to perform the procedure or even oversee the treatment. Look for a clinic where a doctor is responsible for the procedures that are performed, even if an experienced technician is the one who actually provides the treatment.;
,


There are many types of lasers used for cosmetic procedures today. Ask if the clinic you choose uses an FDA-approved tool specifically designed for laser hair removal.

,


Laser hair removal providers should be willing to show new patients licensing documentation from the state where they work. Ask how long they have been performing laser hair removal and how many procedures like yours they have performed. Find out if the technicians participate in ongoing training to keep up with the latest advances in laser treatment.
Membership in professional organizations like The American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS), the National Council on Laser Excellence (NCLE) or the International Aesthetic and Laser Association (IALA) is not required, but it does show the technician or doctor maintains standards of excellence in his work, as set by the association.

,


Many doctors that specialize in cosmetic treatments offer before and after photos of previous patients to prospective clients. This gives patients a realistic idea of the results they can expect and showcases the doctor or technician's work in this area.

,


A visit to the clinic or doctor's office provides the opportunity to ask the laser hair removal provider questions in person, visit with the office staff and receive and overview of the specific procedure you are requesting. Consultations are typically free of charge at most reputable laser clinics today.
When you go in for your initial consultation, take a list of questions that include the experience of the technician, the treatment you would receive, and how to prepare for the procedure. Beware of any clinic that promises ""permanent"" hair removal results. While this procedure does significantly reduce unwanted hair, it is not considered a permanent hair removal procedure by the FDA and subsequent sessions may be required to maintain results.

,


Ask about the cost of the procedure before you schedule your appointment. Since some laser treatments require more than one session, get a price estimate that includes all the sessions you need to achieve desired results.

,


Because laser hair removal is considered a cosmetic procedure, it is rarely covered by insurance plans. Doctors and clinics often provide financing options to make the procedure more affordable to patients.

Wear loose, comfortable clothing to the appointment.",How to Prepare Your Skin for Waxing," Don't book a waxing appointment until you haven't waxed for least one to two weeks. Ideally, you should have 1/4 inch (.635 cm) of hair in the area you want to wax. Waxing will be more painless and effective if you wait long enough to wax.

The exception to this is fine hair, like women's facial hair. Fine hair can be shorter, but try to grow it out for several weeks beforehand.;
, Sensitive skin does not make for a pleasant waxing experience. The best time to wax is a week after your menstrual cycle, when your pain threshold is highest. Do not schedule an appointment during your time of the month.Also, do not schedule an appointment just before or after a day you plan to spend lots of time outside. If you get a sunburn, freshly waxed skin will be painful., Avoid scheduling an appointment right before a special event, vacation, or photoshoot. Skin reacts differently to waxing, especially the first time. Your skin may experience redness, bruising, or irritation. Try waxing for the first time weeks before a special event so you know what to expect.

If you experience skin irritation after waxing, you can prevent it in the future by applying a layer of coconut oil, baby powder, or a soothing lotion right after you wax., When you have found a professional esthetician, tell them about any allergies or skin sensitivities prior to the appointment. Your waxer can then choose a wax type appropriate for your skin type to avoid skin irritation.

If this is your first time waxing, let your esthetician know. They can tell you how to prepare for your specific treatment.Tell your esthetician about any skin creams you use as well, as this can affect your skin sensitivity.

, Because skin wax can contain chemicals irritable to the skin, ask for an allergy patch test from your doctor or dermatologist. You will want to know how your skin might react if this is your first waxing session. Let your esthetician know if you react to a certain chemical or fragrance.

Allergy tests can take up to several days to display irritation, so schedule your test well in advance., Treat any rashes or sunburns before your appointment to avoid tearing skin while being waxed.Look for any cuts or bruises as well: even small shaving cuts can develop irritation when waxed.

If you're prone to breaking out in a certain area, avoid getting it waxed. Waxing tends not to be effective on areas affected by hormonal breakouts.
Should your sunburn or rash persist, postpone your appointment until your skin has healed.

, Time spent out in the sun will make your skin sensitive. Even if you don't get a sunburn, skin is more irritability-prone right after a tan. Avoid spending extended amounts of time outside for several days before your appointment.

If you need to spend time outside, wear SPF 50+ sunscreen and re-apply every few hours., Before your appointment, exfoliate in the shower to remove dead skin and lift trapped hair. Exfoliating will reduce the likelihood of ingrown hairs after the appointment. Using a loofah or washcloth, rub an exfoliating cream in circular motions around the area you want waxed.Rub softly. Pressing too hard can irritate your skin.
Don't exfoliate your legs the same day you plan to wax them. Exfoliate several days before to prevent itching and redness.

, After you exfoliate, apply a moisturizer to your skin. This will hydrate your skin and keep it soft until the day of the appointment. Exfoliation can leave your skin dry, so always moisturize afterwards., During the day of your appointment, soak your skin in a warm bath to hydrate your skin. Dry skin is painful to wax because the hairs are harder to remove. If you don't have time for a full bath, soak the skin you plan to wax in water for five to ten minutes.

Drink plenty of water before your appointment to reduce rash development after waxing., Use a water-based, oil-free moisturizer after you've soaked your skin. Moisturizer will prevent your skin from burning during the wax. Be sure to use the moisturizer several days before your appointment and the day of for best results.

Do not use an oil lubricant (like coconut oil) before you wax, as this will prevent the wax from grabbing any hairs. You can use oil-based moisturizers after your appointment to prevent infection, as they can be an excellent disinfectant., Moles, skin tags, or lesions could rip off during a waxing appointment (which can increase the likelihood of cancer). Cover them up with a band-aid so you remember to tell your esthetician before the appointment., If you're sensitive to pain, take an ibuprofen-based pill before your appointment to reduce pain and inflammation. Take the pain relief pill an hour before your appointment so it kicks in when you need it and lasts throughout the appointment., Don't wear skinny jeans or tight fabrics to your appointment. After your skin has been waxed, you'll want soft and comfortable clothing. Wear soft, loose clothing to avoid irritating your skin after the appointment.Don't wear new clothes to your appointment. You'll want clothes you are familiar with and know you love.

Gather the necessary waxing supplies.,
Wax your legs.,
Wax your underarms.,
Wax your pubic hair.",How to Wax1," The first step is to buy an at-home waxing kit or make your own sugar wax.


There are many types of home waxing kits on the market -- the two major options are regular waxing kits (where cloth strips are used to pull the wax from the body) and hard waxing kits (where the wax itself dries and can be pulled off without the need for strips).
Regular wax is perfect for legs and underarms, while hard wax works best on the coarse hair in your bikini area.
Prepare the wax according to the instructions on the packaging. Many waxes can simply be melted in the microwave.;
, Before you begin waxing your legs, wash them in warm water to open the pores and make the hair easier to remove. Waxing is also more effective on freshly washed skin.


When the wax is ready, use the wooden stick provided (or use a clean popsicle stick) to apply the wax to a patch of skin in the direction of the hair growth.
Place one of the provided cloths on top and press it firmly into the wax by stroking it in the same direction as the hair growth.
Wait approximately 10 seconds, then rip the cloth from the skin, in the opposite direction to the hair growth. Try to do this in one fluid movement, keeping your hand close and parallel to the skin. Don't try to pull the strip up, as this could bruise or irritate the skin.
Repeat this process all over the leg, taking care not to apply wax to the same area twice (this is very irritating on skin). When you're done, rinse your legs in cool water (not hot) to remove any traces of wax.

, The process for waxing underarm hair is almost identical to waxing your legs. However, removing underarm hair is a little more awkward (as you can only use one hand) and painful (so you may want to take a painkiller or use some numbing cream first).


Before waxing, scrub your underarms clean with a loofah, soap and warm water. This will help to soften the skin and open the pores, making waxing less painful.
When you're ready, apply the hot wax, stroking it on in the same direction as the hair growth. Your underarm hair grows in two directions so make sure you wax this area in two stages against the direction of hair growth.
Put your hand behind your head and stretch your arm back. Press a cloth strip over the hot wax, using firm strokes in the direction of the hair growth. Make sure to leave a little piece of loose cloth at the top of the strip, as this will allow you to grasp it firmly.
After ten seconds, quickly rip the cloth from the skin in the opposite direction to the hair growth. If this movement feels a little awkward to do one-handed, ask a close friend to help you.
Repeat the process with any remaining hair on that armpit, then do the same on the other side. Wash your armpit with cool water to remove any remaining wax and avoid using any deodorants or body sprays over the next few hours.

, Waxing the hair around your bikini line and pubic area can be a little bit scary, but the process is more or less the same as other types of waxing. Just be sure to get a waxing kit designed specifically for this area and remember that hard wax is recommended, as it sticks to coarse hair better.


Before you begin, you will need to decide how much hair you want to remove. Do you just want to remove the hair outside your bikini line? Do your want to make a triangle? A landing strip? If you like, you can give yourself a Brazilian (removing all the hair) but this can be quite tricky and it's recommended that you go to a professional.
Next, wash the skin around the bikini line, as this will help to make the waxing less painful. If the hair is long, trim it with a safety scissors until it's about 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) in length.
Waxing your bikini line will need to be done while lying down, so you can access all areas. Try laying a towel across your bed so you can be comfortable and avoid getting wax on the covers. It might also be helpful to prop a mirror nearby, so you can see exactly want you're doing.
Lie down on the bed, propping your head up with a pillow so you can look down while you work. Use the sticks provided to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth. If you're using hard wax, wait 10 to 15 seconds for it to harden. If you're using regular wax, rub the cloth strips firmly onto the wax.
Pull the skin taut with your free hand, then grab the edge of the cloth or the hardened wax and rip it off in a single fluid motion in the opposite direction to the hair's growth. Try to pull the wax across rather than up, as this is less painful and will cause less irritation.
Work your way around the bikini line, avoiding going over the same skin twice. You can use a tweezers to pluck out any missed hairs at the end. When you're done, you can apply a little baby oil to soothe the area and get rid of any wax residue. Avoid using soap or shower gel around this area for the next 24 hours, as recently waxed skin is easily irritated.

Gather the necessary waxing supplies.,
Wax your upper lip.,
Wax your eyebrows.",How to Wax2," When waxing the skin on your face, it's very important to use a wax kit that's specifically designed for removing facial hair.


This is because the skin on your face is extra sensitive and can easily become irritated if the wrong type of wax is used.
Men should use a facial wax designed for coarser hair, as their facial hair is thicker and more difficult to remove than women's.

, Waxing your upper lip is a relatively easy process, similar to other types of waxing. It is one of the most common areas for women (and men) to wax at home.


If you like, you can use wax strips that will remove upper lip hair without the need for hot wax -- these are relatively cheap, but not as effective as they don't grab onto the hair as well. Just follow the directions on the packaging to use.
If you're opting to use regular wax, use a cream rather than a honey wax, as these are less sticky and easier to control than honey waxes.
Wash your upper lip area (and remove any traces of make-up) and dry thoroughly. Apply the warm wax onto one half of your upper lip, tracing carefully along the lip line. Pressing your tongue against your upper lip can help to extend the skin and make the job easier. Make sure to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth.
Place the cloth strip over the wax, stroking it on in the direction of the hair growth. Wait ten seconds for the wax to cool slightly, then stick your upper lip between your teeth to pull the skin taut (this is important).
Grasp the edge of the strip and quickly pull off the wax strip. Remember to pull your hand across rather than straight up. Press your hand against the waxed area for a few seconds to help with the pain.
Repeat the process on the other side of your lip, then use a tweezers to clean up any stray hairs.

, Waxing your own eyebrows at home is a little trick and usually not recommended for beginners -- this is due to the fact that you are working with hot in the sensitive eye area. In addition, the results are potentially disastrous if you take off half an eyebrow! However, if you definitely feel comfortable with waxing your own eyebrows at home, here's how you do it:


Use a cream wax that you heat up in a wax pot, as these types of waxes are the most gentle on sensitive skin. Clean and dry the eyebrow area fully.
Apply the warm wax onto the underside of the first eyebrow, tracing carefully in order to get the shape that you want (you can consult an eyebrow shaping guide here). Make sure to apply the wax in the direction of the hair growth (away from your nose).
Place the cloth strip over the wax, stroking it on in the direction of the hair growth. Wait ten seconds for the wax to cool slightly, then use one hand to pull the skin of the eyebrow taut and the other to grasp the edge of the cloth.
Quickly pull off the wax strip in the opposite direction to the hair growth. Remember to pull your hand across rather than straight up. Press your hand against the waxed area for a few seconds to help with the pain.
Repeat this process with the other eyebrow, then use a tweezers to clean up any stray hairs. You can either use wax or tweezers to remove any stray hairs between your brows.

"
"
Avoid ingrown hairs.,
Use baby powder.,
Avoid burning yourself with the wax.,
Make sure hair is long enough before you attempt to wax it.,
Don't wax the same area twice.",How to Wax3," You can avoid ingrown hairs by regularly exfoliating and moisturizing your skin in the weeks before and after the waxing session.


Use a body scrub, loofah or washcloth to exfoliate your skin, or make your own exfoliating body scrub using sugar or salt.
Follow up with a lightweight moisturizing lotion -- if your skin feels sensitive after the wax, make sure it is color and fragrance free.

, A good tip to make your waxing session more effective is to sprinkle a little baby powder on your (clean) skin before waxing.


The baby powder soaks up any moisture or oil from the surface of your skin and helps the wax to stick to the hairs better.

, It's important to get the temperature right, as burning yourself with hot wax is no fun at all!


Once you've melted the wax, test the temperature by applying a little to the inside of your wrist. The skin here is very sensitive, so if it feels okay, the wax should be at a safe temperature to apply to the rest of your body.
However, it's important that the wax is not too cold either, otherwise it won't spread properly!

, In order for hair to adhere to the wax and be effectively removed, hair must be at least 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) in length.


Therefore, you should avoid shaving or using any other hair removal methods in the week or two running up to your waxing session. It may be hard to resist -- but you'll get a much smoother result in the end.
You also need to be wary of hair that's too long -- use a safety scissors to trim long hair to about 1/2 on inch in length for more efficient waxing., Waxing the same area twice can be very painful and even damaging to the already-sensitive skin. So if you notice any hairs that you missed, just use a tweezers to pluck them out instead.

Store any leftover wax in the refrigerator.",How to Make Hair Removal Wax at Home," In a medium-heavy saucepan, add the sugar and cook over medium-high heat, without stirring—just an occasional swirl of the pan—until the sugar begins to caramelize. This will smell delicious!;
, Be careful: the sugar will be very foamy, and very hot.









Continue stirring until the mixture has melted and has the consistency of pancake batter. If the mixture is too thick, add water 1 tablespoon at a time until you have the right consistency.

, If you want to use it later, let it cool, then refrigerate it.








, Your hair should ideally be between 1/8-inch and 1/4-inch (3 mm and 6 mm) long.









If your hair is too short, then the wax won't pull the hair out by the roots.
If your hair is too long, you may experience a little bit of discomfort.

, If you don't have strips already, you can cut up or tear up a cotton or linen shirt.









To fix frayed edges, sew around the edges of your strips with a sewing machine.

, Baby powder or cornstarch will absorb body oils and moisture, allowing the wax to stick to the hair (not your skin), making the process much less painful.








, Using a wooden tongue depressor or a spatula, apply your homemade wax where desired. Apply the wax in the direction of hair growth.








, Take a strip of cloth, place it on the wax, and smooth it in with the direction of hair growth.








, Pull lightly on the bottom edge of your fabric strip to see if it sticks well enough.

, Hold your skin taut by pulling at it from a point underneath the edge of your fabric strip and pull the strip off against the direction of hair growth. Do this very quickly. Do not pull it off at a 90° angle, but in a more shallow angle.








, It should keep for a couple of weeks in the refrigerator, or a couple months in the freezer.

Try exfoliating before a bikini wax.,
Wear loose, comfortable clothing to your appointment.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Prepare for a Bikini Waxing1," It’s important that you get a bikini wax from a practitioner you can trust. Ask friends and family if they have suggestions. You should also take time to read reviews of the establishment and practitioner online before booking your appointment., Your hair will need to be at least ¼ inch or 2/3 centimeter long for a bikini wax. If the hair is any shorter than this, the wax will not be able to grab onto the hair. If your hair is not long enough, the practitioner may send you home and have you reschedule the appointment., Gentle exfoliation can help loosen hair from its follicles, which may make the waxing process a little easier and possibly less painful. Try using a washcloth to gently exfoliate the area to be waxed. Make sure you do not rub too hard, or you can cause inflammation., It is important that you don’t show up for your bikini wax wearing tight bottoms, such as a pair of skinny jeans. After your wax you will want to put on loose-fitting bottoms, like a pair of linen pants or a dress. If you feel comfortable, you can forgo underwear after your treatment. If not, wear soft, comfortable panties.

, It is important that you are hydrated when you go in for your bikini wax. This can make the process a little less painful. Try drinking at least 64 ounces the day before and the day of your wax."

Be prepared for a little pain.,
Consider taking ibuprofen an hour before your wax.,
Know that it’s normal to bleed a little.,
Understand the waxed area might be red after the wax.",How to Prepare for a Bikini Waxing2," While some salons might claim that a bikini wax is painless, you should not take such claims at face value. You will experience pain during your wax, especially if it is your first time. The pain, however, should only last for the duration of your wax., Some people recommend taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, like ibuprofen, before you get a bikini wax. This can help mediate some of the pain you might experience when you get a bikini wax. Ask your doctor if taking a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug is a good choice for you., Hair follicles are connected to blood vessels, which means there might be a little blood when the hair is pulled out. You are more likely to bleed a little if it’s your first bikini wax., It is normal to have a little bit of redness after a bikini wax. This will usually last no more than a few hours after the procedure. If you still have redness and inflammation in the days after the wax, call your practitioner."

2 cup (400 g) white sugar
1/4 cup (30 mL) lemon juice, orange juice (squeezed), or vinegar
1/4 cup (180 mL) water
Waxing strips (from the store or a piece of cotton fabric/t-shirt)
Use a large stainless steel pan. If you use an old, decaying pan, some of it may end up swimming in your wax.;
, Get them to a boil and reduce to medium. Stir occasionally.


Watch the pot! Undercooking is reparable; overcooking is not.
If it starts boiling again, lower the heat.

, The wax should slowly turn from translucent to a honey brown. When you reach this point, take it off the heat immediately.


This part is a true science; it can take anywhere from 6-20 minutes. Take a butter knife and see how thick it is (don't touch it!). If it seems to thickly move and stick as it goes, it's ready.
Try dropping it in a glass of water. If it immediately forms a bead and doesn't trail, you're good.
If it's runny and not at all wax-like, pitch it in the trash (not the sink) and start over.

, ...But not too much. Let it cool to the point where it's hot but doesn't burn you. You may have to learn this the hard way.









If it cools too much, it will lose its stick. However, it can be reheated. If you've poured it into a microwaveable container, nuke it till it's malleable again.

, You should start with a clean base. Apply baby/talcum powder to the area. Make sure every last bit is dry!


As you go, you may need to reheat your wax or apply more powder. Apply more powder if you experience more pain or start to sweat.

The level of pain depends on you. For some women, it's not a problem. Don't let this deter you.



, This can be done with a butter knife. If it's too hot, wait a bit. If it's too cold, it won't tear off the hair 100% and will need to be reheated.









Apply in the direction of the hair. Try to have about 1/4 - 1/2 an inch (.63 - 1.2 cm) before you go about waxing; the concoction needs something to adhere to; however, too long and it makes things difficult.
Place a mirror between your legs to get a good look at your undersides.

, Start nearest your navel. Rub the strips into the wax a bit to ensure a clean removal.









You can use waxing strips from the store or cut up an old cotton t-shirt. Sugar wax is water soluble and your strips can be used more than once, if cleaned immediately and thoroughly.
Cut your strips in 1-2 in (2.5-5 cm) strips. The smaller ones can be used for clean-up or hard to reach places.

, Do one or two at a time to keep it manageable. The last thing you want is a bunch of cotton strips stuck down there.









Leave the strip on the area for around 30 seconds, depending on its size. Rip it off (quickly!) in the opposite direction of hair growth.

The quicker the better; you'll experience less pain if you go faster.


Repeat this until all the hair is gone.

, If you have sensitive skin, you may want to apply an oil or lotion to calm the area. Use tweezers to grab any strays.









Of course, clean up any mess you've made, too! Wax can get a bit difficult to deal with when hardened and the sugar may attract ants if left out for an extended period of time.

A waxing product such as Nair Roll-On Wax is a good choice because it has a roll-on applicator that dispenses an even amount of wax over the surface.

, These can be bought (sometimes coming with the wax) or homemade. It's a good idea to make strips of varying sizes (from 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm)).


If you opted for the homemade route, search your closet for an old t-shirt or piece of cotton fabric. Cut it up into strips like you would any other material.

Bonus -- if you take good care of them, you can use them again after a thorough washing (if your wax is water soluble).



, This is super important--the wax needs to stick.


Trim the hair to 1/4 - 1/2 inch (.63 - 1.2 cm) for easiest removal.
Apply baby/talcum powder to the parts you´re going to wax. This makes the wax stick to the hair and NOT your skin, and significantly reduces the amount of pain.
If you pain starts increasing, apply more powder. Especially if the environment you're doing it in is rather warm.

, Have a paper towel or cloth nearby. For waxes that dissolve in water, a damp cloth is fine.


Otherwise, you may moisten a cotton ball with simple baby oil. That removes excess wax very well and leaves skin smooth.

, Apply the wax in the same direction the hair grows, in thin strips.


With one hand, stretch that skin taut. Use paper towels to grip the skin so that it does not slip.
Rip off the wax with the other hand in the opposite direction to hair growth. Doing this gives you better results and hurts much less.
Do not apply too much wax as the waxing strips may not adhere to the hair.
Place a mirror between your legs so that you can wax the areas you cannot see. A compact mirror is sufficient.

, Because the bikini area is very sensitive, it may take more than one session to remove all the hair.


Hair in some areas may be easier to remove than others. This is contingent upon how thick the hair is. You may have to stop if the area becomes too red and continue after the redness subsides.
Use tweezers to pluck out remaining hair rather than waxing repeatedly.

, You may have bits of wax that are playing hard to get.


Use warm water and apply a soothing oil or lotion.

You don't need to use a special scrub. All you need is a washcloth or bath pouffe with soap. Make sure to do this at least a day before your wax.
, This is important for hygiene, since you should not shower for at least 24 hours after waxing. Don't use this time to exfoliate if you forgot to do so the day before.You do not want to cause unnecessary irritation right before a wax., This will ensure comfort after your wax. Cotton underwear and a dress is perfect.  

Avoid wearing tight fitting clothing like yoga pants or skinny jeans.

, For 24 hours: Avoid sex or other activities such as sitting in the bath or swimming for 24 hours after you wax. Open hair follicles are especially susceptible to bacteria and irritation during this time., During shower time, lightly exfoliate the area daily.

Use over-the-counter painkillers for waxing pains.",How to Wax a Unibrow1," While most people are able to wax without any problems, for some, waxing can cause minor skin irritation. If you've never waxed before, you probably don't have any idea how your skin will react to the wax. For this reason, it's a good idea to wax a few days before any major events that you want to look good for — if your skin between your eyebrows does get irritated, it will have a chance to recover before you need to show it off.


Though this is rare, some people are allergic to hair-removal wax and can experience symptoms like rash and folliculitis when they come into contact with it.If you're unsure whether you're allergic, it's a good idea to apply some of the wax to an area of your body that isn't usually visible (like your side or your upper leg) before using it on your face. If your skin reacts with rash or pustules, you probably should not use the wax for your unibrow.;
, Cleanliness is important for a good waxing procedure. Since the wax can remove not only unwanted hairs but also the very top layer of skin, infection is a very small (but real) risk. For this reason, you'll want to wash your face with gentle soap and a clean towel before beginning to kill any bacteria or other microbes which may cause problems.


Don't forget to wash your hands, too (or, if a friend is helping you, have this person wash their hands). Harmful bacteria can be present on the hands after all kinds of mundane activities (like, for instance, eating), so you don't want unwashed hands anywhere near your delicate skin post-wax., Most waxing products come in one of two forms: cold and hot.Cold wax, which comes pre-attached to the removal strip, is the slightly easier and more convenient option. Hot wax, on the other hand, must be heated, applied, and then removed with a separate strap. If you're using hot wax, start heating it now according to the provided instructions — you can do the next step while you wait for it to warm up.


If you're using hot wax, be careful not to heat it to an uncomfortable or dangerous temperature. A burn between your eyebrows can be seriously painful (and won’t look great, either). Also, because you’re working so close to your eyes, you’ll want to avoid extremely hot wax to minimize the potential for damage in worst-case spillage scenarios., As noted above, waxing can be somewhat hard on the skin. To minimize its unpleasant effects, try sprinkling just a little baby powder in the area you plan to apply the wax (in this case, between your eye brows). Not only will this make the application and removal of the wax slightly more comfortable, but also remove any excess oil or moisture from the skin and hair, giving the wax a better ""grip"" on the hair when it is applied.

, When you're ready to begin, start applying the wax to the portion of your unibrow that you want to remove — usually, this will be the quarter-to-half-inch between your eye brows.The way you do this is slightly different for cold and hot wax applications:


For cold wax strips, simply press the sticky side of the strip firmly between your eye brows and rub it in to ensure a good hold.
For hot wax, use the provided applicator or a convenient spreading tool like a popsicle stick or butter knife to apply the wax in the correct area between your eyebrows. Press the provided fabric strips into the wax until they are well-adhered.
Be very conservative about ‘‘where’’ you apply your wax and how much you use — you don’t want to accidentally remove the tips of your eye brows. Always err on the side of using too little wax. Remember, if you don’t get every last hair in between your eyebrows, you can always wax again. However, if you get too much hair, you’ll have to wait for it to grow back!

, If you're using hot wax, give it a few minutes to harden and solidify before removing it. As it hardens, it will tighten around the hairs, essentially ""trapping"" them in the wax. If you're using cold wax, simply press the adhesive wax into the troublesome hair and it will naturally adhere.


When you're ready, remove the strip by pulling in one quick motion against the direction of hair growth. Since most people's eyebrow hair grows up towards the forehead, this means grabbing the top of the strip and pulling down.
Don't hesitate! This part is like pulling off a band-aid: the quicker you do it, the less it hurts.

, After you pull off the removal strip, you should see the hair you removed stuck in the wax. There may still be some excess wax stuck to your skin at this point. This can usually be removed with a special wax-removal products, which are usually sold at the same places you would buy the wax itself (beauty stores, salons, department stores, etc.) It's also possible to remove the wax with baby oil or any other moderate oil suitable for facial use.


If you use oil, try to pick a non-scented variety. Artificial fragrances can sometimes irritate delicate skin or cause allergic reactions., After you're done waxing, check your work with a magnifying mirror. You should see much less hair (if any) between your eyebrows. However, wax-jobs sometimes aren't perfect and may leave behind stray hairs. In this case, you may want to wax again, but if there are only a few unwanted hairs left, if may be quicker and easier simply to use a pair of tweezers.


Tweezers are easy to use — working with a mirror, carefully grab each individual hair and remove it with a firm yank. Like waxing itself, tweeze-ing hairs is much less painful if you go quickly.

, Even if you wax perfectly, your skin may be somewhat irritated after waxing (after all, you have just removed your hairs directly from their follicles). If your skin is red or inflamed after waxing and you don't have time to wait for it to subside naturally, try covering it up with a small amount of flesh-toned makeup. Unless your skin irritation is major or you're allergic (which should have become apparent after your initial wax test), you should look just fine.

, While the skin may be a little sensitive after waxing, in general, any serious pain should subside fairly quickly. If the space between your eyebrows still stings more than 15 minutes or so after waxing, take a single dose of an over-the-counter painkiller like Motrin, Tylenol, or Aleve to make the pain more bearable. Check the label before you take the painkiller — painkillers with anti-inflammatory properties are best because they will also make your skin slightly less irritated.


You may also want to consider using a numbing product before you wax. These helpful substances, which are usually available as creams or sprays, numb the skin temporarily, making waxing much less painful."

Mix one cup of sugar, ⅛ cup water, and ⅛ cup lemon juice.,
Heat your ingredients on the stove.,
Remove from heat.,
Apply and remove wax as normal.,
Try adding your favorite scents.",How to Wax a Unibrow2," If you don't have any commercial wax handy, don't worry! It's easy to clean up your eyebrows with a homemade recipe that uses just a few common ingredients. To begin, combine one part water, one part lemon juice, and eight parts sugar in a mixing bowl. We've provided measurement suggestions above, but the recipe is very easy to adjust as long as you keep the ratios of the ingredients the same.


This recipe is similar to an ancient Egyptian technique known as ""body sugaring.""This old technique works the same as modern waxing — it just uses ingredients that were available thousands of years ago.

, Pour your slushy mix into a saucepan and start to warm it over low heat on the stove. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the mixture's temperature carefully. You don't want it to boil over, so it's important not to heat it too quickly. Heat the mixture to 250o F (121o C) before continuing.


At this temperature, the sugar enters what culinary experts call the ""hardball"" candy stage, gaining a thick, tacky, adhesive quality — perfect for waxing.

, At 250o F (or when bubbles appear), remove the sugar mixture from the heat. Pour it into a clean bowl. Allow the sugar mixture to cool to a temperature that isn't painful to the touch but is still ""liquid"" enough to use for waxing. This should take no more than fifteen minutes.

, At this point, you can use your homemade sugar wax basically the same way you would use ordinary artificial wax. Use a clean applicator like a piece of silverware or a popsicle stick to apply a thin layer of wax to the hair between your eyebrows in the same direction as the hair growth. Press a thin strip of cloth into the sugar wax. Wait for the sugar wax to harden, then tear the strip away from the skin opposite the direction of skin growth.


You'll probably have some leftover sugar wax when you're done — you can save this in the refrigerator in a sealed container. When you want to use it again, you can simply warm it in the microwave. You don't need to warm it on the stove again., The great thing about this recipe is that it's extremely versatile — it's easy to change it to fit your needs. For instance, to give your sugar wax the scent of your choice, all you need to do is add a little of your favorite fragrance during the cooling phase. Below are just a few things you may want to consider adding to make your wax more appealing:


Crushed lavender petals
Shredded mint leaves
Shredded basil leaves
Peppermint extract
Orange peel
Sandalwood extract

Keep the area clean.,
Exfoliate daily to treat ingrown hairs.,
Use a warm compress and hydrogen peroxide for painful ingrown hairs.,
Use a hydrocortisone cream.,
Talk to your dermatologist.",How to Get Rid of Bumps After Waxing1," It’s important that you keep the waxed area clean, especially during the first few days following a wax. Sweat and dirt can get trapped on freshly waxed skin, contributing to the development of those pesky bumps. Try showering at least once a day and making sure you clean the waxed area thoroughly during your shower., Dead skin cells can build up after you get a wax, clogging the hair follicle and causing ingrown hairs. After you wax, make sure you exfoliate the area every day. Try swapping out your regular washcloth for an exfoliating cloth. Then gently rub the wet exfoliating cloth over the waxed area with your favorite soap or body wash.You can buy an exfoliating cloth at your local drug store or online.
You can also try a topical exfoliating product, like a post-wax cream that contains salicylic acid. Be sure to carefully follow the directions on the package.

, If you have post-wax bumps that are painful to the touch and/or feel pressurized under the skin’s surface, you might have infected ingrown hairs. If this is the case, take a warm compress and apply it to the affected area. Leave the compress on for 1-2 minutes, and then swipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide., Calming inflammation after a wax can help eliminate post-wax bumps. Dab a small amount of one-percent hydrocortisone cream on the waxed area after your procedure. For example, a pea-sized amount works well after a brow wax. Use more for a larger area., If you frequently get bumps after waxing, you might want to make an appointment with your dermatologist. They can determine what is causing the bumps, and whether waxing is the best way to remove unwanted hair. For example, they may suggest a depilatory or laser treatments instead of waxing."

Use a gentle cleanser after waxing.,
Apply witch hazel after waxing.,
Don’t apply lotions or oils after a wax.,
Try a cold compress after waxing.,
Wear loose clothing.",How to Get Rid of Bumps After Waxing2," After you are finished waxing an area, gently wash it with a mild cleanser. Don’t use soap or scrubs, as both can irritate the freshly waxed skin. For example, after you wax your eyebrows, wash your face with an everyday, gentle facial cleanser., You can soothe freshly waxed skin with a gentle application of witch hazel. Dip a cotton ball in with hazel. Then, smooth it across the area that was waxed. You can purchase with hazel at your local drug store or online., Lotions, oils, and other types of moisturizers can clog the pores of freshly waxed skin. Avoid applying these products right after a wax. If you find your skin needs extra moisture, try aloe vera gel instead., One way to cut down on the bumps some people get after waxing is by icing. Apply ice to the waxed area to help reduce inflammation. Make sure the ice pack or bag containing ice is clean so that you do not inadvertently introduce bacteria and dirt to your waxed skin., Tight clothes can trap dirt and sweat, contributing to the appearance of post-wax bumps. Try wearing loose, breathable clothing after a wax. This will allow your skin to breathe and may help prevent the appearance or exacerbation of unsightly bumps.For example, you should avoid wearing tights after a bikini wax. Instead, opt for loose fitting pants or a skirt.

Choose the badger shaving brush according to your needs and budget.",How to Care for a Badger Shaving Brush1," While the cleaning methods provided in this article are appropriate for each type of brush, it is helpful to understand the way in which badger shaving brushes are ""graded"" (noting, however, that there is no standard naming convention, so name variations are given here):


Pure badger, or dark badger (standard) - the hair used here is derived from the stomach, shoulders, neck, and buttocks of the badger. This hair is usually very dark and it is coarser than other types of badger brush. Brushes made from this hair tend to be machine assembled, and they are the most affordable version of the badger shaving brush range.Gray badger, standard, pure - this hair is taken from the tail and back of the badger. It is lighter, almost gray. Again, this version tends to be machine assembled.
Premium badger, finest, tapered, or best badger - this hair is taken from the back of the badger and the color band varies from light, to dark band, to light again. The tips of the hairs are thinner than the base and this makes them soft. This version is usually assembled by hand and is expensive. It is thought to be best for light beards.
Silver tips/silver-tip badger, sometimes referred to as ""super"", (although that can mean it is slightly inferior to the silver-tip) - this type of brush uses only neck hair that lightens during winter, making it very expensive.It is white, with a small dark band. It is very soft and is suitable for men with skin conditions.;

Wash a new badger shaving brush well before using it.,
Let it dry.",How to Care for a Badger Shaving Brush2," Prior to its first use, a new badger shaving brush should be washed gently but thoroughly, using warm soapy water.


Be prepared for some hairs to come loose. When you get a new brush, it is quite natural for a few loose hairs to come away from the brush in the first few weeks–these are shorter hairs that did not quite reach the glue base and this should not be a cause for concern.

, Place the shaving brush in its holder with the bristles facing down. Before storing, it is always important to allow the shaving brush to dry thoroughly, as leaving it wet and damp can damage the bristles. As shown in the image, run your clean thumb across the brush to check that it is dry.

"
"
Wet the brush thoroughly before use.,
Rinse the brush.,
Flick the excess water away and place the brush in a stand with the hair pointing down.,
Be sure that your brush has air.,
Clean if needed.",How to Care for a Badger Shaving Brush3," Dip the tip of the brush into the shaving cream or soap (you can use a shaving bowl). Lather gently using a light circular or up-and-down motion. When applying the shaving cream or soap, avoid applying so much pressure that the badger hair splays - be gentle.

, After shaving, rinse the brush gently but thoroughly in clean, warm water.

, If you do not have a stand, leave the brush pointing out rather than horizontal, so that air can get to all hairs and dry the brush naturally.

, Natural hair that is left wet can develop mildew; try to avoid enclosing a wet brush in a too small space.


If you keep it in the bathroom cabinet, make sure that it has sufficient space to dry.
If you shave away from home and keep your shaving brush in a travel tube or kit bag, give it an opportunity to dry as soon as you can.

, If your brush becomes affected by mildew or a build-up of soap, soak it in a solution of borax, which can be obtained from a pharmacy.

Use a gentle cleanser on your face.,
Moisturize well with a lotion or oil.,
Try natural anti-inflammatories like cucumber and tea.,
Calm redness with your diet.,
Use a green-tinted foundation or coverup.",How to Get Rid of Red and Irritated Skin on a Nose1," Use a mild facial cleanser when you wash your face to keep the pores on your nose open and clean. Pat your face dry with a clean towel instead of rubbing it, which can create redness.


Try a cleanser that includes salicylic acid if you experience acne on the nose. However, test out any product with salicylic acid first, as some are allergic to the ingredient, which will make redness much worse. Look for cleansers made for sensitive skin if you have bad reactions to ingredients like this.
Use exfoliating cleansers carefully or avoid them altogether if they create a burning, itching, or irritation after use. You may also want to avoid harsh toners, astringents, or products containing alcohol to lessen irritation.;
, Use a moisturizer intended for the face or a pure oil to help keep the skin of your nose hydrated and soothed. Try a cream specifically meant to reduce redness, or simply a natural oil of your choice.


If you want to try a medicated moisturizer, look for over-the-counter varieties that contain ingredients like licorice or feverfew, which are natural anti-inflammatories.Try applying pure coconut or almond oil to your nose as a moisturizer, as they are both natural emollients.You can use a small amount after cleansing your face and let your skin absorb it, or use more and gently wash away the excess after several minutes.
Always apply a moisturizer to your nose after cleansing and before bed to ensure it remains hydrated throughout the day and night. You can moisturize several times throughout the day if you’re prone to very dry skin or live in a dry and cold climate.

, Use ingredients that may have an anti-inflammatory effect directly on the skin of the nose to help soothe it and reduce redness. Try applying pureed cucumber to the face as a mask, or brewing green, chamomile, or peppermint tea and putting it on the nose with a washcloth.You can also make a mask out of oatmeal. Look for 100% pure colloidal oatmeal if you can, and mix it with enough water to make a paste. Leave the paste on your skin for 10 minutes before rinsing it off. You can also add milk, honey, or aloe vera for additional soothing effect.
Keep any homemade or storebought face treatment in the refrigerator before use for an extra cooling effect. Even a plain cold washcloth over the nose can reduce redness quickly., Pay attention to food and drink that seems to trigger redness or irritation on your nose and face. Avoid known allergies and sensitivities, and favor cooling, anti-inflammatory foods and beverages.


Generally, it’s beneficial to avoid hot and spicy foods, alcohol, hot drinks, and anything else that you notice gives you a flushed complexion after consuming. This is especially important to note for those with persisting skin conditions that cause redness like rosacea.Try incorporating more cooling and anti-inflammatory foods into your diet, such as melon, cucumber, coconut, spinach, celery, etc., If you can’t reduce redness and irritation completely with other methods, use makeup to even out the red tone in your skin. Try facial makeup that has a slightly green tint to counteract red tones.


Make sure your face is well cleansed and moisturized before applying makeup. Dab small dots of foundation or concealer onto your nose, then rub in with your finger or a makeup sponge to blend evenly, without applying too much.If you are unsure of what shade of makeup to apply or how to apply it, consult a makeup professional for assistance.

Use petroleum jelly, chapstick, or moisturizer.,
Blow your nose with a soft handkerchief.,
Protect your nose and face outdoors.,
Use a humidifier at night.",How to Get Rid of Red and Irritated Skin on a Nose2," Use a thick and lasting moisturizer or humectant on your nose to prevent redness and irritation during cold or allergy season. Apply a thick moisturizer on the nose, focusing on the nostril area, as often as needed when you’re blowing your nose frequently.


Use common chapstick products that include camphor or eucalyptus for the added benefit of helping clear nasal passages. You can also try pure eucalyptus oil or Vitamin E oil for soothing moisture.Make sure to use a moisturizer, petroleum jelly, or chapstick that is unscented and gentle. A highly scented variety or one that’s irritating to your skin will only cause extra irritation when the skin around the nose is already dry and cracked.

, Try using a handkerchief made of soft cotton to blow your nose instead of a disposable tissue. This prevents the irritation that can occur from a rough paper tissue over time.


Look for a soft cotton flannel or brushed cotton for a material that will not irritate your skin easily. You can make your own handkerchief just by cutting a square from an unused item of clothing in the desired fabric.
If you do choose disposable tissues, try ones that include moisturizers like vitamin E and aloe. Do your best to blot at the nose rather than rub or wipe to reduce irritation by friction., Keep your nose warm and protected in cold and dry climates by wearing something over your face. Try wrapping a scarf around your head so it covers your nose, or even a ski mask to keep your whole face warm easily.


Ensure that you can still breathe easily by leaving a slit in a scarf to breathe through your mouth. However, covering both your nose and mouth loosely with fabric will help to keep your nose warm due to the warm air and moisture created by your breath.
Wearing a scarf or hat will also lessen the flush of red skin that occurs when a cold face warms up rapidly as you step indoors., Use a humidifier in the room of the house you’re occupying while recovering from a cold or during dry winter months, especially overnight. The extra humidity in the air created by these machines helps keep the skin of your nose hydrated and less irritated.


Also turn down the heat in your home if you can during the winter. This will avoid the extra drying effect that comes from central heat.
If you don’t have a humidifier, simply take a large bowl of steaming hot water and put your face near enough to it to remain comfortable. Place a towel over your head and over the bowl to trap the steam in, then breathe in the warm steam for several minutes to soothe both your nasal passages and the skin on your nose."

Wear high SPF sunscreen on your nose.,
Wear a hat and stay in the shade.,
Soothe with aloe and moisturizers after sunburn.,
Drink lots of water.",How to Get Rid of Red and Irritated Skin on a Nose3," Put on sunscreen 15 minutes before you go outside, paying particular attention to your nose, which sticks out from your face and is more prone to sunburn. Choose a broad-spectrum sunscreen with 30 SPF or higher, and apply it every two hours and after swimming or sweating.If you have trouble remembering to put on sunscreen before you go out, use a moisturizer with SPF in it as part of your daily routine. Many foundations, BB creams, and powder makeup also include some SPF for additional protection.
If you’re prone to breakouts or problems with excess oil on the nose, opt for a sunscreen meant for faces, as they are often formulated without oils.

, Opt for a hat and shade from an umbrella in addition to wearing sunscreen to protect the nose. Choose a wide-brimmed hat that creates full shade for your face.


Seek shade particularly at times of the day when your shadow is shorter than you are, i.e. 12:00-2:00 PM.Remember that even full shade from a hat or umbrella does not block all UV rays, nor do clouds on an overcast day. For best results, take all skin protection measures possible, applying sunscreen regularly or wearing full-coverage clothing even when under shade or clouds.

, Apply aloe vera fresh from the plant or from a 100% aloe vera product to soothe sunburn on the nose. Continue to apply aloe and other hydrating moisturizers regularly until a sunburn heals.


Keep aloe vera in the fridge or freezer for an extra cooling effect.
You can also take aloe vera internally by drinking a 100% aloe vera juice product. This may have some benefit to your body’s overall anti-inflammatory response.

, Be sure to drink water before, during, and particularly after sun exposure. This keeps the body and skin hydrated, and will lessen the irritation and dryness of a sunburn on the nose or anywhere else on the body.


If you have trouble remembering to drink water, keep a large bottle with you and commit to drinking it all by the end of the day. Bring a whole gallon jug with you if know you’ll be outside for an extended period of time.
Jazz up your water if you need or want to with fresh lemon slices or drops that add flavor and electrolytes. Just stay away from high-sugar drink mixes, and don’t substitute soda or alcohol for water when you’re thirsty, as these will actually make you more dehydrated, which does not help the skin.

List the benefits of a bare chest.,
Remind him of the hygienic benefits of a bare chest.,
Explain how much better his tan will look.,
Point out that bare chests are “in.” Some of the most handsome men in Hollywood rock a hairless chest, like Zac Efron, David Beckham and Justin Bieber.Long gone is the 70’s open-shirt, hair-spilling fashion––less hair on the chest is definitely considered to be more appealing by current fashion standards.

,
Say that bare chests look better in dress shirts and sheer shirts.",How to Convince a Very Hairy Man to Shave His Chest1," A lot of men use logic to make decisions, so list off some logical reasons why shaving his chest is wise. Telling someone that, “it would be awesome” is not extremely convincing, so give him concrete reasons to start convincing him. Go into the conversation with ideas of what you want to say., Ridding his chest of the hair will reduce breakouts. The chest hair can act as a barrier between the soap and the skin, which can increase the risk of breakouts in this area. Less hair means that less bacteria and debris will be trapped below the hair. Additionally, removing chest hair can help reduce body odor as well. Chest hair can increase body heat, causing him to sweat.If he removes his chest hair, he will be a cleaner, and cooler, man!


If your guy is a clean freak, this may not actually be an issue for him. However, it never hurts to list all of the information you have.

, A bare chest is much easier to tan.If your man wants a nice, even bronze then he should remove the chest hair. It’s easier to get a good tan on exposed skin than one that is covered with hair.


If he doesn’t care about his tan, you can sweetly tell him that you think he looks very handsome with a sun-kissed glow. Your opinion just might probably sway him.

,, Wiry chest hair can be seen straight through shirts made of lighter fabric. This typically isn’t the best or most appropriate look.Wearing an undershirt can fix this problem, but that can get old— and certainly uncomfortable during warmer months! By shaving his chest, he can slip a sheer dress shirt on without a second thought.


This is an especially convincing reason for any guys who dress up regularly for work.

See a doctor if an infection occurs.",How to Do a Male Brazilian Wax," Waxing is generally a safe practice, but any time you rip hair from your skin there are a few things that can go wrong. These issues can happen at a salon as well, but most professional waxers take measures to avoid them. Here's what to look out for:


First of all, waxing (as well as all other types of hair removal) puts you at risk for getting ingrown hairs, which are hairs that grow back into the skin. This results in a bump that can become irritated and painful. Using the right waxing technique and aftercare can help prevent ingrown hairs.You're also at risk of burning yourself with hot wax. However, testing your wax in a less sensitive area, like the back of your hand, before applying it to your nether regions will help you avoid getting a burn.
Some people who wax, especially the first time, get folliculitis, which is an inflammation of the hair follicle. This is usually clears up on its own within a week, and its less likely to occur if you use the right aftercare.
Consider getting salon experience first. That way you'll get a sense of how the procedure is done and how to best avoid an unpleasant outcome. Look for a unisex salon with lots of great reviews by men who got a Brazilian there. If after trying a salon you decide you can handle the process yourself, read on.;
, You can buy wax online, from a professional waxing salon, or at the drugstore. Since you're waxing your most sensitive skin, it's very important to get the right kind of wax. Make sure it's specifically meant to be used in a Brazilian wax. Do not use regular leg wax or body wax!


Your kit should come with a pot of wax to be heated (either in the microwave or using a wax warmer), waxing strips, waxing sticks, and finishing oil.
Some people like to make their own wax using a mixture of honey, sugar and other ingredients. If you go this route, be sure to test it on another part of your body to make sure it takes off the hair cleanly without getting stuck to your skin.

, The bathroom is the best spot, since it's easier to clean wax off of tile than carpeting or wood. However, you're definitely going to need room to stretch out and move around, so if you're bathroom is on the smaller side, use a different room.


Lay out a plastic tarp, some old newspaper, or another covering to protect your floor.
Have some paper towels and oil handy for cleanup. Mineral oil, olive oil, or any other type of oil will immediately take wax off of most surfaces (including your skin).

, You want to trim your hair to just under 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) long. Any hair that is shorter than 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) is going to be very difficult to remove, and could result in pulled skin and a lot of pain. The same goes for hair longer than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm). Use a scissors to trim your hair to an even length wherever you plan to wax.

, This helps prep your skin to release the hairs more easily by opening up your pores a bit. Time your shower so that your skin is still warm and supple when you begin waxing.


Exfoliate your skin while you're in the shower. Taking off the dead skin cells will give you a cleaner wax. Carefully scrub the entire area you plan to wax using a loofah or some body scrub.
Dry yourself off completely when you're finished. Your skin must be dry before you start waxing.
Don't put on lotion or oil after your shower.
If you want, you can sprinkle on a little baby powder. This helps to keep the wax from adhering to the skin.

, Read the instructions that came with your waxing kit carefully, and heat up the wax until all of it is melted and runny. Stir it up with one of the waxing sticks. Once it's melted, test it by putting a small dab on the back of your hand. If the wax feels too hot, wait for it to cool down a bit before starting. If it's difficult to spread, you'll need to heat it up a bit more.


Throughout the waxing process, you might need to pause to reheat the wax, especially if this is your first time waxing - you don't want to rush things! If you don't want to bother running to the microwave every 10 minutes, consider buying a wax warmer to keep it from cooling off.

, This is the hair that's easiest to remove. Once you experience how it feels to take it off you can decide whether you want to proceed to the parts that are more difficult to reach. Lift the penis up towards you to begin removing hair on the shaft of the penis, then turn it on the side and remove the hair there and the other side of the penis as well.

, Do not apply a pool of wax all at once - that will result in a tangled mess. Dip a waxing stick in your tub of wax and apply a patch - less than 1 inch (2.5 cm) square - to an area of hair. Removing just a little at a time is the best way to manage the discomfort and ensure that you don't end up hurting yourself.


Apply with wax in the direction of your hair growth. It grows in all different directions down there, so be careful to examine each patch of hair before apply the wax.
Use the stick to apply the wax in one smooth stroke, like you're spreading cheese on a cracker. Don't rub it in or move the stick from side to side.
Switch out the waxing sticks frequently. This helps keep things sanitary and prevent infection.

, This is very important: do not pull in the same direction as the hair growth. The hair will not come out cleanly unless you pull against the growth. Here's what you need to do to get a clean pull:


After you lay down the strip, pat it lightly so it adheres to the wax.
Use one hand to hold your skin in place near where you placed the strip. This is especially important if you're waxing looser skin.
Grasp the waxing strip between your thumb and forefinger.
Pull the strip back in a smooth, quick motion. Don't try to do it slowly!

, Use two fingers to stretch a patch of skin so that you won't pull it too much when you wax. Use this method to continue applying wax in very small patches and keep waxing it off until the scrotum is completely hair-free.

, If you have hair growth behind your scrotum and back toward your anus, you may need to get flexible to reach everything that needs to get waxed. Move your legs into a comfortable position so that you can access the area between them. Keep waxing in small patches until you're satisfied with the amount of hair you've removed.

, There are likely a few stray hairs that you missed. You can either go back and get them with a little more wax or use a tweezers to remove them one by one.

, Rub the oil that came with your waxing kit (or another oil made for use on skin) to remove those bits of wax that are still stuck to your body. Gently massaging the dried wax with oil should loosen it right away. Then hop back in the shower and rinse yourself off with warm water.


Once all the wax is off, you can use a mild body wash to wash the area.
Don't use bar soap, which can leave a film that leads to ingrown hairs., A natural moisturizer (nothing loaded with chemicals) will help soothe your skin, which may be red and irritated after your wax. Use a natural body lotion or a bit of coconut oil to treat the area. This will help prevent infection and ingrown hairs.


If your skin feels inflamed even after moisturizing, apply a cool compress to help the inflammation go down.

, Your skin needs room to breathe and heal, and constricting it under tight clothing won't help. If you have time, spend a few hours wearing nothing but your bathrobe around the house. For the next few days, wear boxers instead of briefs, and stay of skinny jeans until the waxed area is no longer red.

, Your tender skin will be susceptible to getting infected, so it's best to wait until it's no longer red and inflamed before having sex.

, The sensitive, pale skin you just waxed could easily burn when exposed to the sun or a tanning bed. It's probably best to avoid tanning this area altogether, but if you're planning to tan, wait several days after waxing to give your skin time to heal.

, If you end up with an ingrown hair or another inflamed spot that grows increasingly irritated, you may need to have it looked into by a doctor.

Make him consider the snuggle factor.,
Say you love to see his bare skin.,
Explain that soft, bare chests are very kiss-worthy.",How to Convince a Very Hairy Man to Shave His Chest2," Most men are very sexual creatures. If a guy thinks that shaving his chest will persuade you to have sex with him, that may be all you need to convince him.Be careful not to insult him. Don't tell him that you are repulsed by his hairy chest. Simply tell him that you find hairless chests very sexy.

, Tell him that snuggling up to a hairless chest is considerably more comfortable. Play with his heartstrings– tell him that you love being near him, but the hairs in your mouth or on your cheek make you less inclined to cuddle up with him. What guy wants to hear that his lady is repelled by his chest hair?

, What guy doesn’t want to show off his six pack? Even if he only has a two pack, tell him how much you like his body. Your man will be flattered, and hopefully more willing to show off the goods by removing the excess hair. Repeatedly tell him you love a sexy bare chest., Let him know you're more inclined to kiss a bare chest than one that is all hairy.

Tell him that a professional will make the process easy and mess-free.,
Recommend a place that specializes in men.,
Make sure he knows his hair removal options.,
Avoid nagging your hairy man.",How to Convince a Very Hairy Man to Shave His Chest3," One reason he may balk at the thought of hair removal is the effort he’d have to put in. It can be a time-consuming commitment, and it can certainly create a big mess. If he has particularly thick or coarse hair, the process can be a bit painful as well. By going to a professional, he can get a perfectly smooth chest without having to worry about purchasing the proper supplies or cleaning up afterwards.


A professional knows how to shave the chest to avoid razor burn and/or irritation. Between the technique and professional grade shaving cream and lotion, your man will be thrilled with the result.

, If he’s worried about being emasculated by getting his chest shaved, find a no-frills, masculine place to take him. Show him the place you’re suggesting, and find reviews from other men if you can. Many men will be too shy to visit the hair and nail salon for a chest shaving. Finding a place he feels comfortable can make all the difference.

, Some men assume they’ll have to shave every day, but remind him that waxing and laser treatments are great options as well.To make things easy for him, you can even tell him the pros and cons of the different possibilities, such as cost, pain, and upkeep. Not only will he have the information right at his fingertips, this will also show him how much you’d like him to seriously consider hair removal.


Talk about the methods you know of that reduce the pain, such as numbing creams, steaming, Advil, and even drinking whiskey.
Remind him that having it removed professionally means less pain overall.

, Spell out your preferences, but remember that he is the one who needs to make the choice about this. If he isn't convinced by what you've suggested and wants to keep his hairy chest, then it's acceptance time. He is aware of your preference, but badgering him will only cause a fight.Just let your reasons filter through over time— eventually, he may agree but on his own terms, in his own time and only when it seems like he's reached the decision. Ultimately, remember that there is more to a relationship than body hair.


Your man may prefer a certain hairstyle or look on you, but you wouldn’t want to hear about it day in and day out. Put yourself in his shoes, and remind yourself that it’s his body, his choice.

Wash your hands with soap and water.",How to Get a Bad Smell off Your Hands1," Before attempting an alternative remedy, it is best to try to eliminate the smell by washing with hand soap and water.

While findings have been inconclusive as to the mechanics of this process, it is generally thought that the sulfur in the garlic (and in many other odorous compounds) binds with the chromium in the stainless steel. This is why stainless steel must be used, and not other iron alloys, as they do not contain chromium.;

Wait for a few minutes.,
Squeeze the tube.",How to Get the Last of the Toothpaste out of the Tube1," To begin, heat some water in a pot on your stove or using an electric kettle. The water should be hot, but not boiling. Then transfer the water to a bowl., Stand the tube of toothpaste on its cap, submerged in the bowl of hot water. (You may need to lean it against the edge.) Be sure that the cap is screwed on tightly., In order for this process to work, you will want to let this sit for three to five minutes. You can set a timer for yourself, or put on a song this length to pass the time., After the toothpaste has been warmed up, it should exit the tube quickly and easily. Simply squeeze the tube as you normally would and use the last bit of toothpaste.You may want to squeeze any excess toothpaste into a glass jar or Tupperware container; otherwise you may need to repeat this process.

, A scented type is preferable. Every three to six hours (depending on how much you need), put some deodorant on. The smell will also make you feel washed.

, You do not even have to use soap. Even though a shower might not be possible, washing your face is always an easy option. Whether it is in a public bathroom or with a water bottle and tissue, washing your face is one of the most basic ways to feel clean.

, Avoid eyeliners, mascara, heavy lipstick, and eyeshadow. These will most likely smudge during long stretches of time and will make your face feel heavy. Try to stick with a pretty scented or tinted lip balm. You can also use a light foundation. However, too much makeup will smear.

, Here too, scented moisturizer is good. Apply some to your face (without makeup) or your arms and legs. It will relax you and act as a soap.

, On long trips, many people have the tendency to pick or bite their nails. If you keep a nail file with you, not only will you have something to fiddle with, it will keep your nails looking pretty.

, Socks can get dirty easily, so changing them often will make your feet feel pampered. Make use of the socks some airlines give you. You can use moisturizer on your feet in-between changes, too.

, If you brush your teeth after every plane meal, you will feel ""minty fresh"". However, if a toothbrush is not handy, take a mint every so often. They provide something to chew on and give you good breath. Again, some airlines will provide you with a toothbrush and toothpaste- make use of it.

Educate teens about puberty.,
Have someone the teen looks up to talk to them.,
Avoid humiliating teens.",How to Get a Teen to Shower Regularly1," Any teen is likely to have some education about what happens during puberty, but they may also not realize the impact of body odor. Furthermore, many teens may know what to expect, but they simply may not realize that it already applies to them. Remember, it isn’t like a teen just wakes up one day knowing they have gone through puberty. Instead, it is a gradual process, and they simply may not realize they are smelly.Ideally, you should start talking to your child about puberty before they reach it, and before they are a teenager.
For example, you should explain that when people go through puberty, their body does things differently than it did before. They will sweat, but now this sweat will be smelly. Not only that, but they will grow hair in new places, and this hair can make that smell worse.;
, If the teen is the type that doesn't believe a word you say, see if you can enlist the help of someone your teen really looks up to. For example, if you are the mom of a teen boy, he may be more likely to listen to a man that he looks up to, such as his father, uncle, grandfather, or even a close family friend.If the person that is going to talk to him isn’t sure what to say, give them a few pointers. Point out that they should be delicate, and try their best not to make your teen feel embarrassed.

, When talking with teens about hygiene and showering, it is really important to do your best to avoid making them feel embarrassed. With topics such as hygiene, this can be very easy to do. If they feel embarrassed, they will likely become defensive almost immediately, and they aren’t going to want to listen to anything you are saying, no matter how logical it is.Be empathetic and remember that the teenage years can be really tough and confusing. You can say, for example, “I know that it can be really tough at your age, and this may be at the bottom of your list of priorities, but remember that taking care of your hygiene is important. It may seem like a hassle, but being clean and well-groomed will help make you feel more confident in spite of everything going on.”

Set a good example.,
Allow them to pick out their shower products.,
Change the wi-fi password.",How to Get a Teen to Shower Regularly2," If you don’t shower regularly why would a teen listen to you nag them about showering? When children become teens, they are much more likely to start questioning certain things than they were before. Though this may sometimes be frustrating for you, it shouldn’t be viewed as a bad thing. It simply means they are becoming more independent.If you want a teen to shower regularly, then you need to be in the habit of showering at least as often as you would like them to shower too.

, Teens may feel more inclined to shower if they are excited about the products they use in the shower. It may seem like it shouldn’t matter, but this gives them some control over the situation.For example, maybe the teen doesn’t enjoy the smell of the products you pick. Allowing them to choose the products is a simple way to let them feel more in control of the situation.
When you make a run to the drugstore, ask the teen to go with you. When you get there, ask them to pick out the products they want to use in the shower. To help control the price, tell them they can only pick products that cost under a given limit that you set.
If a teen isn’t sure what they should get, you can give them a generic list. For example, you can write on the list, “shampoo, hair conditioner, body wash, deodorant.” Of course, you can add anything else you think is necessary to the list, but those are some essential items.
When they bring you their selections, try not to make comments about their choices. For example, you might think something smells bad or looks stupid, but they chose it, so obviously they don’t. Making comments will only make them feel embarrassed.

, If you’ve talked to the teen about the importance of maintaining good hygiene, but they still refuse to shower, then you’ll have to find other ways to convince them to get in. Many teens today will be convinced if they aren’t able to access the internet. Change the wi-fi password whenever you want a teen to shower, explain to them that they can have the new wi-fi password once they’ve bathed and that this will keep happening until they are showering on a regular basis.


You can also apply this to other privileges. If you don’t have wi-fi or if your teen isn’t interested in using the internet, then think of something that they do value. Maybe they enjoy spending their time drawing. In this case, you could take away their art supplies until they’ve showered.
When you explain this to your teen, don’t simply say, “You can have the password when you’ve showered” without explaining why it matters. Instead, try saying, “I’ve changed the wi-fi password, so you won’t be able to use the internet until you’ve taken a shower. I want you to learn that you can enjoy privileges once you’ve taken care of your responsibilities. Taking care of your hygiene is one of those responsibilities."
"
Consider a teen’s emotional state.,
Try to think of reasons why a teen might not want to shower regularly.,
Ask them why they don’t want to shower.",How to Get a Teen to Shower Regularly3," During the teen years, there is a lot going on in terms of hormonal changes and body development. Not only that but most teenagers are trying to learn how to be more like adults at the same time. With all of this going on, it isn’t unusual for teens to experience difficult emotions or even depression. Thus, it is important for you to consider whether your teen’s poor hygiene is a sign of something more serious.If a teen was bathing normally but has suddenly stopped, and if you have noticed other symptoms such as moodiness, changes in their school performance or social behavior, or if they have started using drugs or drinking alcohol, then it may be time to seek help from a doctor.

, There may be a logical reason behind why the teen isn’t showering, so you should spend some time reflecting on what those reasons might be instead of just assuming they are being lazy.


For example, there's a teen who has very long hair, maybe they aren’t showering because they don’t have time to do their hair afterward. In this case, you could purchase them a shower cap, or suggest that they take a bath on the days that they don’t want to wash their hair. Some people simply don’t need to wash their hair every day.
Maybe the young person is having a hard time finding the time to shower. Many teens have a lot on their plates with school, friends, extracurricular activities, and chores. It could be that they feel they can’t find the time. If this is the case, maybe you can help them figure out a way to manage their time better, or even cut out one of their chores so they have 15 extra minutes to shower.

, Many times, teens rebel over little things simply to feel like they have some control over their lives. If you haven’t already done so, consider asking the teen why they don’t want to shower. Asking will hopefully help you figure out why they don’t want to shower. Additionally, it will also show your teen that you acknowledge that they are growing up and have opinions and thoughts of their own.


Hopefully, the reason they don’t want to shower will be a fairly straightforward one. For example, if the teen doesn’t like the smell of the products, then you can easily let them pick ones they do want.On the other hand, if their reason for not showering is more philosophical (e.g. they don’t want to shower because they feel they should be natural, or something like that), then you’re going to have to do a bit more work. You’ll have to spend time educating them on the health implications of poor hygiene and hope that makes sense to them. If it comes to it, you may have to start revoking privileges.

Make sure that you are aware of any rules related to student showering.,
Talk to your students about your expectations.,
Be sensitive to the reasons a student may not want to shower.,
Explain the dangers of poor hygiene.,
Make sure the students have enough time to shower.,
Consider alternatives to showering.",How to Get a Teen to Shower Regularly4," In some schools, there are rules surrounding whether or not students are expected to shower after exercise. Before doing anything to encourage a teen to shower at school after exercise, make sure that you familiarize yourself with the school’s stance on the matter.For example, though it may be common to have a “shower inspection” after gym class in some schools, other schools may prohibit such inspections. Some schools may not allow showering at all.

, If you are a gym teacher or a coach, you can give your students a talk about what you expect from them at the beginning of the year. If your school doesn’t prohibit you from doing so, you can tell your students that you do expect them to shower after gym class and what the consequences of not showering will be.


When you talk to your students about showering, you may want to explain that when you say shower, you don’t mean 15 minutes spent washing every inch of their body. A shower after class is simply meant to rinse off the sweat, and shouldn’t take any longer than a couple of minutes.
You might also point out to students that showering in front of others may seem a bit awkward at first, but you will get used to it. Remind them that everyone feels self-conscious at first.

, Most students feel very nervous and awkward showering in front of others, at least at first. While this is to be expected, there are some cases where a student may have a legitimate reason why they don't want to shower in front of their peers. Whether or not you agree with this reason, it is important to listen to what the student has to say, and be sensitive when responding to these reasons.


For example, the student may have an issue with their body that makes them feel very anxious about taking off their clothes in front of others. There may even be a religious reason they feel they should not shower.
Tell students that they should come talk to you in private if they have a reason that they don't want to shower. If they have a reason, then try to make alternative arrangements. For example, allow them to wash with a washcloth or wear a bathing suit in the shower if they wish.
Whether or not you agree with the student's reason for not wanting to shower, you should try to be sensitive. Don't tell them something like, ""That's a stupid reason."" If the student came to you it means they trust you to listen without judgment. If you react negatively, that student will likely lose their trust in you and will feel even more self-conscious about their reasons for not wanting to shower in front of others.

, Your students might be aware of the consequences of showering when it comes to being smelly or looking unkempt; however, they may not be aware that poor hygiene habits can also lead to skin infections and even to infectious diseases such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)., One reason teens may not be showering could be that they feel they don’t have enough time to shower and get dressed before they have to be in their next class. Girls especially may feel that they need more time to get dry and dressed. If you expect them to undress, shower, dry off and then get dressed again, you’re likely going to need to give them more than 5 minutes in-between classes to do all of that, especially if 20 or 30 students will have to share only a few shower heads.


If your students are worried about getting their hair wet because they won’t have time to style it the way they like afterward, then suggest that they simply don’t get their hair wet while showering. If they have long hair, they can bring a shower cap, or simply put their hair up in a loose bun, and then let it down when they are done.

, If, for some reason, the students can’t/won’t shower or don’t have access to showers, consider other methods of removing sweat and staying hygienic. Showering is perhaps the best way, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t alternatives that may help the situation if you can’t get the teens into the shower after exercise.


For example, teens could use a wash cloth with a bit of soap and water to deal with the smelliest parts (e.g. underarms). Students might also consider using disinfectant wipes. Though this may not be ideal, it could help the situation if showers simply aren’t an option at your school.
Don’t forget to remind students to bring a stick of deodorant to use after exercise. Using deodorant whether or not they take a shower is a good idea.

Wash your underarms whenever you notice an odor or damp patches. Pat yourself dry afterward without rubbing harshly.;
, Antiperspirant deodorant may not be enough for everyone, but it's a great start. Research Apply two or more times per day if necessary.

, Pick up an extra-strength antiperspirant from a pharmacy, or visit a doctor for an even stronger prescription. Apply for a few days each month for long-lasting protection, or as the label instructs.


Switch products or visit a doctor if the product irritates your skin or fails to reduce sweat.
Continue to use regular antiperspirant deodorant while between extra-strength uses.

, Light, cotton shirts allow air to pass through and cool down your underarms. Cotton will also absorb more sweat than synthetic shirts. Heavy or synthetic shirts may have less noticeable damp patches, but they trap sweat and heat, causing your underarms to sweat indefinitely.


If this still doesn't fix your problem, consider wearing a cotton undershirt. This may wick the sweat away from your armpits without staining your over-shirt.

, Hair traps sweat, and hairy armpits may require frequent washing to remove the stale sweat odor. Shave your hair away, and more sweat may drain and evaporate.

Consider alternating oil varieties every couple of days to get the full benefit of all the oils and see what works best for you.


Virgin olive oil and sunflower oil are also commonly used for oil pulling. Avoid canola oil and other varieties processed with additives.;
, It's important to do a pulling before you've consumed any food or drink in the day and also before you've brushed your teeth. You'll have the opportunity to clean your mouth out afterward, and it won't take long to complete the routine.

, The oil will mix with your saliva, absorbing and ""pulling"" toxins from your mouth. As the oil is swished around the mouth, teeth, gums, and tongue, the oil will continue to absorb toxins, usually turning somewhat viscous and milky.

, It's important to spit out the oil when it starts to feel thick. This usually takes somewhere between 10 and 15 minutes, and certainly no longer than 20.


You don't want to hold it in your mouth so long that the toxins start to reabsorb. Spit into the trash can and rinse your mouth thoroughly with warm water, which tends to do a better job getting the oil out than cold. Make sure not to spit it into a sink or toilet, because it may clog the drain.

, If you want extra power, try adding other ingredients - some people like a bit of mint or some apple cider vinegar for whitening, although results may vary. If you want to try out different oils to see what works best for you and yields the best results, get as many as you'd like and to try to use a different one each morning for a full week. Keep a fully stocked kitchen with a variety of organic oils and experiment with their benefits and uses.


Organic virgin oils like coconut oil aren't always the cheapest thing at the market, but they're incredibly versatile: you can use coconut oil to make your own toothpaste, massage oil, in your hair, and in your next stir-fry.

, Some people are turned off by the concept of making a mouthful of cooking oil the first taste of the morning, but it is important to do before you clean your mouth or consume anything, so make it easy on yourself. Consider measuring out the oil before you go to sleep and leaving it by your bedside, or set out on the bathroom counter top so that you don't have to think about it. Put it in your mouth and start swishing.If you usually keep your toothbrush on the counter, put it away and put a tiny glass of oil in its place. It'll become a habit in no time.

, If you typically do some calisthenics or light stretching in the morning before breakfast, make oil pulling part of the regimen. Wake up your body and get your day started right. The more you make it part of some routine, the easier it will be to make oil pulling a regular thing in your life.


Whatever you typically do in the morning, add oil pulling to the routine. Look over the newspaper briefly while swishing the oil, or read your favorite blog.

, Studies have shown that regular oil pulling reduce the amount of s. mutans, a common oral bacteria responsible for a variety of oral diseases and a major contributor to tooth decay, plaque, gingivitis, and cavities. The lipids in the oil work to pull out bacteria and keep bacteria from sticking to the walls of the mouth.An emulsifier, vegetable oils increase saponification, which accounts for the cleansing, soap-like texture you'll notice when doing an oil pulling.

The antibacterial qualities of virgin oil support the use of pulling to promote general oral health.

Wash your feet and toes before soaking them in the mixture described as follows.,
Soak your toes in a very-warm to hot mixture of 1/4 cup (60cc) of Epsom salts granules added into a pint (1/2 liter) of full strength white vinegar (tilt your container to only cover the toes) or double all ingredients if desired.,
Loosen and treat existing fungus, gradually, under your toenails.,
Watch your nail fall off (coming loose similarly to how a scab loosens when soaked), in the mixture, after a week or more, with once daily soaking, if fungi have undermined your complete toenail.

,
Rub, gently scratch out and scrape any dead skin and fungus off/out of your fungus-toenail area while it is soft from soaking.,
Dry your toes thoroughly after washing or soaking them; do this before putting on your shoes (with clean socks, if you can).,
Repeat the soakings about one or two times per week until all nails grow back (eventually).

,
Continue to ""air"" your toes without shoes or with sandals (and clean soaks), letting your feet breath (dry), preventing sweaty feet, as much as possible.

,
Prevent regrowth, of once-cured fungus, on toes and under your toenails, continuing to medicate and/or seal completely dried toes;


Foot powder, anti-fungal cream
Greasy Vapor Rub, such as Vick's VapoRub(TM) or Mentholatum(TM) (it can make your socks look dirty), or
Nail sealer/skin coating, or ""artificial skin"" type of product.

",How to Cure Toenail Fungus Inexpensively and Quickly,"



Diabetic persons should treat fungi under a doctor's supervision.;
,


Soak for 30 minutes each night (or up to two or three times per day -- if you are desperate). Do this for a week or two (for more economy consider saving and reusing the mixture of vinegar-salts for soaking repeatedly, if your feet are clean each time, and freshen it up with a little new vinegar and Epsom salts.)
If you'd like, you could filter it through old tee shirt material to remove settled out salts, etc.

, Begin killing it the first time, and continue about a week or several weeks, depends on depth and extent of infection.

,,


If it is too sore, wait a few sessions before removing nail debris, loosened dead skin.
If the nail is very thick, file and scrape it to be very thin, gently, without injuring yourself, to allow the vinegar mix to penetrate more effectively.

,



Air dry your feet, if you have time. The fungus really love moist skin, damp soaks/shoes and nails, allowing toenail fungus to get its ""foothold"" originally or repeatedly.

See your doctor before trying to clean your ears at home.,
Consider purchasing an earwax-removal kit.,
Gather your materials.,
Warm the oil and peroxide.",How to Clean Ears with Peroxide1," Humans are supposed to have earwax — it has the important job of protecting our ears from bacteria and fungus. It’s rare to have so much earwax that it has to be removed; however, if you have ear pain, a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or hearing loss, see your doctor to make sure that the problem is excessive earwax and not something else.Earwax removal is most safely done by a healthcare professional.Using peroxide can cause ear damage if your ear problem isn’t due to excess earwax.
If your doctor okays it, you can proceed to using peroxide at home. Ask for advice on selecting and using at-home ear cleaning products.;
, Pharmacies and drug stores often sell ready-made earwax-removal kits that can be easy to use at home. Often, these kits contain earwax-softener like Debrox or Murine — products that contain a mild form of peroxide. The kits may also include bulb syringes or other tools you might need., If you want to use products you already have at home, you can. The cleaning process should take about 30 – 45 minutes. Gather and prepare the following materials before you start to clean your ears:An oil to soften the earwax, such as mineral oil, baby oil, olive oil, or glycerin
Hydrogen peroxide, or a carbamide peroxide solution available at most drug stores

The peroxide must be diluted — make sure you get peroxide that is 3% or lower in strength.Two medium-sized bowls
An eyedropper
A rubber bulb syringe
A clean towel

, Putting cold fluids in your ear can be uncomfortable, so warm up the oil and peroxide before using them.Fill two bowls with hot water. Place the bottle of peroxide in one, and the bottle of oil in the other. Let them sit for a few minutes to warm. You could also put the oil and peroxide into two smaller bowls and place those in the hot water.


Test the temperature of the oil and peroxide on the skin of your hand before putting it into your ear. It should be warm, not hot.

"
"
Position yourself.,
Soften your earwax with oil.,
Add the warm peroxide.,
Flush the wax out with warm water.,
Drain your ear completely.,
Dry your ear gently.,
Clean your other ear.,
Perform this procedure as often as you need to.,
Use peroxide weekly if you get “swimmer’s ear.” Swimmer’s ear, or otitis externa, is an infection of the outer ear (outside the ear drum) that many people get from swimming.",How to Clean Ears with Peroxide2," Tilt your head to one side so that the ear you are cleaning first is facing the ceiling. Place your clean towel beneath your head, or on the shoulder of the ear being cleaned, to catch drips — whatever is more comfortable for you.

, Draw up some of your warm oil into the eyedropper, and drop about two drops into your ear. Allow the oil to sit in your ear, with your head tilted, for about 3 minutes.Do not push the dropper deep into your ear canal. Insert the tip gently into your ear and let the oil drop or roll down to your eardrum.

, Draw up several drops of the peroxide in your eyedropper, and gently drip it into the same ear. Let this sit for 10 minutes.You might feel bubbling, tickling, or itching as the peroxide works. It may also sound like crackling.

, When the bubbling has stopped and time is up, draw up some warm water with your bulb syringe. Tilt the ear you are cleaning over your sink. Hold the bulb syringe at a 45° angle to your ear, and gently squirt the warm water into your ear canal. Pull your outer ear up and back with your other hand — this straightens your ear canal and will let the water in better., Let the water, peroxide, and oil drain out of your ear into the sink or onto your towel. You may see earwax in the liquid coming out. Pull your outer ear up and back to allow for best drainage, then let go and wait for everything to drain out completely., Dry your outer ear with the towel. You can also use a hair dryer on the low/cool setting to dry your ear canal., Repeat the process on your other ear. Re-warm the peroxide and oil if they have cooled down.

, You might need to do this process several times to soften your earwax enough to remove most or all of it. You can try repeating the process over several days. See your doctor if your symptoms don’t improve after several attempts.


Once your ears are clean, you can do this cleaning process once a month.If you often struggle with excess earwax (and not another ear problem), you can use oil weekly to soften the wax. Use two to three drops in each ear, and flush it out with warm water.Peroxide is probably too drying to use weekly.

, If you get swimmer’s ear often and it’s been diagnosed by your doctor in the past, cleaning your ears with peroxide occasionally may help prevent infection.You can also try putting two to three drops of oil in each ear before swimming as a protective measure."
"
Add mineral or baby oil to peroxide if you have sensitive skin.,
See your doctor if you have signs of an ear infection.,
Keep your ear clean and dry if you have a perforated eardrum.",How to Clean Ears with Peroxide3," Hydrogen peroxide may be too harsh for you if you have sensitive skin. Peroxide can be very drying, which can be irritating if you’re prone to breakouts or skin reactions. If peroxide is drying your ear canals, try adding a few drops of mineral or baby oil to the peroxide.If that doesn’t help, use an alternate method to clean your ears.


You can try warm water alone or a saline solution, instead. Make a saline solution by dissolving ½ teaspoon of salt in a cup of boiled water., If you have an ear infection, don’t try to clean your ears with peroxide. See your doctor to get diagnosed and treated — you might need antibiotics, depending on what’s causing your infection.You may have an ear infection if you have ear pain (especially when you lie down), diminished hearing, and fluid draining from your ear. You may also have a feeling of fullness or pressure in your ear, or a fever.Look for signs of a possible ear infection in children, such as crying and pulling at their ear, trouble sleeping, difficulty hearing and responding to sounds, fever of 100°F (38°C) or higher, loss of balance, not eating, or complaining of a headache., If your eardrum perforates, or ruptures, don’t put anything liquid in your ear. Suspect that your eardrum has ruptured if you have increasing pain or pressure in your ear, followed by quick relief from pain, drainage from your ear, and loss of hearing. See your doctor right away — ruptured eardrums usually heal by themselves, but they might need to be repaired surgically. In the meantime, keep your ear clean and dry.You should not use peroxide if you have ear tubes, or tympanostomy tubes.Some people get small hollow tubes surgically implanted in their eardrum as a child if they have frequent ear infections.Don't use peroxide if you've ever had ear surgery.

Choose a mild soap.,
Take a shower or bath.,
Wash the penis.,
Keep it clean.,
Understand foreskin care.",How to Clean Your Penis1," Many soaps contain perfumes that may irritate sensitive skin, and some contain cleaning agents too harsh for use on the genitals. For best results, choose a mild, unscented soap meant for use on the body (in other words, do not choose hand soap).If you have sensitive skin, ask your doctor or dermatologist about choosing a soap that's right for you.;
, Use warm water, rather than hot water, to avoid burning or irritating your genitals and the rest of your body.Shower as you normally would, washing all over with warm water and the mild, unscented soap you've chosen.

, Lather up your choice of mild, unscented soap between your hands, and apply it to the testicles and shaft of the penis. The key thing to remember with an uncircumcised penis is to wash under the foreskin.Gently pull the foreskin back as far as it will go. Do not force the foreskin past its natural point, as this may damage the penis and cause scar tissue to develop.Apply soap under the foreskin, and thoroughly rinse away all the soap and any debris that may have collected.Return the foreskin back to its natural position., Personal hygiene is important, but doctors warn against over-washing the penis. Washing too frequently, especially with soap or shower gel, can cause soreness and irritation.You should also thoroughly dry the penis after showering. If you use talc or body powder on your testicles, resist the urge to powder the penis. If talc gets under the foreskin, it can cause irritation and discomfort.If you use talc powder, you may want to switch to a cornstarch-based powder instead. There may be a link between talcum powder and ovarian cancer in women— so if you have vaginal sex with a woman and have talc powder on your penis, you may be putting her at risk.

, With proper care and hygiene, having an uncircumcised penis does not present any significant health problems; however, failure to clean under the foreskin can cause a buildup of oils and debris, called ""smegma.""Other common foreskin problems include:


inflammation, usually caused by forced retraction and irritants like harsh or perfumed soapinfection, such as posthitis and balanitis, typically caused by poor hygiene and unwashed smegma build-up"
"
Use a mild soap.,
Take a shower.,
Wash the penis.",How to Clean Your Penis2," Even without foreskin, you'll want to ensure that you use a soap that won't irritate your penis. Opt for a soap or body wash that is mild and fragrance-free.Ask your doctor or dermatologist about choosing a soap that won't irritate your skin.

, Once again, it's important to choose a water temperature that won't scald or irritate your skin. Aim for warm (but not hot) water, and wash with soap all over your body like you normally would., Lather your mild, unscented soap well between your hands. Apply it to the testicles, the base and shaft of the penis, and under the head of the penis. Even without foreskin, it's important to properly wash under the head of the penis, as sweat, bacteria, and debris can still accumulate there.In the absence of foreskin, all you have to do is lather the penis and thoroughly rinse away the soap under the shower or in the bathtub.
Be sure to thoroughly dry the penis after showering or bathing. Without foreskin, it's technically safe to apply talc or body powder, but you should still exercise caution to avoid getting talc in the urethra or causing skin irritations."

Imagine yourself in their place.,
Talk privately with the smelly person.,
Start the conversation with praise.,
Disarm the person who smells.,
Be as honest and direct as possible.,
Ask if they’re aware of their smell.",How to Tell Someone at Work that They Smell Bad1," In order to get over your own scruples (if you have any) about confronting the person at work who smells bad, put yourself in their shoes. Remind yourself that if you had a body odor problem that concerned your coworkers, you would want to know. Imagining yourself in their place will put you in the right frame of mind for the coming conversation., In order to avoid embarrassing them more than you need to, find a quiet place to initiate the discussion. If you’re a manager, you can pull them into your office. If you’re just a coworker, pull them aside in the breakroom or another empty space when nobody else is about.To talk privately with the smelly person, ask them, “Can I talk to you?” or “Do you have a moment to talk?”

, Starting the conversation with praise will soften the blow and let the stinky worker know that you are not trying to be malicious. Be honest in your application of praise. If the person is not a good worker, for instance, do not suggest that they are. Find something else to praise them about.Tell the smelly person, for instance, “You are a hard worker and a valuable member of this team.”

, Before you get into the actual issue of the worker’s stench, acknowledge that the conversation will be a bit uncomfortable but is necessary nonetheless. Disarming the person who smells in this manner will show them that you’re on their side and sympathize with their position.Start by saying, for instance, “This is bit awkward, and I hope I don’t offend you, but...”

, If you leave the stinky person with vague comments about “hygiene,” they might think you’re asking them to brush their teeth to solve their bad breath. To avoid any confusion, be gentle but don’t mince words. Say, for instance, “You seem to have a disagreeable odor these days.”Never tell the smelly worker that anyone else has brought the issue to your attention. This will only cause them further embarrassment.

, After laying out the issue in gentle but explicit terms, find out if the person at work who smells bad knows that they smell bad. If someone at work who smells bad admits that they have a medical condition that causes them to emit a bad scent, thank them for being honest with you. There’s nothing more you can do about it at that point.Ask, for instance, “Is this a problem you’re aware of?” or “Has anyone ever told you this before?”
The smelly worker will then acknowledge your concern by saying, “I understand your concerns and offer my apologies. I will act to correct this issue. It will not be brought up again.”

"
"
Suggest possible causes and solutions.,
Tell your boss about the issue.,
Apply pressure if necessary.",How to Tell Someone at Work that They Smell Bad2," When someone at work smells bad, they usually don’t know it. And if they don’t know it, they likely don’t know how to correct the problem. Offer helpful comments regarding the potential cause and possible suggestions for how to deal with the problem.For instance, you might say, “Perhaps you just need to wash your clothes more often. Or maybe you could try showering more frequently.”

, If, after telling someone at work they smell bad, they do not take reasonable and appropriate steps to freshen up, you should report the issue to a workplace superior. With luck, they will have more success than you did in correcting the coworker’s stench., If you’re in a management position and the person at work who smells bad is combative or disagrees with you, insist that they must come to work smelling fresh. Remind them that stinky workers reflect badly on the business and that failing to correct their foul odor could hurt their relationships with their coworkers.Say, for instance, “We have a company policy that requires all workers to be fresh and clean at work.”

"
"
Move to a different location.,
Cover the scent using candles or air fresheners.,
Set up a fan.",How to Tell Someone at Work that They Smell Bad3," If possible, change your cubicle or desk. If moving altogether is not an option, try to at least find ways to minimize the amount of time you spend near the stinky colleague. For instance, volunteer to take on a different set of responsibilities that takes you to a different part of your workspace., Scented candles are a great way to conceal an odor. You could also try a plug-in air freshener that sprays in automatic, regular intervals, or you could use a pressurized air freshener of the sort that comes in an aerosol can., Turning a fan toward you will keep the air circulating and dissipate your coworker’s stink. Setting up a fan will provide some relief from your smelly coworker."

Avoid moisturizing your belly button.",How to Clean Belly Button Lint," Before cleaning your belly button, take a quick shower. This will help loosen up any dirt or lint in your belly button. You don't need to do anything special in the shower. Just shower as you normally would using regular soap and water., It's best to clean out your belly button using a salt solution. Mix a teaspoon of table salt into a cup of water. Mix the salt in until it dissolves., You can use your fingers or a small rag to clean your belly button. If you use your fingers, wash your hands first. Dip your rag or fingers into the salt solution.Gently massage the inside of your belly button. This will loosen up any lint or other dirt and debris. If some pieces of lint are very large, you may have to pull them out of your belly button.

, Do this using plain water. Gently pat dry the area around your belly button dry with a clean rag.

, Belly button infections can happen due to poor hygiene or a recent piercing. You should see a doctor as soon as you can in the event of an infection. Signs of a belly button infection include:Red or itchy skin near the belly button
Swelling
A bad smell
Discharge from the belly button
Pain or blistering around the belly button

, You don't want to keep your infant waiting to be cleaned. A baby may become fussy or uncomfortable if cleaning takes too long. When you get ready to clean an infant's belly button, get your supplies ready ahead of time. You will need the following:A large towel for your baby to lie on.
A sponge, cotton swabs, a bowl of warm water, and baby soap.

, Babies are prone to infection. Wash your hands under warm water using soap before you begin the process of cleaning your baby's belly button.Wash your hands for about 20 seconds.
Make sure to dry your hands off using a clean cloth or paper towel.

, A belly button infection can be dangerous for an infant. If you notice an infection, your baby will need to see a pediatrician as soon as possible. The following are the signs of a belly button infection in a baby:Discharge around the belly button
A foul smell coming from the umbilical cord
Tenderness or swelling of the skin

, Dab a piece of cloth in warm water. Gently wipe down the umbilical cord and the surrounding area. Then, wipe down the cord with a mild cleanser.You want to keep the cord clean and dry until it falls off naturally. This keeps your baby's belly button free of infection.
Do not use rubbing alcohol to clean an umbilical cord.

, Leaving the cord wet could result in an infection. Gently pat the cord, and the surrounding area, dry with a clean, absorbent cloth. Make sure the cord and the surrounding skin are dry to the touch., Your belly button will be less prone to lint if there's less hair around your navel. If you grow hair around your navel, shaving may prevent lint from building up. If belly button lint bothers you, try shaving your navel with a razor and see if you notice a reduction in lint., Lint collects in your belly button because of fibers of fabric, like cotton, coming off your clothes. Older clothing may attract less lint than new clothes because it's already shed those fibers of fabric. When possible, wear old clothes to prevent the accumulation of belly button lint.If you don't have anywhere special to go on a given day, throw on an old t-shirt.

, Do not use lotions or moisturizers in or near your belly button. While these are generally safe to use on other parts of the body, extra moisture near the belly button is dangerous. It can encourage fungal or bacterial infections."

Consider a DEET-based product.,
Try a Picaridin alternative to DEET.,
Think about a Permethrin repellent.,
Consider other plant-based repellents.",How to Choose Mosquito Repellent1," DEET stands for either N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diemethylbenzamideis. It is a reliable mosquito repellent that has been in use in the US since the late 1950s under brands like Cutter, Repeller, and Off! You can find DEET mosquito repellents at most outdoors, sporting goods, and hardware stores in lotion and spray forms.DEET can be highly effective. But be aware that these repellents come in different concentrations, from 5% to 100% DEET.
Be aware that DEET’s toxicity is still under study and be careful with it especially if you’re using it on children. Some kids may have skin irritation and can also have harmful reactions if they accidentally swallow some.However, know that DEET repellents are still considered safe for children in low concentrations. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends levels of no more than 35% for kids.;
, Picaridin was created by Bayer corporation in the 1980s as an alternative active ingredient to DEET and has been available in repellents in the US since 2005. It’s as effective in keeping away mosquitos but lacks some of DEET’s unpleasant qualities. Consider it if you’re wary of DEET.Know that Picaridin is safe and as effective as DEET in similar concentrations. It is also odorless, non-oily on the skin, and will not cause skin irritation or melt plastics.
Look for brands at the pharmacy or outdoors store like Cutter Advanced and Skin So Soft Bug Guard Plus.

, Permethrin is another proven repellent. It has been used in agriculture, for lice in humans and animals, and as a repellent for mosquitos, ticks, and other insects. It can also last a long time. The thing that makes this product stand out, however, is that it’s used on clothes rather than on skin.Be assured that Permethrin is fairly safe. While it causes skin irritation in some cases, the product is biodegradable in only a few weeks when it bonds to the soil or clothing.
Permethrin is low in toxicity to birds and mammals. However, it is more toxic to insects, bees, and fish, so you’ll need to avoid accidentally contaminating blooming crops and water with it.

, There are a number of mosquito repellents with other kinds of active ingredients, many derived from plants. You might want to consider these products if you are concerned about the possible side effects and toxicity of chemicals like DEET or Permethrin.You might try a repellent with oil of lemon eucalyptus, a synthetic form of the naturally occurring oil in eucalyptus leaves. This compound is as effective as 15%-20% concentrations of DEET.
Don’t use oil of lemon eucalyptus on children, as its safety hasn’t been tested. Don’t confuse it with the natural variety, either, lemon eucalyptus oil. This is a different product and hasn’t been tested and approved as a repellent.
Think about trying repellents that use citronella, lavender, sassafras, peppermint, or soy oils as active ingredients, too. These have all been tested and are moderately effective, though less than synthetic counterparts.

"
"
Choose Permethrin for the longest-lasting coverage.,
Go with higher DEET concentrations for longer coverage.,
Bear in mind that “natural” active ingredients won’t last as long.",How to Choose Mosquito Repellent2," Since Permethrin goes on your clothes and chemically bonds to the fabric, it is really long lasting and will stay active even after you wash the garments. It’s probably the best choice for a lasting, low maintenance repellent.US military studies show that a low concentration of Permethrin on clothing (.5%) gave protection for up to 97.7% of bites. It can also last from 2 weeks to 6 months, or about 5-20 detergent washings.
Look for pre-treated shirts, hats, and pants, if you are interested in using Permethrin. Brands like LL Bean and ExOfficio now offer such garments., DEET is not only powerful stuff, but it can give you excellent coverage if you’re going to be outdoors for a long period of time. In general, keep in mind that coverage will last longer with higher concentrations.DEET with about 50% concentration normally gives about 4 hours of protection, while increasing the level to 100% adds about one more hour. However, some brands with 100% DEET concentration can last up to 10 hours or more.
Make sure to read any labels carefully to see what sort of concentration the product has. Lower levels of DEET (under 10%) will give you at most two hours of protection.

, The dilemma many people have when choosing a mosquito repellent is that they don’t trust chemicals like DEET or Picaridin, fearing that they are toxic and “unnatural.” Unfortunately, the alternatives don’t always work better. Naturally derived mosquito repellents usually aren’t as effective and also don’t last very long.You’ll probably be OK with a natural active ingredient like citronella or peppermint oil if you’re only outdoors for a short time – at most a few hours.
For instance, Burt’s Bees Herbal Insect Repellant uses rosemary oil, lemongrass oil, and citronella and works for up to 6 hours. This is pretty exceptional.
More typical are products like Buzz Away Extreme, Badger Anti-Bug Balm, and All Terrain Herbal Armor, which use active ingredients like citronella and give protection from about 4 hours to as little as 20 minutes.

"
"
Get a lotion or spray-on repellent for your body.,
Go with Permethrin for clothing, tents, shoes, and other gear.,
Don’t bother with citronella candles.,
Check the Environmental Protection Agency’s search tool.",How to Choose Mosquito Repellent3," The kind of mosquito repellent you choose to use can also depend on how you want to use it – in other words, the method of application. Most repellents go on the skin or are sprayed on your clothing. Look for lotions, aerosol sprays, creams, and sticks if this is what you want.Liquids, creams, lotions, and sticks will let you apply the repellent directly to your skin, while an aerosol or pump spray will allow you to treat skin or clothing.
Keep in mind that sprays give a more even application to the skin and clothing.
Read the labels on these products to see what the active ingredients are. Choose a lotion or spray that has the ingredient you most prefer, whether DEET, Picaridin, or a natural alternative.

, As said, Permethrin is specially designed for use on clothing and other fabrics. Pick a product with this active ingredient if you want to use the repellent in this way. While Permethrin normally comes in an aerosol spray, make sure that you don’t inadvertently use it on the skin.Look for pump sprays like Sawyer Products Premium Permethrin Clothing Repellant or aerosols like Repel Permethrin Clothing and Gear Repellant.
You can also apply Permethrin to things like mosquito nets and use it on your clothing along with a DEET-based skin repellant. This will increase your protection even more.

, The idea of having an outdoor garden party and being protected from mosquito bites by scented candles is a nice one. There are, in fact, plenty of candles that claim to do just this by using the repellent qualities of citronella. The thing is, they don’t work very well.Citronella is moderately effective when you apply it to your skin. However, it is not always useful against mosquitos in candles. This may be because the smoke can change with wind direction and dissipates quickly.
In one study, citronella candles reduced the number of bites only by a small amount – 42.3% and 24.2%. You can try repellent candles if you want, in other words, but don’t expect too much., The US EPA can help you put together all of these different factors to choose the best mosquito repellent for you. Just go to their website and search for “Find Insect Repellent.” This will take you to a comprehensive search tool. All of the products listed here are registered with the EPA, meaning they have been tested for safety and effectiveness and have shared this information with the government.On the search tool, choose how much time you want protection from the drop-down menu. Then, indicate that you want protection from mosquitos. You can also narrow the search by active ingredient and by company.
Press the “search” button and then review the results. The EPA lists each entry by product name, hours of protection, active ingredient and concentration, company name, and EPA registration number.

Shower daily.,
Apply strong deodorants or antiperspirants to your underarms.,
Wear natural-fiber clothing.,
Change and wash your clothes often.,
Try some relaxation techniques.",How to Stop Underarm Odor1," Make an effort to shower every single day, no matter how tired or busy you may be. This is an excellent way to ensure that your body is fresh and clean throughout the day. If you wake up sweating after a hot night, hop in the shower, and always shower after a long day of movement or especially exercise. You should never forget to shower after working out, or your bad body odor will build up.


Use an antibacterial soap for best results.After you shower, make sure to fully towel off, so you don't leave any moisture that invites bacteria on your body.;
, Though deodorants don't stop sweating, they do mask the smell of bacteria on your skin. Antiperspirants contain aluminum chloride, which is a chemical that does reduce sweating, and which also contains a deodorant. Apply the antiperspirant twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening.


If you think you need more than the average deodorant or antiperspirant, then check out products that say they are of a higher strength -- you don't need to go to a doctor to get these.
If you've tried a stronger anti-perspirant or deodorant and it's still not working, it may be time to see your doctor to get a prescription for even stronger antiperspirant.

, Wearing clothes made of cotton, wool, or silk will make your body less likely to sweat because of the comfort and durability of the materials. And if you're working out, invest in a high-tech fabric that wicks the moisture off your body., If you wear the same t-shirt for three days, then yeah, your armpits may smell. Make sure to always wash your clothes after you wear them, and to avoid wearing the same article of clothing for two or more days in a row, no matter how comfortable it may be. And take extra care with your workout clothes -- dirty and moist workout clothes are a breeding ground for bacteria, so you should wash them after every single workout.

, People often sweat not because they are overexerting their bodies, but because they are overexerting their minds.

Smell yourself.,
Check your breath.,
Give your clothes a sniff.,
Assess your sweat.,
Ask someone you trust.,
Observe other people’s behavior toward you.,
Talk to your doctor.,
Wear an antiperspirant.,
Practice good oral hygiene.,
Wash your clothes frequently.,
Change your diet.",How to Tell if You Have Body Odor," Your first line of defense against troublesome body odor is a keen sense of smell. Take a whiff of potential problem areas, including your underarms, feet and genitals. While your own body odor is typically tough to distinguish, you may be able to pick up on it if it’s strong enough.See if you can detect any salty, musty or pungent notes.
The best time to do this is after the effects of bathing have worn off, since this is when odors will be most pronounced.;
, Breathe out sharply through your mouth and into your cupped palm so that the gust is redirected to your nose. Smell your breath as it bounces back toward you. This can usually help clue you in as to whether your oral hygiene might be a source of unwanted body odor.Perform routine breath checks between meals so that you can rule out a particular type of food as the cause.Keep a pack of sugar-free chewing gum or mints handy to freshen bad breath.

, At the end of the day, dig through your discarded garments and put them through a smell test. As your body secretes sweat, dirt and natural oils, they can become absorbed into clothing fibers, causing them to stink. In this way, your clothing may be responsible for trapping body odor and making it worse.Focus your attention on the underarms of your shirts and the crotch region of pants and underwear.
Make sure the articles of clothing you check are work or casual items. Workout apparel is much more likely to smell already because of how much you sweat in it.

, The bulk of body odor is caused by perspiration, and the way your sweat smells can tell you a lot about what’s going on in your body. It’s not uncommon for body odor to seem worse in the summer months or after strenuous exercise. If you find that your sweat smells unusually strange or intense, however, it could be the result of some lifestyle change you’ve recently made.You can get a better sense of how your perspiration smells by sniffing yourself in a place with poor ventilation, such as a closed shower stall or inside the neck of your shirt.
New medications, natural hormonal changes, chronic stress and conditions like diabetes are all potential causes of stubborn body odor., Entreat a close friend or loved one to give their honest opinion about how you smell. Insist that they be straightforward with you, as their admission will ultimately be doing you a favor. It’s much better to find out from someone who cares about your feelings than from a stranger.Dig for more useful information by asking a few follow-up questions, like when they first noticed the odor and how obvious it is.
Having someone else smell you is generally the best way to discover that you have a body odor issue., Take note of how the people around you react when you’re in close proximity. For instance, if someone sits further away from you than normal or averts their face when you walk by, it might mean that they find your scent offputting.In an effort to be polite, most people won’t broadcast their distaste. Pay attention to subtle cues like a pained smile, exaggerated blinking or an apparent eagerness to create space.

, If your concerns have reached the point of causing you to feel self conscious, you can ask your physician or healthcare specialist flat-out whether you suffer from body odor. These people are there to help you, so they won't be reluctant to give you an honest answer. They may also be able to provide you with professional advice on how to overcome body odor or make it less noticeable.Dermatologists, dentists and general physicians are all qualified to inform you about the causes and treatment of body odor.
Your doctor may be able to trace your body odor to a specific habit, condition or dietary choice and help you come up with a lasting solution., Apply a strong antiperspirant to your armpits before leaving the house in the morning. This suggestion may seem obvious, but the fact is that most body odor problems originate in the underarm region. Try to get in the habit of using antiperspirant every day to safeguard yourself from surprise bursts of B.O.Antiperspirant and deodorant are not the same thing. Deodorants help combat underarm odor but don’t protect as well against sweat, which is the leading cause of body odor.Clinical strength deodorants are also an option that can help keep persistent odor under control.
Reapply antiperspirant throughout the day as needed to stay one step ahead of frightful fragrances.

, Bad breath is a prime contributor to overall body odor. For this reason, it’s important to brush your teeth at least once a day (twice is preferred), and also get on a consistent regimen of flossing and using antiseptic mouthwash. The cleaner your mouth is, the less you’ll have to worry about scaring others away when you get up close and personal.Brush for around two minutes, hitting all of the teeth’s major surfaces and the top of the tongue.
In addition to regular brushing, you should schedule an appointment twice a year to have your teeth cleaned by a dentist., Do a load of laundry a minimum of once a week, or more if you’re physically active or have a downsized wardrobe. In most cases, it’s best not to wear the same item of clothing more than one day in a row. Because your clothing soaks up all the odor-causing substances that your body puts off, they can quickly grow rank.Undergarments like bras, socks and underwear need more frequent attention because they’re worn directly against pungent problem areas.
Add a scoop of baking soda to the washing machine for extra stench and stain-fighting power., As the old saying goes, you are what you eat. Choose foods that are rich in fiber and essential vitamins and minerals. Avoid excess sweets and oily or aromatic foods—such as garlic, onions and curry—as these contain chemical compounds that are the perfect recipe for stinky sweat.Dietary fiber aids digestion and helps prevent and eliminate foul-smelling waste.
Be sure that you’re properly hydrated, as well. Water plays an important role in regulating healthy bodily functions."

Try making your own natural deodorant treatments.,
Apply your products properly.",How to Stop Armpit Sweating1," Before you go buy more of the same old deodorant at the store, you need to think a bit about what exactly your problem is, to get the right product for the job. For some people, the biggest problem with sweaty pits is body odor, while for others the biggest problem is unsightly sweat stains and the resulting embarrassment.


If you struggle from body odor and sweat stains, you need to use an approach that addresses these problems individually. Applying deodorant will do nothing to stop your armpits from sweating though it will mask the odor.
You can't stop your body from perspiring completely without medical procedures, which are typically only performed in extreme cases. If your body stopped excreting salts and toxins through the skin, you would die.;
, Depending on your problem, you may either need commercial deodorant, antiperspirants, or a hybrid product, or you may need to talk to your doctor about more powerful prescription anti-perspirant products on the market.



If you've got a problem with body odor, you need to use deodorant that uses gentle, natural ingredients that will mask the odor, and practice other good hygiene practices that will remedy the problem. Read the section for general hygiene tips.

If you've got a problem with sweat stains, most commercial anti-perspirants that use aluminum chloride hexahydrate are effective at controlling the amount of sweat that your underarms produce.

, There are all-natural commercial deodorants, but you can also create your own natural deodorant to control sweat produced in your underarms.


Mix equal parts of baking soda and water to create a sweat-controlling paste, then let it sit for 20-30 minutes. After that time, rinse off the mixture with water.
Try using apple vinegar or other malt vinegar to neutralize the armpits' natural odor-causing bacteria. This in turn creates a drying effect in your underarm, which conditions your armpits to sweat less and to stay dry.
Try a mixture of lemon juice and tomato pulp before bed. Let sit for 15 minutes.
Make a paste from ground walnut leaves and eucalyptus.
Some people think that sage tea helps to act as a ""coolant,"" keeping the body from sweating.

, In general, if you struggle with underarm sweat, you need to apply your anti-perspirant or deodorant to clean underarms before bed, first thing in the morning, and any time after bathing. Always wash your arms thoroughly with clean water and soap, dry, then apply a thin layer of deodorant or anti-perspirant to your dry underarms.


Some people will only apply deodorant before going out, or before getting dressed. If your underarms have already gotten sweaty, you're doing nothing to control odor or sweat. You need to clean your underarms first, always.
If you've noticed that you're already sweaty, don't apply products over the sweat, which won't do anything to control odors. Instead, you need to wash your armpits using soap and water, try to cool yourself down, then apply fresh product under your arms.

Shower more regularly.,
Wash your shirts after every use.,
Wear undershirts.,
Shave your armpits.,
Change your diet.,
Exercise to lower your body-mass index (BMI).",How to Stop Armpit Sweating2," Controlling underarm sweat requires more than just products and remedies. Keeping your body clean and dry is essential to controlling your underarm sweat throughout the day. If you struggle with it, it's a good idea to shower your body, or at least your underarms, at least once and as many as two times a day to keep it in check.


During the summer time, if you live in a humid climate, try to keep a little time between a hot shower and getting dressed, if you struggle with underarm sweat. Let yourself completely dry and let your body cool down before you put clothes on, or you may immediately start sweating.

, Especially if you've sweated in a shirt, it's essential that you thoroughly wash your clothes between wearings. Again, underarm body odor is not caused by sweat, exactly, it's caused by the bacteria left from dried sweat, which produces an unpleasant odor.


If you don't wash sweat from clothes, the bacteria from the sweat you leave builds up over time, making the smell worse. It's very important to change clothes regularly and keep them clean.
If you really sweat a lot, change your shirt more often, even if it's in the middle of the day. If you know you might get sweaty at work, keep a pressed shirt if your bag, ready to go if necessary.

, Clean white t-shirts can do a lot to absorb extra sweat, keeping it away from your outer shirt layer. If you're a big sweater, consider layering your clothes so that the sweat won't come through to your outer shirt as easily.


Like your outer shirts, it's also important to keep these washed and clean regularly to avoid unpleasant smells.

, If you have a big sweating problem, it's sometimes true that shaving your armpits can help, somewhat. While shaving your pits won't make your armpits cooler, or produce less sweat, it will keep the sweat from collecting in your armpits, which can make the sweat stains more pronounced, and the odor more prevalent.


It's important to know that body hair, including armpit and even facial hair, actually helps to cool your body in hot temperatures collecting the sweat you secrete, which cools as it evaporates. Shaving body hair might make the sweat less present in your armpits, but it might also make your body sweat slightly more.

, Strong-smelling foods and some food families will affect the way your sweat smells, according to recent studies.If you already tend toward sweatiness, it's important to be aware of dietary issues that might be making it worse.


Onions, garlic, and other foods in the alliaceous family will cause sulfurous, pungent sweat upon drying. Some spices, like asafetida, cumin, and curry powder will likewise be detectable in the underarms, as well as cruciferous vegetables like cabbage or broccoli.
Diets high in red meat, dairy, or alcohol produce distinctive-smelling sweat that many people become acclimated to over time.
Capsaicin, found in hot peppers, will stimulate the nerve receptors in your mouth in the same way that actual heat does, tricking your body into thinking that you're hot. Your hypothalamus will send out a signal to sweat.

, If you have more mass on your body, your body will sweat more to keep itself cool. If you're really struggling with underarm sweat, it may be something you can remedy by incorporating cardiovascular exercise into your routine and losing some weight. Get all your sweating out with exercise.


The best and quickest way to lose weight is to increase your physical activity and decrease the number of calories you consume in a day to a stable level. try to incorporate leaner proteins, like legumes, lean chicken, and eggs to replace fried foods, dairy, and red meat, and increase the number of whole grains and vegetables in your diet.
Stay well hydrated throughout the day and try to start exercising small. Start going on long walks in the morning and at night, then showering to remove the sweat from your body and cool down.

In some cases, an oral anticholinergic such as Rubinol will be recommended, which helps to curb sweating, particularly in the underarms.
Talk to your doctor about onabotulinumtoxina injections. This treatment method is minimally invasive, and supposedly effective, offering an average efficacy rate of six-eight months.

, This type of electrotherapy involves, typically, two to four 20-minute sessions per week. Water is used to conduct a small electric current on your skin, which can help to reduce sweating for several weeks or months. While the treatment has mixed results and is somewhat uncomfortable, it's effective in some cases.

, This treatment uses a small endoscopic instrument that is inserted below the armpit to interrupt the sympathetic nerves that cause you to sweat. This treatment is effective, but risky, with side effects that include complications in breathing, nerve damage and/or causing other parts of your body to sweat excessively.

, Theoretically, Botox injections can and have been used to control underarm sweat for up to six months, with limited success reported among some people. This should only be considered if you have a problem with severe underarm sweating as treatments can run from $700, and they can be very painful.


There's no proven medical link between Botox and sweating, and it's not generally recommended to seek this as treatment by the medical community. Still, it's used by some.

You can either tell the students where and how to wash, or you can adopt the Socratic method. You can ask students where they think germs may grow and how best to get rid of them. Encouraging casual conversation about hygiene will usually create a more comfortable environment.

, The best way to do this is to ask a dentist to personally come and talk to your class about dental hygiene. You should hand out toothbrushes, toothpaste and dye tablets.


You can also do this at home with a toothbrush, toothpaste, floss and dye tablets. These are available at most dentists' offices to encourage good brushing. Sometimes having them choose their own toothbrush will encourage them to brush their teeth. Kids often respond better when it's something they have a choice in.
Ask the dentist to explain the germs found in the mouth and how they can harm you. The dentist should tell the students where they hide and tell them how to get rid of them with a twice per day flossing and brushing routine.
Ask the children to take out their toothbrush and play a 3 minute song. This is the typical time that most dentists encourage people to brush. Ask the students to brush while the song plays and then spit in the sink.
Ask them to chew on the dental tablets and rinse. Then, ask them to look in the mirror. The areas where plaque is still active in the mouth will be dyed blue or red, demonstrating how careful we must be when brushing.
Repeat this activity at home if you do not think your child is brushing enough. Make brushing fun by brushing with them and playing a 3 minute song that they like.

, Tampons are the most common menstrual hygiene product for women in Americabecause they are convenient and simple to use. A tampon is made of absorbent cotton and is worn inside the vagina to absorb menstrual fluid as it leaves the cervix. They are available in a variety of absorbencies including light, regular, heavy, and super to coincide with the days of your flow. Tampons are disposable and are thrown away after use, and must be changed at least every eight hours.


Never wear a tampon longer than eight hours or wear one that is more absorbent than you need, as this can lead to a rare but serious condition called Toxic Shock Syndrome.

, Disposable pads (also called sanitary towels or sanitary napkins) fit inside the underwear and come in various lengths and absorbencies. They are made of an absorbent material called cellulose and must be thrown away after use. Some women use them as back-up protection with tampons, and other women prefer pads because they are uncomfortable with inserting something in their vagina. Because they have a leak-proof plastic backing, disposable pads can trap smells more than most other hygiene options.

, Some women chose to purchase or make pads made of absorbent materials like cotton, Zorb, or microfiber. Cloth pads do not contain the same chemicals as disposable pads and do not have the same smell that many women notice when blood is absorbed by a disposable pad. They do require regular laundering and can be slightly bulkier than disposable pads.

, Menstrual cups are very popular in Europe and have recently begun gaining popularity among American women. Some menstrual cups like Softcup are disposable and inserted like a diaphragm. Reusable menstrual cups like the DivaCup or Lunette are made of medical-grade silicon and are inserted into the vagina and worn against the opening of the cervix. In both cases, the muscles of the vagina wall hold the cup in place. They can be worn for 12 hours, including while in the water or while sleeping. Because they are worn internally, they can help reduce the smell of menstrual blood during your period.


The user removes the cup every four to 12 hours, pours the collected blood into the toilet or sink, and washes the cup before reinserting.

, Wearing a tampon for an extended time can lead to leaks, and wearing a pad for too long can lead to odors.


During your heavy days, you may need to change it every hour or two. On light days, don't go more than three to four hours without changing it during the day.
Again, never leave a tampon in for more than eight hours, even for overnight wear, and never wear a tampon that is a higher absorbency than you need to reduce your risk of TSS. , Your period will most likely be regular and predictable, but sometimes ""breakthrough bleeding"" can occur between periods, or your period can be early. It's best to be prepared with the right supplies at all times.


Keep a tampon or pad with you in your purse, locker, and/or car for emergencies.
Keep a supply of tampons or pads in your bathroom so that you won't have to run to the store when your period starts.
Don't be afraid to ask a female friend for a tampon or pad if you need one. Even a stranger in the bathroom will likely be willing to help you out if you are in need.

, Your entire body needs to be cleaned every day, and during your period you will need to take extra time to wash your vulva (the genital area on the outside of your body), as blood and fluids can build up in this area.


Use a mild soap or body wash on your whole body, including your vulva, and rinse well.
You do not need to use a special soap made for your genitals; these are a marketing gimmick meant to exploit your self-consciousness about your period. Remember, it is natural to have a body that smells like a body, and genitals that smell like genitals.
You should never clean inside your vagina, such as with douches. Your vagina is a self-cleaning organ that naturally produces the right balance of mucus to flush out any contaminants, and a douche or wash can disrupt your pH balance and lead to infection., If you feel you need extra freshening between showers, unscented baby wipes will help get rid of odor.


Use the wipe as you would toilet paper after using the restroom, wiping only on the outside of your body. Be sure to discard it in the trash can, as they are not made to flush and can clog sewer lines.
Baby wipes are made for an infant's sensitive skin so they should not sting but discontinue use if they burn, itch, sting, or you get an infection.

, You can stay clean and avoid smells by changing these regularly and keeping an eye out for leaks.


Wear cotton underwear. Cotton is a natural fiber that allows air to circulate properly, which can help prevent sweating and smells.
You should also avoid wearing thongs during your period, which can transfer bacteria from your anus to your vagina and cause infections.Change your underwear if they become damp with sweat or fluid, or at least once a day.

, Sometimes body odor intensifies during your period and can leave your clothing smelling musty.


Use the recommended amount of detergent and be sure you wash everything, including your underwear, daily.
If blood gets on your clothing or sheets, rinse with cold water as soon as possible and then rub with a laundry pre-treatment product such as Spray n Wash or Shout. Let it sit for a few hours to overnight, then wash on warm with your regular detergent.

, In fact, other people most likely cannot smell you. Every woman has a distinct vaginal smell during her period (and a different, distinct smell when she is not on her period), so it is important to determine if a smell is typical or abnormal for you.


Blood has a normal, slightly metallic smell to it. This is normal, but if it bothers you, consider wearing tampons or menstrual cups, or changing your pad more frequently.
If the smell is very strong, fishy, foul, or is otherwise abnormal for you, and you have been washing daily, there is probably an underlying cause.
If you wear tampons and notice a strong odor, you may wish to check for a retained tampon. This occurs when you forget to remove your tampon, and the old tampon is still in your body. It is impossible for a tampon to get ""lost"" in your body, so if it's still in there, you should be able to locate and remove it easily. Insert a clean finger into your vagina and feel for the string, then pull it out. If you find you cannot remove it, see your doctor immediately.

, A fishy or foul smell that persists even when you clean regularly can indicate an infection called bacterial vaginosis (BV), which requires a prescription to treat.


BV is sometimes accompanied by itching or burning, but other times there are no symptoms except a foul smell. You will need to see your doctor for a prescription to treat BV., Sometimes a woman's hormones shift during her period which can make her normal body odor smell stronger.


While most women can use a regular deodorant during their period; others find that it is not sufficient during your period.
Both body odor and vaginal odor can be influenced by diet, and some foods like garlic, coffee, and fried foods are known to have an effect on the smell. If your diet contains any of these or other pungent foods, consider eliminating the food to see if the smell improves.

, On very hot days, menstruation and sweat can combine to create a stronger smell than normal.


This can be especially problematic if you tend to wear disposable pads, which trap bacteria, blood, and sweat between the layers of plastic. In this situation, consider wearing a tampon or menstrual cup, which is inside the body, or change your pad more frequently.

, Most women experience their first period around age 12.Your first period usually comes about two years after the very first signs of puberty, which are usually breast buds (slightly swollen and protruding nipples, not actual breasts), and a few months after the first signs of armpit and pubic hair.Your first period can start at any time but might be accompanied by sore breasts, mood swings, or pain in your lower abdominal muscles called cramps.

, It should not be embarrassing or strange.


The first time you get your period, you might feel worried or self-conscious. But look around. Every person you see was born from a woman who had her period, and nearly every woman you see has her period every month. All of your friends will get their periods if they haven't already. It is one of the most normal human processes imaginable.
Most girls begin their period around age 12and experience menopause around age 51,which means that they will experience 39 years of monthly periods or about 468 total periods!

, Every woman's menstrual cycle is a bit different, but with time most women can learn to recognize their own cycle so that they can prepare for their period.


A ""menstrual cycle"" actually refers to the entire fertility cycle, usually 28 days, that results in a period once a month. Every month, a fertile woman's body prepares to become pregnant. Over the course of the month, the body creates a nutrient dense lining for the womb to nourish a potential embryo, then releases an egg which travels down to the womb area, and if it is not fertilized by sexual intercourse, it leaves the woman's body along with the lining of the womb, which appears as bloody fluids as it leaves through the vagina.
As your body prepares for your period; you might experience general symptoms known as PMS (premenstrual syndrome), which can include bloating, tiredness, moodiness, food cravings, headaches, and cramps.

Shower regularly.,
Shave your armpits.,
Change your clothing regularly.,
Wear clothing made from natural fibers.,
Pay special attention to your socks and shoes.,
Use products that interact with the human body to prevent odors.,
Use a perfume or body spray.",How to Smell Nice if You Sweat a Lot1," Sweat itself does not smell; body odor is caused when bacteria on your skin breaks your sweat down into acids. While bacteria are a normal part of your body's make-up, you can eliminate excess bacteria — and, most importantly, the acids they produce — by washing daily.


Pay special attention to cleansing hairy areas of the body. Humans have two types of sweat glands. Eccrine glands are spread across your skin and regulate your body temperature by cooling your skin with sweat when you get hot. The sweat produced by this gland is typically less smelly. Apocrine glands, on the other hand, are concentrated in hairy areas of your body such as armpits and your genital region. The sweat from these glands contains high levels of protein. Your skin bacteria love protein, so this type of sweat quickly becomes very stinky!Use antibacterial soap on your armpits. Again, some bacteria are good — but too many can pose a problem, especially in odor-prone areas like your armpits.;
, Hair traps sweat and odor, providing ideal conditions for smell-producing bacteria to multiply., At minimum, you should change into fresh clothes daily. Changing more than once a day is a good idea if you perform physical labor that causes you to sweat or if you exercise.

, Avoid tight, restrictive clothing and man-made fibers such as nylon. These types of clothing restrict the ability of your skin to ""breathe,"" increasing your volume of sweat.

, Socks should be thick, soft, and made of natural fibers, or sports socks designed to absorb moisture. Shoes should be made of leather, canvas, or mesh rather than synthetic materials.


Change your socks at least twice a day if you are prone to sweaty feet.
Consider carrying a spare pair of socks with you during the day so you can change whenever needed.

, Some products work to mask smells, while others work to eliminate the root cause of sweat.


Deodorant uses perfume to mask the smell of sweat without eliminating the sweat itself.
Antiperspirant reduces the amount of sweat the body produces. The active ingredient in antiperspirant is usually aluminum chloride, which blocks sweat glands from producing. Many antiperspirants include a perfume agent to make you smell nice in addition to remaining sweat-free.
If regular antiperspirant fails to keep you from sweating, consult your doctor about special formulations containing extra aluminum chloride. These antiperspirants are usually applied overnight and washed off in the morning. They operate by using the hours you are sleeping (you sweat less while you sleep) to seep into sweat glands and block the production of sweat., While perfumes are no substitute for good hygiene, they replace problematic smells with an appealing scent.


Experiment to find a fragrance that interacts well with your body chemistry.
Keep your chosen perfume or body spray handy to refresh your scent during the day.
Be aware of any regulations regarding scents in your workplace or school. Some people are very sensitive to artificial fragrances, and you may not be permitted to wear them in certain settings.
Moisture-reactive perfume is not yet on the market, but it may prove a useful tool in the future. Scientists in Ireland have learned how to bond fragrance to ionic liquids that react to water — including the water in sweat. The more someone wearing such a substance sweats, the stronger the scent becomes."

Maintain a healthy weight.,
Avoid spicy foods and alcohol.,
Use armpit shields to protect your clothing.,
Maintain a positive mental outlook.",How to Smell Nice if You Sweat a Lot2," Carrying excess weight causes your body to work harder, raising your body temperature and producing more sweat. Skin folds caused by excess weight can harbor bacteria, so pay special attention to these areas when bathing. , You sweat more when you consume these items, and as previously mentioned, sweat interacts with the bacteria on your skin to produce body odor. Cutting back or eliminating these things from your diet will help you manage sweat volume, therefore keeping you smelling nice.

, While this tactic will not change your sweat volume, by protecting your clothing you'll be able to wear shirts and sweaters longer before they become smelly. Shields are generally made from absorbent material that will keep sweat from clinging to your skin and becoming smelly. You will also minimize the appearance of your sweat., A recent scientific study indicated that the ""chemosignals,"" or body odor, of people in a happy mental state tended to induce a happy reaction in others exposed to their odor. In other words, if you're a happy person, the message you send to others spreads that happiness — even your body scent smells happy!"

Ask your doctor about botox.,
Consider therapeutic plastic surgery if your concerns about body odor have become overwhelming.,
Talk to your doctor about ETS surgery as a last-ditch measure.",How to Smell Nice if You Sweat a Lot3," Fruity-smelling sweat can be a symptom of diabetes, while bleachy-smelling sweat is one symptom of liver or kidney disease. Contact your doctor if you are concerned your sweat is a symptom of a significant medical problem., Basic hygiene should keep you smelling nice. If you find your problem persists, your doctor may be able to offer stronger treatments to eliminate the excessive sweat that is causing your body odor.

, Botox, a low-level dose of botulinum toxin, can be injected into a problem area. The botox will block signals from the brain to sweat glands, reducing sweat. This treatment is temporary, lasting two to eight months.

, Try the methods outlined above before taking such a significant step, but if your concerns are seriously compromising your quality of life, surgical options exist.


Removing a small area of skin from a patient's armpit and the tissue just below the armpit will often eliminate the most troublesome apocrine sweat glands.
Sweat glands can sometimes be drawn out from deeper skin layers using liposuction.

, An endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, or ETS, uses keyhole surgery to destroy the nerves that control sweating in a problem area."

, Always change into clean underwear after a shower.


If you're smelling not so good ""down there,"" then change your underwear at lunch or after you get home from school or work.
If you're a female and you're menstruating, change your underwear often and also change your pad or tampon every few hours to keep yourself smelling fresh.

, The odor from dirty clothes will keep you from smelling good.

Never put dirty feet into clean shoes. The biggest key to keeping shoes smelling fresh is to always clean your feet and wear clean socks.
Alternate your shoes on different days. Wear one pair one day and another pair the next day to give your other shoes time to air out.
Take your shoes off as soon as you get home. Doing this gives your shoes a chance to dry and prevents bacteria from growing inside moist leather or fabric.

, In the morning and at night before you go to bed are good times to brush your teeth. To keep your mouth even cleaner and fresher, brush your teeth after every meal. Also, thoroughly brush your tongue to remove any film or residual odors that can cause your breath to stink.

, You can also use special inner soles in your shoes that can be taken out and washed when they become smelly.

, Splash your cologne all over yourself. If it's perfume, spray it on the pulse points on your neck, behind your ears and on your wrists. You can also spray perfume on your clothes. Just make sure that you don't overdo it so that you're the only thing that people can smell in a room.

, These sprays can irritate your vagina and upset your vagina's self-cleaning mechanisms.

, These must-haves will save you from sweat and odor when you're on the go:


Wet wipes – use this to wipe up any grease or odor from your body

Hop in the shower.,
Use deodorant.,
Try body powder.,
Wear clothes that smell good.,
Have great-smelling feet.,
Freshen your breath.",How to Smell Good All the Time1," If you want to smell your best, it starts with getting clean. How often you should bathe depends on your personal body chemistry, your daily activities and the weather. Many people bathe once a day, but if you play a sport or live in a hot region you might want to jump in the tub more than once. If your skin is really dry, every other day might be enough. But no matter what, make sure you bathe often enough that your body odor doesn't become noticeable to other people.


In the shower, wash your skin with soap and warm water to make sure you rinse away the dirt, sweat and bacteria that causes body odor.
When in doubt, go ahead and rinse off! Trying to mask body odor with deodorant or perfume doesn't really work.
If you don't want to wash your hair every day (many say it leads to dry and damaged hair), use dry shampoo to freshen your hair on days you don't wash. It's composed of powders that absorb the oil that makes your hair look greasy.;
, Two percent of people have a gene that prevents their armpits from producing body odor.They're the lucky ones, right? The rest of us rely on deodorant to keep body odor at bay throughout the day. Put some on after you shower, and reapply as necessary throughout the day.


Consider choosing a deodorant/antiperspirant combination if you tend to get a little sweaty.
Deodorants come in solid sticks, gel sticks, or sprays. You also buy natural rock deodorant, or even make your own using baking soda and coconut oil. Experiment with the deodorant that feels the most comfortable and keeps you smelling the best.
If you plant to wear perfume or cologne, it's not necessary to use a highly-scented deodorant. You don't want to wear too many different scents at once.

, Sprinkling on a little body powder after your bath or shower is a great way to stay fresh. Just dry off completely, then put some under your arms, on your feet, and anywhere else you'd like. The powder helps to keep your skin dry and cool during the day, so it comes in handy on hot, humid days.


You can buy body powder formulated for adults or just pick up some baby powder - it works just as well. You might want to get an unscented version, though, since baby powder has a distinctive smell.
Don't want to buy body powder? Make it! All you need is cornstarch. If you want to scent your body powder, soak a cotton ball in your favorite perfume or essential oil. Put the cotton ball in a jar and cover it with cornstarch. Apply the body powder using a fluffy makeup applicator., Wearing the same clothes several days in a row can affect the way you smell, so make sure you keep up on your laundry! Choose to use a scented detergent or an unscented one - it doesn't matter, as long as your clothes are clean.


You might want to carry a few backup items to change into if you're going to be out all day. Some people like to keep a fresh pair of underwear, tights, socks or an undershirt on hand for emergencies.
If you work in a place with a strong smell or you're around smoke a lot, you might have to take extra care to keep your clothes smelling great. Laundering them more frequently and using a strong-smelling detergent and fabric softener should do the trick.
Get your winter coat and other unwashable items dry cleaned every few months to keep them from getting smelly.
Speaking of clothes, check out your bags, backpacks, hats and other accessories, too. Wash these items every once in a while, especially if you use them every day.

, If you're worried about how your feet smell, take extra care to scrub your feet in the shower, dry them completely, and sprinkle them with body or foot powder before you put on your socks and shoes. Carry an extra pair of socks to change into later in the day. Make sure your shoes are in good shape, too - old shoes can be a source of bad smells.


Have a separate pair of shoes you use when you work out, rather than wearing your running shoes to school or work.
Carry a small bottle of foot powder with you so you can use it when you need to during the day.
When possible, wear socks with your shoes. Going without socks tends to make your feet sweat more, leading to bad odors.

, Practicing good dental hygiene is the main way to keep your breath smelling fresh. Be sure to brush and floss every day, and see the dentist regularly to take care of issues like plaque buildup so you don't end up with chronic bad breath. In addition to basic hygiene, you can keep your breath smelling good all day long by doing the following:


Drink lots of water. This is especially important during and just after meals. It rinses away the food particles and cleanses your mouth.
Use mouthwash - but not the kind with alcohol. Alcohol in mouthwash can dry out your mouth, leading to conditions that cause bad breath. Choose a breath-freshening wash that doesn't have alcohol and rinse your mouth out whenever you're in need of a quick fix.
Avoid garlic, onions and super spicy foods on days when you're really concerned about having fresh breath. It's hard to mask the smell of strong-scented foods with mouthwash, and the odor can persist even after brushing or using mouthwash.
Carry breath mints you can pop last minute when you want your breath to smell sweet.

Choose the perfect scent.,
Dab a little on your pulse points.,
Scent your hair.,
Stick to one signature scent.,
Try creating an original scent.",How to Smell Good All the Time2," Look for a scent that adds to your style and complements your overall presentation. A great scent is one you don't mind smelling all day. It shouldn't be too strong, since some people are sensitive to overpowering smells. Experiment with different scents until you find a few you like. You can wear the same scent every day or rotate between a few.


Different scents are great for different occasions. A citrusy, floral, sweet scent might be great for daytime wear, while you might choose something musky and a bit stronger to wear at night.
If you're looking for a more masculine scent, go for a cologne with notes of fir, cedar and sandalwood.
Scents change depending on who is wearing them. They interact with your unique body chemistry and change a little throughout the day. It's something to keep in mind when you're picking out a scent - one that works for your friend might not smell the same way on you.
You can also use a scent in the form of lotion or body oil, if you prefer. Solid perfume is another popular choice.

, Don't bathe yourself in your chosen scent. Use it strategically, so people nearby get small whiffs, but don't feel overwhelmed. A little goes a long way, especially if you're using real perfume. Put some on your wrists, neck, and behind your ears - that's probably all you need.


If you're using a spray bottle, don't spray it directly on your body at a close range. Hold the bottle several inches from your body and spray lightly, then move your wrist or other body part into the mist.
Even if you're using scented lotion, you probably don't want to slather it all over your body. Just use it in a few places, like your hands and neck. Use an unscented lotion to moisturize the rest of your skin.

, If your shampoo doesn't have much of a smell, you might want to add a bit of scent to your hair. This is a nice, subtle way to keep you smelling great all day long. Rub a little perfume or essential oil between your palms, then smooth it gently through your hair. Alternatively, you could add a few drops of your favorite scent to your unscented shampoo or conditioner.

, It's not a good idea to wear 3 - 4 warring scents that leave a smelly trail in your wake when you walk down the hall. Instead of asking you the name of your perfume, people will pinch their noses when they see you coming! Just wear one main scent at a time.


That means that if you have a strongly-scented lotion, you shouldn't also wear perfume, and vice versa.
Be sure you aren't accidentally wearing too many scents. Your deodorant, hairspray, and lip balm might all be scented. Try to choose unscented products and stick to one or two main scents.

, If you don't want to splurge on a bottle of perfume or cologne, you can make your own scent! Purchase a few different essential oils, like rose, lavender, lemongrass or vetiver, and use a few drops instead of perfume. You can even make your own perfume blend by mixing several different essential oils together until you come up with something you like.


To find essential oils, check out health food stores. They're usually in the body care section.
You can dilute your essential oil mix with water or vodka so that it doesn't smell as strong. Put it in a spray bottle and use it on your body and hair.

Freshen up a few times a day.,
Stay away from foods with strong odors.,
Keep your surroundings clean.,
Scent your drawers and closets.",How to Smell Good All the Time3," You're probably good to go in the morning, after you've showered and put on clean clothes, but it's a good idea to take some time to freshen up throughout the day. Whether you're at school or work, there are things you can do to keep yourself smelling great even though you've been on your feet or at a desk all day long.


Brush your teeth or use mouthwash. It instantly makes you feel and smell fresher.
Reapply perfume if necessary. Don't put on too much - just a light mid-day spritz.
Change clothes if you need to. If you've been physically exerting yourself, you might want to change your underclothes or socks halfway through the day.
Use sanitary wipes to quickly cleanse yourself. Get the unscented kind, since scented wipes have a strong smell. Do a quick swipe in areas that need freshening, then reapply deodorant.

, On days when you're extremely concerned about smelling good, try not to eat a lot of onions, garlic or spicy food. These foods have components that linger in the system for awhile, and they can change the way your breath and body smells.


Cruciferous vegetables, nuts and legumes also affect your smell. Eating a lot of broccoli, nuts or beans could cause you to get gassy.
Instead, eat fruit and other water-heavy foods. They'll cleanse your system and help you smell good.

, Is your bedroom clean and fresh, or does it smell a little stale? How about your car and other places where you spend a lot of time? Keeping the spaces around you clean will help you smell fresh, too. Start by making sure your bedroom is clean. Put all your dirty clothes in a closed hamper, and hang up or fold your clean clothes for storage instead of letting them stay in a pile. Here are a few other ways to keep your spaces extra fresh:


Scent your sheets and pillows with herbal spray. Mix a few drops of essential oil with water and spray your linens when you make your bed.
Shampoo your carpet regularly. Carpets tend to hold in odors, and can affect the way all of your belongings smell. Between shampoos, clean your carpet by covering it with baking soda, then vacuuming it up.
Clean out your car. Wash the seats and air it out regularly.

, If you want to keep your clothes smelling great, try storing them in drawers and closets that are scented with sachets. You can make your own sachets by filling small cloth bags with dried lavender or other herbs you like. Simply place the sachets in the corners of your drawers or hang them in your closets. They'll lightly scent your clothes and keep them from smelling stale.

People with thick hair, curly hair, or who don’t have oily hair can usually wait longer between shampooing.
If you are worried that your hair or scalp smells but you don’t want to risk damaging your hair, try just using water or a leave in conditioner instead of shampooing. You can also test out products such as powders and dry shampoos, which will help you go longer between washings since they reduce oils and the bad smells that might repel boys.
If you are not sure how often you should wash your hair, ask a professional stylist or dermatologist.

, To maintain dental health and prevent bad breath, which boys might find unattractive, brush your teeth at least twice a day. Flossing your teeth everyday will also help keep your mouth and breath smelling great.
Brush after a meal to remove food particles and get rid of germs that cause bad breath.
If you practice good dental hygiene, but still feel like you have a problem with bad breath, talk with a doctor or dentist. You might have a medical condition that is causing this problem.

, Antiperspirants help prevent sweating while deodorants mask odor, so applying these products every day will help you smell great for boys.To maximize the effectiveness of these products, use them twice per day—in the morning and at night.Many antiperspirants also contain deodorants, so these products are often more effective at preventing body odor than simply using deodorants.If regular strength products don’t seem to work for you, try a stronger, clinical strength antiperspirant or deodorant. Doctors can also prescribe even stronger products.
Keep antiperspirant or deodorant with you at school or work so that you can reapply it as needed.

, Hair can trap bacteria and odors, so shaving areas such as your armpits should help you reduce and manage body odor., Although it is natural, foot odor is unattractive and can make you feel less confident around boys. Avoid wearing the same pair of shoes each day so they have time to air out.To cut down on unpleasant odors and freshen shoes and feet, you can also sprinkle foot powder in your shoes or apply these products directly to your feet.

, Bathing regularly and going through the steps above won’t be effective if you put on dirty, smelly clothes. Wash your clothes regularly to keep them smelling fresh.To get rid of bad smells on your clothes and boost the effectiveness of your detergent, consider adding white vinegar, lemon juice, borax, or baking soda during the wash cycle., If your attempts to practice good hygiene don’t seem to be working and you have concerns about how you smell, talk with a medical professional about your situation. They will be able to diagnose and treat any medical conditions that might be causing the problem.


They may even be able to prescribe certain products or medications that are more effective than over-the-counter ones.

Learn about the smells that boys find attractive.,
Apply the perfume correctly.,
Try scented lotion.,
Use great-smelling bath products.,
Think about the combined scent of your products.",How to Smell Good for Boys2," Fragrances and perfumes are personal choices and you should pick one that you like, but researchers have found that males are often attracted to a few specific scents, so you might consider a perfume that contains these notes:Vanilla.
Orange.
Lavender.
Green apples.
Don’t be afraid to ask a member of the opposite sex what smells good to him. This is probably the most effective way to ensure you smell good to someone else.

, Applying too much or too little perfume or fragrance can be off-putting to boys. Keep these guidelines in mind to make sure you are applying perfume correctly:For a more even application that isn’t overwhelming, spray once into the air above you and then walk through the mist.To keep fragrances from dissipating, apply to a few pulse points and areas that give off heat. These include behind the ears, on the wrists, on the collarbone, inside the elbows, and behind the knees.You can also lightly spray your hairbrush with perfume before brushing your hair.
A quick way to tell if you’ve applied too much perfume to an area is to wait a few seconds after applying and then touch a tissue to the area. If the tissue sticks, it’s a good indicator you over-applied the product.If you accidentally put on too much perfume or body spray, rub a cotton ball soaked with rubbing alcohol to the spot., When you want to smell good for boys, scented lotions can have more staying power than perfumes and are usually less expensive. These products also often have moisturizing skin benefits that perfumes don’t offer.


Be careful when using scented lotions and perfumes because they might be too strong or cloying when mixed.

, Scented bath products are also an easy and inexpensive way to improve the way you smell to boys since they are often more affordable than perfumes.


If you are planning to use a strong-smelling perfume or lotion, a lighter smelling body wash or shower gel might be a better choice so these scents are not overwhelming., When you use multiple scented products, it’s important to consider what the combined smell might be like. You want to choose products that go together and compliment each other rather than creating an off-putting combination that might be too strong and end up repelling boys.


Choose products in the same family so they go better together. For example, if you use a citrus-based perfume, choose a citrus-based shower gel or lotion.Products with vanilla, amber, and coconut tend to layer better and go well with more products.For an objective opinion, ask your friends or family how these products smell together when you are wearing them.

Prepare a smell-good kit.,
Use a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and water to reduce body odor.,
Apply witch hazel.,
Avoid foods that can cause body odor.,
Chew gum to prevent bad breath.,
Select and wear clothes made from natural fibers.,
Store perfumed sachets in your clothes drawers and closets.",How to Smell Good for Boys3," When you’re on the go and want to make sure you smell good for boys, it can be helpful to have a few products on hand that you can use if you’re away from your regular stash. Consider carrying these items with you in your purse, bag, car, or gym locker.Wet wipes or baby wipes to freshen up.
Powder to absorb sweat and prevent bad odors.
Antiperspirant and deodorant so you can reapply as needed.
Lotion or perfume when the product you put on in the morning dissipated.
A spare toothbrush, toothpaste, or mouthwash to freshen your breath.

, If there are certain areas such as your feet or under your arms that you think smell, mix 1 teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide (3%) with 1 cup (8 ounces) of water. Then, wipe this solution on the affected areas., Witch hazel lowers the skin’s pH level, which makes it difficult for the bacteria that cause bad odors to survive. When you want to make sure you smell good for boys, try applying a cotton ball soaked with witch hazel to the areas of your skin that seem smelly such as the underarms or your feet.Carry a spray bottle of witch hazel with you so you can apply whenever you feel the need.

, Certain types of foods can result in more pungent body odors that boys may find less than appealing, so try changing your diet to see if it makes a difference in how you smell. Garlic, curry, onions, fatty foods, and oils have been shown to cause a stronger body odor.It’s a good idea to consult with a doctor or dietician before you make significant changes to your diet.

, When your mouth is dry, bad breath can occur, and chewing gum helps increase saliva production and flow.For dental health, choose a sugarless gum with xylitol.

, Clothes made from natural fibers such as cotton and wool are more breathable, which means that they help odors dissipate instead of trapping them like synthetic fabrics. They also help keep you cooler and fresh-smelling.


It’s much harder to get odors out of synthetic fabrics, even with repeated washing.
Wash your clothes as soon as you can, especially after working out.

, To keep both yourself and your clothes smelling great even when they’re stored in drawers or closets, store them with perfume sachets."

Combat odor with food and drink.Certain foods have deodorizing properties that linger on your breath and skin for hours after you eat them.",How to Smell Good," On average, you should take a shower every one to two days. Even if you are unable to smell an unpleasant odor on your skin by the end of day two, you should still wash up.


Bacteria and moisture will build on your skin fairly quickly, causing potential health problems as well as a notably foul odor. Regular bathing dries out the skin and strips it of odor-causing bacteria.
Wash up more frequently during the summer, especially if you catch yourself sweating a lot during your work or play hours.
Use warm water and soap. The soap is an essential aspect since it removes dirt and grime trapped in your skin's natural oils.
Wash your hair as needed. You may not think that your hair is contributing to body odor issues, but oil, dirt, and bacteria can build up there, as well. Washing your hair every one to three days will usually prevent this from causing an issue.
For an extra boost, use a scented soap and scented shampoo.;
, As sweat leaks out, it gets trapped in your underarm hair, causing bacteria to grow and fester. This causes odor to build.


You should shave your armpits every few days in the summer, especially if you sweat a lot. You can last longer in the winter, but you should still shave every couple of weeks to preserve optimal freshness.

,


For best results, choose a deodorant also labeled as an antiperspirant. These deodorants not only apply fragrance to your armpits, but also reduce sweating and odor-causing build-up.
A good deodorant should last for at least 12 hours, but you may need to apply it more often if you end up sweating a lot during the day.
You can purchase spray deodorants and stick deodorants. The latter tend to have a better reputation, though.

, Wash your clothes regularly and change into something clean each day. If smelly sweat soaks into the fabric below your arm, you should change into something fresh.


Your undergarments are especially essential to change. During particularly hot weather, you may even need to change your underpants and socks twice a day.

, Bad breath can be caused by unpleasant food odors, but more commonly, it results from the build up of bacteria in the mouth. You should brush two to three times each day in order to strip your mouth of bacteria and reduce the effect of bad breath.


Brush your teeth as soon as you wake up in the morning and right before going to bed. You can also brush your teeth in the middle of the day, shortly after lunch, to promote even better dental hygiene.
Run your toothbrush over your tongue as you brush. Not many people think about it, but bacteria that builds up on your teeth also builds up on your tongue. Gently scraping your tongue with your toothbrush is a good way to remove most of this bacteria.
Use dental floss at least once a day to remove the dirt and bacteria lurking in between your teeth.

, The exfoliating process gets deep into your pores, completely clearing out any foreign bacteria or dirt lingering there. Invest in an exfoliating body wash and use it in the shower once or twice a week, or as directed on the label.


Alternatively, you could also exfoliate your skin using Dead Sea salt or Epsom salt. Mix 2 to 3 Tbsp (30 to 45 ml) salt into a full tub of hot bathwater and soak in it until the water gets cool. Only use salt once or twice a month, though, or else you may dry your skin out too much.

, Doing so will increase the potency of that smell, allowing it to last longer.


If you cannot find the same exact smell in multiple products, use different products that each have similar elements in common. For instance, opt for multiple rose-scented products even if each product is manufactured by a different company.
Begin with a scented shower gel and layer on a scented lotion as soon as you dry off. If possible, complement the smell further with a scented deodorant.
You can also use perfumes, colognes, body powders, and aftershaves to add further layers.

, Proper application begins with choosing the right product. From there, you also need to know where to apply the product and how much to use.


As far as perfume goes, products labeled as ""perfume"" have the highest concentration of scent, followed by ""parfum,"" ""eau de toilette,"" and ""eau de fraiche.""A higher concentration of scent means a longer-lasting smell.
As far as cologne goes, an ""eau de toilette"" has the highest scent concentration, followed by ""cologne"" and ""eau de cologne."" Aftershave has the weakest concentration.As with perfume, a higher concentration of scent means a longer-lasting smell.
Only apply perfume and cologne to pulse points along your body. These areas are the warmest part of your body and diffuse the perfume most effectively. Try the inside of your wrists, nape of your neck, inside of your elbows, and behind your knees.Resist the urge to douse yourself in fragrance, as this is often overwhelming to the people around you.

, Use a tongue cleaner every night before going to bed. Gently run the scraper over your tongue and rinse your mouth out with water.


A tongue cleaner is even more effective at stripping your tongue of harmful bacteria than a toothbrush. As such, this can be an especially handy tool to have and use if you struggle with bad breath.

, While proper dental hygiene is your most effective weapon against bad breath, you can use breath mints and other breath fresheners after a meal or whenever a “stale” taste develops in your mouth.


Breath mints, chewing gum, and breath sprays are all decent options worth considering.
Be forewarned that overusing these products can actually lead to increased tooth decay, especially if you use mints and gum with high sugar contents.

, Body odor can also result from the buildup of toxins within your body. While there are special diets designed to flush these toxins out, the simplest way to keep your body free of odor-causing toxins is to consistently stay well-hydrated, since simple water is nature's way of flushing out your system.


Try to drink six to eight 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of water daily.

, As such, foot hygiene and deodorizing is another important aspect of smelling good.


Clean your feet every day. Use a pumice stone, foot brush, or other exfoliating scrub to scrub away the dirt and dead skin cells on your feet.
Use foot powders to absorb moisture as needed.
Wear open footwear in the summer. Open footwear allows your feet to ""breathe,"" preventing sweat and odor as a result.

, Fabric can absorb unpleasant odor, so even clean clothes may begin to smell bad as time passes. Take a few extra precautions to keep the area you store your clothes in smelling fresh in order to keep yourself smelling better, as well.


Air fresheners are, perhaps, the most obvious solution to try. Choose an air freshener that neutralizes odors instead of merely masking them. When possible, look for a freshener specifically labeled for use with clothing.
Lay fabric sheets in your dresser drawers to preserve the fresh ""laundry scent"" longer. You can also stuff fabric sheets into the shoes stored in your coat closet.Fabric sheets stuffed into shoes should be changed daily, but those in your dresser drawer should only be changed once they lose their scent.
Sprinkle soap shaving in your closet or dresser. Shave a bar of soap using a box grater. Collect 1/2 cup (125 ml) shavings to put into a plastic bag, and place these plastic bags open in your drawers or along the bottom of your closet.
Fill a cloth mesh bag with potpourri and place it in your dresser drawers. Change the potpourri as needed.
Place an open box of baking soda at the bottom of your closet. Baking soda absorbs odor, so the space should begin smelling fresher within a few days to weeks.
Place chalk in your closet.Chalk absorbs moisture, thereby limiting odor-causing dampness in your closet. Tie a bundle of chalk with sturdy string and hang it out of the way inside your closet.

, Treat yourself to a scented bath once or twice a week for an extra fragrance boost. Pour a little bubble bath into your bathwater or mix in a few drops of essential oils.


If washing your hair, wait until after you finish washing your hair before you add the scents.
Women should avoid soaking in strong, heavy scents or chemicals. These products can cause irritation to the sensitive vaginal area, thereby upsetting the chemical balance of that area and leading to a stronger odor.

, When you sense your armpits are in need of a touch-up, excuse yourself to the restroom and roll the perfume around the perimeter of your armpit.


Note that this should not be used as a replacement for deodorant. Alone, fragrances like this will not be able to combat body odor. Only use this tactic as a backup for your regular armpit freshening routine.

,


Soak a cotton ball with concentrated apple cider vinegar and thoroughly swipe it over your armpits.
Perform this at least three times each day: in the morning, at noon, and at night.
If you choose to do so, you can still apply a little deodorant after applying the vinegar. An antiperspirant is especially helpful since it reduces odor-causing sweat.

, Pungent-smelling foods do not need to be avoided altogether, but you should consume them alongside foods that can counteract the odor.


Cinnamon has a strong, pleasant odor that lingers on the skin.
Cardamom and fenugreek seeds act as mouth fresheners.
Citrus fruit can leave your mouth feeling fresh, and since citrus is easily absorbed by the body, your skin may give off a slightly freshened odor, as well.
Swap the coffee for jasmine tea or green tea, when possible. Jasmine tea has a pleasant, long-lasting floral odor, and green tea contains polyphenol compounds that remove odor-causing bacteria in your mouth. Moreover, green tea and herbal tea improve your digestive health over time, thereby improving your body's odor.
Balance out the smell of garlic and onion with milk, parsley, or mint.

Increase your vegetable and fruit intake.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Exercise regularly.",How to Smell Natural1," The food you eat plays a large role in your natural scent. When you eat something strong smelling, those scents will eventually make their way up to your skin and out through your pores. Vegetables and fruits smell fresh and natural. They also help your body get rid of toxins that may be causing unpleasant odors.Avoid red meat, alcohol, and foods with lots of chemical preservatives.
Garlic and onions are healthy veggies, but because of their strong odor, try to limit your intake of those.;
, Water flushes odor-causing toxins from your system, first by diluting them and eventually getting rid of them entirely. The more water you drink, the cleaner your system will be. Try to stay hydrated at all times and counteract any smelly foods you’ve eaten by upping your water intake more.For example, if you ate red meat earlier, up your water intake significantly afterward. The water will help you move the food through your system, dilute toxins and flush them out of your body faster.

, Sweating helps your body to excrete even more odor-causing toxins though your skin. To detoxify your system and keep it running clean, try to work up a sweat regularly by exercising and increasing your overall physical activity.If you eat red meat or other odor-causing foods often, try to work in an exercise session each day to flush out those toxins.

Use natural, aluminum-free deodorants.,
Opt for laundry detergent that uses natural scents.,
Spritz problem areas with vinegar.,
Wipe down with witch hazel daily.",How to Smell Natural2," Aluminum is a common ingredient found in a lot of deodorants. It works by preventing perspiration from exiting through the sweat glands under your arms. Unfortunately, this also means the toxins that would naturally be excreted through your armpits are being blocked. Try an herbal or all-natural deodorant instead. Opt for organic natural products whenever possible.Herbal and crystal deodorants are especially popular.
Even if it’s labeled “natural,” check the ingredients list before you by it.

, Many laundry detergents today have strong chemical fragrances added to them. These scents can be cloying and overwhelming. Look for detergents that are more delicately scented by natural essential oils.


Lavender, lemon and cedar are just a few of the popular natural scents used in laundry detergents today., White and apple cider vinegar kill odor-causing bacteria. Put a small amount in a spray bottle and spritz any problem areas with it, then gently wipe your skin dry. This will get rid of any bad odors. Don't worry, the vinegar scent dissipates quickly!, Witch hazel is a natural substance that can soothe skin and decrease bacteria. Pour some onto a soft rag and wipe down your skin gently with it. It’s scent is mild and natural."
"
Use lightly scented body oil instead of lotion.,
Look for hair products containing mild natural scents.,
Wear natural essential oil perfumes.",How to Smell Natural3," Body lotion is scented with perfumes and contains other chemical ingredients, as well. Body oil is naturally moisturizing and usually unscented or scented with natural essential oils like sandalwood and patchouli.Coconut and jojoba oil are both popular with natural product enthusiasts.

, Hair tends to hold on to the scents of products throughout most of the day. Avoid the faux “fresh” scents used in many shampoos and conditioners and opt for hair products that are lightly scented with natural fragrances and essential oils., Most department store perfumes are alcohol-based and feature unnatural fragrances that cling to your skin and clothing for hours. Natural perfumes, on the other hand, are gentle formulas made of botanicals. While the scents do last a few hours, they fade away naturally as your skin absorbs the hydrating oil.


Perfume oils that include patchouli and sandalwood smell earthy.
If you want something a little brighter, try a citrus or floral scent.

Use a scented shower gel for an added burst of scent. Choose one that you absolutely love. If it's not to be shared with others, keep it elsewhere or mark it as yours only.
Use a deliciously scented soap in the shower or bath.;
, The ""regularity"" depends on your hair type and your age. When you do shampoo, use a scented shampoo that you love and be sure that the conditioner matches this.

, Soap can be used in different parts of the house, not just in the shower or bath. It's also used at the hand basin after using the bathroom or for cleaning your hands. It can also be found in the kitchen and in the laundry, places where a scented soap will give you a life whenever you need to wash your hands in these locations. Keep a small bar of soap or some fresh smelling sanitizer close by at all times to ensure soft, clean hands.


Soap is also handy when out and about. A scented gel or sanitizer soap can be kept in your handbag/purse, in the car, in your office or desk, and so forth, ready for use as needed.

, Here there is a need to be careful, for you don't want the deodorant to overpower your fragrance. However, a softly scented deodorant can help you not only to stay fresh but to smell great too. Try different sorts until you find several you like, allowing you to mix and match them with your favorite perfumes, to check that they don't overwhelm the perfume. Of course, the other alternative is to get a no-scented or lightly scented deodorant; it still does the job but it's not competing with your other scented products.


Keep your deodorant handy in case you need to re-apply.

, When you wear perfume during the daytime, wear a floral, fruity or freshly scented product. Try to find one that hasn't got too many chemicals in it and isn't too strong. When you wear a perfume at night, wear a slightly stronger scent that tends to linger in the air. As always, make sure it isn't too strong.


Read How to choose perfume for details on selecting a good perfume.

, If you choose to wear body spray, unless you are a teenager, steer clear of Charlie, Impulse and Own Brand products. You may find these smell as cheap as they actually are. Chose an up-market brand if you can afford it. The key to body spray is to not wear perfume as well; if you do, you will smell overwhelming to others and the end mixture won't be very pleasant.

, When you wear nice smelling products, always test them together to ensure that they mix and layer well. For instance, do not wear a strong lavender soap, a light passion flower deodorant, a really strong tacky body spray and a light rose perfume. It just won't work together. If you can, buy products from the same range, such as a light lime soap, a lemon shower gel, a 'go fresh' Dove deodorant and a citrus body spray. These particular scents will layer well, will last the whole day and will help you to smell wonderful because they are fresh and luscious.

, When you have your period, you may find you smell a lot more than usual. To battle Mother Nature, it is recommended that wear a scented sanitary towel, change your sanitary ware frequently and wash twice a day. There are sprays that can be used but this is a delicate area of your body and the less products used, the better for your health.

, Be sure to take good care of your feet and keep them hygienic. Never wear the same socks two days in a row and never forget your feet when showering. You can add a few drops of tea tree oil or a sprinkle of baking soda to smelly shoes, to improve the odor. Tea tree oil is also anti-bacterial, which can help your feet to smell less too.

, This includes such foods as tuna, garlic or onion. Eat something fruity or sweet for lunch, preferably something that won't get stuck in your teeth. Consider an apple or blueberries.


If you love garlic (after all, it's good for you) and other smelly foods, try eating parsley afterwards, to minimize the odor.

, Wear clothes for a maximum of 24 hours. For a sweet subtle scent, use a scented clothes detergent.


Wash your pajamas weekly, at least. This may need to be more frequent during hot weather.
Clothing close to your body needs to be changed more frequently than outer wear. If you try to wear the same t-shirt twice in a row without washing, eventually your skin oils will discolor it and odors may be hard to shift. On the other hand, an overcoat can be worn plenty of times before it needs a dry clean or other suitable wash. Spot wash outer clothing to remove stains and odors.

Keep a napkin or handkerchief with you to dry off your hands whenever necessary.",How to Prevent Sweaty Palms1," There are many antiperspirants designed especially for hands and feet. Nonprescription antiperspirants will temporarily block sweat pores, which means less sweat will be produced on your skin.Make sure to choose an antiperspirant and not just a deodorant; these are different kinds of products for different uses.


It may help to include an antiperspirant in your daily body care routine, preventing occasional sweat rather than treating already-sweaty palms.
Consult a dermatologist or a general care provider for guidance about different antiperspirant products.;
, Loose-fitting clothing can help your body regulate its temperature, reducing the amount of sweat that appears on uncovered body parts. Cotton, wool, and silk generally allow your skin to breathe and are good choices for hot weather. Sport clothing that wicks away sweat may be a good choice for exercising., These powders absorb moisture easily, keeping your hands from appearing too damp. They can also help increase your grip, which may be diminished due to sweat. Avoid caking your hands in powder, which may make you sweat more. A light dusting is fine.


Be sure to wash powder off afterwards.

, Tasks such as typing, construction, or writing involve a lot of friction, heat, and work. Make sure you take regular breaks when performing these activities so your body can regulate its temperature. Wiping your hands off with a soft cloth or towel may also help. Breaks can be combined with other sweat-reduction tips found in this article; for instance, during a break you could wash your hands or move to a cooler place.


If possible, try to alternate your tasks throughout the day. Type for half an hour and then do a different task before coming back to typing. This will allow your body to rest.

, Don’t hide your hands in your pockets or cover them with gloves or rings. Keeping your hands in cramped areas will make them damp, warm, and sweaty. Though cool air may feel uncomfortable or cold on very sweaty patches of skin, it will help reduce sweating.

, A simple cotton cloth can keep your hands dry for a period of time. You needn't wipe your hands off regularly, only when they become unreasonably sweaty. Cotton is preferable, as it absorbs moisture well. Consider keeping a plastic baggy on your person in which you can stow used cloths.


Dipping your handkerchief or cloth in rubbing alcohol can help your hands stay clean and cool.

Avoid foods with added sugars.,
Stay away from spicy foods and caffeinated liquids.,
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.,
Limit your intake of foods that are high in iodine.,
Keep your weight at a healthy level.",How to Prevent Sweaty Palms2," A warm body will sweat in order to cool itself. Staying hydrated is important because it allows your body to regulate its temperature. More than that, though, cold drinks, rather than room-temperature or warm drinks, can prevent excess sweating, as the intake of cold fluids keeps your core body temperature down.Water is best, but you can drink chilled teas or other non-calorie drinks that taste good--the better they taste, the more likely you are to drink them.You can drink sports drinks as well, but such fluids are designed for use by athletes engaging in vigorous activity. These drinks contain carbohydrates and electrolytes you may not need if you aren't exercising.

, Sugar-laden foods can boost blood sugar, which can lead to dizziness, sleepiness, and sweating. If you are sensitive to sugar, eating more than you need may lead to increased sweating. Additionally, conditions such as reactive hypoglycemia may lead to sweating, jitteriness, and headaches after ingesting sugar.Other foods composed of simple sugars, such as white bread or potatoes, may aggravate such reactions even if they don't contain added sugar. Cut these out of your diet, or replace them with alternatives, such as wheat bread or yams, that contain more complex carbohydrates.

, These should be especially avoided on warm days. Spice and caffeine activate specific neurotransmitters that tell your body to produce sweat.Choose milder foods and reduced-caffeine drinks and treats.


Remember that even decaf coffee contains trace amounts of caffeine, which may be a problem for sensitive individuals.

, These are a good source of fiber, vitamins, and minerals that help regulate bodily functions. Whole foods promote stable blood sugar levels, which can prevent sweatiness of the palms. Fresh fruit and vegetables contain water, which can help regular body temperature, especially if chilled.


You may consider including a multivitamin in your diet if you cannot eat many different kinds of plant foods.
Contrary to popular conception, fruit and vegetables diets do not ""detox"" your body.It is better to include such foods as part of a daily diet rather than as a crash diet.

, These foods include turkey, onions, cranberries, dairy products, potatoes, broccoli, beef, and asparagus. Though these foods are healthful, consuming too much iodine may contribute to hyperthyroidism, a metabolic dysfunction. One symptom of hyperthyroidism is excessive sweating.Only a doctor can diagnose hyperthyroidism. If you are concerned about developing metabolic syndromes, consult your primary care provider.

, Excessive sweating can be more common in those who are overweight, obese, or otherwise unfit.Though exercise, especially strenuous exercise, causes one to sweat, you will sweat less in your everyday life if you are at a healthy weight and commit to a healthy activity level.

Avoid hot and humid places.,
Wash your hands often with soap and water.,
Take cool showers to keep your body from sweating.,
Control your anxiety and stress.",How to Prevent Sweaty Palms3," Your body will sweat in order to reduce its temperature. Being in hot weather will raise your body temperature. If you are outside a lot during hot parts of the year, consider taking regular breaks indoors where it is cooler, or seeking regular refuge in the shade or under an umbrella.


Public areas, such as coffee shops, libraries, and museums, often have air conditioning during hotter months. It is generally acceptable to spend time in these areas in order to relax and beat the heat.

, Though this may seem counter-intuitive, rinsing your hands with cool water can lower your body temperature, preventing excess sweat. Using soap will keep your hands healthy and bacteria-free. Make sure you dry your hands completely with a soft cloth after washing them.


Excess hand washing may make them too dry. Either limit hand washing or consider using a lotion after washing.
An alcohol-based hand sanitizer can also keep your hands cool., Cool showers are a great way to reduce your body heat in hot weather or long days. Take care that you don't shower too much; too much cleansing can leave your skin dry and without essential oils, which may interfere with healthy sweating. Consider using a moisturizer or body lotion, as well as an antiperspirant, after showering.

, Stressful situations can make you sweat more than usual.Control your stress levels through daily exercises such as yoga, meditation, or massage. Consider practicing different relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and even laughter. Mix and match these techniques for your daily life in order to combat different kinds of stress--do yoga in the morning, for instance, and breathe deeply throughout the day.


Warm baths can help you control your stress (and sweat) levels, even if they do raise your body temperature.

Your doctor may ask general questions about lifestyle, or may request a history of your symptoms.Your care provider may first advise non-prescription antiperspirants, or may prescribe a stronger topical medicine such as Drysol.
Only a doctor can diagnose you with a treatable disorder such as hyperhidrosis.

, Iontophoresis is a process that involves applying low-level electrical currents to affected areas, such as palms. It has been shown in many cases to reduce sweating. This treatment is not permanent; it is administered twice a day for several days, after which you will have reduced sweatiness for several weeks. Then the procedure must be repeated again.Your doctor may suggest a device that you can use to treat yourself at home. Iontophoresis may not be right for you if you are pregnant or use a pacemaker.

, Botox, usually known as a treatment for facial wrinkles, can reduce sweating by paralyzing the nerves in your palms. This treatment can also work on other body parts, such as the soles of feet. This procedure may be more expensive than other options and is temporary, keeping sweat away for six to twelve months., Some surgical procedures can alter nerves that stimulate excess sweat production. Others can remove problematic glands in your palm. Surgical corrections become permanent about one month after the procedure, so there is room to reverse the changes.This doesn't mean surgery should be considered lightly; surgery can be expensive and may put you at risk for negative side effects.

Be respectful.",How to Be a Fangirl," This part is easy. A fandom is a collective group of people who are passionate about a specific thing, literally a group of fans. There are 2 types of fangirls, real-life and fictional. Real-life consists of sports teams, music artists, and bands, while fictional refers to any fandoms that are not real. Ex., games, tv shows, movies, books, even plays/musicals. Even though these types of fangirls seem very different they are both fangirls and gather in the same places, Tumblr, wattpad, Pinterest. And do the same things, fanfic (RPF) and cosplays to name a couple. Real and fictional fangirls tend to ignore each other instead of arguing so there are no full-out fandom wars, even if either side receives hate from the opposite once in a while. (While a fandom can be anything, they tend to focus on t.v. shows, movies, books, actors, a sports team, and musicians. So figure out what you're passionate for and start the hunt for others like you.


A few popular fandoms are Star Wars fans (fans of Star Wars), Whovians (fans of ""Doctor Who""), Sherlockians (fans of the BBC ""Sherlock;"" Holmesian seems to be more for fans of the original Arthur Conan Doyle stories), Potterheads (fans of ""Harry Potter""), Directioners (fans of the musical group, One Direction), 5sos Fam (The fans of the musical group ""5 Seconds Of Summer""), Swifties (fans of the pop star Taylor Swift), The Clique (fans of the musical group Twenty One Pilots), Demigods (Percy Jackson Fandom), Phandom (fans of Amazingphil, Phil Lester and Daniel Howell; Dan Howell) Youngbloods/Overcast Kids (Fall Out Boy fans), Marzipans (fans of Marzia; Pewdiepie's girlfriend), Sprinklerinos (fans of Sprinkleofglitter), Bro Army (fans of Pewdiepie), Tiny Planet Explorers (KickThePj), The Fault In Our Stars Fandom, Lushies (Matthew Lush), Tributes (The Hunger Games Fandom), Trekkies (Fans of ""Star Trek""), R5ers / R5 family (Fans of the band ""R5""), Initiates (Fans of Divergent), Gladers (Fans of The Maze Runner), Fairy Tailians (Fans of the anime Fairy Tail), Fallers (Fans of Gravity Falls), and Bronies (fans of ""My Little Pony"", usually referring to older males), A.R.M.Y (Fans of the K-Pop group BTS).Some fandoms even combine (eg. Wholock , SuperWhoLock ), you don't have to remain loyal only to one.
Don't be afraid to join into a fandom when you're starting out. It may seem like there's a lot of ground to cover in the beginning, but don't worry, you'll get the hang of it the more you're involved.
You should only pick something that you're passionate about, because it will make you want to share that passion with others!;
, You will want to find people who share your enthusiasm. The internet has made this particularly easy, but also overwhelming. There are a variety of places to start.


A lot of fandoms are sustained by the internet. They can be found on places like Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, Archive of Our Own (AO3), Fanfiction.net, Wattpad, Quotev, Quizup, Younow, YouTube, or even Livejournal (that old dinosaur).
Look for the so-called ""fandom leaders"" the people whose posts, artwork, and fanfiction are most popular. Paying attention to them can be a good way to get a feel for how things work in your fandom. It's also a good way to find other fans, in the people who are connected with or follow the most popular participants.
Fandom predates the internet, of course, with Star Trek fanzines, people writing letters to the original Watson as if he were real, and the enduring cultural phenomenon that was Star Wars.

, If you learn the language before delving in too deep it will help when you start getting further involved. Fandom, like anything, has evolved a language of its own that will seem incomprehensible to outsiders.


""Canon"" is one of the most important words to learn. Canon is a term writers of fan fiction use to describe something that is aligned with the original storyline. For example, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger are canon.
""Headcanon"" is a mini-story of an event or ship. It is not real, but could happen. i.e. Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger romantically together, or Dramione, could be told in a story in a few paragraphs or less as a headcanon.
""Fanfiction"" is where fans write stories about the thing they are passionate about. There is fanfiction about celebrities (called RPF or Real Person Fic), an alternate version of a book or movie. A lot of fans contribute to fandom by writing fanfiction and posting it to Archive of Our Own, Wattpad, or on their personal Tumblr blogs.
""Feels"" are feelings that have gotten out of hand according to fans. These extreme feelings (usually sadness, heartbreak, or overwhelming joy) tend to come about during a particularly intense/upsetting/wonderful scene or performance in a book, movie, or television show. At this point, many fans are moved to incoherency by the moment.
In fandom the term ""meta"" (possibly short for meta-analysis), means to analyze the source material in terms of character psychology, motivation, authorial intent. Meta can even be used to examine the fandom itself in these terms.""Theories"" are fan-made ideas. Such as ideas about the next generation, someone is a vampire, or an analysis on hidden secrets. Many fans come up with theories and you can too. Some are clarified by authors some are not. But choose what you want to believe.
""Fan wars"" are when two fandoms fight over which one is better. ex. Harry Potter vs. Twilight is a classic. You can choose to contribute or not. If you do choose to contribute though, try comparing characters, plot, storyline, meaning, etc.
Speaking of fan wars, check out the Supernatural vs. Beliebers war. The Beliebers were totally out of their league, because Supernatural has all of the other big, bad, scary fandoms to back it up (SuperWhoLock, Harry Potter, Hannibal).

, In many fandoms, you’ll see everyone talking about ships. No, they’re probably not boat enthusiasts. Ships (also seen as “shipping”) are pairings of characters or people in real life that fans would love to see become romantically or platonically involved. There are a variety of terms associated with shipping.Poke shipping is the shipping of two characters in Pokemon games/tv show. Ex: Ash & Misty.
Slash shipping is arguably one of the most popular and vocal parts of certain fandoms. It means the romantic pairing of two characters of the same sex, usually male (femslash is the term for female). The term slash is supposed to have come from the Star Trek: Original Series fandom with Spock and Kirk because of/in Spock/Kirk.One theory for slash fiction's popularity is the lack of queer narratives in popular culture.The term OTP means One True Pairing and means that this is a person's number one ship, usually regulated to one fandom. Fans of different works can have numerous OTPs. These pairings are not always canon.
The term NOTP (pronounced No Tee Pee) means the opposite of OTP and means that this is a person's least favourite ship, or a ship that they hate eg the 'NO' part of it. Fans of different works can have numerous NOTPs. These pairings are usually not canon, but they can be. If they are cannon, often times there is another ship the person likes better, (for example, Twilight fans often prefer either team Jacob or team Edward, and the other team is their not) or they believe there is a social reason they should not be together.

, Most fandoms have a lot of resources that contain information about the thing you're passionate about and the older members may not enjoy having to explain the same things over and over again.There are a variety of fansites to utilize: Tumblr, character and plot wiki pages, Livejournal, Fanfiction.net, Wattpad, AO3 has a wide variety of fanfiction, fandom forums.
For example, if you’re into LOST, there is an entire online database that includes everything remotely related to the show. For celebrities, fan-made blogs and websites are the hotspots for the latest pictures and information.
It helps to hang out in the background of your chosen fandom for a bit to get to know the ropes (so to speak) before jumping in. So hang back while you're learning.
Read Fanfiction (most fans will do this on the app wattpad)
Get merch.

, Once you've gotten the hang of how things work in your particular fandom, get to work contributing. It's a great way to participate and to get to know other people.


Participate in discussions about your fandom circulating the internet. Across a wide variety of social media, you can talk to like-minded fans and discuss and chat about your fandom. You don't have to be Tumblr famous to talk to people or have them listen to you.
Phrases such as OMG SIHAFOHSAUFOASH should do well.
Write fanfiction or meta and post it to AO3 (there's an application process to this website that you should learn about before trying to make an account there). There are things like spoiler tags, trigger warnings, and age ratings on fanfiction. Pay attention to these and make sure to tag your own things so people know what they're getting into.
Join a roleplaying forum for your favorite fandom. Roleplaying is when you act out a role from your source material. If you can't find one in your fandom, why not start one!

Make .gifs (Graphics Interchange Format) which is a format for compressing files and capturing scenes from your favorite movie or TV show.
Make YouTube videos about your ships, your favorite sports team, your favorite moments in a character's development, or parts of an interview with your favorite celebrity.
Make edits!

, Just because you love something doesn't mean you should ignore its flaws or become offended when someone points them out. Being a fan means understanding what's good about the thing you're passionate about and what needs work.


Call out problematic behavior. Fandom isn't free of the problems that plague society, so when you see problematic behavior (like sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia) explain to the perpetrator why such behavior is problematic. Be aware that they won't always listen and could react negatively. An example: the creators of the podcast, Welcome to Nightvale, have explicitly stated that the scientist character, Carlos is a person of color and yet a certain subset of the fandom persists in portraying him in art as white, or white-passing.
If it's canon itself that's problematic, writing meta about it or fixing it through fanfiction is a great way to deal with the problems it presents. Again, remember that not everyone will agree with you that the problems you see are problems and will argue with you.
Try to have civil discussions about problems in fandom and in-source material. Shipping Wars are some of the worst offenders in this regard. The small and typically polite Due South fandom was almost torn apart by the Ray Wars (one which was a better Ray, Ray Kowalski or Ray Vecchio, and who should be shipped with the main character, Constable Benton Fraser)., Frankly, this is a good rule of thumb for life, but it will also serve you well in fandom. This means being respectful of opinions you don't agree with among the fans who share your fandom and being respectful of the privacy of the people who created the source material.


Respect the people who are participating in fandom with you, even if they do not share your opinions, your ships, or your ideas about canon. People are allowed to have different views from you. Just remember, no one has the right to be mean to you (to call you names, pass around gossip about you, make comments about your appearance/your life).
Being respectful towards the people/person who created your source material is also incredibly important. Many fandoms have that one fan who took their passion too far and made the rest of the fandom look bad. This means allowing celebrities their privacy, not asking invasive questions, asking celebrities for a photo instead of just taking one. Criticism is fine, being rude is not. Criticism is telling someone how they can improve, being rude is telling someone everything that is wrong with them. There is a difference.
Respect the people you fangirl/boy over. If they are real people or the creators of a fandom, they have feelings too! Don't shove hate in their faces. The same goes with shipping. If it isn't canon, the people involved may not be comfortable with it so don't directly tweet them or tag them in things that might make them uncomfortable. The last thing you want is to force a ship so hard that it makes the people involved less close.
Never insult a fandom! This can make you look bad, and really offend some people who are attached to this fandom.

Wear an undershirt.,
Wear underarm pads.,
Wash your shirts more frequently.,
Try a sweat resistant material.",How to Prevent Sweat Stains1," Wearing a shirt underneath a dress shirt can help reduce or eliminate outwardly visible stains. Your undershirt will “catch” the stains, preventing them from getting on your nicer clothing.;
, You may want to wear pads that absorb your sweat and block it from your clothing, known as dress shields, underarm shields, or underarm pads.


If using disposable shields, remove the covering of the adhesive backing to these disposable pads and stick the shield to the underarm of your shirt.
If using reusable shields, read the instructions about how to wear the shields. Some have straps that go over your shoulder, some pin to clothing or bra straps, and some are meant to be sewn into clothing.

, If you wash your shirts daily, before the stain has time to set in, the shirts will not become stained. If you cannot do a full load of laundry, rinsing the shirt and rubbing a dab of detergent or a sodium percarbonate (also known as “oxygen bleach”) on the armpit area may help.

, Traditional cotton weave tends to show sweat stains worse than other materials. Microfiber or “smart weave” materials can help repel sweat stains."
"
Wear antiperspirant.,
Ask your doctor for a prescription.,
Consider other medical treatments.",How to Prevent Sweat Stains2," Make sure you are using an antiperspirant, not just a deodorant. Whereas deodorant only eliminates smells, antiperspirant prevents sweat by blocking sweat ducts, usually with aluminum.Begin with a basic, inexpensive over-the-counter antiperspirant. If that does not help, try a clinical strength antiperspirant, also available OTC.
Apply antiperspirant twice daily: once in the morning and once before bed.
Only apply antiperspirant to dry skin. If your underarms are wet from showering or from sweating, dry them before applying.

, Consult with your doctor, preferably a dermatologist, for prescriptions to deal with excessive sweating.


Prescription antiperspirant has higher levels of active ingredients than OTC antiperspirant.
Ask about oral medications, known as anticholinergics, that stop sweating. However, know that these stop all sweating, which is not always a good thing (remember, sweating serves a biological purpose by cooling you off)., If your sweating is extreme, known as hyperhydrosis, you may consider more aggressive medical treatment options.


Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) shots in the armpits prevent the body from triggering sweat glands to work and can block excessive sweating for several months at a time.Ask about miraDry. This is an approach that delivers electromagnetic pulses to the sweat glands to close them permanently. It is usually done with local anesthetic and may cause some pain for a few days.Consider surgical treatment if other options do not work. Surgeons can remove the sweat glands, which permanently stops underarm sweat. This is an outpatient procedure, but any surgery should be taken seriously and all other options should be tried first."
"
Stop wearing antiperspirant.,
Wear loose-fitting clothing.,
Lose weight.,
Eat sweat-reducing foods.,
Use natural deodorants.",How to Prevent Sweat Stains3," Though this seems counterintuitive, there are some studies that suggest that the aluminum in antiperspirants is the true cause of the yellow stains that often appear on clothing., Clothing that is pressed directly into the armpits is more likely to cause sweating and encourage staining. Looser clothing will be cooler and less likely to attract stains.

, Obesity often leads to increased sweating. Losing weight will cut down on the amount you sweat. Your clothing may fit more loosely, which can also help cut down on the underarm staining.

, Grapes, wheatgrass juice, tomato juice, sage tea, and raw apple cider vinegar all have properties that may reduce sweating., Using coconut oil, cornstarch, witch hazel, salt, or tea tree oil as ingredients in a homemade natural deodorant can reduce sweating. These ingredients are less likely to stain clothing than aluminum-based antiperspirant.

Be healthy and stay in shape.,
Have manners and etiquette.,
Be sweet like vanilla is.,
Be hypnotic.,
Walk the talk.,
Act royal.,
Sleep like a princess.,
Have a talent.",How to Be a Dream Trance Princess," Dream trance princess girls usually have vintage curls. Their curls are bouncy, shiny, soft and begging to be touched. You can achieve this with hot oil treatments once a week. Hot oil treatments help your hair grow faster, make it shinier, softer, and healthier. Also, give yourself a scalp massage every day. This promotes growth and distributes your natural oils throughout your hair. Brush your hair with a boar bristle brush for a few strokes for extra softness. Use curl enhancing shampoo and conditioner every 3-4 days. Lather up really well before rinsing and applying conditioner from root to tip. Try to use sulfate and silicone free products. When you have finished your shower, you can do pin curls, finger curls, or roller curls. If your hair is too bouncy, you can comb it out. Hair inspiration can be Lana Del Rey in the Young and Beautiful music video, Veronica Lake, or Jessica Rabbit. If you have very short hair, you'll need a wig.;
, A dream trance princess never has pimples. She keeps her skin soft, dewy, and clear. You can do this by steaming your skin before washing with an acne wash. Exfoliate with plain sugar. Splash with cold water, rub with an ice cube, tone with lemon juice, and apply a generous amount of moisturizer. Use under eye cream if you can to stop those bags and dark circles and even prevent wrinkles. Remember to wash your body with a lavender body wash and moisturize with lavender lotion.

, Lavender is a relaxing scent and makes you sleepy. Have some lavender perfume on and use lavender beauty products. It would be nice to have a small lavender plant in your room. You can use a lavender scent in your locker also to show everyone how dreamy you are. Scent your papers with lavender. Simply make sure everything smells like lavender at all times.

, Makeup is very important. Dream trance princesses need to look dreamy and princessy at the same time. This can be done with deep plum cat eyeliner, which is especially suitable for blue-grey, hazel, and green eyes. Add some white shadow on your eye lid and a bronze shade in the crease. This will create large, deep set eyes. To create the bedroom eyes look, popularized by Marilyn Monroe, cat line your top lid in deep plum, add white on your waterline and extend a bit past the end, and flick slightly down on a line on your bottom lid. This will make your eyes look sleepy and seductive. If your skin isn't perfect use concealer on your blemishes. Try to avoid foundation unless your skin is very uneven. A pale blush on the apples of your cheeks makes you look youthful and happy. Apply a beautiful shade of pale pink on your lips to complete the look. The focus should be your eyes. If you want to contour you can, but it is not necessary. Nails can be lavender, pale pink, nude, French manicure, sky blue, crimson, or glitter.

, Your fashion sense should be impeccable. Dreamy clothes are flowing and princess clothes are dresses, so you should have lovely flowing dresses. Ruffles, lace, sparkles, embroidery, velvet, and pastels are lovely. You can add some dreamy darker colors too, but not all the time. Your main color palette should be violet, blue, white, and pink. Any shade of these are lovely. Clothes should be any vintage dress or blouse and skirt combo. If you must wear pants, skin tight is the way to go, and pair it with a really girly and loose top. Shoes can be high heels, knee high boots, or even combat boots. Sneakers are a definite don't, no matter how trendy they are. Combat boots should only be worn with extremely girl outfits that you want to edge up a bit. Accessories can be tiny handbags to hold your handkerchief, perfume, lipstick, money, and smartphone, dainty pearl necklaces, diamond earrings, and pretty stockings.

, Don't be too skinny, don't be too muscly, and don't be overweight. If you have curves, those are gorgeous, but if you are considered ""fat"" then it is time to get in shape. Nobody dreams about slobs chewing their food loudly. Daintily eat and jog a few times a week and your appearance will be amazing. If you need to gain weight, drink some protein shakes and eat plenty while working out to get in tip-top shape.

, Every princess has manners. Read Emily Post's etiquette book and apply it to your daily life.

, Be kind to everyone, even those who are mean to you. Give favors to everyone and be as nice to them as possible. Make sure everyone knows you are a sweetheart.

, Look into someone's eyes with a seductive stare. Pout your lips slightly. Smile a little. Talk in a slow, deep voice. Remember that your eyes should put everyone in a trance. Listen to some hypnotists to know how to talk. People should see intensity in your face and they should feel relaxed by your voice.

, Walk slowly and daintily, like you are really an angel flying over the ground. Your feet should be silent while your dress billows over them. Also, do what you say and say what you mean.

, Don't flaunt it, but carry a few ""real"" pieces around, like a real designer handbag or real diamonds or real pearls. You will instantly seem richer. Hold your head up high and respect your elders and authority. Be cultured and know French.

, If you truly are a dream trance princess, you should look like one while you are asleep! Make sure your skin is perfect and apply some Vaseline to your eyelashes. Use some lip balm. Set your hair up in curlers and wear a flowing nightgown. Only put in your hair curlers when everyone is done seeing you and you are in your room ready for sleep. Until then, your hair should be brushed and hopefully a little curled still from the day before. Lay your head down on your lavender silk pillowcase and have sweet dreams.

, Dream trance princesses have a talent and everyone knows it. You can sing in a deep, seductive, powerful voice, draw beautiful realistic pictures, write romantic novels, be an amazing ballet dancer, or anything you want.

Use an over-the-counter antiperspirant.,
Talk to your doctor about other options.,
Avoid sweat-causing substances.,
Consider seeking treatment for anxiety.,
Wear underarm shields under your clothing.,
Avoid fabrics that don’t breathe well.,
Dress to hide armpit sweat.,
Look for high tech sweat-proof or sweat-resistant clothing.",How to Prevent Sweaty Armpits," Antiperspirants work by blocking your sweat glands for a time so they cannot produce sweat.Antiperspirants can be purchased over the counter in a number of strengths, including newer “clinical,” and so-called “prescription strength” formulations. These virtually all have the same active ingredient, aluminum chlorohydrate, but the amount present and the formula used will affect how well an antiperspirant works on a particular person, so you may need to experiment to find the one that works best for you. For best results, apply the antiperspirant at night on dry skin.
Even “all natural” antiperspirants contain aluminum, something to be aware of if you are trying to avoid aluminum exposure. However, the other ingredients in an all-natural formulation may be better for you, so that may still be a reason to consider them.
Deodorants, unlike antiperspirants, do not reduce sweating. Instead they contain ingredients to mask or prevent body odor associated with sweat. If you are trying to stop sweat, be sure to look for the word “antiperspirant” or “antiperspirant and deodorant.”;
, If normal antiperspirants won’t do the job, there are a number of other treatment options available for excessive underarm sweat that your doctor can authorize or administer.


Actual prescription-strength antiperspirants are one option.
There are also other therapies available to provide a long-term reduction in armpit sweat, including miraDry, a new technology that uses electromagnetic energy to destroy sweat glands.Botox shots applied to the armpits have also been shown to be effective. , Sometimes what we eat and drink can make us more prone to sweating. Spicy foods are one common culprit; caffeine, alcohol, and processed foods can also cause an increase in sweating.Taking too much of the vitamin niacin (or even a small amount in people who are sensitive to it,) can also cause excessive sweating.Drinking hot beverages also raises your internal body temperature and make you more prone to sweating.


Don’t avoid drinking water to prevent sweating! Your body needs water to function properly, and drinking more water can actually reduce sweating by helping to cool your body. It will also help ensure that when you do sweat, it won’t smell as bad., If you commonly break out in a sweat when you are anxious, a condition called “nervous sweating,” you can use the ideas outlined in this article to help manage the problem, but you might also consider talking to your doctor or a mental health care provider about the possibility that you have an anxiety disorder. In addition to treating the symptom of nervous sweating, there may be medical and/or behavioral treatment options to help you manage your anxiety in general., When armpit sweat is unavoidable, underarm shields are a great way to keep it hidden and protect your clothing. These are absorbent pads that you wear under your arms to absorb excess sweat and prevent clothing stains; many also offer some kind of odor control. Called alternately “dress shields,” “underarm shields,” “underarm pads,” “armpit guards,” etc., there are dozens of styles available. Some affix directly to your clothing or skin, while others are held in place with discreet straps. Both disposable and washable options are available.


Underarm shields are available at many online retailers. You can also find them frequently in men’s clothing stores, and the lingerie section of many women’s clothing retailers.
You can even make your own underarm shields at home!, Certain fabrics, namely silk, polyester, rayon, and nylon, don’t breathe well and are more likely to cause sweating.Better choices include cotton, linen, and even wool.

, If you know your armpits are going to sweat, dress in such a way that you can disguise it. Wear an undershirt under your clothing, or dress in layers to prevent sweat stains from becoming visible. For instance, a sweater vest worn over a shirt does an excellent job of hiding sweat stains. A hoodie or light jacket worn over a tank top or camisole can also help conceal armpit sweat.


Sweat stains are usually more visible on light-colored clothing, so avoid light colored blouses if you are prone to sweating.

, There are a number of “sweat-proof” undergarments for both men and women that use different methods for wicking sweat away, or preventing it from reaching the visible layers of your clothes.There are also an increasing number of sweat-resistant fabrics on the market that use technology to keep sweat from building up and causing embarrassing stains.Ask your local clothing retailer, or do an online search for “sweat-proof” or “sweat-resistant” clothing.

Try getting a Facebook, or Twitter, that way you will be able to show your friends or classmates, what you like, how you feel about certain things, what music you listen to.",How to Be a Different Person Next Year for School," For example, if you have acne, try to use face washes, but make sure they are for your skin type. If it is too severe, try seeing a dermatologist. Exfoliate your skin two times a week, more than that will harm your precious skin, always moisturize your skin for a healthy glow. Tan's aren't always a necessity, most of the time, your natural color is the best, unless you are too pale. Remember that your skin is irreplaceable, so treat it as you would treat a queen. Give it treats by using masks, sometimes.;
, Try taking the BMI test, it will show you if you are overweight considering your height. If you are overweight, then try some yoga class, or running a few miles a day. Exercise will never hurt you, no matter what. It even keeps you in a better mood, and lets the time pass if you have nothing to do. While you exercise try listening to music, it keeps up your heart rate, and lets you enter a whole different world.

, If you have a boring closet, try to donate stuff you don't need. When you have cleared space, its time for you to hit the mall. Go to places that you would love to buy from.


Try buying unique pieces of clothing that you wouldn't find many people having, but still keep up with fashion. If you know that you would enter a shop with boring things, take someone that is your opposite with you. Let him/her help you in buying your clothes.






If you love your old style, that's fine; Try looking up magazines with things that you like, for example there can be many beautiful clothes with the color brown, or beige. If you are that way then try being ""Preppy"". Of course, there can be other problems like; Say you had a tight budget. Go to shops that you know are cheaper, but you also know have hot clothes. Try to be more creative. Creativity is the key, you could wear a black simple top, with a crazy pink, yellow, red, or even neon green scarf. If you were known for wearing ballet flats, or flip flops for school, try buying High Tops, Nike, SUPRA, Converse, something you wouldn't normally wear and vice versa.







, Always take showers, and if you have a sweating problem, get some antiperspirant deodorant. Ladies, you should try shaving your underarms, since they keep the body odor, and try your legs, too. The bikini line, isn't essential unless you want to. Waxing is better than shaving though, because shaving can keep your skin color darker, and it may cut you. Waxing may hurt but its definitely better than shaving.


Buy perfume that goes with your personality, if you are a sweet person, buy vanilla or cotton candy scents. If you love being a girl, buy flower scents, if you are more cool, you know, like always wear high tops and stuff, also wear sweet scents like vanilla, believe they'll rock. For boys, I prefer a calm cool scent, try to find something that reminds you of something you love, for example the sea. That goes for girls, too.







, If you were a lonely person, try making friends, If you were a loser, BE CONFIDENT that's the answer to every question (almost). You got to love yourself more than ever, keep your head high, but not too high. When people see how much you respect yourself, they will respect you as well.

, Who knows, maybe a person you thought never liked you, could turn out to be your closest friend, always chat with people, they will be able to trust you and so will you, you have nothing to lose but friends to gain.

Use a nice loofa and body wash, and a nourishing shampoo, it pays off.

, Don't be too girly, and actually try to be a slight tomboy. Wear anything comfortable and cute. Oversized sweaters, T-shirts, and nighties are comfortable. Don't wear anything tight and revealing, because you're just not that. Shop at H&M, Abercrombie and Fitch, Hollister, and Aeropostale. Your wardrobe is cute, comfy, and chill.

, Get a suitable haircut for a geek, but it has to be cute, so don't cut it boy short, like a pixie cut, or Miley's blonde pixie. The shortest you can go is to your shoulders. If you cut it to your shoulders, make sure it's cute and sort of like a perky bob or sort of loose and flowy. Geeks also like to keep their hair long, or medium length. Medium length is probably your best choice. Also, comb it if you have short hair, and style it nicely if you have medium/long.

, Cute, geeky girls always know how to accessorize! You should be wearing glasses, and if you do, wear sort of big, attention-catching ones or unique, perky ones. Try to stick with plain black. Also, don't wear flashy jewelry, and stick to hair ties on your wrist, okay?

Determine how much determination you possess, and how much energy you are really willing to put into this.,
Gauge your self control.,
Take one day (or a moment of reflection) to look at yourself.,
Here's the part where you finally take action.,
Start from the head and work your way down.,
Choose something that fits your facial structure.,
Work on your face and skin.,
Exercise to keep healthy.,
Buy some new clothes.,
While shopping, keep in mind your image.,
Now's the hard part, no really.,
Make subtle changes to the unappealing qualities when you notice or see them.,
Make subtle changes in your lifestyle.,
Don't give up, and don't skip a day.,
Feeling down?,
Now comes the part that was talked about earlier, and your reflections come into play.,
Keep doing the things that you've done so far.",How to Be a Controlled Introvert (Solitary)," Making a choice to go out and change yourself is not only a time consuming process, but one that requires a strong want to truly change.;
, Are you a person who keeps a tight leash on themselves, or do you give your impulses and emotions free reign? This is going to be important through this change, so keep it in mind as you go onto the next steps.

, How do you present yourself? Do you slouch or do you hold your back too straight? Do you cross your arms often? How do you dress? Are your clothes revealing? Take note of this - because this is part of what you are wanting to change.

, The first thing that you want to change is your outside look (not suddenly, but bit by bit at a time), as it may make you feel better about yourself.

, First thing's first, get a haircut. There are magazines that showcase hairstyles - which you can find at your local grocery store.

, If you really want to go for the elegant (or introvert) look, choose a hairstyle that frames your face, such as an inverted bob for example. If you want it past shoulder length, you can try something like the video-game character Rinoa Heartily.

, If you have dry skin or chapped lips, use some moisturizer or lip balm. Make sure that your face is good looking (and most of all, your own). If you have acne, purchase an acne cream, or go see your dermatologist. Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics, or an acne medication. If you want, you can use make up to cover the acne, but you want to be you - this whole ordeal is about improving what you already have.

, When you exercise you will get in better shape, and feel more confident and better about yourself. You will be more comfortable with yourself, without the need to hide or flaunt anything.

, Don't go out and buy a whole new wardrobe. That's just not reasonable. Start out with one outfit, then two, then three. Soon enough, your entire wardrobe has changed.

, The whole thing about wanting to be an introvert is that you are not seeking to stand out. Don't buy trashy clothes, or threads that show too much skin. Go simple, but pretty. Buy some jeans that fit nicely (and don't show your butt crack), and then pair some nice tank-tops to go with it. Make sure that you throw a few dresses (or skirts) in there too. Keep in mind that you don't want to be wearing obnoxiously bright colors - pastels are good, or deep, rich colors like navy blue or sage. Remember, you don't have to wear a corset to be elegant.

, This part of the guide is where you start to make changes in your lifestyle and personality. THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD, and you will want to give up. But don't! You'll be happier in the end! You want to change yourself for the better, but still be you.

, Can you feel yourself slouching? If so, sit up straighter. Are you nervous and chewing your nails? Stop. The more you correct yourself the more it becomes second nature - you'll start correcting yourself without even thinking about it!

, This is the first step to supporting the effort you've put into this so far. For the first thing - in order to get yourself going - try taking a walk early in the morning every day for a week. Go for a drive. Wander through the streets of your town. It doesn't matter if you're alone, or you don't know where you're going, just do it! There's so much to see out there!

, If you sleep in late and don't get to go for your walk, that's okay. Get out of bed anyway, and take your walk, no matter if it's noon or four in the evening. As long as you do it and don't pass it by, you're not doing anything wrong. ""It doesn't matter how slow you go, as long as you do not stop"". Those words are very wise, indeed.

, Feeling giddy? Control it. Emotions are human nature, they give us empathy and make us who we are. Sometimes they can get out of control, and we do things that we shouldn't. There's nothing wrong with this! Use your emotions as a motive to change - if you're sad, distract yourself with a nice stroll in the park. If you're angry, take a few deep breaths.

, What do you not like about yourself? What did you want to change? Take baby steps towards not doing what you didn't like. For example, if you talk too much, try listening to the conversation instead of talking - it's harder than it looks, but truthfully, when there's more than one person in a group, your input isn't needed (that sounds mean but it's the truth).

, If you stumble, you don't have to fall. Everyone fails if they just stop everything and go back to the way things were. Continue on, don't let anything stop you. It's like coming home from the hospital; you don't just come home and stop taking care of yourself. By continuing on, that's what you're doing - make sure that you get the care that you need (from yourself).

Check the hair.,
Get flawless skin!If one day, you have to leave the house without makeup, you'll still look great!,
Get pretty nails!,
Get perfect brows and teeth!,
Be hot!,
Finally, the MAKEUP!,
Dress appropriately.,
You are beautiful, no matter who you are, and what you look like!

",How to Be a Downtown Diva," It should be a definite shade ( this means black, brown, auburn, chestnut, red or blonde, not some drab in-between shade you dyed it two years ago). The straighter the better, though if you have curly hair, keep it beautiful and rock it well!;
, And anyway, flawless skin is fresh, pretty and a sign of youth!

, For your nails, a french manicure is perfect and matches everything. For the toes, a cream red always looks stylish.

, Arch your eyebrows with a good set of tweezers or ask your mom to do it for you. Brush your teeth twice a day and rinse with mouthwash. You'll then create a winning smile!

, NOTICE, HOT, not THIN. Have a curvy figure, (If not, that's fine!). Just remember, God made you beautiful whether you are a pear, apple, petite, pencil or hourglass figure.

, Wear a foundation, concealer and loose powder. Apply blush for warmth. Dust some shimmery brown, gold or bronze eyeshadow onto your lids. Curl your lashes and apply mascara. Apply a thin line of liquid eyeliner to the lash line to make lashes appear thicker. Slick on some gloss. But if you are under fifteen, a tinted moisturizer, mascara and a tinted lip balm will look pretty and give almost the same effect.

, Go to the shops and buy the following items listed in How to Get a Basic Wardrobe (for Girls), plus a leather jacket, Minnetonkas and anything else you feel necessary. A denim jacket does wonders too!

Enjoy limitations when it comes to creating.",How to Be a Creative Thinker," Part of being creative is knowing enough about the world to understand how things work. Also, the more you know, the more perspective you'll incorporate into your own, and you'll be able to connect ideas that you might not have been able to do before. Reading is one of the best ways to expand your knowledge base and to broaden your perspective.Enjoy variety. Read on a lot of different things. This way, when it comes time to put your knowledge and creativity to the test, you’ll be able to apply your knowledge cross-field and cross-discipline.
Read imaginatively. Don’t just focus on scholarly monographs or instructional materials. Spend time reading fantasy, science fiction, or some sort of genre that will help expand your horizons about what is possible.
Read about things you don’t know anything about.
Make reading a habit. Avoid falling into the trap of forcing yourself to read one book a week or one book a month. Instead, find books and other reading materials that you enjoy and put them everywhere. Use spare moments and downtime to explore these worlds of knowledge.;
, Sometimes just talking through a problem or brainstorming with another person will help you move an idea along that has been stagnant in your brain for a little bit. In this event, find someone who understands the sort of problem or issue you’re trying to work through, they might have a different perspective that will allow you to solve the problem in a creative way.

, Use any occasion to broaden your perspective by engaging new and different people. Interesting and different people are all around us. There is no telling how they will influence your creative instinct. Use opportunities like:


Parties.
Business meetings.
Community events.

, A lot of people develop routines and commit large amounts of time to the same activities that they’ve always engaged in. These activities don’t really challenge you to think creatively and often times won’t help you grow as a person. Think about minimizing the time you spend on the following:


Watching television, specifically programs you watch all the time.
Playing games or sports you’ve already mastered. If you’re a master chess or checkers player, and beat the computer or your friends every time, chances are that those games aren’t helping you grow. Consider different games or sports.
Socializing with people who bore you or engaging in social activities that restrict your creative impulses., Sometimes we need stimuli that will feed our own creative impulses. There are a number of ways to get such stimuli, and they’ll likely be fun, interesting, and engaging. Consider:


Art galleries, art fairs, or festivals. You’ll see many things you don’t normally come into contact with, and that might get you thinking about something new.
Attend concerts, symphonies, or music festivals.
Watch a play, an opera, go visit a museum.
Attend a public lecture, talk, or a presentation.

, Whether a walk on the beach or a ride down the nearest tree-lined boulevard, the power and beauty of nature can help anyone step back and look at the big picture. When in a positive state of mind, you might be able to see connections that you did not before.

, Failure is a necessary part of the creative and learning experience. Embrace it as such, and commit yourself to learning from your failures and your mistakes. This way, you'll grow to see every failure as an opportunity for improvement and innovation rather than an obstacle or a limit on your success.

, Sometimes we get ideas that seem to vanish before we’ve committed them to paper. Many thoughts are seemingly random and disconnected. Try drawing a mind map on a piece of paper. Now, because you can see your ideas, you might be able to understand them and their relationships better.


List your seemingly random ideas.
Pick some of your most intriguing ideas, and write them on various places on a sheet of paper. Place them according to how you think they are connected.
Draw lines connecting ideas.
Draw spur lines of important ideas and connect them to lesser ideas., Taking a little time to contemplate the world or to reflect on things will help expand your horizons. Spending time alone will also enable you to consider problems you’ve been trying to work through and find new solutions that you might not have thought about before.

, Having an open mind will enable you to think about problems that you might not have thought about before. You’ll also be able to engage ides and ways of doing things that you were previously hesitant about.


Part of this is accepting the position that there are often many ways to solve a problem or achieve a goal.
Accept that there are many ways to view the world. Then you can see that there are many ways to be creative and solve problems.
Understand that you don’t know everything, and every activity is a learning experience.
Consider unpopular or even “weird” ways of viewing things or solving problems. These unconventional ideas or views might just give you a creative spark., Actual creating is the best practice to train your brain for creativity. There are a number of things you can do to train your brain in this way:


Drawing. If you enjoy drawing, draw. It does not really matter if you think you're good at it.
Writing. If you enjoy writing, write. Actual writing (fiction or non-fiction) is the best way to hone and develop your thoughts and your creative impulse.
Build. If you enjoy building things, whether it be abstract art or basic carpentry, you should build. This will stimulate your creative juices, and you might wind up building something really cool!, Try to get outside of your comfort zone and the “box” you typically function within. Think about a problem you are trying to solve in different ways. Embrace different perspectives, and maybe try to view the problem as an opportunity. For example:


If your goal is to build a fence, think about the purpose of building a fence. Then focus on what you hope to achieve by building a fence. If you’re trying to keep deer from eating your prize flowers, maybe consider other options like spraying your flowers with organic soap to deter the deer.
If you’re trying to solve the problem of fuel efficiency in car, perhaps think about it as a transportation problem instead. Instead of just trying to build a more fuel efficiency engine, you can scale down the size of a car or even identify alternate modes of transportation for people.
Don’t fear starting all over if you think a line of inquiry or something you’ve been working on has failed you. Just start over and re-conceptualize., Remember, being productive and creative are different. You just need to judge for yourself when you need to be creative and when you need to achieve productivity, or both.


Someone can be highly productive while not being creative at all.
Creativity entails finding new ways to solve problems and making or creating things that are unique.
Productivity entails producing something, but can often be done in a non-creative and workman-like way.

, You can do this both before you start working and during your work. Dedicated “think-time” can only help you, especially if you’re having trouble finding creative solutions to long-standing problems.


Spend a little time thinking before you start work.
Take breaks throughout to think about what you’re doing.
Whenever you meet an unexpected challenge, take a break to think about that challenge. Maybe you’ll consider a solution you hadn’t thought of before., Studies have shown that people’s optimal times for cognitive capacity vary. Figure out when you think best and try to work and be creative at that time. Other studies have shown that some people are most creative at times when they are least productive in a conventional sense. Experiment and try to find out when you’re most creative and inventive. This is different for every person., Oftentimes the most structured and orderly environments don’t promote creativity. Try to create an environment that fosters your own personal creativity.


Put up images or posters that demonstrate the creative impulse.
Create a non-orthodox working area, like putting a couch in your office.
Move around while you work. Some people like to stand while they work at their desk. Others walk slowly on a treadmill while they read, write, or think., While sometimes new and innovative ideas might come to you when you’re occupied with something else, you should probably devote a little time to brainstorming and to working ideas out.


Spend half an hour before bed thinking about things, if this works for you.
Take a little time from your lunch to think about problems.
Whenever you feel like your creative “juices” are flowing, stop whatever you’re doing (if you can), and work through those ideas.

, While structure and routine are very helpful and can promote productivity, they might also stifle creativity if they dominate your existence. Instead, reserve structure and routine for when you must absolutely be productive, and allow yourself to be less structured at other times in order to nurture your own creativity., Limitations, in terms of time and physical supplies, can help spur creative solutions to problems. When it comes to problem solving or creating, enjoy the fact that you are limited by time and/or materials. Think about other ways to achieve your goal that might save time or supplies.


Jeff Bezos said, ""I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.""
Rules, constraints, and limitations force you to think creatively. So next time you’re blaming your manager or client for thinking too small, you should thank them.

Find a mentor you think is brave.",How to Be a Daring Girl," If you feel afraid of something, it is important to face your fears rather than running from them.For example, if you are afraid of heights, then avoiding heights will only intensify your fear. Instead, try to expose yourself to heights gradually to help reduce your fear.


You can also try making a list of things that you are scared to do from least to most scary, and try to do one every day.
Start with the things that are the least scary for you. For example, if you are afraid of heights, then the least frightening thing on your list might be looking out a window from the second story of your house. Start with this and then move on to more frightening items on your list.;
, Not knowing much about something can make it seem mysterious and scary. If you are frightened of something because you know very little about it, then learning more about it may help you to feel less afraid.For example, if you are afraid to try skateboarding because you think it is dangerous, then learning as much as you can about skateboarding and skateboarding safety may give you the courage to try it.
Start researching the things that you fear to help empower yourself.

, Using relaxation techniques can also help you to face your fears. If you notice that you are feeling anxious when you confront something that scares you, then use a relaxation technique to help calm yourself down.For example, you can do some deep breathing to calm yourself. Take a slow deep breath in through your nose as you count to five. Then, slowly release the breath out through your mouth as you count down from five.

, Anger is a strong emotion, so allowing yourself to get angry may also help you to overcome fear.For example, if you are afraid of someone who pushes you around, then tray to allow your anger to overtake the fear instead.


Try using your voice to help you harness your anger when you are feeling fearful. For example, if you are in a situation where someone is harassing you, then try raising your voice and tell the person to “Knock it off!”

, Going outside may also help to reduce fear and ease your anxieties.Spend some time in nature every day to help yourself become more courageous.


Try taking a walk when the weather is nice or just sit in your back yard and observe your surroundings for a few minutes.

, Part of being daring is being courageous. When you are being treated badly, or when you see others being bullied or picked on, speak up. You can say something like ""That's not true, and it isn't nice either."" Tell the person being bullied that they can come hang out with you and your friends.Tell a kid who is picked on that they can count on you to help. Get your friends on their side as well.
If you hear nasty gossip, tell the gossipers you aren't interested in hearing mean things repeated about others.
If someone is picking on you, say ""I don't like when you say that to me."" Then remove yourself from the situation. If the meanness keeps happening, get help from a teacher.
If you think someone needs more help than you can offer, get the advice of a responsible adult.
Always talk to an adult if you think someone is being repeatedly bullied or abused at school or at home.

, If you are seriously afraid of something and you can't be daring on your own, get help. There are some situations in which it doesn't help to just dare yourself: you have to work on keeping calm first. For instance, if you are terrified of spiders, or public speaking, or heights, you can work on calming your panic by getting help from friends, family, or even a professional therapist.Identify and overcome your phobias.
If you're afraid of the water, work with a swim coach who has experience getting people into the water.
If you're afraid of spiders, get a friend or family member who is not afraid of spiders to help you. Explain that you need help calming down when there is a spider.
Take gradual steps. You can try looking at pictures of spiders, then being in an area where there are sometimes spiders, then sitting somewhere where you can see a spider, then eventually being the person to scoop a spider up and take it outside.
Think about what you're afraid of. What are you afraid of happening? If that happens, what will happen next? And next? And next? Imagine each step of what you want to do going wrong. This will help you stay calm when you try it next.
Tackling the things that scare you most will be the most satisfying to accomplish.

, Do you have a friend who wants to be more daring? Get in the habit of daring one another to do new things whenever there's a chance. Make some rules first: for example, the dares shouldn't be dangerous, shouldn't get anyone in serious trouble, and shouldn't be mean.


Think up fun dares that will scare your friend but won't hurt them.
For example, you can dare your friend to climb a tree or sing a song loudly in public.

, Have you ever gone camping? Take a camping trip with family and friends. What natural landscapes have you never explored? The mountains, the sea, the desert, a wetland? Ask your family to take a trip, or find out the areas near you that you haven't yet seen.


Find a tourist guide of your hometown. Pick things you've never done, and organize trips to do them. Are there any weird small museums? Plan a visit!
Is there an outdoors skill you don't have? Can you climb, swim, and camp? Can you recognize the local flora and fauna? Sign up for an outdoors club, or buy a guide to the natural world of your region.

, You're growing up—dare to take on more responsibility and ask for more freedom. Think of the things others do for you, and the things you aren't allowed to do, and take steps to eliminate some of them.


Do your parents cook all the family food? Offer to pack your own lunches, or to make the family breakfast on Sundays.
Have you always had the same chores? Ask to trade some so that you can learn a different skill.
Consider getting a job that will earn you your own money, such as mowing lawns, dog walking, babysitting, or working as a clerk.
Ask your parents to approve trips you can take on your own, either by bike, bus, or foot, to places you have never been by yourself.
Ask to make your own decisions. Do you shop for your own clothes? Pick your own classes? Sign yourself up for afterschool activities? Take control by deciding what you want and presenting it calmly and seriously to your guardians.

, Performing is one of the most frightening skills to learn, but it's useful throughout your life. If you're shy in front of audiences, dare yourself to get out there. Performing can be anything: you can sing at a karaoke party, audition for a community play, or even volunteer to read aloud in class.


Learn unusual skills. You never know when you'll be asked to demonstrate a talent. If you teach yourself to do something nobody else can do, you'll amuse and impress those around you. Try learning magic skills, gymnastic tricks, complicated math maneuvers, or something only you have thought of.
Write a short play with some friends and put it on for your families.

, Are you scared of food that is smelly, spicy, or slimy? Food that has ingredients you don't recognize? To be truly daring, work to expand your palate. Try food from different countries, or different places in the world. Give another try to food from your own culture that you don't like—sometimes eating it at a different moment, in a different place, or made slightly differently can improve the experience.


Even if you can't travel, you can explore cuisines from different cultures. Each country has many styles of food that use different cooking methods, different spice combinations, different ways of filling you up or getting you hungry for more.
Explore the restaurants in your hometown that serve foods you haven't tried, like Ethiopian, Cuban, or different regions in the United States.
Do you like Chinese food? That's great, but China has many cuisines—Cantonese, Shandong, Hunan, Xinjiang—and different restaurants often specialize in different ones without advertising this in English. Try to look up different cuisines and see what specialties you can get in your area.
Learn to cook new recipes. Set yourself the challenge of learning ways to cook that have nothing to do with your
Order snacks popular in different countries offline, or visit a store that specializes in a regional cuisine, old fashioned candies, or other delicacies you aren't familiar with.

, Boys and girls are often taught that they have to behave in a certain way to fit into their gender norms. One way to be more daring is to challenge these rules. Some ways that you can challenge gender stereotypes include:Trying things that you want to try. Girls are sometimes discouraged from participating in certain activities, such as playing football, working on cars, or doing household repairs. However, you do not have to obey these rules. If you want to learn to play a sport, then look for opportunities. If you want to learn about auto mechanics, then go for it!
Pursuing your dreams. Some professions are dominated by one gender due to gender stereotypes. For example, it is more common for men to be construction workers than women, while it is more common for women to be secretaries. Don’t let these stereotypes prevent you from pursuing your dreams. If you are attracted to a specific career, then pursue it even if it is dominated by men.

, Being assertive means that you speak your mind and stand up for yourself. Being more assertive will help to make it easier for you to be daring. Some things you can do to be more assertive include:Learning to say “No.”

Expressing your wants and needs in an honest way.
Acknowledging your right to be happy and letting go of guilt.

Improve your posture.,
Maintain good hygiene.,
Be well-groomed.,
Wear classy makeup (optional).,
Dress elegantly and modestly.,
Always use refined language.,
Be an articulate speaker.,
Be considerate of others.,
Make people comfortable.,
Perfect your etiquette.,
Avoid gossiping about others.,
Stand up for yourself with dignity.,
Be well-read.,
Find classy friends.,
Be a conscientious citizen.,
Drop the habits of an unclassy lady.,
Accept responsibility for your own actions.",How to Be a Classy Lady," Having good posture is an important part of being classy. Make sure to keep your back straight, whether you're sitting down or standing up, and to avoid slouching at all costs. Slouching is a sign of laziness and bad manners, so make sure you keep your spine straight and your head up as much as you can.


Try doing this when you're by yourself, too, so you get used to doing it in front of others.;
, This means showering every day, and always wearing clean clothes, without stains. If you're doing something where you'll get dirty, change right after. If you're in a situation where you'll get sweaty (e.g. a dance), bring an extra shirt just in case.

, Brush your hair several times a day, if need be, and be prepared to put your hair up again if bits are falling out. Don't brush your hair in public, though, because that's not classy; wait until you're alone in the bathroom to do it.

, If make-up is your thing, then you should apply it appropriately. For day-wear, natural-looking makeup is the best. Little or no makeup is better than smudged makeup. Remember that too strong or poorly applied makeup has a tendency to look cheap.

, The key word here is to dress with dignity. This does not have to cost very much. Keep your clothes in good repair. Anything ripped, or revealing is not classy. It is more important that the clothes fit you well, are wrinkle-free, appropriate for the occasion, and cover all the essential bits.


This means not wearing anything too short (short skirts or shorts), too translucent, or anything that exposes your belly.
If you really wish wear something a little revealing (deep neck, bare shoulders, or a high cut on the skirt), reveal one thing only. For example, and evening top with a low neck should be accompanied with a long skirt/trousers and have proper sleeves that cover the shoulders.
Remember that, when in doubt, it's better to be a little bit overdressed than a little bit underdressed. If you're in doubt about what to wear to an occasion, it's better to look a little nicer than the other guests than to look like you didn't put as much time into your looks as the others. Try not to wear too short shirts or shorts and don't show too much skin.

, Don't swear or use crude expressions. Profanity is one of the least lady-like traits.


If you feel that your conversation becomes very dull without the use of profanity, remember that this is just temporary. As you substitute in non-profane expressions (of which there is a virtually limitless supply), you will find your language becoming more specific, more expressive, and more interesting.

, If you want to sound classy, then you have to speak clearly and avoid mumbling or talking too loudly. A classy lady speaks with confidence and talks clearly enough for others to understand her. Avoid saying ""um,"" or ""like"" every two seconds, because that will make you look unrefined.


Read regularly to improve your vocabulary and range of expression.

, This is the key to being classy, and without this you will easily be mistaken for a snob. Be particularly attentive to the needs of the elderly and remember that nobody is beneath your notice. Always be polite. Classy ladies do not say anything hurtful or offensive to other people.


If you have to confront someone or put them in their place, speak the truth as you see it, but in moderate language and without recourse to shouting. It is important to find the right time and place for such confrontations.
If you want to be a classy lady, then you should treat waiters, strangers, friends of friends, or neighbors with the same level of respect you would give to your close friends.

, Classy ladies are social and at ease with others. The key to doing this lies in making the people you meet feel at ease and accepted. If this is not easy for you, work on improving your social skills, and on being charismatic.


Improving your conversational skills is a great way of putting people at ease, and making an impression as a well-bred and well-informed lady.

, A good start is to always be polite and to say thank you once too often rather than too little. A firm grasp on etiquette is also helpful if you get nervous in social situations, because you'll always know how you're supposed to act.


Learn dinner etiquette, party etiquette, workplace etiquette, and dating etiquette to become more ladylike.
Remember that it is really poor etiquette to comment on or make a fuss about other people's lack of etiquette or manners. Unless the situation really warrants it (their behavior may cause harm to themselves or others, or is on the way far side of moral and acceptable behaviour), graciously overlook their gaffes and shortcomings.

, Malicious gossip or speaking badly of people behind their back is not very lady-like. Though you may be angry at someone or feel wronged, gossiping about it to a third party will not solve your problems. If you want to be a classy lady, then you have to restrain yourself and avoid saying anything negative about other people unless you want to cause trouble for yourself.


Keep your Facebook posts classy, too. Stick to the positive instead of ranting about ""some people"" who have done you wrong.

, Being classy and polite does not in any way mean being a pushover or voicing opinions that are not your own. If you deem that your opinions may be too forceful or may be hurtful to those present, do not lie, but change the topic to something else. If someone asks an impertinent question, do not feel obliged to answer - make a joke, or endeavor to turn the question around.


When you do stand up for yourself, state your case without resorting to name-calling or getting overly emotional.

, Read novels to find role-models for etiquette and good manners. Jane Austen is exceptional in her shrewd portrayal of good and bad manners and morals, and a must-read for anyone wishing to be a classy lady. Reading classic novels also has the benefit or making you a well-informed lady, and there is nothing classy about ignorance.


Being well-read will also make you able to make more sophisticated conversation.

, If you're really determined to be classy, then you have to seek out classy company. If your friends are bringing down your level of classiness or not supporting your new mindset, then you may want to seek out other people who help you become your true classy lady self. These people should be confident, self-assured, and maybe a little bit older and more mature so you can learn from them.


Your friends should lift you up, not bring you down, so you should hang out with people who make you want to be better than you actually are.

, Part of being classy means being a good, conscientious citizen. What the heck does this mean? A number of things. Don't leave your shopping cart hanging out in the parking lot after you've put your groceries in your trunk; return it to the cart aisle. Let pedestrians cross in front of you when you're driving. Hold the door for the elderly, even if you're in a rush.


If you've dropped something in the supermarket, clean it up or tell some what happened. Don't just walk away from your mess.

, If you're really committed to being classy, then you have to get rid of a few things that may be making you look less classy than you really are. Here are some good things to avoid:


Loudly smacking your gum
Loudly chewing your food
Burping in public
Getting too drunk in public
Giving people the finger
Cursing
Rolling your eyes
Farting in public
Picking your nose
Kissing in public

, Being able to own what you've done in your life is the height of class. It's not classy to play the victim, blame all your problems on someone else, or to say, ""I would have been able to do thing X if only Y hadn't..."" Stop whining or making excuses and understand that life is what you make of it and that you have the power to be as classy as you want and to have a life as good as you want it to be.


It's not classy to complain about all of the things you don't have. It's classy to admit that you have a lot of work to do to become the person you really want to be.

Pick the right shoes.,
Wear makeup for effect.,
Wear sunglasses.,
Don’t be high maintenance.,
Wear black and wear leather – but don’t wear it all the time.,
Get a tattoo.,
Don’t follow trends.,
Be comfortable with sex appeal.",How to Be a Bad Girl1," Bad girls pay attention to their entire look, and they don’t neglect shoes. They make a statement with them.


Stilettos are a bad girl’s key accessory, at least at night.
Jordans work
Clogs or flip flops are nos. Bad girls aren’t that casual. And they’re never frumpy.
Above all, bad girls wear sexy shoes. ;
, Bad girls don’t leave the house without mascara. At night, especially, they aren’t afraid to go bold. They love to play with makeup. They do it strategically. They use it to make a creative statement.


It’s all about the eyebrows. Get them shaped. Make sure they are expressive. They should be bold. Bad girls use eyeliner to show drama and strength. The French actress Brigitte Bardot used eyeliner in her movies as a statement. When it comes to eyeliner, “the blacker the better.” Try a cat eye. Red lips make a statement. So do smoky eyes. Be careful with the glitter. Anything childish isn’t going to cut it. , Sunglasses create an aura of mystery and, above all, bad girls have an aura. They leave you wanting more. They leave you wondering.


Don’t wear sunglasses indoors or at night, though. There’s a fine line between cool and obnoxious.

, Bad girls don’t take five hours to get ready. They’re too confident to fixate on their appearance excessively, although they take care of it.


A bad girl doesn’t have to be dressed to the nines at all times, but she never looks sloppy. One absolute no: Wearing sweatpants outside your own house. , Everyone looks good in black. And black is just cool. But bad girls know how to carry off color too.


Bad girls don’t wear pastels. So put away the pink and lilac. Those are for girly girls.
Bad girls don’t wear bows. And they don’t do ruffles. You won’t find them in a prairie skirt.
Try monochrome. When Beyonce’s sister Solange Knowles wore head-to-toe red, she won raves. , It should be a small one, though, with meaning (and just one). And it shouldn’t be something you can’t cover up for the office. When Selena Gomez was trying to change her good girl image, she got a small tattoo on the back of her neck of a Roman numeral. That’s perfect.


Your tattoo should have a back story. And you should understand what it means.
Avoid a “tramp stamp.”

, Make them. Madonna is an example of a bad girl who did things her own way. Whether it’s her cone bra or challenging society's rules, Madonna broke convention. Find a trademark. That means something uniquely yours. Bad girls find their own look, and they stick with it, whether they go vamp or goth.

, Bad girls know their power over others. When they walk into a room, people look. Cleopatra is one of the most famous bad girls in history because she wasn’t afraid of using sex appeal to seduce. "

Embrace your story.,
Take the lead.",How to Be a Bad Girl2," Girls who don’t show confidence are taken advantage of. It’s impossible to be passive and be a bad girl. People are attracted to confidence. Bad girls are not afraid to say what they want. They know what they want, and they go for it. Bad girls never ask for compliments. They expect them. , Never beg or call too many times. That doesn’t mean you should be rude. Show manners. If someone texts you, text back. It means you don't always text first, though. Wait a day before calling back when starting out.
Understand when people need space.

, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis didn’t talk about her secrets. Neither should you. Never let them see you sweat. In the words of the Duchess of Windsor, “Never complain. Never explain.” The screen goddess Sophia Loren was known for saying, “Sex appeal is fifty percent what you've got and fifty percent what people think you've got.”, You have a circle of friends you trust, but you don’t need them with you at all times. You don’t need a partner to make you happy, either. You’re comfortable with yourself, and you know who you are.


Don't hesitate to do things on your own, whether it's traveling or exercising.
Make your own money.
Develop your own interests. Don't become a chameleon.

, At a party, you don’t cling to the wall. You’re the person everyone clusters around because you’re fun. You laugh, but more importantly, you make other people laugh. You’re a conversationalist, and you aren’t afraid to talk to strangers.

, Bad girls don’t tolerate abuse. They don’t let people call them names. They walk away if they’re not being treated right. Bad girls are strong. They are never, ever doormats., Bad girls don’t say they’re sorry. At least not for doing things their way or being themselves. Passive people are always saying they're sorry, and it's usually for being themselves.
Apologize over the big things only.
Be confident in your own actions.

, What are you good at? What do you love? Whether it’s art, music, writing, hula hooping, softball, or something else, bad girls have something they love.


Tracey Emin was known as the “bad girl of art” in the United Kingdom partly because she was perceived as strong and confident “about her work.”
Angelina Jolie’s passion – charitable works – didn’t mar her bad girl image. It just gave her more depth. Some bad girls show a hint of good girl. Passion is always a key part of a bad girl's personality. , Don’t ever tease someone cruelly. But a little flirting and coyness can be great. As the pop star Katy Perry put it, I'm kind of a good girl - and I'm not. I'm a good girl because I really believe in love, integrity, and respect. I'm a bad girl because I like to tease.”


Mae West perfected the art of teasing, especially using the sexy double entendre (words with double meaning). , Bad girls don’t need other people for their money. They make their own successes, and they do it the honest way.


Studies have found that men are attracted to girls with interesting jobs.Bad girls tend to have careers that are exciting and allow them to interact with people.
They might have a non-traditional career, like police officer, pilot, or firefighter. Bad girls prefer independent professions. The Girl with a Dragon Tattoo had a skill. It was non-traditional, and she wasn’t afraid to use it.

, Maybe they were bullied as a kid but that made them tough and empathetic to others. They are survivors. They’ve been through stuff, but you can’t tell. Still, it’s made them more interesting and stronger.


The models who grow up awkward and loser-y and just getting made fun of are the ones with the most character,” says model Binx Walton. “They know how to handle it.” , Bad girls don’t hang back waiting for other people to make up their minds or decide what to do. They know what they want, and others follow. Sometimes they break the rules, but never in a way that’s harmful. Ask someone to dance. Or go out on the dance floor first.
Initiate ideas: Where to go out to eat, a big idea at work. Don't sit back, and wait for others to do it.

Don’t be the princess.,
Eat with gusto - sometimes.,
Listen to rock-and-roll.",How to Be a Bad Girl3," You might find a bad girl on a motorcycle. She probably drives a sports car. You’ll never see her in a mini-van. Ever.

, When you travel, don’t sign up for a tour or stick to well-traveled routes. Be willing to go to exotic locales. Rent a car, and randomly land in little villages. Walk a trail like Reese Witherspoon in Wild.

, Be the girl who is up for anything – within reason. While others are hanging back and looking timid, you’re out there giving it a try.


Skydiving isn't for everyone, but if you do it, people will be impressed with your moxie.
Rock climbing isn't for wimps.
Hang gliding highlights the bad girl's best trait: She loves freedom.
Whitewater rafting is a way to show you're adventurous.
Dancing shows your free-spirited side and confidence.

, But don’t just pretend to enjoy sports. Actually understand something about the game. Throw out a statistic or two to show you know your stuff.


The singer Taylor Swift says she showed her bad girl side by going to an NBA basketball game and having a beer. , Bad girls don’t get drunk. They might be seen with a Martini in hand. Or they’ll have a beer with the guys. They drink - but they do it the right way.


You won’t see them doing Jell-O shots, losing control, or dancing on bars. , Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is a bad girl. Sleeping Beauty is not. Princesses are fragile. Bad girls don’t need saving. They are powerful, and they know it.

, No one finds a person fun who picks at a salad for every meal or who sits down and watches other people eat. Bad girls eat with gusto – just not all the time. They’ll dive into a steak. They’re adventurous with food. They’re willing to try new things.

, Rocker Joan Jett personified what many people think of as a “bad girl.” She even wrote a song about it. ""Cause I was born to be bad/I'm not sad/But I'm glad I did it/Born to be bad/I'm not sad/Why don't you all get with it."" "

Be kind.,
Be appreciative.,
Be compassionate.,
Be responsible.,
Be tolerant.,
Compliment people.,
Polish up your manners and use them.,
Be helpful.,
Be silly and use your sense of humor.,
Stay humble.",How to Be a Beautiful Girl on the Inside," Strive to really think good of others and to find that good in them. Act as if all you can see is this goodness, helping them to live up to your expectation. Throw kindness around like confetti. Moreover, notice other people's kindness and tell them how much you appreciate it.


If you feel an urge to gossip, remind yourself how you might feel if someone gossiped about you and said unkind things. If you find yourself letting rude or untruthful things slip out, apologize immediately and explain that you are striving to become a better person but that sometimes you slip up.

Commit random acts of kindness. These spontaneous, caring and generous acts can add lots of good to the world. Top up someone's parking meter, shout someone in line a coffee, lend someone your sweater when they're cold.
Care for other species. Life is a miracle, and creatures are too. Do your best to treat animals kindly, considerately and compassionately. They are living their lives on a shared planet, doing what they know best to do. Make choices that tread lightly on their lives.;
, Know what about your life is good and treasure that. Consider keeping a gratitude journal, to help you to notice all the little, amazing things and the special people in your life. Note down everything that matters and makes a difference, no matter how small; this is teaching you to appreciate life in all of its facets. Even if you're going through hard times, always resort to finding the good things as much as possible and focusing most on those.


Avoid comparing yourself to others. Comparison is a way of eating away at yourself, causing you to think that you're deprived of what others have or that you're not as good as someone else at doing or being something. Instead, realize that the talents and skills you do have are totally representative of who you are, and that you can always keep working on improving the skills. This also works in reverse; avoid resorting to telling yourself that there are those who have it much harder in life––this too is a form of comparison that can leave you feeling like you can't appreciate what's good about your life and that's not constructive.
Spend time with young children. See things through their eyes, notice the awe that they have for simple and natural things. Use this to reawaken your ability to notice the awesome things around you.

, There is always room for acknowledging the hardships and pain others are experiencing; whether you've being through a similar situation yourself or you can just tell that someone is doing it tough, reach out and let them know that you care and that you're there for them.


See the difficult situations people are going through and realize that, while that doesn't excuse bad behavior, it does offer an explanation for their rudeness, unkindness or curt replies.
Practice self compassion too. Learn to view your internal judge with compassion and objectiveness; everyone wrangles with this being but it doesn't have a right to turn into your worst enemy. learn to forgive yourself, to let go of the bad days, and to ask your negative thoughts to be still and quiet as you don't need to hear them.

, Take responsibility for yourself and the choices you make in life. Couple this with the self-compassion needed to understand that some of the choices you make in life will be ones you wish you hadn't. Everyone goes there and keeps going there; it's part of being human. But it's not an excuse to try to fob the blame off onto another or onto your circumstances. By taking responsibility you also get to be the one in charge of your life, both what is good and bad about it, and progress in wisdom.

, A tolerant person is a strong and beautiful person. It takes courage to be tolerant because you will often be faced with people who are not tolerant. Learn all that you can about other cultures and beliefs, for yours are not the only ones on this Earth. Learn to see people as reflective of a range of beliefs and ideals, a diversity that is essential to healthy communities, and not as ""us"" and ""them""––just because you don't agree with someone or like their lifestyle, does not mean that you have to fear them.


Learn to release your negative emotions constructively. Remind yourself that it is okay to be angry, that is your body and mind telling you that something needs to be paid attention to. However, it is never okay to be cruel, demeaning or to put yourself above others.
Do not let the anger, fear and insecurities of others shape your character. Acknowledge their fear or anger but don't respond in kind. Instead, offer them attentiveness, a listening ear, kindness and patience.

, Complimenting people is a way of forcing yourself to find the good in them, and to give people a wonderful boost. People who compliment radiate an inner beauty when the compliment comes from a genuine place.


Be careful not to overdo the appearance compliments. People are not how they dress or shop, although the occasional ""Your hair is gorgeous!"" or ""I love your shoes!"" will be appreciated. Most of the time, look for actual deeds and talents to compliment, notice their strengths and ignore their weaknesses, as this approach will have a more lasting effect on their confidence and well-being. It's also more likely that they'll remember your kindness for noticing.

, Civility is at the heart of good community. Good manners is a way of giving others respect and preventing yourself from trying to be the center of attention. A person with good manners greets others instantly with a ""Good Morning!"" or a ""Hi!"" and such a person will always remember to say ""thank you"" and ""please"". These are small things in the grander scheme of human relations but they mean a great deal as they tell people you are genuinely considerate and care about them and their comfort, not just your own.


Anne-Louise-Germaine de Staël once said that ""Politeness is the art of choosing among your thoughts.” Keep this thought at the forefront of your thoughts, before letting them loose on others!

, Offer a helping hand to persons in need when it's something you can help with. Being beautiful on the inside comes from being able to reach out to others and make their day a little easier. Offer to open a door, watch a baby, walk a dog, help a friend with homework, and so on. Each of these ways of helping won't take a lot of time or effort from you but they will all help to build relationships and cause others to view you as a really beautiful person.

, Have a laugh at yourself and learn to stop taking everything so seriously. A little levity in life can help you through the toughest of times and can help you to see the surrealism of things that happen to you in life. Occasionally let go and be child like again to release your inner child––visit a playground, swing on the swings and play kid's games with your friends.


Smile whenever you have the chance. A smile can give the impression that you have a positive perspective on life and that you're a welcoming person. A smile is ideal for lightening the load of an unhappy person, for acknowledging the effort of a retail assistant or for making a friendly connection. A smile can lead people to think that you're a remarkable person on the inside.

, Don't rush to be the center of attention or to demand praise. You are special and unique but you are also part of a social group and a wider community and each person has unique talents and abilities too. Moreover, each person matters and there is no hierarchy other than the ones created in our minds. Rather than tooting your trumpet, get on with what you know how to do best and do it well; shine through what you do and achieve and when people remark upon it, don't let it go to your head. Equally, when people don't notice your talents and efforts, accept that you don't need their validation to do the best you can in life, that's your life's mission already.



Being classy is knowing you've got it but knowing even more so that you are not going to flaunt it. Let your deeds speak for themselves.

Put on simple, monochromatic clothes that cover your body to give the impression that you’re shy and don’t want to expose anything about yourself.Choose dark and conservative colors like black or navy. Avoid bright colors or prints that draw attention to you like animal prints, red or yellow.For example, both guys or girls could wear a pair of black jeans with a simple black tee. If you want to wear a print, keep it small and in subdued colors.
For girls, avoid showing skin with deep cutouts, sheer fabrics, or lace.For guys and girls, avoid wearing clothes that are too tight or pants are low cut or loose and expose your underthings.
For guys, button up dress shirts to the top and wear pants such as khakis or dress trousers.;
, Just as having simple clothing can help give the impression that you’re shy, so can simple and minimal accessories. From shoes to jewelry, keep any extras to your outfit as uncluttered as possible.


Wear as little jewelry as possible. If you like to have a piece or two of jewelry, wear items that are simple and not flashy. For example, you could wear a pair of small and simple studs or tiny hoops. Stick with the same principle on rings, bracelets, and necklaces.Avoid piercings in less common areas such as your nose, lip, or eyebrow. These will invariably draw attention to you.
For girls, put on shoes that are either flat or have a very small heel so that you don’t appear taller. You may also want to avoid shoes that show your toes.For guys, wear running shoes or trail shoes in a non-flashy color like black.
Carry a bag in a simple, neutral color. For girls, make sure that it’s not large or has a lot of “bling” on it. For guys, a simple backpack in a color like black won’t draw attention to you.

, Wearing elaborate hairstyles and a lot or garish makeup can make you appear outgoing and that you want attention. Style your hair simply and apply little or no makeup that enhances your natural beauty.For guys, keep your hair short or in a shorter style that lets you hide your shyness behind the strands.
For girls, wear your hair down or style it in a simple, low ponytail.Keep your hair a natural color and avoid dying it or strands of it different colors such as pink or blue.Avoid using too many hair products, such as gel, which can make your hair appear slick and crunchy.
Put on no makeup or minimal makeup that just enhances your natural beauty. For example, you could swipe on a coat of mascara and some colorless lip balm. Using a lot of makeup, such as red lipstick or glittery eye shadow, can draw attention to you.Keep your nails short. For girls, keep them simply painted or don’t paint them at all., Being quiet and introverted can often signal a shy person.By speaking slowly and as little as necessary and keeping your voice soft, you can reinforce that you are shy.Keep your volume to a minimum, which may prompt people to repeat what you’re saying and signal to them that you’re shy.Avoid yelling, even if you are upset. In these cases, you may just want to avoid saying anything to help reinforce that you are shy.
Take your time to respond to questions and reply as briefly as possible. Don't give away too much information and act uncomfortable if someone presses you to disclose too much.Ask as few questions as possible, which can signal that you’re uncomfortable talking or engaging with others.
Act nervous when you’re talking by letting your voice quiver or make longer pauses to convey that you’re thinking about what you want to say to not rock the boat.Try blushing when asked questions or when you need to speak, which can be a sign of discomfort and shyness., When you’re speaking with people, look at the floor frequently and blink a lot. This can show the other person you’re uncomfortable and signal that you’re shy.


Look at the floor or past the person to whom you are speaking., Certain body language can cue that you are shy, including avoiding eye contact. Try using other forms of body language that reinforce the impression that you are shy.Some examples of shy body language are:


Crossing your arms or legs
Touching your neck or fingering you collar
Blushing
Darting eyes
Fidgeting., If you are in class or meetings at work, or even at social functions, position yourself at the back of a space or in a corner. This can keep focus on others and may also discourage people from engaging with you.


Sit in the back row in classes or at meetings. If the room is set up in a circle formation, sit as far away from the person convening the meeting as possible. You can also arrive early and sit in a corner.
Stand or sit as far away from a party or gathering host as you can. Most people will want to talk to her and the farther away you are, the less likely you may be to have to talk to other people.

, Withdrawing from social interactions or situations that are new is a sign of shyness.Avoid going to group functions or attending new situations if you can.


Kindly decline invitations to any group functions, which can make it seem like you are hesitant and shy.Be aware that this may make people think you’re anti-social and they may stop asking you to attend if you decline often enough.
Position yourself at the wings of social functions if you do attend.Talk to one person if you are in a new situation.
Hesitate to accept if someone presses you attend an event., People who are outgoing usually have an easier time starting events or projects. Allowing other people to take the lead on things such as projects, parties can help you stay in the background and seem shy.


Don’t volunteer for anything. Let other people assign you some function. You can blush or seem embarrassed if you want to act more shy.
Casually mention something you’d like to start and let someone else get the ball rolling. Offer support where you can.

, When you’re talking to someone else, let her lead the conversation. This can indicate that you’re shy and may make you seem mysterious and more irresistible.


Avoid being totally silent, which may make your conversation partner think something is wrong with you or her.
Let the other person ask questions or offer longer statements before you respond.
Make sure to glance often and directly at your chatting partner.Consider repeating what the person says in a playful way. For example, “you’re a boxer, are you?”

, Give your conversation partner answers with your eyes, smile, and head gestures. This can make you appear shy—and cute.


Answer funny or flirty questions with a smile and tilting your head to one side.
Widen your eyes, look directly at the person, smile, and nod your head if your chatting partner says something that sounds good to you.Keep your tone light and easy. This might involve raising your voice a bit.Glance away briefly when you’re talking, which can make you seem shy.Blush on cue if you can.

, Keeping a little distance between you and your chatting partner can make you seem shy. Don’t stand too far away, just enough to keep the conversation going and her interest in you.


Sit close to the person and keep a hand on the table somewhat near to hear. This can indicate you want to touch her during conversation but are too shy to make a move.
Touch the person instead of answering questions. Keep the touch quick and superficial. Follow it up with a look or brief answer if need be.

, While it's okay to listen to other people's advice, it's not okay to be led by their preferences on who you should be according to their grand plan. Have your own grand plan and balance the advice you receive to help, not hinder you.

, If you are a caring, sharing and emotionally connected person, don't give that up for the sake of wanting to appear tougher. You are who you are, and this journey is partly about getting others to respect that.

, If you have a life plan but you are inconsistent, vague and easily persuaded to follow other directions, this can be harmful to developing your true self. This isn't the same as openness to new experiences and willingness to try new things––such virtues can be practiced without losing a sense of self. The problem arises when you let others decide your destiny, your direction and what sorts of values you should follow. Chopping and changing your mind can lead to being vulnerable to other people's opinions.

, Then, be consistent about them and follow through on these values, enhancing your skills, talents and thoughts in line with these values.

, If you are someone who cares so much that your heart is on your sleeve, wear it with pride. There aren't enough people willing to stand up for feelings and emotions forming a valid part of the whole. Remind yourself that showing emotions is a sign of strength.


Brené Brown, author of Daring Greatly, says that vulnerability is ""the birthplace of innovation, creativity and change."" She also says it represents truth and courage. These are brilliant virtues, not weaknesses to be hidden away!

, This isn't about patting yourself on the back just for being awesome all the time. It's about recognizing when you've done a good job, helped someone, made a positive difference and tried hard. This ability to self coach and self validate will help you to overcome the need for validation from others, which can become an obsessive pursuit that leaves you vulnerable to others' judgments, which are frequently misplaced or self-interested.


Be ready to acknowledge to yourself when you've done a good job, when you need to improve and when things that didn't go so well aren't the end of the world but a pathway to making things right again. This makes for a nice balance that is not narcissistic, unrealistic or pessimistic.

, A content person is someone who has put right whatever is wrong in life. Contentedness comes from more than simply pursuing what other people say produces happiness––it comes from working out for yourself what brings you contentment and fulfillment. Some of this will take trial and error, and it will change over time. But that's okay, a person who is flexible won't break when bent by life's inevitable hardships.

, This means knowing your strengths and building on them, realizing that talent is only part of the equation and that honing it through learning, practice and more practice, is the best way to improve throughout life. It also includes knowing that you can do things competently.

, Both forms of respect lead to respect being returned to you. Respect is a form of scuttling any appearance of vulnerability because people know you're strong.

Call family members you can count on to have a positive attitude. If your mom is always looking on the bright side of life, give her a call every Sunday to keep your spirits up.
Avoid friends who are negative. You do not have to end these friendships. However, try not to engage with complaining or other negative thought patterns.;
, If you want to come off as perky, active listening can help. Active listening is a form of listening that encourages mutual understanding. It can also make you look more alert and engaged with another person, allowing you to come off as perky.


As the speaker talks, offer verbal and non-verbal cues that you are paying attention. Smile, nod, and offer responses like, ""Yes"" and ""Uh-huh"" on occasion.When the speaker finishes talking, reiterate what was just said. Summarize the main points the speaker made to assure that you understood. For example, ""I'm hearing that you feel stressed because you have a deadline coming up at work.""Do not plan what you have to say ahead of time. Simply listen to the speaker, giving him or her your full attention.

, Gossip has a bad reputation, but positive gossip can actually be helpful to your relationships with others. Perky people are thought of as cheerful and positive. Always saying nice things about others can help you be perkier.


When you hear someone engaging in negative talk about a friend or co-worker, try to turn the conversation to the positive. For example, someone says something like, ""Did you hear Patrick having a screaming fight with his dad on the phone before class yesterday?"" Respond with something like, ""Patrick is such a nice person! I hope he can work out his family problems.""Positive gossip can encourage others to look for the best in those around them. It can improve your relationships at work and in your social circle. It can also make you come across as an upbeat person, adding to your perky image., Just as positivity is infectious, negativity can spread as well. If you want to act perky, you have to work actively to shut out those around you who drain your energy. Find ways to disengage with negative people so you can keep your positive, peppy attitude.


Never engage in negativity. If someone is complaining continually about a problem or issue, disengage as soon as you can. Say something like, ""I'm sorry you feel that way. I hope it gets better."" Then, end the conversation.
When you're around people who have a negative outlook, stick to lighter topics. Talk about the weather and TV shows rather than anything heavy. A negative person is likely to put a pessimistic spin on bigger issues, so avoid talking about your personal or professional life with negative people.
Be mindful of how much time you spend with negative people. The people you spend the most of your time with should bring you up and not down. Seek to lessen contact with people who are consistently negative thinkers.

, If you want to be perky, you'll need to have a high overall energy level. Work on maintaining a regular sleep schedule. This will help you get a better night's rest.


Go to bed and get up on roughly the same time each day. Your body runs on a circadian rhythm that adjusts to a regular schedule. If you set your bedtime for 11 PM each day, and your wake-up time for 8 AM, your body will wake up and fall asleep naturally at those times.Have a bedtime ritual. This can help signal to your body that it's time for sleep. Do something relaxing before bed. Take a warm bath, read a book, or have a small snack.Avoid going on your computer or phone close to bedtime. The light emitted by electronic screens stimulates brain activity, making sleep difficult., Magnesium is an important vitamin to a balanced diet. Upping your magnesium levels can increase your overall energy. It can increase your heart rate and oxygen levels, resulting in higher overall energy.Women should get 300 milligrams of magnesium a day. Men should strive for 350 milligrams. You should talk to your doctor about healthy ways to reach these levels.Foods high in magnesium include hazelnuts, cashews, whole grains, and bran-based products. Halibut is also high in magnesium., If you feel tired during the day, take a short walk. This can increase your energy level, leaving you perkier. At work, take a 15 minute break to take a brisk walk around the block. Taking short 10 to 15 minute walks throughout the day can help boost your energy level. You should also strive for regular physical activity.Try to exercise for 20 to 30 minutes at least 3 times a week.Pick a form of exercise you enjoy. If you loathe running, you'll struggle to stay on a schedule. If a long bike ride is incredibly relaxing for you, try biking instead.
Talk to your doctor before starting a new exercise regimen. You want to make sure you do not strain yourself.

, Many Americans skip breakfast, but if you want to be perky, breakfast is a must. Low-energy and poor performance at work and school are linked to skipping breakfast. You'll have more energy and be in a better mood if you eat breakfast every day.Pick a healthy breakfast. Go for something like oatmeal, whole grain cereal, or yogurt and fruit.
If you don't have time for a sit down breakfast, at least grab something small. Even a piece of fruit or bread is better than nothing. Grab a banana on your way out the door in the morning.

, Stress is a major drain on energy. If you're constantly stressed out, you're unlikely to come off as perky. If you have a high overall stress level, your energy can deplete quickly. Look into ways to reduce stress in order to increase energy.Meditation, deep breathing, and yoga are all great activities that help you better manage your stress. Look into medication and yoga classes in your area. You can also find guided routines online.
If you have trouble managing stress on your own, consider talking to a psychiatrist or therapist. Many mental health disorders, like generalized anxiety disorder, are marked by an inability to cope with stress. You can find a therapist through your insurance or by asking for a referral from your regular doctor. If you are a student, you may be entitled to free counseling through your college or university.

, Sometimes, mild dehydration can drain energy. This can lead to you behaving in a less than perky manner. Work on drinking water throughout the day. Keep a cool glass of water near you desk at the office. Carry a water bottle around throughout your day. If you feel yourself getting tired, sip on some water and see if you notice a difference.Bring a water bottle with you to work or school. Take a sip when you find yourself getting thirsty.
Drink a glass of water with each meal. If you exercise, make sure to stop and drink water throughout your workout.

, Oftentimes, the food we eat is high in sugar. White breads and pastas are often high in added sugar. Sugar and refined grains can deplete energy, robbing you of the ability to act perky.Go for whole grains over processed grains whenever possible. Select wheat bread over white bread on a sandwich, for example. Swap out normal noodles for spaghetti with whole grain noodles.
Read labels. A lot of products, like canned pasta sauce and spread for bread, are surprisingly high in added sugar. Make sure you're not inadvertently consuming high amounts of sugar from unexpected sources.

, The mind is a busy place. You likely engage in self-talk all the time, even on an unconscious level. When you screw something up at work, for example, you may immediately begin to beat yourself up. If you want to appear more perky, taking control of your internal monologue can help. Start engaging in positive self-talk to develop a perkier persona.Do not say anything to yourself you would not say to another person. If you find yourself beating yourself up, pause and think about what you are saying. What would you say to a friend or loved one in a similar position?For example, say you miss a deadline at work. You had a stressful week emotionally, and your job fell to the wayside. You may say to yourself, ""What's wrong with you? You should be more responsible."" Stop. What would you say to a friend in this situation? You would probably tell a friend something like, ""Everyone makes mistakes. This isn't a reflection of you. Try not to hold onto it and just do better next time.""
Be as gentle and encouraging with yourself as you would with others. When facing setbacks or difficulties, say nice things to yourself. Reaffirm your good qualities. For example, say something like, ""You made a mistake, but this isn't a reflection of you. I know you'll do better tomorrow."", People tend to engage in negative, and often irrational, thought patterns throughout the day. You may be guilty of certain black-and-white thinking patterns that skew your perception, resulting in a negative overall attitude. If you want to be more perky, work on identifying and abandoning negative thoughts.


Many people engage in filtering. This means you magnify negative aspects of a situation while ignoring the positive ones. For example, three co-workers complimented on your new haircut but you overheard one co-worker making a catty comment. While the majority of people were nice, you may latch on to the negative comment.You may also personalize problems. If something negative occurs, for example, you may blame yourself. A friend fails to return a call and you assume it's something you've done when, in reality, a variety of factors can affect someone's ability to answer phone calls.You may also be guilty of catastrophizing or polarizing issues. For example, if you have a bad morning, you assume the rest of your day will be a disaster. Your co-worker disagrees with you on how to pursue a project. You see your side as the right side, without recognizing the middle ground.If you catch yourself engaging in any of the above thought patterns, try to stop yourself. Remind yourself that many people get trapped in negative thought patterns, which are almost always irrational. Recognizing thought patterns as they're happening can increase your overall energy, making you a more energetic, cheerful person., If you want to be perky, you have to actively work towards a positive attitude. Throughout the day, check yourself. Stop and evaluate what you're thinking. Are you engaging in negative thoughts? Are you being too hard on yourself? If so, try to do some positive self-talk to get back on the track to perkiness.Many setbacks can occur from one day to the next. For example, say you are 5 minutes late for work due to an accident on the highway. You may find yourself thinking, ""I should have woken up earlier. I could have avoided this setback. Why am I so unmotivated?""
Stop and imagine another person in this scenario. What would you say to that person? Try to say that to yourself. For example, take a deep breath and think, ""I am not normally late, and these were unforeseen circumstances. No one is perfect and I'm allowed to have the occasional mix up.""

, Humor can be a great way to cultivate a cheerful attitude. If you want to be perky, learning to laugh at life's trials and tribulations can help. Work on making jokes throughout the day.If something goes wrong, try to crack a joke. If you spill coffee on your keyboard at work, for example, joke about your clumsy nature. Laughing off troubling times can help you feel perkier.
Try to watch humorous films and TV shows. If you saturate yourself in humorous material, it's likely to rub off on you. You'll be able to make jokes in your day-to-day life more easily.

, Sometimes, small physical changes can actually alter your thinking. Carrying yourself in a more confident matter can make you feel more sure of yourself. This can make you more perky.


Smile. It's a small change, but a powerful one. Many studies indicate that smiling actually affects your mood. If you smile, you will feel happier.Sit up straight. Your posture also has a profound effect on your mood and overall perkiness. Sitting up straight throughout the day can lead to a higher overall energy level, resulting in a perkier attitude.Adopt a power stance. If you carry your body in a way that conveys confidence, you'll feel perkier. Lean back when sitting down. When standing, place your feet flat on the floor, push your shoulders back, and move your chest forward."

, Sometimes jokes can go a little too far.

Be persistent.",How to Planche," This will help your body feel limber and warmed up, making it easier to planche. Proper stretching is a vital part of avoiding preventable injury. A planche is an advanced technique, so you'll need your body in its best order before you attempt it.


Touch your toes. Keep your legs as straight as possible.
Circle your wrists and hips.
Stretch your arms by Crossing one arm over your chest and holding the elbow with the opposite hand; repeat on the other side.;
, Crouch between either push-up bars or parallel bars with your hands grasping the bars on either side. If you don't wish to perform the planche on bars, squat down on the floor with your hands planted on either side of you. Make sure your hands are planted a comfortable distance apart, so you'll be able to support your body adequately.

, Before you lift yourself up, make sure your hands are planted facing forwards, roughly parallel to where your belly button will be when you lift yourself up.


Experiment with different hand grips before you find one that works best for you.,









It's good to continue picturing yourself in a push-up position. As you lean forward however, you should be putting far more pressure on your hands than you would in a push-up.
Leaning forward is a great way to train towards a planche, as it will get you used to the increasing pressure on your hands and wrists.

, All of your body's weight should be focused on your hands. Keep your body straight throughout. Because this technique takes so much upper body strength, it's unlikely that you'll be able to pull one off without training in increments first.









A good way to imagine a planche is as if you were doing a push up where your feet aren't touching the ground.

, Because proper balance is so important during the planche, you need to keep your body straight. Tightening in your abdominal muscles will help keep your body rigid.

, Most professional gymnasts see 30 seconds as a good goal to hold the position for. When you complete the full planche, return yourself slowly to a resting ""push up"" position.









It is fine if you cannot hold it for the full 30 seconds at first. Simply getting yourself into position is difficult enough. It is helpful to train yourself in increasing increments. For example, once you achieve the position, try to hold for 5 seconds. Once you're able to do that comfortably, aim for 10, and so on.

, Keep an eye out for the particular motion and stance in which the professionals execute their planche. Having a firm visual reference will help you figure out the specifics yourself.


It may look very easy when professionals planche, but it is, in fact, an extremely difficult process. Even professional gymnasts may take years to properly figure it out.

, Although even the most basic planche is quite difficult to pull off, it's a more achievable goal to someone starting out. You should be able to hold each of these moves for at least 30 seconds before you try the next step in the process.









Planching takes at least six months from the start of your training to being able to capably pull it off. You should keep this in mind and aim to be patient with your progressions., However, unlike a regular planche where your legs would be extended, keep your legs tucked in under your body. This will reduce the amount of strength and balance required to hold the planche.


When you're comfortable with a tucked planche, an advanced tucked planche will push your limits. An advanced tucked planche differs from a regular tucked planche because your legs are extended in an L-shape at the knee. This should increase the difficulty, both in terms of strength and balance.
Tucked planches are easier because the weight is more situated towards the area you're lifting from., As you push yourself upward, extend one leg outward while keeping the other tucked as with a tucked planche.









You should alternate between legs. This will strengthen up the two sides of your body, and make them both ready for a full-blown planche.

, A straddled planche differs from the full planche in that both of your legs will be spread. Although you'll have the full body extension of a planche, the distribution of weight will be a bit easier to handle.









Once you're able to consistently pull off straddled planches, you should be ready for a full-blown planche.

, When you've mastered this elite exercise, kick it up a notch by doing pushups. In the planche position, bend your arms at the elbows to lower your body to the ground, then straighten your arms to come back up. Keep your torso, legs and toes in a straight line parallel to the ground the whole time.

, It's simple math: the less weight you have on your body, the less exertion you'll need to keep your body straight and stable. Gymnasts benefit from keeping their body fat percentage as low as possible. Cut down on empty calories and focus on training cardio exercises when you're not busy with gymnastics.

, Planching is all about balance and upper body strength. Handstands will help acclimate you to putting your body's pressure on your hands. This may be done with a wall-assisted handstand as well. Place your feet up on a wall, plant your hands on the ground, and step your feet up the wall to get you in a handstand position. Try to hold for at least 30 seconds.


Getting someone to help you with handstands by holding your body in place is a great way to start if you're not used to gymnastics yet., Though it shouldn't come as a surprise to most, proper eating will have a major effect on any kind of athletics. This is especially true with gymnastics, where any amount of ""empty calories"" runs the risk of adding extra weight for you to carry around. Organic food is recommended because it maximizes the amount of nutrients you get in the same amount of food.


Drink sufficient water.Keep a water bottle with you wherever you go.

, Because a planche requires a high level of strength and balance, you should aim to get at least 7-9 hours each night. More sleep may be appropriate on nights before a big training day.

, A perfect planche can take years to perfect. Even professional gymnasts have trouble with this. Start small, and work your way up slowly. Don't give up, and learn to identify small improvements in your form. This is vital to keeping your morale up.

Choose a set of stairs that is reasonable, such as no more than four steps. A set of stairs between one story and the next story of your house is not safe; never attempt to jump such a set of stairs. Always keep the amount of steps manageable and realistic for your height and athletic ability.

, This is still jumping, but it's closest to the ground. Try running down the stairs and jumping at that step when you feel confident enough.

, If you're taller, this will be a little easier for you. If you are shorter, it might be harder. If there is a pain on your ankle, foot or leg, stop for a while.

, Ask friends to do the same, so whoever gets there first wins.

, If you live in an apartment, try doing that on the stairs of the building.

, If there are about only one to three stairs, don't run. You still can, but it won't do much. If there are more than three steps, run. It will give you more speed, so you can jump with greater ease.

, Just laugh it off, get up on your own quickly and say something like ""Well wasn't that graceful?"" or something. If you act like it wasn't a big deal, your friends or fellow jumpers won't either.


If you're actually hurt, see a nearby school nurse or a doctor to check on you.

, Try doing it on every set of stairs, once you stop doing it, it will be harder to start doing it again.

Work on your abs.,
and


v-ups (same as tuck-ups but instead of going into a tuck, you go into a v position with only your butt on the ground), and plank position (when you lie on your stomach and put your elbows on the ground and lift your stomach so that only your feet and elbows and forearms are on the ground- hold for 1-2 minutes).,
Practicing these moves can help with gymnastics or simply to get the body you want.,
Build leg muscles.,
Build up your arm muscles.,
Develop flexibility.,
Take dance classes or practice drills for balance and coordination.",How to Perform Strength Training for Gymnastics," For almost all aspects of gymnastics, you need great stomach muscles, especially on bars. Mastering moves such as hollow body (when you lie flat on the ground and lift your legs and shoulders and arms, so that only your back and butt are on the ground. If you are doing it correctly, your stomach should become hard and it should be difficult. Try to work your way up to holding this position for a minute or more.) This can help you to do a variety of strength moves such as:


tuck-ups (when you do hollow body position, then curl up into a tuck so that only your back is still on the ground, and then back to hollow body- do about 30 at a time)





;
, For every exercise you do, it is important to keep your head neutral.

, Hollow body position is vital to your success in Gymnastics, because you will use it at every event and if you do it incorrectly it can cause many problems. However, if you master it, and it becomes a good habit you will have great success in gymnastics.

, This is not as important as abs but is still necessary. This can be done by running or heel-raises (when you stand on the edge of a surface- such as on the stairs or in gymnastics you can stand on the beam with your heels off the edge of the beam and you go from having your heels as far down as they go to standing on your toes, and repeat that about 100 times).

, Do push-ups and pull-ups to get that muscle. Try a drill where you have a surface that is about 3/4 of a foot tall, and you do three sets of push-ups: 30 with your hands on top of the mat, 25 on the ground, and 20 with your feet on top of the mat and your hands on the ground.

, Try doing all three splits every day for two minutes each. Once you have those splits down, you can work on the flexibility in your thigh by going into either your right or left leg split and lifting the foot of your back leg up so that that leg is bent. It's a really good stretch. Also practice going into a straddle and touching both legs and getting your stomach to the ground in the center. Try to touch your toes in a pike. Go into a lunge before doing your splits, you don't want to pull a muscle. Gymnasts should be flexible all over- not just in splits.

, This should help you become more graceful.

Dance
Motions
Sticking landings perfectly.;
, For the dance, do it exactly as your coach taught you. Suggest any new ideas to your coach at practice, not at a meet; that way you have plenty of time to practice and get it right. Be as consistent as you can, in full turn.

, Many gymnasts assume that motions are easy, and a bit of rest. However, they're also hard work and you should be trying your hardest in motions too, to get a good or a perfect score.

, This takes practice and time and requires you to put the skills that you've already perfected in your routine towards a perfect landing. For example, if you can't do a perfect round off back handspring back layout punch front, do a perfect round off back handspring back tuck instead. Go with what you know well and perform well.

, Unless you're a compulsory gymnast, put the hardest skills that you can do perfectly in your routine.

, Beam routines are very difficult to get a perfect score on because you have to stay balanced, have grace, and stick the landings. All of this is a lot to ask, but it is possible.

, Keep your body tight, it'll be over in less than a minute and a half.

, Even though beam can be difficult, it can also really pay off to be the beam champion, so perfect your skills.

, Ask your coach if your full turns are done well enough, if your leaps are split, or if your cartwheels are straight. Be guided by your coach's feedback and keep aiming to improve.

, The funny thing is that some of the so-called ""harder"" skill may be much easier for you, depending on your own approaches, so go through the list and cover them all to find your comfort zone.

, Bars can be tricky for all the strength it would take to swing around the bar, but it can still be the easiest to get a perfect routine on. However, stick with the basics, namely, the straight legs and the pointed toes.

, Kips can be impressive, and are common for a gymnastics bars routine, so it's better to use them than pull overs.

, It can be tiring, but it's one routine and it'll be over soon. If you do well, you'll be cool with your score.

, No matter what level you are in, circles will really help get a better score, and if you are above level 7, it's good to use giant swings.

, The tricky part is the dismount. When it's the dismount, look high, and flip with the same good form you had, and try to stick the landing. After all the connections and skills you have used, to get a perfect score, try your best to stick your dismount!

, The vault is the event that is tricky for some gymnasts, but as easy as a cartwheel for others. This is the event where all you can do is try your best.

, Some vaults start at 8.00, others start at 9.00, some start at a perfect score of 10.00, so you have to pick a 10.00 vault, to have a chance of earning a perfect score.

, Don't slow down, or stagger; you must sprint before mounting the vault.

, Then reach over, keep a tight body, and look at the vault.

, Just try your best; if you keep trying, you'll get a perfect score someday.

, Before trying to touch your feet to your head, stretch your hamstrings to avoid straining them.Sit upright on the ground with your legs held straight in front of you.
Slowly bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight.
Extend your hands and reach for your toes. If you can’t reach your toes, try touching your ankles or perhaps your knees.
Move your extended legs out so that they’re about shoulder width distance apart.
Repeat bending forward and reaching for your toes (or ankles or knees)., Begin by sitting on the ground with your legs extended in front of you.Bend your right knee and bring your right foot inward towards your pelvis.
Slowly bend forward at the waist, keeping your back straight.
Extend your left hand towards your left foot; try to touch your toes. If you can’t reach your toes, try to touch your ankle or your knee.
Repeat each step on the left side.

, Warm up your back with some gentle stretches so you don’t strain it.


Start on your hands and knees and slowly drop your head and pull your back up into an arch. Hold for several seconds.
Drop your stomach, lift your head, and pull your back downward into an inverted arch.For the next stretch, lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet on the ground. Keeping your back on the ground and your legs bent, slowly lower your knees to the ground on your right.
Move your legs back into a neutral position.
Repeat the stretch on the left side., After stretching your back and legs, you can begin the process of touching your feet to your head.Lie flat on your stomach, arms extended forward and legs extended behind you.

, Do this step slowly and gently--don’t rush.


Slowly bend your knees and raise your feet until your legs are bent upward behind you.

, Again, perform this movement slowly. If you feel any pain, stop immediately.


Lift your chest and raise yourself up on your elbows.
You should be lying on your stomach, resting on your elbows with your legs bent upward at the knee.

, At this point, only go as far as you comfortably can. If you begin to feel pain or strain, stop immediately and gently return to a neutral resting position.


Lift your chest and draw yourself up onto your hands.
Slowly arch your back and reach your head backward as far as you can.

, Don’t force your body to go any further than it’s capable of or comfortable with or you could injure yourself.


Draw your feet forward and upward towards your head.
Arch your back and extend your head behind you until you feel your feet touch your head.

, Start in a standing position, then bend one leg behind you while balancing on the other.Reach behind you and grab a hold of your raised foot.

, While grasping your raised foot, arch your back and begin gently pulling your foot towards your head.If you feel any pain or discomfort at this point, stop. Going further could result in strain or other injury.

, While pulling your foot towards your head, continue arching your back. Pull your head back until you feel it touch your foot.


This will require good balance to accomplish. If you’re having trouble maintaining your balance, do some balancing exercises before trying again.

, From that position, place one forearm flat on the ground. Adjust the position of the other hand by moving it back until the heel of your hand is directly across from where the elbow of your opposite arm is resting.


Touching your feet to your head from a handstand position is a very advanced technique that you should only attempt if you have advanced levels of strength, flexibility, and balance.Alternatively, a less demanding strategy is to start on your hands and knees close to and facing a wall, then lower yourself onto both forearms., Kick your feet up above your head until you can find your balance.You’ll be in a modified handstand position, with your feet in the air and your weight resting on your forearm and on your other hand.
Alternatively, you can do this next to a wall so that when you kick your feet over your head, your feet will hit the wall, helping you keep your balance. You’ll be in forearm-stand position with your feet above you, resting on the wall., Once you’ve found your balance in the modified handstand position, bend your legs at the knee so that your feet begin moving towards your head.Arch your back and gradually lower your feet until you feel them touch your head. You can pull your head back slightly to meet them.
Alternatively, you can use a wall as a brace while you slowly lower your feet towards your head.Bear in mind that this is an extremely advanced position that takes a great deal of practice to accomplish."

Stretch.,
Start with some exercises.,
Begin your leap by jumping.,

Put it all together!,
Practice with duct tape for the beam.,
Practice your cat leap on the duct tape.,
When you think you are ready, move to a low beam.

,
After you can do 5 cat leaps in a row without falling off the low beam, move up to a higher beam.

,
Repeat this process until you have graduated to the highest beam.",How to Perform a Cat Leap in Gymnastics," This is very important, and mandatory.;
, Sit on the floor with your legs crossed. Bring up your left leg to your belly button, and do the same with your right leg immediately. You can also do this with your legs out, and laying down. As you are doing this, you are mimicking the leg movements in the cat leap.

, Try to bring your left leg to your belly button, and after you got it as high as it will go, repeat with your right leg. Ideally, the right leg should be directly under the left. But, for right now, just practice on getting your legs higher.

, They play a very simple role. They should start close together in front of you, move upward into a crown position, and then fall out to the sides. All this should be done with grace, and not sloppy. If you want to practice, try it with a straight jump first.

, Do your arm movements at the same time as your legs. In an ideal cat leap, your feet should reach your belly button, be directly under each other, and your arm movements should be graceful. This might take a long time to master, but that's OK!

, Roll out a piece of duct tape about the length of the beam, or shorter if you need too. It should be on a surface where either you want it to stay, or you can easily remove it.

, This should eliminate fear because you can't fall, but provide a nice practice space, width wise.

,,, Congratulations! Now, all you have to do is practice until you get it just right almost every time.

Most gyms will take anyone who has reached the appropriate standards and others will only take people of a certain height, age and/or body type.


Some gyms only take team gymnasts of a certain age. This is especially true with pre-teams. Most pre-teams only take gymnasts who are about 4 to 8 years old.Older gymnasts often have to start at levels 4 or 5.Some gyms won't take older gymnasts on their teams at all. A gym which aims to produce elites will look for kids who are 6 to 7 years old to do level 4 and 5.A gym which focus's on college scholarships will usually want their level 4 and 5's to be no older than 10.Find out what the case is for your gym.;
, Some gyms hold open trials once a year. Other gyms will invite those who they think are good enough. Other gyms will take everyone who reaches a certain level, and so on.


Many gyms start their team at Level 4 but many now begin at levels 2 or 3. Some gyms may not start their team until level 5. Talk to your coach or the gym managers to find out what's expected.

, Team is a big commitment from your parents as well, not just you. They need to agree to drive you to and from the gym, usually 3 to 5 days a week at least. They need to be prepared to allow you to have a lot less time for homework and they will pay a lot of money.

, If your coach doesn't know they can't help you achieve your goal.


Many kids who are desperate to be on team have not even told their coaches and the coaches don't realize they want to be there. If you tell the coach, they can find out if there could be a place for you.

, Teams are not just interested in talented kids, they want dedicated gymnasts. Be on time and dressed appropriately, with the right equipment.

, If you are only training once a week it is unlikely you will ever make team. You should be going a minimum of twice a week, while three times a week is better. Find out whether you can take another class each week, if your class is only once a week perhaps another type of class at the gym.

, You need to acknowledge this before getting on the time because it will mean a massive time commitment on your behalf. Team gymnasts need to train a lot of hours: Level 3s usually train 3 to 8 hours per week, level 4s around 9 to 12 hours per week, level 5s about 12 to 15 hours per week, level 6s about 14 to 18 hours per week, levels 7 and 8 train around 16 to 24 hours per week. Levels 9 to 10 train around 18 to 30 hours per week. This may not be possible if you do any other activities or get tired easily. Training sessions are usually 3 to 4 hours long.

,, When your coach is correcting you, he/she is helping you to pinpoint and then eliminate your weaknesses, in order to become the best gymnast you can be.

, Check whether they apply to you. The more tips you can pick up, the better.

, If you look like a competitive gymnast your coaches are more likely to see you as a competitive gymnast. Wear a leotard and keep your hair neat and tidy.

, Try to be in the gym as much as possible so that you can absorb as much as possible.

, This way you know what skills you need to be ready.

, If your team starts at level 3, you will need to know how to dive roll vault.


On bars, you will need a pullover, back hip circle, stride circle and round-off.
On beam, you will need side handstands and 3/4 handstands.
On floor, you will need handstand forward rolls, round offs and bridge kick overs.

, If your team starts at level 4, you will need your round off back handspring and tic toc on floor.


Your handstand twist dismount and full handstand on beam.
On bars, you will need glide swing, pullover, back hip circle, front hip circle, stride circle and underswing and a handstand to flat back vault.

, If your team starts at level 5 you will need your front handspring vault.


On bars, you will need your glide kip, long kip and squat on a jump to high bar.
On beam, you will need handstands and cartwheels.
On floor, you will need dive roll, round off followed by two back handsprings, back walkover, front handspring and backward roll to handstand.

, These two aspects are among the main things looked at for choosing team gymnasts. You should work on building both strength and flexibility every day at home, for at least 20 to 30 minutes. Ask your coach to design you a home program to do each day and ask them to review it after you have done it daily for 6 weeks.

, It takes a while to develop your gymnastics skills to team level. Keep at it and you will get there.

Purchase the required lumber from your local hardware supplier.,
Wash the entire surface area of each wood piece.,
Glue the six 8 feet (2.4 m) wood pieces together.,
Secure the beams together while the glue dries.,
Sand the wood.,
Mount steel galvanized angle holders to the beam.,
Add legs to the beam.,
Anchor the base for each leg.,
Cover with synthetic suede padding.",How to Make a Balance Beam," To build the balance beam you will need six 8 foot (2.44 m) pieces of 1-by-6 pine beams, four 12-inch (61 cm) pieces of 2-by-4 wood planks and four 24-inch (30.5 cm) pieces of 2-by-4 wood planks.


You will also need to purchase everything listed below in ""Things You'll Need"". These items can all be found at your local hardware supplier or stores such as Home Depot.;
, Use soap, water and a washcloth, sponge or coarse brush to scrub the wood pieces thoroughly. This is very important as dirt and grime can prevent the wood glue from working as effectively. Let the wood sit for a while until it is completely dry before adding the glue.

, Place the pine beams vertically next to one another as that is how they will need to be administered. Glue the largest sides (the flat sides with the most surface area) of the wooden beams together with an industrial-strength wood glue (preferably waterproof).Use a very generous amount of glue in this process as that is what keeps the wood beams together. Make sure they dry before the next step!


When finished the fronts and backs of the beams should be completely flush, creating 1 large beam measuring 8-feet (2.44 m) long and around 4.5-inches (10.2 cm) wide.
The 4.5-inch (10.2 cm) surface will be the top of your homemade beam.

, The best solution for securing the beams together is to use wood clamps. If you don't have clamps, lay the beams flat on their widest part and apply a heavy weight to help fuse the boards.


Allow the beams to dry for at least 24 hours.

, When the glue has dried, remove the clamps or the weights, and sand the entire surface of the beam.


Use a sanding plane or sand belt to ensure the surface is uniform and even.

, Screw the angle holders (the angle holders will come with screws) to the underside ends of your balance beam approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) from the end of each side.

, Fasten the four 12-inch (30.5 cm) pieces of 2-by-4 wood planks into the angle holders to create the legs, using 4 wood screws per leg, or 16 screws total.


There should be 4 available spaces in the angle holders, 1 for each leg.

, Attach one 24-inch (61 cm) piece of 2-by-4 wood plank to the bottom of each leg, using 4 total, with 4 wood screws per anchor.


These will ensure greater stability and a balanced surface.

, Cut a long, thin strip of the suede padding to fit the length and width of the beam. Glue the padding onto the surface so it covers the entire beam.


For optimal results, use a piece wide enough to fit all the way around the beam with enough left over to fasten to the underside with the angle holders.
Allow the padding and glue to fully dry before using the beam.

Look for spots that are outside or have enough space for you to move around freely. If you’re practicing outside, try to find an area with grass, sand or loose dirt, which can help cushion the impact if you fall.Make sure your outdoor practice space is clear of rocks, twigs and other debris that could cause a painful mishap.
See if you can spend the afternoon learning the front walkover in your school gymnasium or the local community center.
Parks and playgrounds with rubberized flooring make great places for safely trying out new skills.;
, Pull a friend, parent or sibling aside and ask them if they can spot you as you get the hang of difficult or scary skills. A spotter can guide you and support your weight as you run through the movement, which lets you focus on your technique. Almost anyone can be a spotter, so there’s no reason not to have one on your first few tries.To properly spot a front walkover, have your spotter place one hand across your lower back and give you a lift as you stand up out of the bridge.Your spotter should be someone who is tall and strong enough to help hold you up.

, Mats and protective padded surfaces will serve to prevent injury in case you land incorrectly. They will also take away a good deal of fear, as you know you’re unlikely to get hurt even if you mess up. Once you get more comfortable with the skill, you can slowly start building up the courage to do it without pads. Testing the waters with a mat can really speed up the learning process, so that by the end of the day you'll be doing walkovers with no hesitation.You can buy fold-up tumbling mats designed specifically for gymnastics and cheerleading at most sporting goods stores. These will lay over any flat surface and store easily when you’re finished with them.
If you don’t have mats available to you, use folded blankets, pillows or couch cushions to break your fall.

, Even though your goal is to learn to do a front walkover in the course of a day, there’s no need to rush yourself. The bigger a hurry you’re in, the more likely you are to make mistakes or develop bad habits. Spend a couple of hours or longer breaking down and drilling each phase of the technique and take your time overcoming intimidating challenges.Create short-term goals for the day, such as ""I'd like to be able to hold a bridge by the end of the afternoon,"" or ""I'll try my first walkover without a spotter after dinner.""
Don’t forget to take rest breaks occasionally. Tumbling is a strenuous activity, and you won’t perform as well if you’re tired.

, Movements like the front walkover can put a lot of strain on your wrists, shoulders and back, so it’s a good idea to stretch out these parts of your body prior to practicing. Following a light warm up, loosen up your muscles and joints. This will get your blood flowing and energize you, as well as increase your range of motion, allowing you to get into tricky positions easier.Raise both arms up high, then reach across your body as you lean from side to side at the waist. Lie face down on the floor and push your torso up and back to limber up your lower back. Flex both wrists to get them ready to hold you up.
Don’t neglect your warm up and stretching routine. You’re at a much higher risk of injury if you force your body to perform difficult movements before it’s ready., Since a well-controlled handstand is the setup for the front walkover, it will be useful to make sure you have it down first. Place both hands on the floor in front of you. Kick up with one leg, then bring both legs together in a vertical position with your body straight and aligned. Maintain your balance by making minor adjustments with your hands and shoulders.Practice your handstands against a wall until you get used to being upside down and supporting yourself on your arms.Instead of returning your feet to the floor beneath you when you exit the handstand, lower yourself forward into a bridge. This technique is called a front limber, and it will help get you more comfortable with transitioning to your feet.Aim to spend an hour or two drilling your handstand, then start working on transitioning into the bridge and follow-through.

, The bridge and backbend translate perfectly to the second part of the walkover. Lying on your back with your hands and feet planted firmly on the ground beneath you, press up so that your body forms an arch. Support yourself by keeping your arms and legs straight and strong. The back flexibility needed for to hold a solid bridge is key for learning the front walkover.Squeeze your butt muscles to help you stay tight in a bridge.
You won't need to be able to hold a bridge for very long in order to do a walkover, so focus on standing up from the bridge to help you practice coming out of the technique easily., Master your cartwheel to get used to the action of kicking up to your hands, which will carry you over when doing the walkover. Set your hands down on the floor one after the other as you swing your back leg up. Drive through with your kicking leg to lift yourself into an inverted position, then rotate around and set it back down, followed by your opposite leg.The technique of landing on the same foot you kick with is used in both the cartwheel and front walkover. When doing a front walkover, you’ll only be tweaking your cartwheel technique slightly so that you’re moving straight forward rather than sideways.
Adjusting your cartwheel technique to practice kicking up into a handstand can help you get the hang of getting inverted by the end of the day.

, Take a staggered stance, with whichever leg you prefer to kick up with in the back. Bend over at the waist and set your hands down a couple feet ahead of your front foot. Your hands should be a comfortable distance apart and parallel, with your fingers spread out in front of you.Start with your weight in the heels of your palms and shift it to your fingers as you raise up into the handstand.
Your hands should stay in the same position throughout the walkover.

, Throw your kicking leg up hard, keeping it as straight as possible throughout the movement. The kick will begin to lift you into a handstand. Keep your other foot on the floor for as long as you can. The momentum generated by the kick will power you through the walkover in one smooth motion, while your extended front leg will act as a counterbalance to help you stand back up.You’ll need to kick forcefully in order to rotate around with enough speed to walk out of the backbend.
Front walkovers are all about confidence. If you don’t commit to the movement, you won’t have enough force to carry you over.

, After you kick up, begin lifting your other leg off the ground. Both legs should now be in the air, leaving you in an inverted position. Balance carefully as you continue to whip your legs over and behind your body. Brace your upper body, but keep your hips and legs loose.Press your fingers into the floor to stabilize yourself and control your speed as you bring your legs over the top.Unlike a normal handstand, resist the urge to bring your legs together. They should stay split from the time you kick to the time your first foot hits the floor.

, At the top of your handstand, arch your back to bring your kicking leg closer to the ground as it comes around. Lean your weight forward as you prepare to come into contact with the floor. The basic idea is that you’re gracefully falling into a bridge one leg at a time.While your body is tilting forward, keep your eyes on the floor just in front of your hands to maintain your center of gravity. If you try to look too far up or down, you may fall out of position.
Use a raised surface, like a bed or the seat of a couch, to get a feel for landing with your first leg.This is the most difficult part of the skill, and will likely take a few hours to practice before you get it down.

, Your kicking leg should now have traveled over your body and be pointed at where you will land. Keep leaning and arching your back until you feel your toes hit the floor. Shift your weight onto your first foot. As you swing your other leg through, push off of the ground with your arms and shoulders to return you to an upright position. You can then glide naturally out of the movement and finish strong and tall. You’ve just done your first front walkover in less than 24 hours!Keep your legs split until the moment your first foot touches the floor. If they’re too close together, the transition won’t be as smooth and it will be much harder to stand back up.
Practice front walkovers regularly until you start to see improvement in your technique.

, This is a must-do. At least one kid will fall off.

, For instance, have one station involve doing a front support. Another could be pullovers with help, and a third could be casting drills.

, Showing is better than telling. Bring up a kid to help demonstrate.


Switch the stations so that each kid gets a turn at each one. Have each kid go one at a time and show the kids the skill that they will practice.

, This is the station where the kids can play, swing, or do any skill.

, This is on the low bar (with a mat under, if necessary). The kids do a pullover, either with help or by themselves.

,, This is not a station, but a course. The kids can swing over the lava, water, etc., jump on the springboard, then (with the stairs) swing off the high bar onto a wrestling mat (8-inch mat).

, This means that the kids will put both their hands and feet on the bar, and swing off with the help of a coach staying in that position until they land.

, This is leaning forwards while staying tucked and going down off the bar.

, For example, they could do 5 sit ups, then get to practice their splits, or something else fun

Set aside a place to practice sticking the landing.,
Create a ""donkey kick"" zone.",How to Lay Out Training Stations for Gymnastic Vaults (Preschool)," You must lower the vault for safety reasons. You do not want the preschooler running at an apparatus that is at head height. If the budding gymnast messes up and goes face-first into the vault, the individual can be injured, have confidence shattered and lose willingness to try the apparatus again. As a rule of thumb, the vault apparatus should not be higher than the middle of the chest.;
, These will be put on the side of the vault opposite the approach (the landing area). Not all stations require a landing mat. Follow the guidance for each individual station.

, Young gymnasts are light, so it is likely that they will not get any bounce if more than three or four springs are installed.

, If they do not know how to hurdle, they will likely get injured. Get them to focus on form and technique-- first by showing, then by doing. Do not allow sloppy habits to form or persist.

, This will allow good circulation of the young gymnasts will and minimize waiting. You will be able to pack more ""hands on"" practice into each session, so the kids will progress faster.

, Take a springboard and set it up in a safe location so that the kid using it will not hurt anyone. If you have a Tumble Trak, you can also set up the station on the track.

, Stand next to the vault between the springboard and the vault, and help them jump up to the vault. You can position a hula hoop for them to jump through. And, if you make it so the vault goes into the pit, this becomes a super fun station. Of course, fun activities help the learning process immeasurably and should be used whenever possible. In this case, the more fun, the better.

, Emphasize running fast as they can. Give them tips and encourage them through praise and gentle guidance.

, For this exercise, bend your knees and place your hands on floor. Jump up as high as you can and, as you land, assume the same position. The chest should stay up the entire time.

, Jump from a low surface (no more than two feet high) and practice bending the knees and properly positioning the arms. Instruct, observe, and provide corrective guidance.

, Donkey kicks are otherwise known as heel drives, but for the kids, donkey kicks are more fun and intuitive. Hands go on a surface at chest height (vault, block mat, etc.). With help, they bring their feet up with knees slightly bent and kick out like a donkey. When their feet touch the springboard, they bounce up again. Repeat three times (or more).

Getting more flexible.,
Get even more flexible.,
Making it perfect.",How to Hold a Handstand on the Beam," To get strong enough to do this, do a minute long plank on the wall to build stomach muscle. You have a better chance of learning a handstand on the floor if your body is strong enough to support it's weight in a handstand. Before moving to the next step, make sure you can get all the way up in your handstand. Have someone take a video of you doing a handstand so you can know if it's all the way up.;
, To learn this, hold a handstand for a minute against the wall. Your hands should be about 10 inches from the wall, and your stomach should face the wall. After you can do this, try holding your handstand on the floor. Aim to hold it for one second. Your handstand is a lot easier to hold on the floor after you can do it against the wall. Don't move on until you can hold your handstand for one second.

, Practice your handstand until you can hold it for two seconds. You should also learn a half pirouette to learn control. To do a half pirouette, when you're in your handstand, flip one hand so that your fingertips are facing the opposite way that they usually do, and after you do that, pick up the other hand and move it to the opposite side that it was on before. Now you should be facing the other direction in your handstand. Don't move on until you can hold your handstand for two seconds, and do the half pirouette.

, To do this, first go up into a handstand with your hands about six inches away from the wall, with your back facing the wall this time. Kick up into your handstand and don't let your feet touch the wall for a time period of three seconds. Then take the wall away and hold it for three seconds on your own. Don't move on until you can hold your handstand for three seconds, with and without the wall there.

, Now you need to hold it for four seconds. This shouldn't be that much harder than three seconds. The reason you need to hold it this long on the floor is that it's harder to hold on the beam, so you need to be really good at holding them on the floor to be able to hold them on the beam. Don't move on until you can hold a handstand for four seconds.

, It doesn't matter how it looks; you just need to overcome your fear of doing a handstand on the beam. To help you be good at this, do your handstand with your stomach facing the wall on the beam and hold it for one minute. Try to get most of the way up. Don't move on until you can get most of the way up on your beam handstand.

, To do this, now you'll do a handstand with your back facing the wall on the beam, and hold it for one minute. This will help you with your form. With better form, you'll be closer to a vertical handstand on the beam. Don't move on until you can do a handstand with good form on the beam (it doesn't have to be all the way up).

, To help you do this, you'll do a handstand with your stomach facing the wall on the beam, and then you'll walk your hands out until your body looks like an upside down L. Don't move on until you can do a vertical (all the way up) handstand on the beam

, If you're going to start holding your handstand on the beam, you need a way to get out of it if you start falling. What you want to do is, turn one of your hands to look like you're in the middle of a cartwheel, then fall to your feet. You need to be able to hold your handstand for one second at this point. Don't move on until you can cleanly do the handstand to side handstand falling drill and hold your handstand for one second on the beam.

, To help you make this easier, first you want to learn a tuck handstand on the beam. Just do a regular handstand and then bend your legs. This will help you with making your handstand straighter. Now you'll want to be able to hold your handstand for two seconds. Don't move on until you can do a tuck handstand on the beam and can hold your beam handstand for two seconds.

, Practice straddling your legs in your handstand on the beam. Don't worry, you're strong enough now that you won't split the beam. If you fall, just come down like you would if you fell out of a regular handstand. Also learn how to hold your beam handstand for three seconds now. Don't move on until you can do a straddle handstand on the beam, and can hold your beam handstand for three seconds.

, As you get better, you'll need more flexibility in your legs. Learn your splits, and a split handstand where your legs are as far apart as they can be on the beam. Don't move on until you can do both of these.

, Being flexible in the back also helps you with controlling your handstand. Learn how to to get your knees to your head when you arch your back.


Then try a Mexican handstand on the beam. A Mexican handstand is where you separate your legs (but still keep them straight), and you arch you back as far as you can. Don't move on until you can do this.

, Focus on your form when you do your handstand. Learn how to hold it for as long as you like without coming down. Learn this on the floor before the beam.

Acknowledge your fear of cartwheels.,
Understand the activity.,
Watch videos of people doing cartwheels.",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing a Cartwheel1," Ask yourself what specifically you are afraid of. Balancing on just your hands? Being upside down? Falling? Hurting yourself?Define the parameters of the fear. When did you first start experiencing this fear? Did you fall? Did you have an injury? Does this fear affect other aspects of your life? This is helpful to figure out whether this is a specific fear just to cartwheels or one that is related to other activities. For example, sometimes people who are fearful of cartwheeling also don't like to flip over monkey bars or do a somersault.
Often we fear the unknown. But think logically: how can you be afraid of something you haven't done yet, like a cartwheel? How do you know you'll fall or hurt yourself? You don't!;
, Do some research and discover what a cartwheel is and the motions involved in doing one. Knowing exactly what a cartwheel is and the steps involved can put your mind at ease.

, Seeing others do cartwheels successfully will give you a sense of the actual motions involved in doing one, which may help assuage your fear. Try this video or this one. It may also help to watch a slowed down video, such as this one.


Watching other people successfully complete cartwheels should help to familiarize you with the motions and also give you confidence in the general safety of cartwheeling; you'll see that very few people injure or hurt themselves while cartwheeling.
You'll also see that a lot of cartwheeling has very little to do with you and a lot to do with plain and simple gravity!"
"
Choose a safe area to practice on.,
Practice the individual motions involved in a cartwheel.,
Practice a full cartwheel.,
Do a cartwheel a couple times a day until you no longer feel that fear.",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing a Cartwheel2," The area where you practice cartwheeling is very important. Picking the right spot will boost your confidence and make you feel safe.


Choose an area where the ground or floor is flat and clean. Good spots include grassy lawns and gymnasiums with mats on the floor or built-in soft surfaces.
Make sure the space has plenty of room to enter and exit a cartwheel (you will move more distance than you think).
Check that there is nothing in the way that you could bump into.
Remember to consider who else may be in the space. On the one hand, you may not want to practice in front of other people if you feel nervous. On the other hand, it might make you feel better about practicing cartwheels if you know that there are people around who could help you if you fall.

, These are: lunge, hands down, (upside-down) straddle, finish. Breaking down and spending some time working with each of these steps helps make the whole activity more manageable.


Get used to the opening motion of a cartwheel by standing in the first position. Put your leading foot forward and raise your hands above your head. You have successfully completed the first part of a cartwheel!
Rock back and forth to start feeling that momentum in your legs and torso. This momentum is what will propel you into the cartwheel.
Try the lean-in movement of the initial stage of a cartwheel in slow motion. This will help you build in muscle memories of the basic way you will push off with your legs and put your hands down on the ground.

, This is the scariest part because it's the part where you flip over your hands and are upside down for a split-second. However, remember that old adage ""practice makes perfect."" Well, it's true! Every time you do a cartwheel, the less scarier it will seem.

, It may not be the best cartwheel in the world at first, but over time you'll get stronger and more confident."
"
Try different variations.,
Bring the ground closer to you.,
Angle your body to the ground rather than straight up and down.,
Bend your legs.,
Take as much time as you need.,
Keep up the momentum and keep practicing!",How to Get over Your Fear of Doing a Cartwheel3," If you're not ready to master a straight up-and-down cartwheel yet, make things easier for yourself by trying different versions of the cartwheel as build your confidence. It's okay to try different things if this is what keeps you practicing instead of giving up.

, Stake several mats in your practice area to bring the ground closer to you when your hands go down in a cartwheel; your hands will plant on the mats, rather than on the ground below. Doing this will help close the gap between you and the ground and likely lessen your fear of falling while practicing.

, Try doing cartwheels in which you plant both hands and spin over the top, but you keep the front side of your body at an angle to the ground. This allows you to catch yourself on your feet more easily in the event of a mistake.

, Do a cartwheel with your legs slightly bent at first. This allows you to make a safer landing if you misjudge your momentum or lose your balance.

, Don't rush yourself into doing anything you're not ready for.


Take a break if you feel a mental block. Fear is a powerful emotion that can take time to overcome. If you feel overwhelmed by fear, stand or sit still, calm your breath by counting to 10, or your attention on the ground beneath you. After a while, you'll feel calm again and perhaps ready to try again.Gymnasts have reported success in overcoming mental blocks towards specific activities by taking a time out. Some have also had success in overcoming fear when they had time to casually ""play"" with different aspects of the skills and not really focus on them., It takes a lot of determination to conquer your fear of cartwheels. Don't give up! No one ever became perfect at something their first few attempts."

Stretch to improve your flexibility.Warming up your legs, ankles and back beforehand will minimize the risk of injury.,
Prepare a soft surface for your back handspring.A soft surface, like yard grass,mat, or bed mattress is necessary in order to practice your back handsprings.,
Work on needle kicks.Needle kicks will help to train the force in your legs, which is needed to execute the initial flip backwards.,
Use a trampoline for gymnastics practice.,
Practice handstands.The cornerstone of a successful back handspring is a handstand.,
Train your handspring using a vault board.Especially starting out, many gymnasts have difficulty mustering the strength it takes to launch their bodies in a flip.,
Squat against a wall.Squatting against a wall is a common way to build leg strength.,
Enlist the help of a coach.Sports coaches have the experience and training to notice issues with your technique that you or your friends might not pick up on.,

Combine back handsprings with other techniques.Once you get the hang of traditional back handsprings, you can solidify your skill by combining it with other techniques.,
Sleep at a regular time each night.Even if you're not actively training, you'll do yourself a disservice by cutting short on sleep.,
Train with a partner.Training and exercising are far more satisfying when they're done with a partner.,
Drink sufficient water.Water is vital for all athletic exercises, and it's especially important in gymnastics.,
Believe in yourself.Although believing in oneself sounds like cheap advice there are few places it means more than in athletics.",How to Improve Your Back Handspring," If your body is not limber during a back handspring, there's a chance you won't adjust properly to the flip. Regardless of the sport you're practicing for, it's always important to give your body a bit of a warm up before the fact.


Stretch and roll your wrists. This is the area that risks the most strain when you execute your back handspring, so it's a good idea to give it some extra love prior to attempting the technique.;
, A hard surface won't give you the cushion you need to spring back, and the risks of injury are much higher. Investing in a mat will allow you to practice your back handsprings from virtually any location.

, To do a needle kick, raise your knees, and launch your leg out in a kicking motion. Repeat this 15-20 times for each leg to complete a full set.









Doing a set of these before attempting a back handspring will ensure your leg muscles are properly warmed up for the technique.

, A trampoline offers a safe, welcoming arena to practice your backflips. If you're relatively new to back handsprings and flips in general, practicing them on a trampoline helps to alleviate the fear of injuring yourself.








, You should practice these as part of your regular workout. Aim your arms downward and lay your hands flat on the ground. Holding your hands in place, launch yourself forward and lift your legs off the ground. Handstands can be held for several seconds or longer if you have the flexibility and strength. They may take a long time to master, but it's a necessary step to take if you want to get good at back handsprings.









Training up your handstand balance will make it easier to control the stage of a back handspring when your hands meet the ground. Being used to the experience of a handstand will make the back handspring feel more fluid.
Training yourself with 20 second handstands in reps of 5 is a good place to start if you already have the basics figured out., A vault board will give you the extra force necessary to achieve a flip. This will allow you to focus on other facets of your technique.


Using a vault board can help you to focus on improving your control, rather than putting the effort into the force of jumping itself. This is particularly helpful if you have difficulty with the initial leap.

, Rest your back against wall, and lower your body down. This will cause a bend in your legs. Get your squat down to the point where your legs are arched at a 90 degree angle. This should cause a noticeable burn in your leg muscles.


If your legs are stronger, you'll be able to leap higher, giving your back handspring greater initial force.
Hold your squat for 30 seconds, then give yourself 30 seconds to rest before you attempt another rep.

, Whether at a subscription gym or as part of a gymnastics team, getting help from a coach can take you from being good to great. It is especially helpful if you have a positive working relationship with the coach. Many coaches find satisfaction in seeing their students thrive. This can have a positive moralizing effect on you if you're feeling frustrated by the learning curve.


Having a coach around can also help limit the risk of personal injury if he doubles as a spotter.

, It's a common mistake for beginning gymnasts to bend their backs as they execute this manoeuvre. Unfortunately, this makes it more difficult for your body's weight to complete the flip, and you have an increased risk of injury if your spine is at an arc.

, If you have had some training doing wall squats, the wall squat position is the stance you'll want to be in as you launch yourself backwards. Bring your legs to a near-90 degree angle. This will maximize your body's force as you launch upwards.

, This reduces the risk of injury. It also helps ensure that your weigh is evenly displaced on both sides. If your head is turned one way or another, you will have a tendency to shift your body's weight in that direction.








, This will offer you the opportunity of analyzing your technique objectively. There may be things you notice yourself doing on video that you weren't conscious about when you were doing it.








, Tumbling and round-offs are just a couple of the techniques gymnasts tend to combine back handsprings with. Although juggling multiple techniques at once ups the challenge, you'll know you have mastered the handspring itself when you're able to combine it with ease.

, Regular, sufficient sleep is especially important if you're into athletics. Getting between 7-9 hours is optimal, although you may want more if you have a particularly straining athletics test the next day.


With proper rest, you'll be able to execute greater back handsprings with less conscious effort.

, If you have a friend who is training in the same skills you are, you'll be able to help each other. One of you can act as a spotter while the other executes the techniques. Above all, the moralizing aspect of training as a team will push you past the boundaries you thought you had.








, Drinking ample water helps to ensure that your joints are lubricated. If you're dehydrated, your body won't function at the level it should.


Ample water intake will loosen up your joints, giving your body greater flexibility when you attempt a back handspring.
Some athletes believe you should multiply your body weight by 0.6 to arrive at the number of ounces you should be drinking each day if you're wanting to get serious about athletics., If you feel like you're not cut out for a back handspring, you'll have a low chance of pulling it off regardless of your physical aptitude. Go into each training session with a positive outlook. You should take comfort in the fact you are going out of your way to hone your body and improve yourself.


Back handsprings are difficult, and require a fair amount of focus on the part of the gymnast. If you have issues with self-confidence, clearing up the emotional aspect will see tangible improvements in your technique.

Go to the gym and practice.,
Eat a good dinner.,
Pick a leotard.,

Go to bed early.",How to Do Well at Gymnastics Competitions1," If this isn't possible, practice your routines at home (no excuses, you can practice without tumbling and the music! Sometimes, you may be able to find it on Youtube)


Be careful not to overdo it, however. Practicing too much before a meet can wear you out, make you frustrated, and even make you unable to compete, if you injure yourself. In the days immediately before a meet, lightly practice and focus on perfecting the small things in routines like dance, attitude, toe points, and arm and leg placements.;
, Eat foods like pasta (carbohydrates) and meat (protein). The worst thing you can do is not eat. Avoid dairy.

, Usually the gym will provide the team leotard for you but if not you would pick out the leotard that makes you stand out more and that complements you. Even though your old leotard might be your favorite, you should look professional.

, Competition times can range from early morning sessions of 8:00 to late night sessions around 6:30 or 7:00. A good thing to do is plan out your day in a schedule minute by minute. This way you make sure you have enough time to get ready, but you have to meet the time limits you set for yourself.

, hours before you compete. If you have a drawstring bag or backpack, put the essentials in the bag before the meet, such as grips and wristbands, any wrist or ankle braces, bobby pins, hair ties, or hairspray/gel, so you don't forget them.

, Knowing the routine will save you the stress of trying to remember what to do on the apparatus. When you go over it in your head


Go over parts you have trouble with (dance, leaps, etc.)

On Floor: Learn the music. Know when the music can help you remember your routine (the same way theatre performers remember their lines using cues. You can remember using musical cues.) Count out the beats as well. This will help you stay in time with the music, and avoid ending too soon and just standing there awkwardly.

On Beam: Strut your stuff! Be confident, and make the judges look.

On Bars: When going over your routine, know the rhythm of your swings. Some people swing faster, some swing at an even pace, and some people speed up as it goes along. Knowing your rhythm will help you visualize you routine.

On Vault: Know the number on the tape measure where you start, so you know how many steps you need to take. Visualize your run, and then how long it takes after you hit the springboard to fly over the vault. This will help you know when to 'block' off.

, It is essential to have a lot of rest. Go even if you aren't tired. Though you may feel completely rested when you go to sleep, you will be tired when you wake up if you don't go to bed early. If you really can't go to sleep, do other resting activities:


Reading
Watching a movie
Do homework

, It may seem strange to target something so obvious, but it has happened that a gymnast ""blanked"" on even the balance beam mount.

, Continuing on the first step, go over your routine. Even if you went over it the night before, you can never go over your routine to many times. Use the tips in the previous section.

, It is dangerous to do gymnastics without warming up (as in any other sport), as you can pull a muscle. Run around and warm up, then stretch.

, There are many (good) ways to do hair for gymnastics, but some good styles are:


French Braids
Spider Webs
Cornrows
Buns
Pony tail

, Make sure you present before and after every routine on every event as you can lose 0.1 every time you forget.

, That sounds hard, but it's possible. Nerves are notorious for making even the best, most prepared gymnasts mess up. Be confident, especially on beam. Projecting confidence and showing attitude, especially on beam and floor, can give you a higher score even if you mess up.

, Keep your upper body up at this point. Your leg should be straight, and your toes should be pointed. Keep your shoulders open, point straight up at the ceiling.

, Move your dominant leg up higher, keeping it straight. You can bend you lower leg slightly. Squeeze your inner thighs and push through your shoulders. Give a good, well-aimed kick backwards to give you enough momentum to carry both legs back over you. Your dominant leg will reach the beam first--push into the beam with it to keep your balance.

, Try to reach a 180 degree split, but if you can't, try to at least make an 120° split. Point your toes, and push through the beam with your shoulders.

, Keep both legs straight. Try to keep your whole body in a line. Keep your arms 'glued' to your ears.

, This stabilizes you, and helps you stay on the beam. Hold it until you are completely stable.

, Hold your arms back, and up.

, A back walkover on the beam is a tricky skill, so find a line on the floor at the gym to practice wobbling less. Practice staying/landing on the line.

, This is a beam that touches the floor, through the middle. This is a safe way to practice, but it's shaped like a beam from the sides, and it's really thin, so make sure your aware of this. Before using it, be sure that you have actually mastered the moves on the floor line consistently.

Do some split kicks.,
Kick to the side for t-kicks.,
Stretch in a split position.,
Do heel stretches.,
Try a bow and arrow stretch.",How to Do the Pretzel Stretch1," Split kicks will help to warm up your muscles and loosen up your hamstrings. Focusing on one side at a time, kick your leg up into the air straight in front of you and moving in towards your face.Continue to kick your leg in this motion for about one minute and then switch to the other side.;
, Next, you will need to stretch out the muscles in your inner thighs. Begin kicking one leg out to the side and up towards your ear on that side. Then, switch to the other side.








Repeat this motion for about one minute on each side.

, After you have warmed up your muscles, get down on the ground and do a split. If you cannot get into a full split position yet, then just get as close as you can. To do a split, put one leg out in front of you and the other behind you. If you can, then lean forward towards your toe for an extra deep stretch.








Hold the stretch for about one minute on each side.
Repeat the stretch on your other side by switching the positions of your legs.
Do not bounce when you stretch. Just hold the position. If the stretch feel painful or uncomfortable, then reduce the stretch until the pain goes away., Stand up again and position yourself next to a wall or bar. Then, lift one leg into the air in front of you. Grab your foot with one or both hands.

Find suitable surface for performing all jumps.,
Start with the star jump or jumping jack.,
Next, try the straight jump.,
After perfecting the straight jump (do it at least 10 times), try to do a tuck jump.,
Follow with a straddle jump.,
Finally, practice doing a split jump.",How to Do Gymnastics Jumps," Before you even consider jumping, choose a suitable soft surface to minimize the risk of injury to your body. A suitable surface is one that is both flat and soft. Ideal surfaces include grass, exercise mats and soft playground surfaces specifically designed to break the impact of falls. Moreover, in each case you are advised to have a spotter, a person who can watch you and help if needed. Preferably, have someone who knows how to perform the jumps teach you how to do them; an article explanation can never take the place of a real life demonstration and hands-on help.;
, This jump has a pedigree that extends beyond gymnastics––it's also used for training military recruits, as a physical education exercise in schools and as part of numerous exercise programs worldwide. It's an energizing exercise that can be performed almost anywhere there's space to jump!


Warm up first or you risk hurting yourself.
Stand with your legs apart, shoulder-width and knees slightly bent. Have your arms to your sides, slightly bent.
Squat down by bending your knees.
Jump up vertically, as high as you can go.
At the same time, bring your arms up to point at a 45 degree angle from your head toward the sky, while extending your legs out similarly. This will form the ""star"" shape.
As you begin to descend, bring your legs and arms back in. Aim to land back in the same spot with your knees bent.
Repeat as often as needed––the landing position prepares you for each successive launch.

, Straight jumps are used in more than just gymnastics, for example in parkour, martial arts and even snowboarding and each method may differ slightly. The method explained here is based on the gymnastics version:


Warm up first or you risk hurting yourself.
Stand in a straight body position. Keep your legs together and arms by your sides.
Bend into a plié.
Now jump straight up. As you enter mid-air, point your toes and extend your arms upwards, past your ears to reach above your head.
Land back in a plié.
Repeat as often as needed––the landing position prepares you for each successive launch.

, Another exercise that extends beyond gymnastics, the tuck jump is often used to increase the vertical jump of athletes, increasing both power and agility through repeated practice.


Warm up first or you risk hurting yourself. This step must not be overlooked.
Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Have your knees slightly bent. Keep your head up and your eyes forward.
Squat low by bending your knees.
From the squat position, push yourself upward as powerfully as you can. As you reach mid-air, bring your knees up to your chest.
Bring your arms to clasp together around your bend legs.
As you start descending, let go of your legs and bring down to land, knees bent.
Descend straight into another squat. Repeat as many times as desired.
This jump is for infrequent use (about weekly only) as it can damage your joints if overdone.

, Often used in cheerleading, dancing and trampolining as well as gymnastics, the straddle jump is also known as the ""toe touch."" Before attempting this jump, be sure you are able to perform a center split. Also, practicing on a trampoline often helps to improve your technique. Be aware that this jump doesn't ""just happen."" It takes a lot of practice and concentration on improving your technique; some people find it is just to hard to do, so don't push yourself too hard, especially not without help from a qualified trainer. As this jump can be quite risky done alone, always do it with a spotter. In fact, the spotter can help you by holding your back at waist level to give you extra lift.


Warm up first or you risk hurting yourself.
Use a chair for support for your first tries. Weight the chair with something heavy to prevent it from toppling over.
Hold onto the back of the chair and simply practice jumping up and down, as high as you go. Only add the split if you feel confident.
Remove the support. Stand with both feet together, you arms dangling by your sides in a relaxed fashion. Stay relaxed all over.
Squat down to the floor. Use your hands to balance you on the floor and raise your heels off the floor slightly.
To take off, look up, breathe in and then push yourself up from the floor.
Jump up into the air as high as you can, relying on the strength in your legs to get you into the air.
Bring your legs out to the sides when up high in the jump and point your toes out. Your arms should also be stretched out toward your pointed toes (you may even try to touch them). Your head should be upright and your eyes facing forward.
As you begin to descend, quickly pull your legs back together before landing, knees bent.
Repeat as often as required.

, As with the straddle jump, this jump is popular in dance, trampolining, cheerleading and gymnastics. Figure skating is another area where a split jump is used but its technique is not covered here. It is also a general gym or exercise technique but in this case, you barely leave the ground, so this method is not covered here. In gymnastics, the aim is to show 180 degrees of separation of the legs.


Warm up first or you risk hurting yourself.
Stand with both feet together, your arms dangling by your sides in a relaxed fashion. Stay relaxed all over.
Jump upward, as high as you can.
Split the legs when mid-air. Pull one leg forward and the other behind as you are in mid-air. Point the toes.
When you are about to land, pull your legs back into the original position and land gently, knees bent. For gymnasts, this jump is often landed on a beam, but never practice this without appropriate supervision from a qualified gym instructor.
Repeat as required.

Dry your body.,
Select your towel.,
Position your towel.,
Wrap the towel around your body.,
Secure the towel wrap.",How to Make a Body Wrap Towel After a Shower," After getting out of the shower, quickly dry yourself by rubbing the towel on the very wet areas of your body. These areas include but aren’t limited to your hair, torso, and arms.


You want to be moderately dry before wrapping a towel around you, so you can actively do things and move around without tracking water all over the place.;
, Use a bath towel large enough to completely cover and wrap around your body. A typical-sized towel should be appropriate for most individuals, but for larger individuals, you might want to consider using a larger towel or a beach towel.


Women will most likely want to use a towel long enough to cover them from their upper chest to their mid thighs. Men may prefer to use a towel long enough to cover the area from their waist down to their knees.

, Hold the towel horizontally, grasping the two top corners with your right and left hand. Place the towel behind you, around your back. The two ends of the towel should now be in front of you, while the middle portion of the towel is pressed against your back.


Women should have the towel positioned higher on their back, so the horizontal top edge of the towel is at the height of their armpits.
Men should have the towel positioned lower, at their waist, so the horizontal top edge of the towel is just above their buttocks.

, Using either your left or right hand (it doesn’t matter which hand you use), bring one corner of the towel across the front of your body to the opposite side. For example, bring the left corner of the towel across the front of your body to the right side. Make sure the towel is tightly pulled across your body. Hold this corner in position with your hand. Then, while your hand is holding the first corner of the towel, bring the other corner of the towel across the front of your body to the opposite side.For women, this wrapping will be across your chest, above your bust and parallel with your armpits.
For men, this wrapping will be across your waist, parallel with your hips.

, Once both corners are brought to the opposite side of your body, tuck the second corner into the top horizontal edge of the towel wrapping, fitting the corner between your body and the towel.Try tucking in a large enough portion of the towel corner so the towel is more secure.


The more taut the original towel wrapping is, the more secure your towel wrap will be.
Consider twisting the second corner and tucking the twisted portion into the top edge of the towel. This twisted portion may secure the towel even further.
If the towel keeps coming undone, consider using a safety pin to keep the corner of the towel tightly tucked and in place.

Before beginning, check the stretch of your fabric.,
With the stretch going in your preferred direction, wrap your fabric around your body to gauge the width of your panel.,
Pinch the fabric where you want to cut, and then add 4–6 inches (10.2–15.2 cm) to prepare for hems and mistakes.

,
Mark the wrong side of the fabric where you will be cutting it with a washable marker, fabric pen, or chalk.

,
Lay your fabric out on an open surface, and use the ruler or straight edge to mark a line where you will be cutting your panel off of the remainder of your fabric.

,
Use your straight-edge again to mark lines on your fabric to straighten all of the edges, creating an even rectangle.,
Now you will need to mark the top of your fabric in the area that you will be sewing your elastic.,
If you have chosen to eyeball the fabric, simply wrap it around your body into the approximate position you would wear it when finished.,
If you have chosen to use the mathematical equation, you will need a tape measure.,
Now that you have marked where you will be sewing in your elastic, you will need to cut your desired length of elastic and sew it in your marked space, about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the top of the fabric.

,
Fold the top of your fabric over twice and pin.

",How to Make a Terry Cloth Bath Wrap," Decide if you want the the stretch wrapping around your body or hanging toward your feet. Depending on the width of your fabric, you may have no choice in the matter.;
, A good rule of thumb is that you will want your fabric to overlap in front of you so that it reaches just before your armpits.

,,,, Cut the fabric.

, Once again, you can eyeball the area by wrapping the fabric around your body, or you can do a simple mathematical equation.

, Once comfortable, pinch the fabric on both sides right under your armpits. Quickly mark both sides where you pinched them on the wrong side of the fabric.

, Measure across your back from right beneath one armpit to right beneath the other. Write this number down as the width of your back. Now use a ruler or the tape measure and measure the width of your fabric. Write this down as the width of the fabric. Now subtract the width of your back from the width of the fabric, and write this new number down as the remainder of the fabric. Divide the remainder of the fabric by 2, and write this number down as the wings. Now you will need to measure in this number from the left side of the fabric and mark on the wrong side of your fabric. Do the same thing on the right side. The space between these two marks should be the same as the width of your back.

Make sure the hot water is on.,

Understand what makes a towel a good towel.,
Consider the content of the towel fabric.,
Do your own testing.,
Shop around.",How to Identify and Choose High Quality Bath Towels," For starters, towels for different purposes will benefit from different fabrics, whether they're for drying your body or drying your dishes. Things to keep in mind include:

Absorbency is created by maximizing surface area. Cotton towels are best for hands and bodies, while linen towels are best for dishes and glassware.
Terry is the most absorbent of all weaves. It is an ideal towel for hand and body drying as it is looped both sides, thus increasing its surface area.
Crash linen is a combination of linen, cotton and rayon that works really well for drying dishes. It helps to increase the evaporation rate.
Damask linen works really well for drying glasses and dishes where lint-free results matter.
Flax derived linen is super absorbent, and strong. It is naturally resistant to bacteria, won't leave lint on glassware, and absorbs 20 percent of its own weight in water.



 

;
, High quality towels are usually made out of fine, long cotton fiber. Some of the more expensive towels are made from Egyptian or Brazilian cotton. While hard to find, Supima cotton is another excellent choice of long fiber cotton that is grown in the United States.

, In store, try feeling and looking at towels to see if they match up to your needs and wants.

Look closely. Do the fibers stand up like grass in a garden? That's a good sign! If they're flat as a tack, they won't feel very good or work that well.
Feel them. Are they soft? Or are they rough? If the towel has a soft, velvety feel and a bit of weight to it, it is good quality. If the towel is scratchy, or feels like canvas, it is low quality (meaning, don't buy the dollar-store towels!).
Check the size. If you're tall or large, look for bath sheets which are bigger than the average towel size and make drying yourself quickly a lot easier.

Look for the best deals. Decide how much you want to pay. If you want the very best quality, it will cost you more. On the plus side though, more expensive towels will also last longer, so you save money in the long run and don't have to replace them as often.
Find towels that are the same color as your bathroom décor. Keep in mind that colored towels will eventually fade. White towels can always be bleached if needed to whiten them back up.

Take a nice warm shower as you usually would.

,
Leave warm towels outside of the shower.

,
A few minutes before you get out, slowly turn the water down, so it's cooler.

Right before getting out of the shower, open the shower door.",How to Keep Warm After Showering in Winter5," You will feel a slight chill, but once you get out of the shower, you'll barely feel the cold. Another way to do this is to leave the door slightly ajar during the whole shower––this will even the temperature for you both in and out of the shower.


This method may steam up the bathroom quickly if you don't have a good ventilation system.

, Most bar soaps are fine to use. Body washes are also acceptable as long as they don't leave a residue. You may add soap to one of the basins to create a bowl of warm, soapy water for washing, or keep the soap separate and apply it directly to the patient's skin.


Avoid using soap that has exfoliating beads or other substances that could end up staying on the patient's skin and causing irritation.
No-rinse soaps are available at drug stores. This is a convenient solution for a quicker cleanse, but they leave a residue so you'll still need to rinse the patient's body from time to time.

, If you plan to shampoo the patient's hair, you'll need shampoo that's easy to rinse out (such as baby shampoo) and a special basin designed for washing hair in bed. You can find one at a medical supply store, and it's a big help when it comes to washing hair in bed without getting water everywhere.


If you don't have a special basin, you can make do by placing an extra towel or two under the patient's head to protect the bed from getting too wet.

, At minimum you'll need three large towels and two washcloths, but it's nice to have extra in case there's a spill or the supplies get soiled.It's convenient to stack towels, washcloth, the water basins and soap on a portable cart, such as a TV cart, so you can keep everything you need close to the bed.

, This will prevent the bed from getting wet and keep the patient comfortable during the process. To place the towels under the patient, lift the patient onto their side and scoot the towel under, then carefully lower the patient and do the same on the other side.

, This will ensure the patient stays warm during the bath as well as providing some privacy. The sheet or towel will stay on the patient's body the whole time.


Be sure to adjust the temperature in the room if necessary, to prevent the patient from getting a chill.

, Fold down the sheet or towel, uncovering the patient's top half, and remove their shirt. Replace the sheet over the top half of the patient. Fold the sheet back from the patient's legs and remove their pants and underwear. Recover the patient with the sheet.Try to keep as much of the patient covered as possible while you're removing the clothes.
Keep in mind that this process can be embarrassing for some people, so try to work quickly and with a purposeful attitude.

, First apply soap or soapy water to the patient's skin. Scrub it gently with a washcloth to remove dirt and bacteria, then place the washcloth in the soapy basin. Dip a second washcloth into the rinsing basin and use it to rinse away the soap. Pat the area dry with a towel.


Remember to rotate between the two washcloths: use one for soaping and one for rinsing. If the cloths become soiled, switch to clean ones.
Replace the water in the basins as necessary.

, Gently wash the patient's face, ears and neck with soapy water. Rinse away the soap with a separate washcloth. Dry the cleansed area with a towel.

, Gently lift their head into the shampooing basin. Wet the hair by pouring water over the patient's head, taking care not to get it in their eyes. Apply shampoo, then rinse it away. Pat the hair dry with a towel.

, Fold over the sheet on the left side of the body down to the hip. Place a towel beneath the exposed arm. Wash and rinse the patient's shoulder, underarm, arm and hand. Dry the wet areas with a towel.


Dry the washed areas thoroughly, especially the underarm, to prevent chafing and bacteria growth.
Recover with the sheet to keep the patient warm.

, Fold over the sheet to expose the right side. Place the towel beneath the other arm and repeat, washing, rinsing and drying the right shoulder, underarm, arm and hand.


Dry the washed areas thoroughly, especially the underarm, to prevent chafing and bacteria growth.
Recover with the sheet to keep the patient warm.

, Fold the sheet down to the waist and gently wash and rinse the chest, stomach and sides. Be sure to wash carefully among any folds in the patient's skin, since bacteria tends to get trapped there. Dry the torso carefully, especially among the folds.


Recover the patient with the sheet to keep the patient warm.

, Uncover the patient's right leg up to the waist, and wash, rinse and dry the leg and foot. Recover the right leg and uncover the left, then wash, rinse and dry the leg and foot. Recover the lower half of the body.

, Since approximately half the patient's body is now clean, it's a good time to refill the water.

, You may have to assist the person. Make sure they are not too close to the edge of the bed.

, Fold the sheet over to expose the entire back side of the patient. Wash, rinse and dry the back of the patient's neck, back, buttocks and parts of the legs you may have missed.

, Put on latex gloves if desired. Lift the person's leg and wash from front to back. Use a clean washcloth to rinse the area. Be sure to clean thoroughly between folds, and dry the area thoroughly as well.


Males should be washed behind the testicles. Wash female's labia, but there's no need to clean the vagina.This part of the body should be washed every day, even when you're not giving a full-body bed bath.

, When you're finished, dress the patient in clean clothes or a robe. First replace the patient's shirt, keeping the sheet over his or her legs. Then remove the sheet and replace the person's underwear and pants.

Turn on the shower in advance.,
Get your toiletries ready.,
Set up a reward for yourself.,
Turn on a short playlist.,
Turn on a five minute timer.",How to Get a Shower Done in 5 Minutes or Less (Girls)1," If you’re trying to cut your shower time, you can start before you even get in the water. If it takes a long time to get the warm water running, turn the water on a minute or so in advance.Instead of standing around and waiting for the shower to warm up, you can brush your teeth, plan your outfit, or do other things to pass the time so that your waiting time doesn’t feel like part of your shower.;
, A good way to ensure that you don’t waste time in your shower is to get organized. If you have a lot of products crowding your shower rack, pick out the toiletries that you use on a regular basis and place them an in easily accessible part of your shower., One thing that can motivate you to speed up your shower is to set up a post-shower reward. This can be effective tool because getting out of a warm shower is easier if there is something there to motivate you.Sometimes the dread of feeling the cold air can make you dilly dally in the shower. If your house is cold, make sure you have a warm clothes waiting for you when you get out.
You can also set up coffee to brew or hot chocolate to heat up while you are taking your shower as motivation to get out.

, A shower playlist is a great way to time your shower in a low-pressure and fun way. Put together a playlist that is five minutes long or a few seconds within 5 minutes. This playlist will help you pace your shower so you know roughly how much time you have left.Try to pick upbeat music as opposed to sad, slow songs. Listening to slow songs while showering can make you move in a slower pace while you shower.

, If you want to take timing your shower one step further, turn on a stopwatch or a cooking timer right as you start the shower and keep it in an easily accessible place next to the shower.You can also use a waterproof clock or wristwatch so that you can prop it up in the shower and keep your eye on it.
If you don’t have a waterproof clock, place it on the sink or somewhere that you can see it if you pull back the shower curtain. This way you can check on the time if you want to during the shower.

"
"
Set up a firm routine.,
Do two things at once.,
Use a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner.,
Time each shower routine.,
Turn down the water temperature.",How to Get a Shower Done in 5 Minutes or Less (Girls)2," Having a regular shower routine can keep you at a steady pace and on schedule. Try to do your shower activities in the same order so that you don’t even have to hesitate or think about what you are doing., Try to maximize the time that you have in the shower by consolidating some of your shower activities! For instance, you apply and rub shampoo into your hair, then wash your body while you let the shampoo cleanse your hair. Once you finish washing, you can rinse the shampoo out of your hair and then apply your conditioner, then multitask in a similar way while the conditioner soaks into your hair., Shampooing and conditioning your hair is often what takes the largest chunk of time in the shower, especially if you have particularly long hair. To cut the time it takes to wash your hair, use a two-in-one shampoo and conditioner. These products can be equally as effective as using two separate products, and they can shave off a significant amount of time from your shower., Another great way to keep on schedule is to decide roughly how long you want to spend on each shower activity. For instance, you may decide to spend two minutes applying shampoo and washing your body, one minute rinsing out your shampoo and applying conditioner, and two minutes finishing washing your body and rinsing out your conditioner.

, If you’re really serious about shortening the time of your shower, consider turning down the temperature of the water midway through the shower. A hot, luxurious shower can be difficult to get out of, but if you turn down the water temperature to a temperature that is not as comfortable, it can be a powerful motivation to get out quicker.Never turn the water to a temperature that is too uncomfortable. Instead, turn the water from hot to lukewarm, rather than freezing.

"
Don’t wash your hair every shower.,
Save activities for after the shower.,
Shave the night before or after your shower.",How to Get a Shower Done in 5 Minutes or Less (Girls)3," If you shower every day, remember that it’s not necessary to wash your hair during every shower. In fact, most experts agree that most people do not need to wash their hair every day, and that daily washings can strip essential oils from your hair that keep your hair and scalp healthy.Unless you have a very oily scalp or exercise and sweat a significant amount, you probably don’t need to wash your hair every day. Try to wash every other day instead.
Not washing your hair can cut your showering time significantly, even by half.
To keep your hair fresh in between washes, you can use a dry shampoo to minimize oil. Though dry shampoo can be helpful occasionally between washes, you shouldn't depend on it to take the place of actually washing your hair., Some people wash their face or even brush their teeth in the shower. These are both things that you can do outside the shower so that you don’t waste your precious shower time. Brush your teeth either before or after taking the shower, and wash your face directly after the shower as opposed to before since the heat of the water helps to open up your pores., Shaving your legs and underarms can take a long time, especially if you do a careful and thorough job. Instead of shaving while you are in the shower, consider shaving the night before.To shave the night before, sit at the edge of your shower and wet your legs, underarms, or wherever else you may regularly shave with warm water. Apply shaving cream and shave carefully, adding water or shaving cream to any dry areas as needed.
Shaving while sitting down can allow you to do a better and more thorough job than you might do while in the shower while you are standing.

Choose the onsen.,
Prepare for attending the onsen.,
Put on the yukata.,
Enter the onsen.,
Enter the shower area.,
Find a stall.,
Try the baths.,
Return to the dressing area when done.",How to Follow Proper Etiquette at an Onsen in Japan," The following options may apply:


If you wish to stay at a hotel that features an onsen, try to stay at a hotel with a ryotemburi or outdoor onsen.  
You may also go to an onsen where you pay a fee to get in.;
, You may want to leave jewelry items behind, or at least carry a small bag with you to put them in. You will not need to take shampoo, conditioner or soaps with you. Hair dryers, small brushes and combs are supplied as well, sometimes lotions and face soaps too. You can take a toothbrush with you, or for women, any special facial soap you use. A scrunchie is useful for keeping your hair up if it's long.


Wait at least 30 minutes after eating, before heading to the onsen.

, If you are in a hotel, prepare by dressing in a yukata (cotton kimono). Wear the yukata with the left side on top.  An easy way to remember is you should have a 'pocket' to place your right hand in on your left chest. If you wear it the other way, you will be wearing it in the style of a dead person, so avoid doing so.


Be sure to wear underwear under the yukata.

, Pay or leave a room number at the entry. Enter from the proper side; men and women will be separated––sometimes the entry is obviously marked with pink and blue curtains. You will be given a small (long and narrow) towel, this and your locker key will be the only things you carry in with you to the bathing area (unless you have a toothbrush and face soap). Find a locker, usually with a basket inside.


Sometimes the keys are a piece of wood, but the keys usually have a band so that you can wear it on your wrist. 
Remove all clothing, and jewelry. If you have long hair, you may want to take a scrunchie (see below).

, You will see rows of faucet and shower head stations, each stocked with a small stool, a plastic bowl, shampoo and other amenities. These areas are known as 'stalls,' although there may be no dividing walls. 

, If the bowl has been moved, or you see a small towel or razor out, that stall might be taken. Make sure you choose a stall that is freshly prepared or untouched. 


The bowl is for filling and dumping water on yourself to rinse, or you can just use the shower head.
The faucet will have two things to control: One is to make the water come out of the faucet or shower head, the other is to control the temperature, marked in Celsius, but usually color coded from blue to red. This is where you clean yourself up from head to toe.
If you do not want to wash your hair, that is okay.
If you brought personal items with you, you can leave them in the stall while you go to soak (if it is not too busy).

, Some places have more than one bath. Many relax in the indoor tub first and then go outside, especially nice in the winter. Choose a tub and step in; importantly, your hair should not enter the bath. This is why you might want a scrunchie to hold long hair up in a bun. You can also use the long towel to wrap around your head to keep hair up. You may see others letting their hair go in the water, but not often, as etiquette says you don't.  


This is a place for relaxing, do not splash. After you get out of the tub, wipe off excess water before moving to the next area.

, Put your undies and yukata back on. There are vanity areas with mirrors and blow dryers, to do your finishing touches. This is where you will find the skin lotions. Sometimes there are even massage chairs!

Cover the mirror.,
Use a washcloth.,
Bathe with parts of your clothes on.,
Bathe in exercise clothes.,
Treat yourself!,
Get sweaty.",How to Combat Dysphoria While Bathing," While it might seem difficult and dangerous, you likely know your own shower well enough that you would be able to find the soap with the lights off. Try turning them off right before getting undressed.


The first few times you try this, you could have a (preferably waterproof) flashlight nearby. If you need it, you can use it for a few seconds to find things.
Put the things that you need in a different corner of the shower before you turn the lights off for ease of finding it.;
, If you feel discomfort at the sight of your body, covering the mirror can be a big help. Use a towel, sheet, shirt or (if possible) turn the mirror around. If the top of your mirror is clean, you could potentially use any of the bath towels in the room.

, Washcloths provide a barrier between your hand and your body, preventing you from feeling what you are touching as much.

, Leave underwear on, or a bra. Getting partly clean is much better than getting not clean at all.

, They are thin and you can wash yourself through them. They can even act a bit like a washcloth, helping the soap to lather, although it may be harder to rinse out.

, Get some nice bath products, like bubble bath, bath bombs, or nice smelling soap and shampoo, and make bathing a time to make yourself happy. Find products that you like, and use those. If you can look forward to bath time for a different reason, the dysphoria will be easier to deal with.

, Go for a long run, or work out hard enough that by the time you're done, you're mentally and physically exhausted. A quick shower may be easier to bear when you're thinking more about sore muscles and how smelly you are than anything else.

Be sure to turn down your hot water heater to the accepted safety range of 120 degrees to 130 degrees Fahrenheit after your sauna to avoid burns and scalding.;
, You should choose the smallest bathroom in the house, because it will be easier to trap the heat and steam in there than in a larger room.Since you want to recreate the high temperature environment of a sauna as much as possible, choose a bathroom that is in a warmer area of your house if you can.

, Nothing can ruin your relaxation faster than looking around and seeing dirty laundry or messy countertops. Wipe down all of the surfaces in your bathroom and remove any extra clutter or dirty clothes and towels from the room.


Store necessities like cotton balls and Q-tips in simple, coordinated baskets or canisters reminiscent of a high-end spa., You can recreate the relaxing ambiance of a sauna or spa environment with the removal of harsh light and the calming scents of a vanilla, lavender, or lemon candle.


Other aromatherapy scents that may calm you include rose geranium, chamomile, and clary sage.If you don’t want to deal with candles, aromatherapy oils can be placed in the tub or in a diffuser. Essential oils in a variety of fragrances, including jasmine, rose, and sandalwood, are widely available.

, To keep as much steam as possible in your bathroom, you also need to cover up cracks and shut the door to your linen closet, if there is one in your bathroom.

, Place rolled up thick, heavy towels along the bottom of your bathroom door. This is especially important when the weather is cold outside.


If there is a closet inside your bathroom, place rolled towels along the bottom of that door as well.

Keep a clean towel handy.,
Dry your hair.,
Pat your skin dry.,
Make sure you are completely dry.,
Apply ointment or cream to lock in the moisture which was absorbed during your shower.",How to Dry Yourself After a Shower1," You may not like to think about it, but your bathroom towel is one of the most bacteria-ridden items in your home. Bacteria grows on organic material and in damp places, making your bathroom towel a perfect breeding ground for the bacteria it collects from your skin. Spreading this bacteria can lead to skin infections and illness. Follow these steps to take care of your towels:Never share towels with other members of the household.
Wash towels at least once per week or every 3-4 uses. If you are showering after athletics or a physically demanding job, wash them more often.
Wash towels at high heat.
Use bleach when possible to kill bacteria.
Replace towels as soon as they begin to fade or smell musty.;
, Squeeze the water out of your hair before stepping out of the shower. Avoid rubbing a towel on your hair, which could damage it and cause frizziness. Consider a separate towel for your hair. It is best to use a microfiber towel, or even a t-shirt. For long hair you can roll it into a turban.


Hold your head upside down.
Place the long side of the towel along the base of your head at the hairline.
Close the towel around your hair and gather it at the top of your forehead.
Twist the towel until it has gathered all of your hair and shortened the length of the towel, usually two or three turns.
Take this tail you have created over the top of your head and tuck the tail into the edge of the towel at the base of your head.

, Aggressively rubbing your body with a towel can cause friction and irritation to your skin. Dry skin can flake off and patches of dry skin can spread. Instead, pat or blot your skin gently.Start at the top of your body and work your way down to your toes.

, Harsh tap water can be damaging to the skin. The metals in the water attach to free radicals, which attack the collagen in our skin. This can be the cause of lines in your face and clogged pores.Make sure that you absorb as much as possible before you hang your towel up to dry. If you are concerned about hard water, you my also consider installing a filtration system in your shower.

, Ointments and creams are superior to moisturizer and less likely to cause irritation. Just after showering is the best time to optimize this solution to dry skin.

, Taking off these items can help you relax even further.Your jewelry could become uncomfortably warm in your sauna environment.
Glasses will become foggy and will be relatively useless while you enjoy your sauna.

, You are now ready to experience your sauna at home.


Have the hot handle turned as high as possible.
You can either turn on the lower faucet or use the shower to fill the tub.
If you’re using aromatherapy oils, you can put a few drops in the tub. The scent will disperse throughout the room.
Keep your shower curtain or door open to let the heat and steam fill the room.

, If your hot water runs out before this time, turn off the water. You don't want to dilute the steam with cooler water.

, You can lean over slightly to inhale steam that may be coming off the water of a filled tub.


This is a good time to close your eyes and detach from everything.
The Finnish sauna tradition promotes well-being and relaxation, so try to use this time to decrease your own stress level., This will help gradually lower your body temperature.

If you have long hair, wring it out a couple of times before moving on. It’s no secret that heat and friction cause damage to our hair. Allowing it to air dry will lead to healthier locks.

, Beginning at the top of your body and working you way down, use your hands to gently whisk away the water from your skin. Do the best you can to get every last droplet. If you have a lot of body hair, it is helpful to swipe the opposite direction of the hair growth the release the water from the hair.

, You can do this with an actual fan, a towel, or a hair dryer. This could take a few minutes if you are doing it by hand.To speed things up, try to release the moisture from the room by opening the door or turning on the bathroom fan. Hair dryers and fans are especially helpful for the hard to reach areas and areas with dense amounts of body hair, like armpits and groins.

Fructose and glucose are hard on the liver, and consuming too much can lead to obesity and diseases such as diabetes.It may be difficult to completely avoid sugar, but you can start by limiting your intake of candy, sugary baked goods, juice and soda, and granulated sugar used to sweeten tea and coffee. Satisfy your sweet tooth by consuming whole fruits, rather than fruit juice.
Artificial sweeteners. Sugar substitutes actually lead to more sugar cravings, and can end up having an adverse effect on the body.Stop drinking diet drinks and other artificially-sweetened foods.
Saturated fats. Many fats are essential to your body's health, but saturated fats found in fried and processed foods are toxic. Limit fast food, processed snack foods, and food that is served in restaurants.
Caffeine. Some studies show that drinking a few cups of coffee a day is actually good for you, but when you're focusing on cleansing your body, it's best to eliminate all unnecessary substances.
Alcohol. Moderate alcohol consumption usually won't harm your health, but drinking too much causes weight gain, water retention and liver disease. Stay away from alcohol when you're focusing on cleansing your body.

, Fiber helps your digestive system function normally. Without it, your body isn't easily able to eliminate waste. During a cleanse, when you want to rid your body of toxins, its especially important to eat fiber at every meal.Eat fruits and vegetables such as green beans, cauliflower, potatoes, and apples.
Eat beans and other legumes that are high in fiber.
Whole grains like oats and wheat bran are also good sources of fiber.

Spinach, broccoli and seaweed all have high levels of chlorophyll.
Watercress, which looks like tiny spinach leaves, has been found to repair cell damage.Kale, turnip greens and swiss chard are excellent sources of vitamins K, A and C."

Try a juice fast.,
Consider intermittent fasting.",How to Cleanse Your Body2," Juice fasts cleanse the body by eliminating food that's hard to digest or toxic and providing the body with nutrients exclusively from fresh-squeezed fruits and vegetables. A juice fast can last anywhere from 2 days to over 2 months, and many report that it leaves the body feeling refreshed and energized.


To complete a juice fast, make your own juice with a juicer. Juicers quickly squeeze the juice (and nutrients) from fruits, vegetables and herbs. Without this machine, juice fasting would require hours of prep work.
Buy spinach, kale, apples, pears, lemons, carrots, ginger, and other watery fruits and vegetables to juice.
Make enough juice in the morning to last you all day long. You should plan on having 6 to 8 glasses of juice per day to keep your hunger at bay.

, Taking a break from eating food for half a day or up to 36 hours helps detoxify your body by creating the right conditions for autophagy, in which cells get rid of damaged molecules, to occur.Intermittent fasting boosts energy in the short-term and may help prevent obesity and neurological diseases.Start by skipping lunch and dinner on a day when you don't have plans that require you to expend a lot of energy. Go to bed hungry and break your fast in the morning with a glass of water and a light breakfast.
Work up to fasting for longer periods of time. As your body grows more used to fasting, your hunger pangs and cravings won't be as strong.

Lift weights. Weight training keeps your body strong and toned, improving your overall health. Incorporate 2 or 3 days of weight training into your exercise routine.
Don't exercise too much during juice fasts and intermittent fasts. Burning too many calories when you aren't taking calories in may cause you to feel weak or faint.

, Yoga is said to detoxify the body by facilitating the removal of lactic acid, carbon dioxide and lymphatic fluids from the system. Deep stretches and proper breathing techniques stimulate the circulatory, digestive and lymphatic systems, each of which contribute to waste elimination.Try the downward facing dog pose, which aids in blood circulation by placing the heart higher than the head.

If your stress seems unmanageable, consider seeing a therapist for help. A therapist will be able to teach you effective stress management techniques.

Stop shaving, tweezing, waxing, or removing the hair in the affected area.,
Keep the skin moisturized.",How to Treat Infected Ingrown Hair1," If ingrown hairs become chronic and you try to use some object to dig out the ingrown hair, scars can form.

This will increase the risk of a scar forming and can increase the risk of spreading the infection.;
, You need to hold off will all hair removal in the area until the infection is cleared.Ingrown hairs appear to form when the hair is cut at or below the level of the skin, leaving a sharp edge to the hair which then grows sideways into the skin.Continuing to remove hair from the area could result in additional ingrown hairs or further irritation to the infected area, both of which you want to avoid.

, Make sure you are not over-drying your skin. Use a bit of moisturizer on the infected hair after every treatment. This can help soften the skin and can reduce the risk of skin damage and scarring."
"
Soak an infected hair.,
Use a topical (skin) antibiotic.,
Contact your doctor if the condition worsens.,
Follow your doctor's treatment advice.",How to Treat Infected Ingrown Hair2," Soak a clean washcloth with very warm water and it place over the infected area. Leave it on for three to five minutes, or until the washcloth cools down. Repeat this process at least three to four times twice a day. The heat may cause the infection to “come to a head” and drain.


An advantage to this approach is that it minimizes the chances of scarring.
Use a clean, fresh washcloth every time and make certain you wash your hands before and after applying. Doing this can prevent any further bacteria entering the skin at that site.

, Before you apply an antibiotic wash and dry the area thoroughly. Topical antibiotics usually contain three different antibiotics and they can come in a gel, cream, or lotion form. The specific antibiotics can vary, but usually include Bacitracin, Neomycin and Polymixin.


Use as directed and make certain you wash your hands before and after applying.
You may wish to do a spot-test first, as some people react unfavorably to topical antibiotics. Apply the antibiotic to a small area of skin (the skin on your wrist is good if you plan to apply the ointment somewhere with delicate skin, such as your pubic area) and check to make sure you don't develop a rash or other adverse reaction.

, If you don’t see any improvement within five to seven days or if the infection seems to be getting worse or spreading, contact your physician or dermatologist for an appointment. Your doctor may need to open up the skin in order to release the infection.Don't try to open up the infection yourself at home. A doctor knows how to make incisions correctly, will use sterile equipment, such as a clean scalpel, and will do it in a sterile environment.

, Your doctor may tell you to let the infection heal naturally or will prescribe you medicine. He or she may prescribe a prescription oral antibiotic, a retinoid to remove dead skin and discoloration around the ingrown hair, or a steroid medicine to apply directly to the infected area. Follow the directions on the medicine closely. You should always continue using medicine for as long as you are told to, even if the problem goes away before you are done with the prescription.
Your doctor may also give you suggestions for preventing future ingrown hairs.

Use antibacterial essential oils to treat skin infections.,
Use some “spot exfoliation” to help remove the ingrown hair.,
Use honey as both an antibacterial and to help draw out any infection.Manuka honey is the one that has been most extensively tested, but any organic honey may be useful.",How to Treat Infected Ingrown Hair3," You can use a Q-tip or a cotton ball to apply your chosen essential oil directly on the infected ingrown hair, but if you have sensitive skin, you may need to dilute the oil with a ""carrier oil"" like coconut oil (especially with oils like tea tree, which can be particularly harsh on the skin). You can leave the essential oil on or rinse it off with warm water after at least 30 minutes. Find a homeopath to assist you in choosing which oil will be best for you. Some essential oils to try include:Tea tree oil
Eucalyptus
Peppermint oil
Orange oil
Garlic oil
Clove oil
Lime oil
Rosemary oil
Geranium oil
Lemon oil

, Mix ½ teaspoon of baking soda or sea salt with 1–2 tablespoons (14.8–29.6 ml) of olive oil, which has antibacterial properties of its own. Use a Q-tip or cotton ball to apply the mixture to the infected ingrown hair.


Use the tip of one or two fingers to gently rub in the exfoliating mixture using circular motions. First rub in using three to five clockwise motions and then reverse, using three to five counterclockwise motions. Rinse off with warm water and pat dry. Wash your hands and put the towel in with the laundry to prevent spreading the infection. Repeat twice a day.
Remember to be very gentle and to use gentle, circular motions to dislodge the hair. Scars can form after particularly vigorous exfoliation because exfoliation can irritate and damage already sensitive skin.
Also keep in mind that infections take time to heal. If the ingrown hair appears to be getting better, continue treatment until it is resolved. If it is not improving, see your medical provider.

, Use a cotton swab to apply the honey onto the infected ingrown hair and allow it to remain for five to 10 minutes. Rinse off with warm water and pat dry — wash your hands and put the towel in with the laundry to prevent spreading the infection. Repeat twice a day.

Weigh the benefits of each method.,
Carefully research locations, practitioners, and prices.,
Have realistic expectations.",How to Remove Your Mustache (for Girls)1," Both of these have the potential to be permanent solutions (after enough treatments) and can help people whose lip hair is due to hormonal imbalances, for example.


During electrolysis, a tiny needle is inserted into the hair follicle, where it creates a current that kills the root of the hair. It’s a tedious, one-hair-at-a-time process – that needs to be repeated many times – but since the upper lip is a tiny area, this won’t matter as much.
During laser-hair removal, a laser is used to zap many hair follicles at once and kill hair at the root. You need fewer sessions than with electrolysis, but it’s significantly more expensive. Because the lasers are best at targeting dark hairs that stand out against light skin, it’s not ideal for dark-skinned or light-haired people.;
, Some places have better machines, more qualified specialists (always make sure they’re licensed), and happier reviews than others. Never choose a location based on their testimonials.

, While laser hair removal and electrolysis can have permanent effects and work wonders for some people, they can also be painful and are not guaranteed for everyone. Moreover, the treatments can be painful and expensive. If possible, talk to other people who’ve had it done for their insights.

Apply a gentle cream afterwards (optional).",How to Remove Your Mustache (for Girls)2," Depilatory creams painlessly cause hair to fall out from the root, but because the chemicals involved in this process are harsh, it’s best to select a cream designed for delicate facial skin.

, Apply a small dab to a sensitive but safe area (such as the skin of your inner wrist) to make sure you don’t react. Leave on for the recommended amount of time (read the box for instructions), wash away thoroughly, and wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure you don’t itch or turn red.

, You can do this with gloves if you prefer, but since the cream needs time to take effect, you can also use you bare hands and then wash thoroughly with soap and water.

, When possible, it’s better to use it for less time to prevent your skin from becoming irritated. If it’s not ready, wait a little longer.

, Use a paper towel or cotton pads

, Rinse more than you think you need to so that no residue will irritate your skin. If some hairs do not come off easily, just try rubbing them gently with water. If that doesn't work, take a bath. The steam coming from the bath should make tough hairs come out on their own.

,, On the one hand, the area may feel dry and in need of a little TLC, but on the other, using too much product on already-irritated skin might cause the pores to clog. Choose based on how comfortable your skin feels when the process is over.

Waxing is only possible if the hairs are long enough for the wax to catch on. If you aren’t willing to let your hairs grow long enough to do this, either look for a short-hair wax (some claim to be able to wax as little as 2mm of growth, though their effectiveness varies) or use another option listed here (such as bleaching).

, The warmer your skin, the more open your pores – and the easier the hairs will be to remove.

, Most waxes must be warmed up, but wax strips are sometimes the exception. Read the instructions on your box for explicit details.

, Use the applicator that comes with the kit to spread it carefully, avoiding the delicate skin on your lips.

, Start on one side and smooth it firmly over the entire area, avoiding folds and air pockets.

,, It will take the wax and your hair with it, but be forewarned that it will almost certainly hurt the first few times you try it. Don’t rip it off slowly or in several motions; this will make things worse.

, Make sure not to leave any residue.

, If your upper lip is still sore from the waxing, you may want to wait a while before doing this.

Choose an epilator that’s appropriate for facial hair.,
Take a hot shower, steam your face over a bowl, or wash your face in warm water.,
Hide your lips by pressing them together.,
Slowly run the epilator over the skin above your upper lip.,
Manually pluck any hairs you missed.",How to Remove Your Mustache (for Girls)4," An epilator is a hand-held device that pulls hairs up by the root when moved across skin. The plucking heads on a body epilator will be too cumbersome to use on the upper lip, so you’ll have to shop around for a slim model designed for facial hair, touchups, and other small-scale work


Epilating is only possible if the hairs are long enough for the epilator to catch. If you aren’t willing to let your hairs grow long enough to do this, use another option listed here (such as bleaching).

, The warmer your skin, the more open your pores – and the easier the hairs will be to remove.

, This will not only make the skin above the lip easier to access, but also keep your delicate lip skin away from the epilator.

, Unless you’re very used to plucking these hairs, be warned that it will probably hurt. You will get used to this with time, but in the beginning, it will be uncomfortable.


Start with the slowest speed. Until you get the hang of epilating, just remember that easy does it.

, If your upper lip is sore, you may want to wait a while before doing this.

Find some strong thread.,
Snip about 20 inches (51 cm) (a foot and a half) of thread.,
Tie the two ends of the thread together.,
Now hold the thread with both hands, and wind it around ten times.,
Place the thread around the fingers of both hands.,
Practice the above motions until you feel fairly comfortable with the movements of your hands.,
Once you are comfortable, its time to start practicing on real hair!,
Sitting on your bed or on a chair, prop up one leg and identify the portion from which you want to remove hair.

,
Place the thread on this portion.,
Now, move the wound portion to the other side, making sure that it catches the hair while moving.,
Be patient.,
Once you are comfortable, move onto your upper lip or other parts of your face that need to be threaded.

,
Avoid doing this on your eyebrows unless you are absolutely confident in your abilities.",How to Thread Hair," You do not need a special type of thread. Use white thread because its easier to see the hair you thread out.;
, This does not need to be exact. You can experiment with different lengths as you become more comfortable with the technique.

, A simple knot will suffice as long as the ends don't come apart (here's a quick one- remember the first knot you make when tying your shoelaces? just make that about 2-3 times with the two ends of the thread).

, The wound bit now lies in the center of the circle.

, Push the wound portion towards one hand by widening the fingers of one hand and simultaneously closing the fingers of the other hand (if you're doing this right, your hands will appear to be having a respectful, mock ""conversation"" with each other. When one hand ""talks"" the other will be quiet and vice versa).

, Usually, a smaller length of thread is easier to work with when you are still practicing your hand movements.

, My suggestion would be to practice on your leg since most people have hair on their legs that can be seen/reached easily.

,, Let the wound part be one end of the hair, and the thread from the other side should be on both sides of the hair you want to remove.

, It will then lift the hair from the root as it moves back and forth.

, This will require lots of practice!

,, Remember, your eyebrows are less forgiving of errors than any other parts of your body.

Choose a cream bleach for facial hair.,
Spot-test the cream.,
Wash your face.

,
Apply the bleach to your mustache area.,
Wait most of the recommended time, then wipe away a small amount to test if it has worked.,
Wipe away the remaining cream.,
Thoroughly rinse your skin.",How to Remove Your Mustache (for Girls)5," Cream bleach is appropriate for lightening hairs that are not completely black, just dark. It lasts for up to 2 weeks. Be sure to only choose bleach that is recommended for use on the face; since the skin here is so sensitive, you have to be extra careful to avoid irritation.


If applicable, choose a cream that suits your skin type (ex. dry, oily, etc.).

, Apply a small dab to a sensitive but safe area (such as the skin of your inner wrist) to make sure you don’t react. Leave on for the recommended amount of time (read the box for instructions), wash away thoroughly, and wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure you don’t itch or turn red.

,, The cream should come with an applicator, but if it doesn’t, use a popsicle stick or put on gloves and use a finger. Be very careful not to get it on your lip itself or near the delicate skin in your nostrils, which can cause your skin to react.

, Use a Q-tip or cotton pad to wipe the cream away (wipe away from your nose/mouth, not toward them) and check to see if the hair is light. If not, wait a little longer.


Ideally, bleaching cream should not be used on the skin for more than 10 minutes because it’s so hard on the skin. If your cream recommends more time than this, test it at the 10-minute mark anyway; if it has worked, remove the rest.

, Again, use cotton pads or something similar to wipe up the cream and don’t get it on any sensitive areas.

, Rinse more than you think you need to so that no residue will irritate your skin.

Use depilatory cream.,
Try hair removal pads.,
Try threading.,
Try tweezing.,
Try waxing.,
Try sugaring.,
Try an epilator.",How to Remove Hair Without Shaving1," Depilatory creams are products that remove hair by dissolving it at the skin's surface.Usually, these products come in a lotion or shampoo-like bottle and are sold at pharmacies like Walgreens, etc. for fairly cheap. If you use this method, check the ingredients when shopping to make sure that you aren't sensitive and make sure to always follow the directions on the label.



Pros: Doesn't hurt. Easy to use.

Cons: Requires frequent use (hair grows back at normal speed). Can smell bad.

Notes: For best results, apply after bathing when hair is softest. Don't use products labeled for body use on the face — these can be made from harsher chemicals.See our depilatory article for more information.;
, Another product that's useful for getting rid of unwanted hair is the aptly-named hair removal pad. This product basically works like a small handheld buffer: you rub the rough surface against the skin with short, quick movements and moderate pressure and hair is gently rubbed out. The area that the pad can ""buffer"" at one time is small, making this method best for small patches of hair.Pros: Doesn't hurt when used correctly. No soreness afterward from lotion, aftershave, etc.

Cons: Time-consuming.

Notes: This product will also abrade the skin, leaving it looking ashen or ""ashy."" You may want to apply lotion afterwards to re-moisturize. Wash and dry pads after use.

, This method of hair removal, which originated centuries ago in Turkey, is gaining popularity worldwide. When someone has unwanted hair ""threaded,"" a ""threader"" gathers the hair in a loop of cotton thread, twists the thread, and plucks it out. With this technique, a good threader can clear a decent amount of hair fairly quickly — 15 minutes for a set of eyebrows is considered good.Pros: Healthier for skin than waxing. Good choice for sensitive skin. Lasts for several weeks.

Cons: Can hurt. Most useful only on flat surfaces (not joints). Can't be done at home.

Notes: Take the time to find a threader with good reviews. An expert threader can make the process much less painful.

, An old, reliable tool for hair removal, a pair of tweezers lets you grab and pluck unwanted hairs individually. This somewhat painful method is usually reserved for removing just a few hairs at a time — much more can be hard to bear.



Pros: Precise — allows you to remove exactly which hairs you want, one at a time.

Cons: Painful. Time-consuming except when plucking just a few hairs. Can cause mild irritation in some individuals.

Notes: Wash tweezers before and after use. See How to Avoid Bumps When Plucking Hair for a guide to minimizing skin irritation during a tweezing session.

, This widely-known hair removal method has a fearsome reputation, but it's often not as bad as it's cracked up to be. Waxing is great for removing stubborn hair from the legs, underarms, bikini area and face (when applied cautiously and gently.)It's also especially good for people with coarse, dark hair that contrasts with their light skin. Waxing can be done by buying kits bought from cosmetics stores or via a professional.



Pros: Removes lots of hair relatively quickly. Lasts for several weeks.

Cons: Painful, though this reduces after the first waxing. Difficult to do at home; professionals can be somewhat expensive.

Notes: If waxing yourself, always apply wax in the direction of hair growth and pull in the direction opposite the hair growth. Follow all directions on the wax packaging, especially when it comes to heating the wax.

, ""Sugaring"" is a method of hair removal that works almost exactly like waxing — a thick liquid mixture is applied to the skin, allowed to set, and pulled off with cloth. The difference is in the ingredients of the mixture: unlike waxing, sugaring uses natural ingredients (often, a honey-like mixture of sugar, lemon juice, and water). This makes it gentler on the skin for some (especially those with allergies).



Pros: Removes lots of hair relatively quickly. Lasts for several weeks. Smaller risk of allergies/irritation. Can be made at home (cautiously).

Cons: Similar pain level to waxing, though this reduces after the first sugaring. Difficult to do at home; professionals can be somewhat expensive.

Notes: See our sugaring article for an at-home recipe and directions for use.

, An epilator is a device that more or less works like an automatic set of tweezers, pulling hairs out with a set of mechanical grabbers. However, unlike tweezers, epilators pull on only the hair — not the skin around it — which makes them less painful to some. Epilators are a good all-around tool, as they work relatively quickly, can be used on many parts of the body, and keep pain to a reasonable level.Pros: Removes lots of hair relatively quickly. Lasts for several weeks. Quicker than tweezing manually. Gentler on the skin for some.

Cons: Some pain, though this reduces after the first use. Requires minor cleaning/maintenance.

Notes: If you can, get a waterproof epilator and remove hairs in the shower when they're softest and easiest to pull out.

Consider laser therapy.,
Consider electrolysis.,
Understand that even these methods can have minor hair regrowth.,
Talk to your doctor before pursuing any ""permanent"" solution.",How to Remove Hair Without Shaving2," Laser hair removal therapy is one of the most common cosmetic procedures performed today.In this procedure, a highly-concentrated beam of light targets individual hair follicles, destroying them. Hair generally stops growing back near-permanently after three to seven sessions.Pros: Quick, relatively painless. Widely available due to popularity.

Cons: Causes pain and redness similar to that of a sunburn for several days. Blisters, temporary discoloration, and other, more painful side effects are possible but rare.Notes: Treated hair falls out over about a month, not immediately. Sunscreen usually recommended to protect the treated area.

Cost: Varies; about $235 per session., In an electrolysis, a small, very thin probe is used to destroy individual hair follicles with a shortwave radio frequency. After, the hair itself is removed with tweezers. This method causes near-permanent hair loss after several treatments. Electrolysis is suitable for most of the body.Pros: Generally very minor discomfort. Short appointments, only a few sessions usually needed.

Cons: Can cause temporary pain and redness.

Notes: Be sure to choose an accredited, certified electrolysis expert. Poor technique can cause additional pain.Cost: Varies; about $25-$150 per hour.

, Unfortunately, for the time being, there is no truly ""permanent"" hair removal method. While the methods above can permanently end hair growth, they won't always have 100% perfect results. After a few years, some minor amount of hair regrowth is possible, so repeat ""touch up"" sessions may be necessary. Be aware of this as you make your decision.

, While both laser therapy and electrolysis are considered by the FDA to be generally safe when performed by a professional, there is a very small (but real) chance of danger with these hair removal procedures and others. For example, in a few isolated cases, individuals who used excessive amounts of face-numbing cream for their laser therapy treatment reportedly experienced life-threatening symptoms.For this reason, it's crucial to discuss these procedures with your doctor before agreeing to undergo them. Only your doctor can tell you for sure which treatments (if any) are safe and appropriate for you.

Decide how much hair you want to remove.,
Clean up down south.,
Trim your hair.,
Wet the skin.,
Apply the nair.,
Give it time to work.,
Rinse off the nair in a test patch.,
Wash off all the nair.,
Moisturize your skin.,
Maintain your bikini.",How to Remove Hair from Your Bikini Area with Nair," Perhaps you have a clear idea of exactly how bare you want to be, or maybe you’re not quite sure. If you’re party to the latter, it is best to figure out exactly what you want. Keep in mind that hair removal can take a lot of time, so if you’re hoping to simply be bathing-suit ready, it may be best to keep the amount you take off to a minimum.


Do you hope to remove just the hair that is exposed outside of your underwear?
Do you want to take off a bit more, and go for the ‘landing strip’ or a sculpted triangle?
Is it your goal to go Brazilian and remove it all?;
, As with all hair removal, you want to make sure that there is nothing that might hinder or slow the process. Additionally, it is good to be hygienic, especially in the nether regions. Take a moment to wash up, removing any loose hairs or dead skin cells. Use an exfoliator to smooth out the skin and open the pores up a bit, making hair removal easier.

, Nair is great because it doesn’t require much effort; just slather on and leave it be. However, it will take a much longer time (and thus be potentially more harmful to you) if your hair is very long and thick. Expedite the nair-ing process by trimming all your hair to about ¼ of an inch. Use a pair of nail or sewing scissors, or use an electric razor specified for use on the bikini.


Even if you don’t intend on removing all the hair in your bikini area, it might be nice to trim it all. This will keep longer hairs from poking out the sides of your panties or bathing suit bottoms.

, Although you can use nair on dry skin, soaking your bikini area with a bit of warm to hot water will open up the hair follicles and make removal easier. Sit in a hot bath for a few minutes or hop in the shower. Towel dry off so that you skin is just damp before applying the nair though, so that it doesn’t just slide off.

, Squeeze some of the cream out onto your fingertips, and spread it over the area of desired hair removal. Spread it only as thick as necessary to cover the root of the strands, but not so thin that you can see your skin through it.


If you are removing all of your hair in the Brazilian style, test a small patch of more sensitive skin prior to slathering your entire pubic area with nair.
Avoid getting any nair inside the vaginal canal or near your rectum; if inserted internally, the nair can cause an infection.

, Have a timer or clock handy, and keep track of how long the nair is on for. The directions on the bottle will likely suggest a time of 3-5 minutes before rinsing.


If at any time the nair causes a burning or stinging sensation, rinse it off with warm water.

, No two people have the same hair, so the 3-5 minute range may be too little or too much time depending on your hair and skin type. Rinse off a small patch of the nair; if most or all of the hair comes off and leaves little to no stubble, you are finished. If your hair is still mostly attached or only a small portion rinses off, then wait a few more minutes before rinsing.


Do not exceed a total of 10 minutes of nair application (no more than an additional 5 minutes after the first 5 minutes).

, Use a steady stream of warm water or a dampened washcloth to wipe away all the nair and hair. Make sure that all of it has been removed, so that you don’t end up burning your skin or getting an infection.

, After putting your skin under so many chemicals, its probably a bit inflamed and dried out. Use a moisturizer for sensitive skin to replenish any lost nutrients and to minimize razor burn.

, One of the benefits of using nair is that it keeps your hair gone for longer than shaving. However, unlike waxing, the grow-back period is anywhere from 3-6 days after the first nair use. Maintain your naked bikini by using nair 1-2 times a week.

Decide on your look.,
Trim electrically.,
Shave it clean off with a razor.",How to Remove Chest Hair1," Shaving is the tried and true method, but there are degrees in its severity. You can utilize a trimmer to manage (or even, dare we say, sculpt) your growth, or use a razor and take the whole of it completely off.


It’s a common misconception that shaving body hair will make it grow back thicker, coarser, darker, faster, and more plentiful, but this is not the case. Shaving cuts the hair, resulting in a blunter tip for the hair (which causes it to feel coarser), but this is not permanent and has no lasting effecting on the follicle.;
, Electric hair trimmers designed specifically for body hair are optimal if you just want to keep your chest hair under control. You should shower before doing any trimming, making sure to scrub your chest clean, and then try out your trimmer once you’re dry. Trimmers come with multiple guards. Don’t be afraid of starting with a longer guard (usually a higher number), then switching to increasingly shorter guards until you find the right length.
Always begin shaving in the same direction as the grain of your hair, and then try running the trimmer against the grain of your hair. If irritation occurs when going against the grain, discontinue for a few days.
Although not necessary, many men prefer to use aftershave or moisturizer afterward to soothe the skin.
Subsequent trims will help you figure out how short you'd like to go, as you'll quickly become aware of the rate of your hair growth and how much upkeep you can handle.

, Spray shaving cream or gel onto your chest, and get to work! Take care around sensitive areas—two obvious ones being your nipples—and run your razor in the same direction that your hair grows. Apply aftershave to soothe your irritated skin, if necessary.


When you opt to take it clean off, however, you're also granted the ""joy"" of maintaining that perfectly smooth chest. There hasn't been a study yet finding chest hair regrowth stubble to be anybody's idea of attractive, and it can be itchy and painful for you while it grows back. Aloe vera can soothe the itch, but you'll have to regularly shave to avoid unsightly stubble. "

Book an appointment at a salon.,

Purchase your wax.,
Apply the wax.,
Rip the strip.",How to Remove Chest Hair2," For first-timers, it might be preferable to put yourself in professional hands. It’s not nearly as rare for men to wax their chests these days, so if it’s any solace, know that you’re not alone.

, It’ll be a big bummer to go through the trouble of waxing all the hair from your chest only to have red, splotchy pecs. Taking care of your skin before it’s waxed will reduce your skin’s recovery time from the procedure, so you should exfoliate the day before. , If you made an appointment, then your part in this done (though you still have a waxing to endure). Otherwise, you’ll need to be picking up a commercial DIY waxing product.


You can also get DIY to the max with it and make your own wax.

, After heating the wax if necessary (some do-it-yourself products are microwavable; check the instructions on yours) you’ll want to apply it to your chest hair. For best results lay it on in the direction your hair grows. Some products use all-in-one applicator strips with wax, whereas others (generally referred to as “hard” waxes) will come with a spatula-like tool for spreading it on.
Your hair needs to be as close to a quarter-inch long as you can get it for the wax to grab hold. If you’re trying wax after a bungled trimming you might need to give your hair a few days to grow, and if you've got an unruly thicket on there you should use a trimmer (or scissors) to cut your chest hair in preparation.

, This is the fun part! If you’re using all-in-one strips, the strip is already on and you can go ahead and remove it. If you’re using hard wax, you’ll want to quickly pull it off once it has hardened enough to be firm, yet still flexible. Remove it in the direction opposite to your hair growth for best results.


After pulling, apply immediate pressure for pain relief.
Different products will recommend different specifics, but care should generally be taken not to re-wax the same area unless specifically instructed to.
Unlike shaving, waxing is removing your hair from the root. It will generally give you a longer-lasting hairlessness (3-6 weeks), but also opens the door to ingrown hairs. "

Ensure you really want that hair gone.,
Prepare for the time commitment.,
Ask your doctor for a referral.",How to Remove Chest Hair3," Electrolysis is a procedure utilizing an incredibly slim needle, which essentially delivers small shocks of electricity to each individual hair follicle. This goes a step beyond waxing and not only removes hair at its root but kills the cells that grow the hair. Which is all to say: electrolysis is permanent.

, Because it attacks every single hair one by one, electrolysis can be extremely time-consuming. Weekly sessions could easily stretch into a year, total, for the particularly hirsute.


Luckily, the actual sessions are fairly brief, only lasting from 10-30 minutes. , With electrolysis, you’ll need to talk with your physician for a recommendation, so it definitely requires more planning than shaving or waxing. Your doctor will be able to point you in the right direction, as well as inform you of any unique reason that electrolysis might not be suitable for you.


Those who use pacemakers, for example, cannot undergo electrolysis for risk of it interfering with the device. "

Wait, then scrape it off.,
Wash up.",How to Remove Chest Hair4," Depilatories are available in a wide range of forms though all serve the same purpose. The chemicals break down and dissolve your hair, which you can then easily wipe off. Popular brands for men include Nair, Magic Shave, and Nad’s.

, You could have chemical allergies you’re unaware of, so it’s always best to test new topical cosmetics in small quantities before beginning regular use. Dab a small amount on the inside of your elbow or another inconspicuous part of your body, then wash it off as you would during normal use. If you notice any redness, irritation, or swelling, discontinue use of this product.


Most depilatory products are designed to remain on your skin for roughly five minutes before being removed.

, Whether you went with a spray, a cream, or a roll-on applicator, you should apply the depilatory—as your selected product directs—to your chest.

, There will be a short period of time during which you’ll allow your cream or spray to work its chemical processes, after which you’ll simply wipe the area clean. Your hair should come away with the cream.


As mentioned above, the said period of time will often be as short five minutes; brief enough to perform in the morning before work, should you need a hairless chest for any reason at work.
Many depilatory products are sold with special tools for scraping the hair and product off though any towel you’re willing to ruin can work as well.

, Rinse away the remnants of your handiwork and admire the view! Good job, you. Now go and put a shirt on.

Apply the shaving cream or gel to the area to be shaved.,
Shave the area carefully.,
Rinse your skin and check for missed spots.,
Clean your razor.",How to Remove Hair Naturally1," Most razors come with an added moisture or lubricating strip. These strips tend to be loaded with chemicals and other ingredients—yes, razors have ingredients! However, you can find razors that are more natural.


Look for a razor that does not have the moisture strip. An alternative would be to purchase razors that have it and then peel or otherwise remove the strip yourself.;
, Common store brands for shaving creams and gels are also full of chemicals and toxic products. Look for a more natural brand, or make it yourself.


Brands such as Dr. Bronner's, Garden of Eve, and Kiss My Face are known for making more natural shaving products.
For homemade shaving cream, you can simply use coconut oil or another carrier oil, like sweet almond oil or sesame oil. You can also look into homemade mixtures., There are some body parts that men and women commonly shave:


Women commonly shave their legs, underarms, and bikini areas. Some women also shave their arms.
Men commonly shave their beards, mustaches, and chests.
There are some reports that people should not shave certain areas, like their arms, because the hair will grow back faster and thicker. However, scientists have proven this to be untrue., In a thin layer, spread your shaving product over the body part you are shaving. Be sure you have enough to protect your skin from nicks and cuts, especially since your razor does not have a moisture strip.

, Pull your razor up the body part that you are shaving in one long motion. Continue to do this repeatedly until you have shaved the entire area.


Frequently rinse the excess shaving product and shaved hair from your razor so that you get a clean, smooth shave all around.
Take your time and go slowly. You are more likely to get a shaving nick or cut whenever you rush and forget to take care on areas like your ankles and knees.

, When you are done shaving the entire body part or area that you want shaved, rinse it and then check for any spots you missed while shaving. Dab a little bit of shaving cream or gel on that spot and touch it up carefully with the razor.

, After you shave, run your razor under hot water. Meanwhile, brush both sides of the razor blade with a toothbrush to get off all of the shaving cream or gel and hair. This helps to keep your blade clean and sharper longer."

Rinse off remaining sugar wax and moisturize.,
Wax again in a few days if you missed any areas.",How to Remove Hair Naturally2," This is a do-it-yourself method of waxing made with natural ingredients.It is much cheaper than going to a salon to have the waxing done professionally.


Lemon juice (2 tablespoons)
Raw sugar (1 cup)
Water (2 tablespoons)
Non-GMO cornstarch or arrowroot powder

, Once you have all of your ingredients, you need to gather the materials that will help you to make it. You will also need materials to help you do your own waxing.Medium-sized cooking pot
Stainless steel bowl
6” x 12” strips of cloth

, Stir the ingredients together, and then slowly bring the mixture to a boil. Next, reduce the heat and simmer the mixture until it turns a golden color and becomes smooth., When the wax is in the stainless steel bowl, allow it to cool for several minutes.The color may become darker as it cools.

, While the wax cools, you need to prepare the body part(s) you want to wax. Wash and exfoliate the area, which helps to remove dead skin cells prior to the waxing. Dry your body when you are done.Areas of the body you can wax yourself include legs and arms.Waxing the bikini area, underarms, and facial areas are not recommended as the skin is more sensitive. See a professional if you would like these areas waxed.A family member or friend could do back or chest waxing at home for you, if that is something you would like done., You do not need a lot of powder; just sprinkle a thin layer over the area.This helps with the wax removal.

, Knead the wax until it is smooth, and then spread it on your body part.As you spread it on, always move in the direction of your hair growth. You should not apply it against the hair growth.

, Lay the cloth strip over the waxed area and press it down. You will need to wait a few moments for the wax to cool to your body temperature before removing it., When the wax has cooled to your temperature, very quickly grip it and pull it up against your hair growth. You need to do this fast, as doing it slowly will actually be more painful and likely not remove all of the hair., Continue to work until you have waxed the entire area.

, When you are done waxing, gently rinse off any of the wax that might be still stuck to your body. Then, moisturize the area.Jojoba and grapeseed oils are recommended options for moisturizing and reducing redness.

, You do not want to wax again immediately, because your skin will become too irritated. If you missed any big areas, then wait a few days before repeating this method.

Gather the ingredients needed to make the paste.,
Mix the turmeric powder with the liquid to make a paste.,
Apply the paste to the area from which you want to remove hair.,
Wash off the paste with warm water.,
Repeat this process regularly to remove hair.",How to Remove Hair Naturally3," This is a very simple home remedy that helps with hair removal, and only a couple of ingredients are needed:Turmeric powder
Water, rose water, or milk

, You need enough to cover the area from which you want to remove hair, so mix one part of each until you have enough paste to cover that area.


You can use any of the liquids listed in Step 1, but only use one of them.
Keep in mind that it is noted that this paste is intended for a small amount of hair or very fine hair. It is best when used on facial areas, like the upper lip., Gently spread the turmeric paste onto the area and let it dry. You can leave it on for 15-30 minutes or until it is completely dry., Once the paste is totally dry, rinse it off with warm water. Then, pat the area dry with a clean towel., One time of applying the paste will not remove all of the hair. You will have to repeat it regularly, such as on a daily basis, to achieve the results you want."

Collect the ingredients for making the papaya mixture.,
Mix all of the ingredients together into a small mixing bowl.,
Apply the paste to the area from which you want to remove hair.,
Allow the paste to sit for 15-20 minutes or until it is complete dry.,
Rinse the area with water and pat it dry.This will help to remove any last remnants of the paste and prepare your skin for moisturizing.

,
Moisturize the area.,
Repeat this process 3-4 times per week for about three months.",How to Remove Hair Naturally4," This method starts with a papaya powder or paste and includes several other natural ingredients known for natural hair removal:Papaya powder (¼ tablespoon) or papaya paste (1 tablespoon—make by cutting and smashing small chunks of papaya)
Turmeric powder (¼ tablespoon)
Gram flour (¼ tablespoon)
Aloe vera gel (4 tablespoons)
Mustard oil (2 tablespoons)
Essential oil, any scent (2 drops)

, When combined, the ingredients should form a thick paste., Gently spread the paste on the area in the opposite direction of the hair growth., Once it has completely dried, you can take a clean, dry cloth and rub it over the pasted area in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Continue rubbing until you have removed all of the paste.,, You can use a natural oil such as olive, jojoba, or grapeseed oils to moisturize. Gently apply the oil over the area where you applied the paste.

, In order to remove all of the hair, you will have to regularly repeat this method a few times each week for three months."

Make the paste easily pliable.,
Stir the hot sugar paste until it has cooled somewhat.,
Work quickly.,
Apply the paste.,
Flick the paste off.,
Coil the ribbon of paste back on the stick.,
Repeat steps 4-6.",How to Remove Back Hair With Sugaring," This should be done by adding a a teaspoon of water per cup of paste (just eye-ball it), and microwaving it for 10 to 15 second. The sugaring paste should become very fluid, so that it can be easily stirred with the stick.

, The result should be a thin paste, which will eventually thicken into an annoying blob if left unattended.
, While the paste is still warm, insert the stick into the sugar paste, flick the tip of the stick up to pull a mass of it up, and twirl as much as you can around the end of the stick. This may only be a little paste- much less than you would need to use if using fingers alone to apply it. The paste should appear golden, due to the sudden stretching motion.
, Apply it against the direction of hair growth. For the back, the direction of hair growth is likely to be downwards, like leg hair. Apply the paste up your back by pressing the stick into a part of the back, and pulling the stick upwards along the skin. If done correctly, it will look like a wide ribbon of paste in mirror; a little bit of paste goes a very very long way. If the sugaring paste breaks while pulling, place the stick at the bottom of the ribbon, and slowly pull it over the whole ribbon again.
, You may have already felt some hairs being pulled out while applying the paste. In order to flick off the sugar paste, make a small but violent downwards stroke or the wrist, and the ribbon of paste will come off. If the ribbon breaks, place the stick (paste and all) at the top of  the area left, and continue flicking downward. Ideally, the ribbon should not break.
, As soon as the entire ribbon of paste is removed, before it can drop full away from the body, thrust the stick violently in a vertical upwards motion, and a little away from the back. This is really just a flick of the wrist, and if you practice, you will find your own method. The entire ribbon of paste should quickly wrap itself around the top of the stick in one tight coil. It's the fastest way to ""reset"" the stick to sugar the next area.
, Unless you are an animal, the paste should stay workable, even with hairs in it. You can reuse the paste many, many times. Don't throw it away just because it is mostly hair. It's gross, but efficient, because you can save your sugar paste. In fact, unless someone else is going to use your paste, you can even replace lightly used sugar paste in the container. The same paste may be used until it is dark brow from hair, and light yellow from manipulation (when sugar is stretched, it forms fibers, and there is often reflection among these fibers, which causes stretched sugar to take on a golden appearance).

Apply a warm washcloth to soothe and clean the area.,
Make a baking soda, salt, and olive oil mixture.,
Soften the hair using aspirin.,
Draw out the hair with black tea.,
Use an exfoliating pad or brush to loosen the hair.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair Under the Skin1," To keep the ingrown hair clean and lower the risk of infection, you can soak a clean, cotton washcloth in warm water and rest it over the ingrown hair. Keep the washcloth on for three to five minutes and repeat this three to four times a day. Be sure to use a clean, fresh washcloth each time you do this.You can also do this as a way to exfoliate the area, making it easier for the hair to eventually fall out on its own.;
, Exfoliating the area with the ingrown hair can help to loosen and remove the hair. You can use natural ingredients like baking soda and olive oil to make a paste that will help to prevent infection and soften the area. However, be very gentle when applying the paste to the ingrown hair.


Combine ½ teaspoon baking soda, sea salt or sugar, and 1-2 tablespoons of olive oil. The olive oil has antibacterial properties and will keep the ingrown hair from getting infected.
Apply the mixture with a Q-tip or a cotton ball to the ingrown hair.
Use the tip of your finger to softly rub in the mixture in circular motions. Do three to five clockwise motions and then three to five counterclockwise motions. Rinse the area off with warm water and pat it dry. You should also wash your hands and put the towel you used to dry the area in the laundry to reduce the risk of infection.
Repeat the exfoliation with baking soda and olive oil at least two times a day.

, Aspirin can help to dissolve the skin around the ingrown hair and soften the hair, making it more likely to loosen during exfoliation.


Take a 325 mg tablet of aspirin and soak it in 1 tablespoon warm water. Make sure you are using an “old-fashioned” tablet that can dissolve in water, not enteric coated aspirin. Check that the tablet does not have a hard outer shell.
Put a few drops, three to five, of honey into the dissolved aspirin. The honey will work with the acidic aspirin to help “draw out” the ingrown hair.
Apply the mixture with a Q-tip to the ingrown hair and let it dry. You can leave the mixture on overnight so the honey can dry.
Rinse the dry mixture off with warm water and pat it dry. Repeat the application of the mixture to the ingrown hair every night.

, Black tea may help to soften and draw out the ingrown hair. Take a tea bag of black tea and soak it in warm water. Then, place the wet tea bag over the ingrown hair, leaving it on for five to ten minutes.


Apply the wet tea bag every two hours on the first day the ingrown hair appears. Repeat the application twice a day after the first day.

, Once the hair starts to soften up and become loose, you can use an exfoliating pad or brush to gently rub the area until the ingrown hair becomes dislodged from your skin. Use gentle, circular motions on the ingrown hair with the exfoliating pad, doing three to five clockwise motions and then three to five counterclockwise motions.


Check to see if the ingrown hair has been removed. If it has not been removed, repeat the motions again until the hair falls out. Be very gentle as you exfoliate the area to reduce the risk of infection or scarring.

Rub the pumice stone in a small, circular motion.,
Rinse your body off with water.,
Apply a moisturizer to your skin.,
Clean the pumice stone after usage.,
Repeat this process in about three days.",How to Remove Hair Naturally5," A pumice stone is a beauty tool that can be found in the beauty section of grocery stores and drugstores. It will likely be near the body washes and loofahs or body sponges.

, As you prepare to remove hair with the pumice stone, exfoliating your skin helps to remove the layer of dead skin cells and soften your hair, which will make it easier to remove.


Take care to do this anywhere that you want to remove hair with the pumice stone.

, Rather than starting anywhere on your body, start with the pumice stone at the hairline in the area from which you want to remove hair.

, Continue rubbing with gentle pressure until the hair is removed from that area. Then, move onto the next area and repeat.


Continue this process until you have reached every section of the body part on which you are working.

, This will help to remove both loose hair and dead skin cells removed by the pumice stone.

, Natural moisturizers, such as jojoba or coconut oil, can be used. They will moisturize the skin and help to reduce irritation from the pumice stone.

, Use soapy water and a nail brush to clean the pumice stone of hair and dead skin cells after use. This will keep it working efficiently., This method only removes hair for a couple of days, much like shaving. You can repeat it in a couple of days to maintain smooth, hairless skin."

Sterilize the needle before you use it.,
Soften the skin with a warm wash cloth.,
Insert the needle under the hair loop to raise the ingrown hair.,
Do not shave, tweeze, or wax the area around the ingrown hair.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair Under the Skin2," Though squeezing, poking, or prodding the ingrown hair can lead to infection, you can try to raise the ingrown with a sterilized needle.Use a loose needle, such as a safety pin or a sewing needle. You can easily disinfect a needle by soaking it in rubbing alcohol.


Wear medical gloves if available to avoid contaminating the needle.
Other ways to sterilize needles include steaming and microwaving.

, Before you use the sterilized needle on the ingrown, you should place a warm wash cloth over the ingrown hair. Leave it on for a few minutes to allow the skin around the ingrown hair to soften. This will make it easier to raise the ingrown with the needle., Hold the needle in one hand and try to pull the skin away from the ingrown hair until it is exposed. You should see a hair curled in on itself just below the surface of your skin. Use the needle to raise the ingrown hair out of your skin until the hair tip is exposed. Be very gentle as you do this, as you do not want to poke yourself or damage the area around the ingrown hair., If you tend to wax, shave, or tweeze the area with the ingrown hair, take a break and let your skin heal. Shaving, tweezing, or waxing the area will only irritate in the ingrown hair and could lead to the development of more ingrown hairs in the area.

Ask your doctor about drugs that help to remove dead skin cells.,
Talk to your doctor about creams to reduce inflammation.,
Speak to your physician about antibiotics if the area gets infected.",How to Remove an Ingrown Hair Under the Skin3," Retinoid drugs, such as tretinoin and Retin-A, can help to clear dead skin cells from your skin. They can also reduce your risk of ingrown hairs if you have a dark complexion, as these drugs reduce the thickening and darkening of your skin, making your skin less prone to ingrowns., Steroid creams can help to reduce inflammation of your skin, which can then lower your risk of ingrown hairs., If the area around the ingrown hair becomes infected, your doctor can prescribe antibiotic ointment or oral antibiotics."

Use a sharp, new razor.,
Shave the hair against the direction of growth.,
Rinse your armpit and repeat on the other side.,
Wait an hour or two to apply deodorant.",How to Remove Armpit Hair1," The process of shaving will go more smoothly if your skin is soft, supple and warm. Either shave in the shower or get your armpits wet with warm water before you begin.


If you tend to get ingrown hairs, exfoliate your skin with a body scrub, too.If you have very sensitive skin, do the process at night to give your skin chance to rest overnight.;
, Raise it high over your head to make sure the armpit skin is nice and taut. This will prevent you from getting cuts or razor burn.

, If you don't use shaving cream or body wash, you could end up getting razor burn, so don't skip this important step.









In a pinch, you can use plain bar soap. Work it up into a lather before you apply it.
Or try shampoo or conditioner, if you don't have anything else on hand.

, Using a dull or rusty razor has more than one drawback. You won't get a close shave, you're more likely to get nicked, and you could even end up with an ingrown hair or an infection. Make sure the razor is in good condition.

, Everyone's hair grows a little differently under the armpit. Yours might all grow in one direction, or it might sprout in many different directions. Make an effort to shave against the direction of growth for a cleaner shave. Carefully shave away the hair, wetting the razor in between strokes if necessary.








, Wash away the excess shaving cream and check your armpit to make sure the hair has been removed. Do a touch-up if necessary, then repeat the process on the other side.

, Shaving may leave tiny nicks in your skin, so give them a chance to heal before you apply a product. If you put deodorant on right away, it could sting or cause a rash.

Start waxing.,
Shave the area.,
Use depilatory creams.",How to Reduce Body Hair Growth1," Waxing can be painful, but it is quite effective at reducing body hair growth. Since the hair is removed from the root, the hair grows back finer, thinner, and slower. You can either buy wax to apply yourself at home or go to a spa or salon to get a professional wax treatment.


There are two different kinds of wax. If you are waxing at home, make sure you get hard wax for sensitive areas such as your face, underarms, and bikini area. Soft wax can be used on heartier areas, such as your legs, back, chest, and arms. You can buy wax you heat in the microwave and fabric strips in most major retailers. You can also buy premade wax strips if you don't want to deal with melting your own wax.
One of the main downsides is that waxing should only be done about once every 30 days. This means that the body hair must be left to grow for that long. This can be uncomfortable at first, especially in problem areas, but over time, the hair growth should be reduced enough to make it harder to notice.;
, If your hair growth is still too much, you can also remove the hair as well. Although there is a persistent myth that shaving makes hair grow back thicker and faster, there is no scientific fact behind this claim. Shaving an area will reduce the amount of hair for the time being while you wait for the hair to be reduced by other means.This method can cause irritation. Make sure, if you shave, to put plenty of shaving cream or lather on the area you shave in order to loosen the hair follicles and reduce skin irritation.

, Depilatory creams are chemical creams that dissolve the hair upon application. These creams used to smell awful and make your skin sting upon application, but developments in recent years have made many change to this method of hair removal that have made them more comfortable and pleasant to use. These creams, such as Nair, dissolve the hair above the skin. Although your hair may grow back a little faster than with waxing, the hair may be finer and lighter due to the bleaching qualities in many of these creams.


This method also hurts much less than waxing and does not cause skin irritation and increased hair growth like shaving can.
You can buy some specifically designed for particular areas of your body, such as your face, bikini area, and your legs."

Raise your arm above your head.,
Apply the cream over the area with hair.,
Wait for the recommended amount of time.,
Rinse your armpit and repeat on the other side.,
Wait a few hours before applying deodorant.",How to Remove Armpit Hair2," Depilatory cream comes in various strengths. Some is meant for sensitive spots like the face and armpits, while other formulas are designed to take off thick leg hair. Start with the cream for sensitive areas; if it doesn't work well, you can always try the extra-strength stuff later.


Using cream that's too strong for your skin can leave you with a rash.
When in doubt, pick one that's meant for the face.

, Rinse away deodorant and sweat so you're applying the cream to freshly washed skin. Pat your armpits dry with a towel.

, Make sure the skin is pulled taut. Get into a comfortable position you can hold for a few minutes, since you'll need to hold your arm upright the whole time you're using the cream.

, Try not to apply it to the bare skin surrounding your hair. Use only as much as needed to cover the hair.

, Keep your arm raised and let the cream go to work. Most creams recommend waiting three to ten minutes to let the chemicals dissolve the hair. Do not leave the cream on your skin longer than the recommended amount of time.


If this is the first time you've used depilatory cream, rinse it off after one minute to make sure it isn't causing an allergic reaction; look for redness, itching and bumps. Reapply if your skin seems to be fine.
The cream may sting a little, but it shouldn't burn or be painful. If you feel pain, wash it off.

, Follow the same process, applying the cream over your hair and allowing it to work for the recommended amount of time. Rinse when you're finished.

, This gives your skin time to heal after the treatment and reduces the chance that the deodorant will irritate your armpits.

If it's longer, it could become tangled and difficult to manage.If necessary, wait a few extra days for it to grow or trim your armpit hair to the correct length.

, Any type of body wax works well for removing armpit hair. Most kits come with a pot of wax that needs to be heated up in a microwave or in a special wax warmer. The kit will also have applicators and cloth strips you use to pull off the hardened wax.


Warm your wax according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Test the wax on the back of your hand to make sure it's not too hot.

, Use a body scrub or a loofah to remove dead skin and dirt, then rinse your armpits clean. This will make the waxing process easier and prevent infection from occurring.

, The powder dries your armpits and keeps the wax from sticking to your skin when you pull it off. Turning on a fan or opening a window can also help to keep your armpits dry during the process.

, Raise it all the way up, so your armpit skin is taut. This will help the hairs come out more easily and keep the process as pain-free as possible.

, Dip the applicator into the wax and spread a small amount on your armpit hairs in the direction of your hair growth. Place a cloth strip on top of the wax and press down lightly.

, Do it quickly, like you'd pull off a bandaid. If you go too slowly, the wax won't pull out your armpit hair cleanly. It will also hurt more if you go slowly.


If you have trouble pulling it off, your skin may not be taut. Try bending your elbow and using your fingers to hold your skin taut while you use your other hand to pull off the strip.
You may also be sweating a bit, causing your armpit to get wet. Try turning on a fan to cool things off.

, Depending on how much hair you have, it might take two or three wax applications per armpit to get the job done. Finish the first armpit, then move on to the second. You can pull out stray hairs using a tweezers when you're finished.

, This will soothe your armpits an help remove extra bits of wax that are clinging to your skin.

, If you apply it right away, your skin might feel irritated. Wait at least a few hours before applying any products.

Wait several hours to apply deodorant.",How to Remove Armpit Hair4," This is the easiest length to manage when it comes to using an epilator. If it's longer, it could become tangled and difficult to manage in the epilator device. It may help to shave your armpits one to two days before epilating, to make sure your hair is just the right length when you start.

, An epilator is a small machine with rotating heads that pull out the hair. Like waxing, the results can last for weeks, but the process can be a little painful.Make sure your armpits are completely dry by dusting them with baby powder. This helps ensure your skin won't get caught in the machine.

, Raise it high so that your armpit skin is very taut. If your skin is bunched, it could get pinched in the epilator.

, Using the lower setting at first will help you get used to the feeling of having your hair pulled.

, Keep it slightly away from the surface of your skin at first. As the hairs are pulled you'll feel a pinch similar to what you'd feel during waxing. Soon you'll get used to the feeling of having your hair pulled, and you'll be ready to move to the next step.

, Now you can get all the stray hairs that didn't come out the first time around. Keeping your skin taut, finish the job on the higher setting.

, Start on the lower setting first, then move to the higher setting. Continue until your armpit is completely hair free.

, Your armpits will feel red and irritated, so soothe them with aloe right when you're finished.

, Applying it right away could sting or cause a rash, so wait at least a few hours.

Drink spearmint tea.,
Eat more soy products.,
Make a gram flour and curd mask.,
Try a pumice stone.,
Use a lemon and sugar scrub.,
Make a homemade wax.",How to Reduce Body Hair Growth2," Studies have shown that the consumption of spearmint tea can decrease the levels of androgens, the male testosterone that is one of the major causes of excessive hair growth, in a woman's blood stream. Buy spearmint tea or fresh spearmint leaves. Drink the tea twice a day for a few weeks to help decrease hair growth. , Soy products increase the the levels of estrogen in your body, which can help balance out the androgens, the male hormones, in your body. Since androgens encourage body hair growth, reducing or balancing them will make your hair grow less. Try to incorporate soy products such as edamame, soy milk, or soy burgers in your diet each day. Over time, it may help reduce your body hair growth., To reduce the appearance of body hair, try applying a mask of gram flour, also known as besan, and curd. Measure 1 tablespoon and a pinch of turmeric. Add 1 tablespoon of curd and mix well. Add enough water to make it a thick paste. Massage it into your skin. Leave it on until it dries. Then, rub it gently off your face. Doing it once a day may reduce the amount and appearance of body hair.You can also replace the water with yogurt or heavy cream. The mixture will be thicker, but apply it in the same way. The dairy ingredients have nutrients that may help reduce hair growth even more., While in the shower or bath, take a wet pumice stone and gently rub it in a circular motion along the area with the body hair. The friction should help loosen the hair at its follicles and make the hair come out. All the hair may not come out the first time, but some will. Plus, the overall amount of hair that grows may reduce over time.


Moisturize the area well after you shower to reduce any irritation or discomfort.Make sure you do this gently. Rubbing too hard with the stone can cause irritation and abrasions.

, Mix 2 tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of lemon juice with 1/2 a cup of water. Apply it on your skin and the hair in the same direction the hair is growing. Leave it on for 15 minutes, then wash it off. Try this a few times a week and it can help discourage hair growth.


Lemon has natural bleaching characteristics, so it can also help lighten the hair and brighten your skin as well.
If the sugar is too harsh for you, try substituting it for honey instead. With this method, eliminate the water and apply the honey and lemon juice mixture to your face with a q-tip or cotton ball., Mix 1 tablespoon of honey with 1 teaspoon each of sugar and lemon juice. Heat the mixture in a microwave for about three minutes, or until it makes a thick waxy substance. Let it cool until it is cool enough to not burn your skin. Dust the area of your skin with cornstarch or flour to help the mixture adhere to the hair. Then, apply it to the area of body hair with a waxing spatula or butter knife in the direction your hair grows. Lay a piece of fabric over the mixture, pressing it down. Then, pull the fabric in the direction opposite to the way the hair grows. Repeat over the entire area of hair. Over time, less hair may grow in this area and it can be less dark and coarse.


Do this whenever the hair is long enough to adhere to the wax, usually every 30 days or so.Make sure you don't burn yourself with this mixture. It will be hot at first, so wait until it has adequately cooled before you apply.

Take birth control.,
Get electrolysis.,
Have laser hair removal.,
Try a medicated cream.",How to Reduce Body Hair Growth3," If your hair growth is associated with a medical condition such as hirsutism or polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), you may be able to take birth control to help reduce hair growth. Since these two conditions produce an overabundance of androgens, birth control is used to decrease the production of these in the body. The decrease in androgens will slow down hair growth and make it finer and softer than before.Consult your doctor about hair growth issues associated with these conditions. If you don't have one of these conditions, you should not take birth control to reduce hair growth unless it is prescribed by your primary care physician.

, Electrolysis is a procedure where a small needle in placed into a hair follicle and it is zapped with an electrical current. This damages the hair at the follicle level, which reduces hair growth in the area. These treatments are typically suited for small areas, though larger areas can be treated over multiple treatments. Look for a qualified electrologist in your area, but be aware. These treatments are expensive.


If you have PCOS or hirsutism, these treatments will help at first, but the body hair will eventually come back., Laser hair removal is more effective, faster, and long lasting than electrolysis. Typically, you would need four to six treatments which are spaced about four to six weeks apart to gain satisfactory hair removal. During this process, body hair production is reduced. Dermatologists and skin specialists perform these treatments, but they are expensive.It is possible to permanently stop hair growth in certain areas with laser hair removal. Be advised that PCOS and hirsutism can still make the hair grown back, even after these treatments., There are some new medicated, prescription creams that help reduce hair growth. These products, such Vaniqa, help reduce the production of body hair in women along the face and neck. It blocks the production of a natural enzyme in the skin that causes hair to grow. This effect makes hair grow slower and can make the remaining hair lighter and finer."

Laser your leg hair.",How to Prevent Ingrown Hairs on Your Legs," Shave after (or during) a shower to take advantage of the steam’s effect on your skin and leg hair.


Exfoliating might help your cause (because it sloughs off irritating, dead skin cells) or it might hurt your cause (because it’s a great deal of rubbing, scrubbing and scraping on the skin in a short period of time). See which works best for you.;
,


Leaving the hair on your legs slightly longer is far less noticeable than red, bumpy ingrown hairs, if visibility is of concern to you.
Try an electric razor if you’re having difficulty leaving your hair longer with a manual razor.
There’s no consensus on the merits of single-blade versus multi-blade razors in combatting ingrown hairs, but you should always ensure your razor is clean and sharp.

, Leg hair often grows downward, toward the foot, though most people will have stray hairs that defy convention. When you shave against the grain, it can cause the remnant of the hair to bend and curl, in turn increasing the chance that it'll curve inward. Shaving in the same direction that your hair grows lessens the chance for irritation.


If this method doesn’t help, try shaving against the grain. It’s less commonly effective, but it works for some., As overly fastidious as it might feel, a clean razor won't drag dirt, dead skin, or any other microscopic debris into (or under) your skin.Tap disposable razors firmly on the side of the tub or sink to knock the accumulated hair out from between their blades.


With an electric razor, cleaning after every stroke is probably excessive. Just be sure to remove the guard and clean it thoroughly after each shave.

, Don’t rub the washcloth: just press it firmly on your skin.

, Longer leg hair is the surest way to avoid ingrowns. If you don’t want to stop shaving altogether, give your hair and skin some time between shaves to recuperate. Repeated shaves is close succession will only agitate the irritated sites.

, Calf socks are a common culprit of ingrown leg hair with men who don't shave, as tight clothing will prevent hair from growing away from the body.Skinny jeans will exacerbate the problem on the thigh and calf both. Consider ankle socks, or slim-cut jeans as opposed to skintight styles.


If you're having trouble with ingrown hairs on other parts of your body, try looser clothing there as well. Briefs can cause particular issues with pubic hair, as it's naturally coarser and curlier. Try boxers if you continue to have trouble here.
Friction is also a factor with ingrown hairs. Dress appropriately when you'll be moving around, in loose-fitting clothing that allows your legs to breathe. Instead of tights, try exercising in shorts, sweatpants, or athletic pants.

, When the hair is pulled entirely out at the follicle, its tip has to break back through the skin as it grows.This can easily lead to ingrown hairs when the tip fails to break through, or curls back around into the skin. Those with coarse or curly hair are at particular risk.


While tweezing and waxing aren’t problematic for everyone, they’re the hair removal methods that are most likely to cause ingrown hairs.

, This in turn will exacerbate ingrown hairs.

, Apply either of these liberally to soothe red, irritated skin. Don’t attempt shaving, waxing, or any other general hair removal for a few days.

, Depilatory creams work to dissolve hair beneath the surface of the skin.Whereas shaving leaves the hair with a sharp edge, these creams do not, potentially mitigating a major irritant for you. The hair still regrows from the root, however, meaning these creams are far from a sure thing.

, Dip your tweezers in rubbing alcohol to disinfect them, then dig the tip of the ingrown hair out of your skin. Don’t pull the entire hair out of your leg—just the tip. The redness and irritation should reduce.Don’t dig too deep into your skin if you have trouble grasping the hair. Let it grow for a few days, and try again once it’s longer.

, Products with salicylic acid or glycolic acid work against ingrown hairs with exfoliating ingredients.These acids are often found in acne medications. It’s not uncommon for such medications to have an overall drying effect on your skin, though, so take care to moisturize thoroughly to offset this.


Expect results after 3-4 days of use.
Some of these chemicals can make you sensitive to sunlight, so read their instructions carefully and apply sunscreen if so.

, The ultimate solution, laser hair removal is an option for those who have chronic issues with ingrown hairs. Treatment inhibits regrowth entirely, so pursue this only if you’re looking to give up leg hair entirely.Although advances have been made, laser treatment is still most effective on individuals with fair skin and dark hair. Those with blonde hair or darker skin tones will find less success down this route.
Even with fair skin (the skin tone most amenable to laser treatment) the total cost of the multiple sessions you’ll endure for laser treatment can run about $2,000."

Use circular motions while exfoliating for maximum effectiveness.
You can make a gentle exfoliating scrub at home by mixing three parts baking soda with one part water.Use this scrub once a week for best results.;
, Keeping your skin and hair hydrated will make both less prone to breakage. Soft, hydrated hair is also easier to shave. After exfoliating your skin, treat it with a gentle moisturizing lotion.Check the label on your moisturizer to make sure that it is non-comedogenic (won't clog your pores).
If you plan to shave your head hair, you can keep it moisturized and supple with a hair conditioner.
You can help keep your body and facial hair moisturized just before or during a shave by soaking the hair in hot water and using a lubricating gel or moisturizing shaving cream.

, Most hair removal techniques leave your skin and follicles more vulnerable to infection. Use warm water and a mild face or body cleanser to wash away dirt and bacteria before shaving, plucking, or waxing."

Use a sharp, single-blade razor to shave.,
Try hypoallergenic shaving cream.,
Rinse the razor.,
Use warm water and moisturizer afterwards.,
Don’t shave too often.",How to Prevent Ingrown Hairs on the Pubic Area1," One of the biggest mistakes you can make when shaving your pubic area, is to use a dull blade. Use a razor that is sharp enough to cut the hair without having to go over it again and again.


Depending on how often you shave, you may need to replace your blade every month or so. Some people switch out blades after five uses, but determine what works best for you.
Use a single-blade razor. This will actually be more effective in cutting the hair, so long as it’s sharp.Remember to shave in the same direction that the hair is growing. Otherwise hairs could actually get stuck as they are growing back, thus causing ingrown hairs.
While electric razors may be suitable for most parts of your body, refrain from using one on your pubic area.;
, Use a shaving cream that is designed for sensitive areas. As with any product you apply to your skin, test a little bit of it on another part of your body before using it on your pubic area.


Don’t skip the shaving cream. Just try to avoid ones that are scented, as this could irritate your skin.
Men may want to consider using women’s shaving cream for the pubic region, as many of the shaving creams marketed to men contain a perfume or scent., Always make sure to rinse your blade off after every stroke. This will help to prevent buildup, which puts you at risk for ingrown hairs.


As more hair and skin builds up in your blade, you are at a greater risk for cutting yourself or for having to go over the area multiple times.

, After shaving the area, rinse it with warm water. Next, you’ll want to apply a moisturizer, but don’t need to overdo it. Simply apply a very fine layer to the skin.


An alternative to moisturizer is aloe vera or baby oil. However, men should remember to never use aftershave. It would be extremely painful!Fragrance free is always the way to go. Look for moisturizer that specifically targets sensitive skin as well.

, Shaving too often is a sure way to develop ingrown hairs. If you don’t allow your skin time to heal and give the hair time to grow, you will risk trapping hair under the skin.


Wait until the hair has grown back. Never go over stubble or an ingrown hair with the razor. This will just cause further irritation.

Wet your skin and apply gel or shaving cream before shaving.,
Shave in the direction of hair growth.,
Shave with a sharp blade.,
Rinse your razor frequently while shaving.,
Shave with an electric razor.",How to Prevent Ingrown Hairs2," If shaving is your preferred method of hair removal, keeping your hair and skin moisturized during the shave is a must. Using a cream or gel will make the hair easier to cut, and will prevent skin irritation.


For best results, apply your shaving gel or cream a few minutes before you start shaving.It’s a good idea to shave in the shower or immediately after getting out of the shower. The warm water will soften the hair, making shaving much easier.

, Shaving “with the grain” may help reduce friction and prevent damage and irritation to your skin. However, this technique doesn’t work for everyone. Experiment with the shaving direction that is most effective and least irritating for you., A sharp blade will cut your hair more easily and is less likely to irritate your skin. If your razor is getting dull, replace it with a new one. While some experts recommend using a single blade razor, it is unclear whether this really helps prevent the development of ingrown hairs. Stick with your multi-blade razor if you find that it is less irritating and more effective for you., Razors quickly become clogged with shaving gel and hair during the shaving process, which reduces their effectiveness and makes irritation more likely. Rinse your razor between strokes to prevent buildup and keep it shaving smoothly., Electric razors and clippers don’t cut as close to the skin as traditional safety razors, which can reduce your chance of developing ingrown hairs. It may be worthwhile to sacrifice a super close shave if you shave frequently and regularly develop ingrown hairs.Avoid setting your razor/clippers on the closest shave setting, and hold the blade slightly away from your skin while shaving.

Use sanitary waxing practices.,
Try a chemical hair remover.,
Use laser hair removal.",How to Prevent Ingrown Hairs3," If you decide to wax instead of shave, you are still at risk for getting ingrown hairs, especially in the bikini area. Always cleanse and exfoliate your skin before waxing. Reduce your risk of infection by using a new applicator stick for each application of wax., Depilatory creams work by dissolving the hair rather than cutting it or pulling it out of the skin. For this reason, they are less likely to lead to ingrown hairs.Chemical hair removers can cause rashes or irritation in some people. Test the product on a small area of your skin before use., Laser hair removal is a semi-permanent hair removal technique that involves destroying the hair and the root with a guided laser beam. While this technique does not usually completely eliminate hair in the treated area, it will reduce hair density significantly. This reduces the need for shaving, plucking, and other hair removal techniques that lead to ingrown hairs.Laser hair removal is relatively safe, and the side effects (typically redness and irritation) are usually mild and temporary. In rare cases, permanent scarring may occur.
Keep in mind that laser hair removal can be costly. Typically, multiple treatments are needed over the course of several months in order for the treatment to be effective.

Rinsing will help cleanse the skin, close up your pores, and reduce irritation., Whether you wax, pluck, or shave, it’s a good idea to treat your skin with a gentle lotion afterwards. Make sure your lotion is free of perfumes and alcohol. Moisturizers containing colloidal oatmeal or aloe may be particularly soothing., Exfoliating is especially important after waxing, since it can help new hair growth emerge the way it’s supposed to. Apply a mild, gentle exfoliating scrub daily for the first few days after waxing., Glycolic and salicylic acid both help exfoliate the skin and prevent ingrown hairs by keeping pores unclogged. Salicylic acid is a key ingredient in many acne medications, so it can also help prevent post-shave breakouts.Try post-shave serum or cleansing pads containing glycolic and/or salicylic acid. If your skin is sensitive, you may need to avoid using these products more than once a week.
Avoid using glycolic or salicylic acid on freshly shaved or waxed skin. Let your skin rest and heal for a day or two before applying.
These products can be drying, so use them in combination with a moisturizer.

Keep the product away from your genital areas. Only apply it to the hair. Be sure to read the directions prior to applying the product so that you know how long to keep it on for.
Have a timer and a wash cloth on hand so that you can effectively remove the chemical when the time is up.
Chemical hair removers are more effective than shaving; however, the results do wear off more quickly than if you were to wax.

, If you’d like to try an alternative method to chemical hair remover consider using wax. Wax can be applied either at home or in a salon by a professional.


Costs associated with waxing are typically minimal, particularly if you choose to try waxing yourself at home.
In order to effectively use wax, your hair should be at least one fourth of an inch in length. There’s no need to have an exact measurement, but keep in mind that the wax needs something to grab on to. If the hair is too short, the wax will not be effective.Always try a strip on another part of your body to test for any reactions prior to applying it elsewhere.
Be sure to have towels and enough wax on hand.
As with the chemical hair removal, wax should only be used on the hair and should not come in contact with your genitals.
There are risks associated with attempting to wax yourself, such as burns and infection. Ideally, you should seek the help of an experienced professional to avoid injuries.

, If your budget allows, consider removing the hair permanently. The most efficient (and costly) method for permanently removing hair is through laser hair removal.


There are many benefits to laser hair removal including the precision and speed. However, be prepared for multiple visits, as it takes anywhere from 3-7 sessions to complete the process.Always do your research prior to getting the treatment. You’ll want to know about the doctor’s experience, treatment plan and the cost.
Additionally, you’ll need to understand what steps you need to take prior to the hair removal. You may need to limit how often you wax or shave in the six weeks leading up to the treatment. Typically, you need to avoid exposing the area to sun before and after as well.

Don't touch your face.,
Use make-up that is suitable for your skin type.,
Drink lots of water.,
Follow a healthy diet.,

Exfoliate your skin.,
Get rid of pimples.",How to Keep Your Face Clean," Is your skin dry, oily or normal? This is what you have to figure out so you can make sure you have the right face products. There are so many different types that it can be confusing.If you have normal skin, your skin has the right balance of moisture, oil and durability. This is what you're trying to achieve with keeping it clean.
If you have oily skin you face might appear shiny, greasy or oil only a few hours after washing.
If you have dry skin, it's often flaky.
If you have sensitive skin, your skin is often tight or itchy and you experience allergic reactions when you come into contact with certain chemicals.
A lot of people have combination skin, where part of your face is oily while a different part is dry.;
, Wash once in the morning and once in the evening. Everyone's skin is different and needs different things. You may have to test out a few different face washes to find the one that works best for you. What you really want from a face wash is something that cleans away dirt and germs and excess oils, but doesn't strip your skin of its healthy oils.Picking your cleanser is based on your skin type, how often you wear make-up, and how often you work out. For instance, if your skin is oily, you'll want a cleanser that has a low pH level, which will be more effective in cleaning the oil. If you have sensitive skin, you won't want the cleansers that are full of chemicals.
Avoid using ordinary soaps, which are too harsh for your face and can strip it of its natural oils.
It's best to rinse your face with warm water or cool water. Hot water strips the healthy natural oils from your skin.
You need to wash your face after exercising to get rid of any sweat and dirt and oils that might clog your pores.

, Don't scrub your face dry, be gentle. The skin on your face is sensitive. Make sure that the towel is clean, otherwise you'll be transferring bacteria to your clean face.

, While not necessary, toners can be a great help to people with oily skin, acne, or badly plugged pores. Toners help remove excess oils and dead skin after that remain after cleansing. This is a great way to add active ingredients like retinoids, antioxidants and exfoliants to your skin regimen.Apply the toner after cleansing with a clean cotton facial pad to your forehead, nose and chin (the so-called ""t-zone""). Move the pad in gentle circles, avoiding the eye area.

Find the right toner for your skin type. Certain formulations can help exfoliate acne-prone skin; others contain anti-inflammatory properties for sensitive.
Many dermatologists recommended not using an alcohol based toner, because it's too drying even for oily skin.

, Don't rub your eyes, or use harsh make-up removers on them. That part of the face is delicate. So, likewise, don't splash yourself awake in the morning with cold water.

, Touching your face can spread the bacteria which cause your pores to become inflamed.If you have to touch your face to apply make-up or face cream, wash your hands first to make sure they're clean of oils.


Also, try to avoid leaning your face against items that collect sebum and skin residue, such as a phone. Sebum is a light oily substance secreted by the skin glands which moisturizes skin and hair.

, Try to buy make-up that has ""noncomedogenic"" or ""non-acnegenic"" on the label if you can, as these are designed to help prevent acne and breakouts and won't clog your pores.


Make sure that you aren't using old make-up. Skincare products, like food, have an expiration date. Using them after that date will do more harm than good.
Try to use mineral based or water based makeup instead of choosing oil based ones as they make skin look greasy and dull.

, Drink at least 8 glasses of water. Staying hydrated and making sure that your body has plenty of water means that your body will be better able to function properly, including maintaining the health and cleanliness of your skin.

, A healthy diet includes vegetables and fruits and eliminates sugar and ""junk foods.""Try low-fat dairy products. A low-fat yogurt has vitamin A, something our skin is dependent upon. It also has acidophilus, a ""live"" bacteria that helps promote intestinal health, which in turn can help skin.
Eat foods that have a high antioxidant content like blackberries, blueberries, strawberries, and plums.
Try foods that deliver essential fatty acids needed for healthy skin like salmon, walnuts, and flax seed. Essential fatty acids promote healthy cell membranes, which in turn promote healthy skin.

, You can either go to a beautician and have someone do a facial for you, or you can try one of the many home facials. Remember to use the one which goes for your skin type. If your skin is oily, try a facial that is for oily skin.


A good home facial mask is a mixture of milk and honey together. After blending the ingredients, put the mixture on your face for 30 minutes, then clean your face with warm water.

, Gently exfoliating your skin will make you get rid of dead cells in your face, which can make your skin look dark and rough. Exfoliate your skin once a week, or once a month. Don't do it more than once a week, because it can strip your skin of important essential oils.


A nice exfoliation scrub can increase the circulation in your face giving you a healthy, rosy glow.
All you need for a home exfoliating scrub is an exfoliant like salt or sugar, a binder like honey or water, and a moisturizer that includes vitamin E oil, jojoba oil or even olive oil. If you have oily skin you can use a mashed banana or avocado as a moisturizer.

, While it can be satisfying to pick at the pimples and pop them with your fingernails, that is the exact wrong way to deal with a pimple! Wash your hands well before dealing with pimples to avoid infection.Avoid touching or trying to pop the pimple or you might irritate it. Popping a pimple can lead to scarring if you're not careful.
Apply a cold, wet washcloth or teabag on the spot for three to five minutes throughout the day. This will help lessen the irritation.
Use a spot-treatment that contains 1 percent or 2 percent salicylic acid, which is often less irritating than benzoyl.
Applying Visine on a cotton swab to the spot can reduce the redness.

Always wash your hands afterwards., When you take your family to the pool, make sure you each wear a pair of water safe shoes. This will keep your feet away from any germs, viruses, or bacteria that might cause skin irritations.

Don't be a stranger to your barber or stylist.

Gather your ingredients.,
Blend the alcohol and essential oil together.,
Use a separate container to mix the glycerin and water.,
Combine the two mixtures together.,
Pour the blend into an 8 ounce spray bottle.,
Store the mist in a cool, dark place for 2 weeks.,
Keep your mist in a cool and dark environment.",How to Make Perfumed Body Mist1," While there are many variations on the theme, most DIY perfume mists are made of the same four basic ingredients – essential oil(s), alcohol, distilled water and glycerin.These botanical blends are all-natural, unlike most store-bought perfumes and colognes, which are made of synthetic ingredients. To make 8 fluid ounces (240 ml) (1 cup) of perfume mist, you will need:


10 tablespoons of alcohol;
½ tablespoon of essential oil(s);
4 tablespoons of distilled water;
½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin.;
, Using a clean container and spoon, slowly stir the alcohol and essential oil(s) of your choice together. Gently swirl the ingredients around about 20 times with your spoon until they are evenly mixed together.


Both rubbing alcohol and vodka are acceptable choices for this recipe. However, rubbing alcohol will have a strong alcohol scent that many people dislike, whereas vodka is much more neutral.If you’d prefer not to use any form of alcohol (which some people find too harsh or drying), you can substitute with witch hazel instead.The essential oils used are a completely personal choice. You can use one that you particularly love by itself, or use several to create different scents and customized blends.

, Using clean instruments, mix these two ingredients together. You don’t need to whisk them vigorously – about 15-20 swirls around with your spoon will get the job done. The vegetable glycerin can even be omitted if you wish. However, since it acts as a binding agent for the ingredients, it is recommended that you use it if at all possible. Glycerin also moisturizes and allows the perfume mist to last much longer on your skin. If you do omit it, you will still end up with a great smelling end product, but the scent will fade fairly quickly.
You can also substitute vegetable oil, jojoba oil or even olive oil for the glycerin. These oils act as binders and carriers, just as glycerin does.
Distilled water is the most recommended choice, but filtered and mineral water will also work.For an even longer lasting scent, substitute rose water or orange flower water for the distilled water. These substances will enhance the scent and nourish your skin.

, Bring the two separate mixes together by either combining them using an entirely new container, or you can pour the contents of one into the other. Stir the ingredients together slowly for about 60 seconds until they are mixed together well.

, Use a funnel if this makes it easier for you to transmit the fluid into a glass or plastic spray bottle. The spray bottle you choose can be new or used, that’s up to you. If you are re-purposing a used bottle, sterilize it first so that you have a completely clean vessel for your blend.


Dark containers are the best choice, since even minimal exposure to light can diminish your scent.Plastic bottles hold diluted essential oils, such as your perfume mist, very well. However, never store undiluted essential oils in plastic containers, since the potent oils can damage and deteriorate plastic., During this interval the blend’s ingredients will meld and it will allow the scent to fully develop. Take the bottle out every day and shake it a few times to encourage the recipe to blend.


After the two weeks pass, your perfume mist is ready to use!

, To preserve the integrity and shelf life of your perfume mist, keep it away from extreme temperatures. Don’t store it in your bathroom, since the heat and humidity will break down its molecular structure. Don’t store it near a window or expose it to sunlight, which will degrade the blend.


Hot, humid atmospheres like bathrooms can also encourage bacteria to grow inside your bottle, which is a potential health risk.
Make sure your bottle is airtight and keep the cap on it at all times when it’s not in use.
The alcohol in your mist will evaporate quickly when exposed to air and your mixture will dry up more quickly."

Gather your supplies.,
Dip one head of the cotton swab into whatever cleaning solution you want to use and start poking around in your belly button.,
Discard old swabs and repeat the process if your navel is still dirty.,
If caring for a piercing, make sure to soak your belly button in salt water.,
Make sure you dry your navel carefully after you take a shower.,
Remember that you don't have to clean your belly button regularly.",How to Clean Your Belly Button," Of course, you'll need a few cotton swabs. But other than that, there's no go-to set of ingredients that people use to clean their belly button . Rather, they use a whole host of items. Experiment for yourself what works best on your body. You can use:


Water
Baby oil
Hydrogen peroxide
Rubbing alcohol
Another kind of astringent, like witch hazel;
, Gently work your way around the belly button, being careful not to rub inside the navel too hard.

, You should only need one or two takes and you're good to go. When you're done, take a clean swab and gently clean out any remaining cleaning solution still present in the navel. Make sure to get as much water, baby oil, hydrogen peroxide, or rubbing alcohol from your belly button as possible.


If your belly button is dry, use some Neosporin and you work your way around your navel. Use a slow, circular pattern and get right in the middle before removing the cream entirely with a swab.

, It's a bad idea to take your piercing, if you have one, out every once in a while, because that is when most bacteria and other infection-causing things get in. Also, it can take as little as ten or fifteen minutes for a piercing to start closing up! Even if it isn't completely closed, it may be too painful for you to re-insert it. Do not remove a new piercing until you are sure it is fully healed, and there is no blood or pus coming from it, or crust on the jewelry. If your belly button is pierced, move it as high up as possible, soak it, then as far down as possible. Make sure you de-crust it, using a clean paper towel soaked in the saline solution, because it can cause pain if you try to slide it when there is crust present. Make sure you use SEA salt. Iodized (table) salt will do nothing for preventing infections! If you have an infected piercing, do not take out the jewelry. This can cause it to close with the infection inside, and it is not pretty. See a doctor. , Too much water and moisture can promote the growth of more harmful bacteria. Remember, your belly button is a haven for over 1,500 kinds of healthy bacteria— you don't want those interfered with by bad bacteria.

, As long as you regularly bathe and use effective soap in and around your belly button, you don't have much to worry about. Your belly button, unlike your teeth, does not require constant supervision. Your belly button is like the brother who prefers to be left in his room for the whole day and prepares his own meals.

Select oils based on scent group.,
Mix lavender, jasmine and neroli to create a floral perfume mist.,
Experiment with your own modifications.,
Mix oakmoss, vetiver and patchouli to create an earthy perfume mist.The original formula remains the same, but this time the scent group is woodsy.,
Mix floral and citrusy oils together for a layered blend.,
Mix more than one layered blend for a unique scent.",How to Make Perfumed Body Mist3," When using essential oils for perfumery, the best place to start is with scent groups.The major scent groups are floral, woodsy, earthy, citrusy, oriental and spicy. Oils that are in the same scent group usually blend very well together. The most popular and easy to find essential oils for each scent group are:


Floral scent group: lavender, rose, neroli and jasmine.
Woodsy scent group: pine and cedarwood.
Earthy scent group: oakmoss, vetiver and patchouli.
Citrusy scent group: orange, lemon and grapefruit.
Spicy scent group: clove and cinnamon.
Oriental scent group: ginger and patchouli.

, To make 8 ounces (1 cup) of perfume mist, you will need ½ tablespoon of essential oils. This is approximately 110 drops.To make a floral perfume mist using the formula already presented, try this recipe:


40 drops lavender essential oil;
35 drops neroli essential oil;
35 drops jasmine essential oil;
10 tablespoons of alcohol;
4 tablespoons of distilled water;
½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin.

, Once you get the hang of it, get creative and try your own experiments with different proportions of the essential oils. For example, you could modify the above formula to be a lavender-heavy scent that only includes 2 oils from the scent group – lavender and neroli.


Adjust the lavender amount to be 70 drops.
Adjust the neroli amount to be 40 drops.
This amounts to 110 drops total, which is what the recipe calls for. Follow the rest of the formula and you’ll have an altogether new floral scent.

, Once you get the hang of it, experiment with the proportions, just like you did with the floral group. To get you started, try this recipe to create a woodsy perfume mist:


50 drops oakmoss essential oil;
40 drops patchouli essential oil;
20 drops vetiver essential oil;
10 tablespoons of alcohol;
4 tablespoons of distilled water;
½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin.

, Some scent groups mix well with other scent groups. Floral and citrusy oils are two scent groups that generally mix well together.Using the same formula as before, create an energizing citrusy floral mist by modifying it with a lavender oil and grapefruit oil blend:85 drops lavender essential oil;
25 drops grapefruit essential oil;
10 tablespoons of alcohol;
4 tablespoons of distilled water;
½ tablespoon of vegetable glycerin.

, Aside from floral and citrusy, there are many other scent groups that compliment each other and mix well together. Use the same formula as before and reference this general guideline to get you started mixing across scent groups:


Florals blend well with oils from the spicy, citrusy and woodsy scent groups.
Oriental oils blend well with oils from the floral and citrusy scent groups.
Woodsy oils usually blend well with all scent groups.Experiment! By trying different the oils, mixing across scent groups and modifying proportions, the possibilities are almost limitless.

Determine your therapeutic goal(s).,
Select essential oils for aromatherapy.,
Opt for essential oils with medicinal purposes.,
Exercise caution when using essential oils.",How to Make Perfumed Body Mist4," Essential oils smell amazing in your perfume mist, but they also provide a variety of mental, physical, and emotional health benefits.Cultures all over the world have been using them for thousands of years for these purposes.When choosing essential oils for your perfume mist, give therapeutic edge to the blend by addressing specific physical and mental health issues.


The act of inhaling different essential oils offers a wide range of psychological and physical benefits known as aromatherapy.Inhalation and topical application of particular essential oils can provide medicinal benefits with additional health, hygiene and beauty advantages.

, An array of mental and emotional reactions can be triggered through the act of inhaling particular essential oil scents.You can choose a single oil or combine the oils to experience a combination of positive effects. Aromatherapy is a vast subject, but there are some commonly chosen oils for therapeutic uses.Roman chamomile essential oil has fragrance properties that are soothing and can reduce stress.
Clary sage essential oil has fragrance properties that can reduce anxiety and promote relaxation.
Neroli essential oil has a rich scent with antidepressant effects. It can also relieve stress.
Patchouli essential oil has fragrance properties that can help ease depression.
Lavender essential oil has fragrance properties that can promote calmness and relaxation.
Lemon essential oil has an uplifting scent that can ease depression and boost energy.

, The naturally occurring chemicals in essential oils can offer medicinal and healing benefits when applied topically to the skin and when inhaled into the lungs.The range of essential oils with medicinal benefits is wide, but not all of these particular oils make great ingredients for a perfume mist because some of them don’t smell especially pleasant. Luckily, there are plenty of oils that both smell great and provide medicinal value.


Roman chamomile essential oil acts as an antispasmodic and sedative; it also provides anti-inflammatory properties and can ease insomnia/promote sleep.
Lavender essential oil can relieve headache and migraine pain. It can be applied topically to soothe minor skin irritations and ease insomnia/promote sleep.
Clary sage essential oil can relieve menstrual cramps and labor pain. It’s also considered to be an aphrodisiac.
Neroli essential oil has antispasmodic properties and can be helpful during pregnancy/delivery. Neroli can also ease postpartum depression.
Patchouli essential oil is soothing to the nervous system and has anti-inflammatory properties.
Eucalyptus essential oil provides antibacterial benefits and can soothe muscle aches. Through inhalation, eucalyptus oil can both clear the sinuses and boost the immune system., Because they are so highly concentrated, essential oils can have negative side effects if used improperly. Consult a doctor before using them if you are pregnant, nursing or have immune deficiencies. If you have sensitive skin, always do a skin patch test before using essential oils topically.


Essential oils are far too potent to be applied directly to the skin without diluting them first. Some of them can irritate the skin.Use the highest grade essential oils that you can find. Check their bottles and packaging for key phrases like “pure grade”, “aromatherapy grade”, “certified organic” and “therapeutic grade.”

Set up a double boiler and start heating the water.,
Combine the ½ cups of coconut oil, shea (or other) butter, and beeswax in the double boiler.,
Add the remaining ingredients, the oils and powders, and stir after removing from heat.,
Pour the warm mixture into molds, like an old deodorant tube or muffin tin, to cool your bars.",How to Make Deodorant1," A double boiler is simply a large saucepan filled with 1-2 inches of water. Turn the stove on medium-high heat to start warming the water. You then put a second empty pot, bowl, or mason jar in the hot water, which heats the contents of the bowl up much more gently than direct heat would.Never add the second pot to already boiling water. Start warming the water, but add the ingredients and the second bowl once it starts to get warm.;
, For small batches, a glass mason jar will do fine, as long as you can stir it. You can also use a normal pot or pan, or a glass bowl -- anything that fits in the double boiler and won't crack with heat. Stir constantly until all the ingredients are mixed smoothly.

, Once the mixture is smooth and easily stirred, add in the arrowroot, baking soda, essential oil, vitamin E oil, and probiotics. Mix quickly before the mixture hardens. Gently stir by hand until all ingredients are incorporated.Essential oils come in many forms and strengths. Start with 3-4 drops, adding more if it doesn't smell strongly enough for your tastes.
Vitamin E is essential for healthy skin, and makes a nice addition to your bar.

, If you will be making these into bars, pour into muffin tins or other molds while still liquid. If you will be putting into an old deodorant container to use like stick deodorant, let the mixture harden for about 15-20 minutes at room temperature to harden and when it is about the consistency of peanut butter, use a spoon to scoop into the deodorant tube and pack down to fill. Then, leave the cap off overnight to completely harden before using."
"
Lower the amount of baking soda if you have sensitive skin.,
Use beeswax for a smoother, easier to apply product.,
Add crushed probiotic pills for a powerful anti-bacterial (and stench) fighter.,
Try adding a 10-15 grams of Dichotomous Earth (DE) for an anti-inflammatory and toxin fighter.",How to Make Deodorant2," Baking soda has been known to irritate certain skin types, so avoid it if you're worried or know you're sensitive. In its place, substitute some more organic arrowroot or non-GMO cornstarch -- both are gentle for sensitive skin.If you can find it, some recipes substitute 2TB Bentonite clay for one tablespoons of baking soda., It is also good for sensitive skin types, though it is not always easy to find. While you can ignore it, instead adding more coconut oil and butter, it is a nice touch that makes a much gentler, easier to spread deodorant.

, Probiotics help fight bad-smelling bacteria on your skin. Add it with the arrowroot and other powders. Make sure the mixture has cooled slightly so that it is warm, but not hot, to the touch. Hot oils can kill the probiotics.The probiotic needs to be one that doesn't have to be refrigerated.

, DE, which is mostly made up of the essential trace mineral silica, helps your body fight rashes and infections, helping the deodorant stay on comfortably. You should make sure it is food-grade, and thus safe for application, and add with the powdered ingredients."

Shower or bathe regularly to reduce scent.,
Wear antiperspirant deodorant.,
Wear loose, natural clothing.,
Wear sweat pads.,
Sprinkle baby powder on your underarms.,
Drink enough water.,
Reduce sweat triggers.,
Try drinking sage tea.",How to Lessen Underarm Sweating1," Bacteria on your skin can turn old sweat into smelly armpits.Shower daily to wash away the sweat before this happens.


Try ending your shower with a minute or two of cool or cold water. This will lower your surface temperature, making you less likely to sweat right away.
Pat your armpits dry with a soft towel. Vigorous scrubbing can stress your skin and cause more sweating.;
, Ordinary deodorant only hides smell. To stop soaking your clothes, you'll need a product with antiperspirant. Apply this just before bed and right after you wake up, or after drying off from your shower. Your skin is usually cool and dry during these times, so the antiperspirant can easily reach your sweat glands and block them.If your armpits are sweaty, dry them first using a hair dryer on a cool-air setting.Most antiperspirants include aluminum compounds that can cause yellow armpit stains.Launder stained clothes soon, before the stain sets.

, A lightweight cotton T-shirt, for example, will wick moisture away from your skin. Having your shirt absorb moisture may sound like a bad thing, but this will keep your skin cool. A heavy or synthetic shirt will keep you hot, causing your body to sweat more.If you still sweat through these clothes, wear a light undershirt as well.

, These cotton pads stick to the underside of your shirt and absorb sweat so less of it soaks into your clothing. Look for these at drugstores, sold as ""underarm shields,"" ""armpit guards,"" and similar names.

, Baby powder (talcum powder) absorbs moisture, so it can prevent soaked clothing. This is generally not as effective as antiperspirant deodorant, but won't stain your clothes.


Talcum powder has been tentatively linked to cancer, but studies show mixed results. You may wish to avoid inhaling it or applying it to the female groin., Whenever you feel hot or thirsty, drink a glass of cool water. This will bring your internal temperature down, so your body won't have to lower it more by sweating., Many people suffer from hyperhidrosis, or excessive sweating, for genetic or hormonal reasons. Whatever the cause, certain foods and substances can worsen the problem. Consider the following changes if they are part of your daily habits:Quit smoking or other nicotine sources.

Reduce your alcohol intake.

Stop consuming caffeine.
Eat less spicy food. Eat less garlic and onion intake as well, since these add odor to your sweat.
Ask a doctor for alternatives if you think your medication causes sweating. Blood pressure and diabetes medication can do this, but don't quit them without medical advice.

, Sage tea is a traditional treatment for excessive sweating. This has not been tested one way or the other in scientific studies.If you try it, drink it daily in the evening, so the heat of the tea doesn't cause sweating during the day.


Consult a doctor before taking large doses of sage supplements, as they can have serious side effects. Sage in dietary amounts is mostly harmless, but may harm people with diabetes, epilepsy, bleeding disorders, or an allergy to the plant.
There are many types of sage. Typically, this treatment uses Salvia officinalis or Salvia lavendulaefolia.

Get a prescription-strength antiperspirant.,
Consider an iontophoresis device.,
Consider powerful oral medications.,
Ask a dermatologist for more powerful treatments.",How to Lessen Underarm Sweating2," Your doctor can prescribe a stronger antiperspirant than those available over the counter. These are typically applied only once or twice a day, and in small amounts, due to the more concentrated chemicals. Once this gets working, you'll only need to reapply once every week or two.These can irritate your skin. If necessary, ask your doctor for hydrocortisone lotion to soothe your skin.

, These soak the sweating area in water, then send a mild electrical current through it. While it is unclear why this works, it is a mainstream medical treatment.This is generally more effective for hands and feet, but special devices do exist for armpits. Ask a doctor about this treatment, or purchase a less powerful over-the-counter version. Patients generally try the treatment daily for several weeks, then continue on a less frequent schedule if effective.Ask a doctor first if you have a metal medical implant (such as a pacemaker or IUD), if you are pregnant, if you experience cardiac arrhythmia, or if you have a skin rash on your underarms.This treatment can cause red skin, and more rarely blisters.

, There are several types of pills that can reduce sweating, but these have serious side effects. In some cases, your dermatologist may recommend a Botox injection or other treatment before these are considered. The following are two of the most common treatment approaches of this type:


Anticholinergic drugs are effective in about 50% of cases, but often cause unpleasant side effects such as confusion and constipation.Beta blockers can reduce sweating, particularly if caused by anxiety. All drugs of this type have serious side effects, and cannot be taken by people with asthma or most heart conditions. Any beta blocker may cause depression or dizziness, and specific drugs may have additional side effects., The following treatments should only be administered by an experienced dermatologist. In most cases, your medical insurance will not cover these procedures.


A Botox injection at the armpit can paralyze nerves sending signals to sweat glands, typically for a few months. The FDA has approved this treatment for the armpit only, when antiperspirant has failed. Risks are very low when the procedure is performed properly, but include life-threatening issues.Microwave treatments to remove sweat glands are FDA-approved, but only recently.They may not be available in all areas.
In severe cases, a dermatologist can surgically remove some of the sweat glands or their attached nerves. Liposuction is typically the type of surgery recommended for underarms.Risks are low, but there is a chance of serious problems."
"
Smell your clothes after removing them.,
Consider your diet.,
Hold your hand against your mouth and puff out some breath.,
Check the parts of your body that moisture loves.,
If you're sweating profusely, there is a fair chance that you don't smell wonderful.,
Ask someone whom you trust.",How to Know You Smell when You Can't Smell Yourself," Take a break first. Go take a shower, watch TV, read a book for a while. Then, collect the clothes and give them the sniff test, especially around the pit area and anywhere you sweat profusely. If you find an odor that is unpleasant, that might be an indicator that you have a body odor problem that is leaching into your clothing. Our own odor can be augmented by the materials we wear, with un-breathable synthetics being at the top of the list for enhancing bad odors. Stinky clothing always means that the clothes need a wash immediately!;
, You might enjoy heaps of garlic, curry, onions, beer, spices, etc., but the residual odor can be very unpleasant to some people. If you think this might be a problem, make sure everyone you're hanging around with at the time shares your meal choices, and you'll all find it harder to smell one another's unpleasant odors! Temporary relief can be found in chewing parsley, mint candies, or swishing mouthwash.

, If the result is stinky when you smell your hand and the air rising back up as a result of being stopped by the hand, it's time to clean your teeth and tongue a lot more thoroughly. Brush your teeth, floss your teeth, rinse with mouthwash, and brush your tongue.


Another method is to lick your wrist. Wait ten seconds before sniffing your wrist. The odor that rises into your nose is the smell of your breath.

, Anywhere there is a potential for skin folds (between toes, under the arms, under breasts, etc.) can be a source of odor if bacteria gets the opportunity to thrive. Don't try smelling any of these regions; that will just confirm you're not thinking straight. The answer to avoiding this source of musty odor is to always dry skin fold areas thoroughly.

, If it's post-sport, don't worry – everyone expects that sporty sweat smell. Less so if it's caused by the stress of your job, a presentation, an exam, etc. Use antiperspirant and and/or deodorant and avoid foods that encourage sweating, such as chilies.

, Find a friend or a family member to give you an honest appraisal of your odor. Tell them that you're worried that you might be a little malodorous and see what they have to say. Don't forget to reassure them that you want the truth and won't hold their comments/assessment against them – and mean it too!

Too many uses can ruin the brightness of your clothes
They can cause itchiness or irritation from the chemicals in the solution.
The scent of the commercial product can also mix with sweat and become intense and too potent.;
, You might have these things laying around your kitchen somewhere. If you don’t, a quick trip to the grocery store to buy the items will only set you back a few dollars. The amounts listed below assume that you’ll be washing a few items of clothing.


1 tsp baking soda
1 cup lemon juice1 cinnamon stick
Regular laundry detergent

, If there are only certain parts of the clothing that smell bad then you should applying baking soda to specific areas of the clothing.


Smell the clothes to determine which area is the worst. If some areas are far worse then others, mix one tablespoon of baking soda with one cup of water. This will form a white paste which you can then lightly spread on the worst areas., Once you’ve pretreated the bad areas, throw the garment in the wash and run it on cold water with the appropriate amount of laundry detergent. You’ll create your mix for the rest of the clothing while it is in the wash.

, While the garment is in the wash, create the liquid mix using the items that you just gathered. Find a small pot or bowl and put the baking soda, the lemon juice, and the cinnamon stick inside.Make sure you mix the baking soda in with the lemon juice and then wait for the cinnamon stick to get soaked. The color of the liquid should be a light brown.

, Once your smelly clothing has finished its wash cycle, coat the garment with the mix. You can pour it on the garment, put it in a spray bottle and spray it, or even spread it on the garment lightly with the flat side of a knife. You do not need to soak the garment; just make sure you cover the entire surface of the clothing., Place in dryer on ""Low Heat"" setting, as the low temperature will keep bacteria from growing.

Let your clothes soak.,
Dry your clothes.",How to Get Body Odor Out of Clothes2," If you’re not washing that many clothes you can also choose to use a bucket. The water doesn’t need to be scalding hot but it shouldn’t be cold either.


This method will work best with warm to hot water.
You can soak your clothes in the washing machine using the ‘soak’ setting if you would rather not use your bathtub.

The next time you go to buy soap look for one that is labeled antibacterial – this type of soap will reduce the bacteria count on your body, thereby reducing the smell when you sweat.This is a good preventative measure that will also help your hygiene.

, Although antibacterial soap will do wonders for the bacteria on your body, showering once a day can accomplish the same feat. Try to save your shower until after you exercise so that you aren’t sleeping in your sweat. The more bacteria on the body, the worse you’ll smell, and then the worse your clothes will smell.


Make sure you dry off thoroughly after you get out of the shower. Bacteria does not breed as readily on dry skin."
"
Wash your body.,
Apply an over-the-counter antiperspirant.,
Use a deodorant to cover up body odor quickly.,
Use a hydrogen peroxide mixture.,
Rub hand sanitizer on your armpits.,
Use oil blotting paper.,
Rub an alum stone on the area emitting the odor.,
Rub mud on the stinkiest areas of your body.,
Spritz the problem areas with vinegar.,
Use diluted lemon juice.",How to Eliminate Body Odor1," If you find that you are a bit smelly, hop in the shower if you have the time. Body odor is created by bacteria that cause you to smell, so rinsing your body (and the part that smells worst in particular) can help to get rid of the smell quickly. However, it’s important to use soap or an antibacterial detergent when you wash yourself, rather than just rinsing with water.


When you shower, focus on your underarms and your feet, as those are two of the biggest body odor areas.;
, Antiperspirants form a block using certain chemicals (like aluminum) against sweating and perspiration, which helps to eliminate body odor. Many of these antiperspirants last all day, but you may need to reapply, especially if you've been doing something like exercising.


Unlike a deodorant, antiperspirants actually eliminate the perspiration, while deodorant simply masks the smell.
There has been a lot of talk about whether antiperspirants that contain aluminum cause breast cancer, or Alzheimer's, but medical research has never adequately proven a link between the two (or between breast cancer and parabens), so it should be safe to use., Sweating isn't bad for you (unless it's in excess and indicative of a larger problem) so you don't want to eliminate it entirely. Sweating serves the very utilitarian purpose of cooling your body down, but you can manage your sweating so that it doesn't happen at inappropriate times. Deodorant covers up the smell, or eliminates it entirely, while not getting rid of the moisture itself.Some deodorants last longer than others. If you are looking for a quick fix to your body odor problems, apply any deodorant that you can find. If you are looking to stay smelling fresh for longer periods of time, consider investing in a quality deodorant.

, If you are at home and don’t have any deodorant or antiperspirant on hand, try mixing one teaspoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide with one cup of water.Stir the mixture together and then dip a washcloth in the solution. Rub the wet washcloth under your armpits to relieve any body odor you may have.

, If you are in a really tight spot and need to eliminate body odor as quickly as possible, you can use hand sanitizer to get rid of the smell. To use hand sanitizer as a relief from body odor:


Squirt a small amount of hand sanitizer into your hand. Use your hand to rub the sanitizer onto your armpits. The sanitizer will help to fight the bacteria that are causing you to smell.

, If you are sweating heavily and are afraid you might begin to smell, use an oil blotter to wipe up the sweat. These papers are very effective at absorbing moisture, so rub one of the papers under your armpit (or anywhere else you are sweating) in order to prevent yourself from beginning to smell.

, Alum is a mineral that contains properties that can help to fight the bacteria that create body odor. To use an alum stone, you rub it on your armpit much in the same way that you would apply deodorant.If you are sweating, consider washing the stone after you have applied it to your skin.

, If you are out in nature and don’t have any deodorant or antiperspirant on hand, try rubbing some mud on your armpits or feet and letting the mud dry. Once it has dried, wash it off. The purpose of doing this is to dry out and remove any dead skin and old sweat that might be causing your body odor, much in the same way that a mud mask works.

, If you’d rather not use store-bought products, try using some natural remedies to solve your body odor problem quickly. Vinegar is a natural antiseptic that can help kill bacteria or fungi in your problems areas (like your feet or your underarms). Spritz some white or apple cider on those areas and then wipe your skin dry.


You can also dilute vodka with water and spritz it on your underarms. This was famously described by Joan Rivers as an ""old Broadway trick"" that she herself uses.If vinegar isn’t really your thing, you can try other natural sterilizers like tea tree oil or witch hazel, both of which have a similar effect to that of vinegar.

, Lemon juice is thought to be a natural antibacterial and antifungal agent.Because of this, it can be used as fast relief from body odor. To apply lemon juice to your armpits or feet, you can either pour lemon juice onto a clean washcloth or rub a sliced lemon onto the problem area.


However, you may need to experiment with how much lemon juice you put on your skin. Lemon juice is very acidic, which means that it can cause your skin to become irritated. If you find that this is the case, wash the lemon juice off and wait a couple of hours before applying a smaller amount of lemon juice to the area.
You can also try diluting the lemon juice with water.

Take showers regularly.,
Keep your skin dry.,
Shave your underarms regularly.,
Wear breathable fabrics.,
Wash your clothes regularly.",How to Eliminate Body Odor2," As mentioned above, taking a shower can help to get rid of body odor quickly. Making sure to shower each day can help to keep you feeling cleaning and fresh while you do your daily activities. When you shower:


Make sure to use an exfoliant a couple of times a week. This can help to wash away grime, dead skin, and bacteria, all of which can play a part in creating body odor. You can purchase exfoliants at your local pharmacy, or you can make your own natural exfoliants.

, Bacteria like an environment with lots of moisture, food to eat, warmth, and the proper levels of pH and sodium concentration, all of which can be found in folds of moist skin. Because of this, it is important to dry off your skin whenever it becomes moist, whether the moisture is from taking a shower or sweating.Use a towel or oil blotting papers to wipe off sweat and other moisture.
After a shower, consider applying powder to areas like your armpit in order to combat moisture.

, This can apply to both men and women, though women more commonly shave their armpits. Getting rid of the hair in your armpits can help to reduce the amount of body odor you have because hair absorbs odors easily; if you have less hair, there will be less chance that the body odor is absorbed.

, There are certain synthetic materials that don't breathe very well unless they've been specifically designed for that purpose (like polyester blends). If you're really worried about body odor wear fabrics like cotton, wool, or silk as they soak up moisture and have better breathe-ability, which means you will most likely sweat less and create less body odor.


You can also wear a cotton or silk undershirt under your clothing to soak up your sweat and body moisture so that your body odor does not soak into your outer layers of clothing.

, As mentioned above, body odor can seep into your clothing. If you sweat heavily in a shirt and allow the shirt to dry without washing it, there is a very good chance that that shirt will smell bad the next day. Try to wash your clothes every time you sweat in them to keep them, and yourself, smelling fresh.

Try to eat a healthy diet.,
Promote gut health.,
Take a wheat grass or chlorophyll supplement.,
Eliminate stress.,
Try a detox.,
Stay hydrated.,
Exercise regularly.,
Consult your doctor if body odor is a permanent problem.",How to Eliminate Body Odor3," What you eat can affect how you smell. If you are having problems with body odor, try to steer clear of certain foods, and up your intake of others. These foods include:


Foods to avoid: large quantities of red meat, garlic and onions, spicy foods, and heavily processed foods that contain high amounts of sugar. All of these foods can make your body odor worse. You should also avoid caffeinated drinks as those can add to body odor.
Some foods to eat are: leafy vegetables, whole grains, raw nuts and seeds, healthy oils (olive oil, salmon, avocado, etc.), and phytonutrients that cleanse your insides (like parsley, cilantro, celery, mints, sage, rosemary, thyme, and oregano.

, Some intense cases of body odor can be caused by a problem with your gut. Your gut may not be able to completely digest certain foods, which in turn can lead to an increase in body odor. You can try boosting your gut health at home, but if it continues to be a problem you should seek the help of a doctor. Ways to boost your gut health include:


Taking a probiotic supplement to help boost your intestinal flora quality.
Taking digestive enzymes with your meals or taking some apple cider vinegar to help aid your digestion.

, Chlorophyll supplements are thought to act as natural deodorizers, which can help to keep you from getting smelly throughout the day. Add a chlorophyll supplement to your normal vitamin regimen., Stress stimulates the apocrine glands, which are a type of gland that causes body odor. This means that when you are anxious or angry and under stress you're more likely to produce more body odor.



Meditation may help to cut down the amount of stress you feel. Meditate for 15 minutes each day and you may find that your stress is becoming more manageable (and therefore you will smell better).

Yoga is another good way to cut down on your stress.

, Cleansing your body, especially if your body odor problem comes from your gut or the food you've been eating, may help to reduce body odor and set you on the path towards smelling clean and fresh.


There are lots of different types of detoxes, so plan to talk to your doctor before you attempt one, especially one of the more rigorous cleanses. This is particularly important to do if you have a medical condition.

, Drinking plenty of liquid throughout the day can help to wash out the toxins in your body. This can help to promote good gut health, which in turn can make you less smelly.


The average adult woman generally needs 2.2 liters (0.6 US gal) of water, while the average adult man generally needs 3 liters (0.8 US gal)., While this might sound counterintuitive because exercising makes you sweat, getting plenty of physical exercise can actually help to combat body odor in the long run. Exercising can help you to sweat out toxins that have built up in your body that could potentially cause body odor.


However, make sure to take a shower after you exercise and dry off thoroughly, as mentioned above.

, If you have tried the above steps and nothing seems to be eliminating your body odor, you may have a medical condition that is causing the smell. Go to a doctor or dermatologist to discuss your body odor issue and get a diagnosis. You might be diagnosed with Bromhidrosis, a condition that causes people to have excessive body odor</ref>


Doctors can prescribe prescription-level antiperspirants. These can cause skin irritation, so make sure you're only using this if you have an actual medical issue (like Bromhidrosis or Hyperhidrosis).
Botox can also block sweat glands and eliminate your sweating. Again, you don't want to do this unless you have an actual medical problem, because it is both expensive and painful. The effects may only last for a few months and aren't always a long-term solution.

Practice what you will say ahead of time.Telling a friend that that he or she smells bad without hurting feelings can be awkward, and you will need to be very tactful.,
Be sensitive.,
Understand that body odors are individual and often culturally determined.Each person has a unique smell, which others may find agreeable or disagreeable.,
Decide when to talk to your friend.,
Talk to your friend in private.This helps make it less embarrassing, and your friend should appreciate that you weren’t trying to call him or her out in front of others.,
Address the awkwardness.This will not be an easy conversation to have, and breaking the ice can be the hardest part.,
Try offering some praise first.You can make the news a little easier to take by saying something nice to your friend before telling him or her about the odor problem.,
Be honest, direct, and kind.Subtle hints like saying “Wow, something smells bad!” around your friend, or leaving deodorant on his or her desk might occasionally work, but more than likely they will be overlooked.Just get to the point and be kind about it, without making jokes or seeming like you’re picking on your friend.,
Offer a possible cause.,
Tell your friend you know he or she might not be aware of the problem.People are very often unaware of their own smell, whether it is good or bad.,
Don’t tell your friend if others have complained.If a person thinks that everyone has noticed the odor and has been talking about it, things can become very awkward.,
Offer a solution.,
End the discussion on a positive note.",How to Get a Friend to Smell Better," Think about what you want to say to your friend, and then practice saying it to yourself or, better yet, to a trusted friend. Have the friend then tell you how your comments sounded, and if you should rephrase anything.;
, Sometimes, body odors can stem from personal or medical issues. Certain diseases or medications, for instance, can cause a person to smell in particular ways. Likewise, depression might cause a person to skip showers or washing his or her clothes. Since a cause such as one of these might be behind your friend’s odor, don’t phrase the problem as his or her fault.Instead, just focus on being honest and helpful.

, A person’s smell comes from a combination of biological and environmental factors, and different cultures may not react the same way to the same smell. Keep in mind that a person’s odor that you find offensive might seem perfectly fine to others.


If you talk to your friend and he or she doesn’t understand why your or others find his or her odor offensive, respect your friend's feelings and don’t get angry. Just explain things so that your friend can understand.

, Since letting a friend know that he or she smells bad may be a difficult talk, you won’t just want to spring it on him or her at any old time. Choose the right moment carefully:


It might be best to talk to your friend at the end of the day.That way, he or she will have time to go home and be more prepared for the next day.
On the other hand, you might talk to your friend at the beginning of the day, so that the problem is taken care of early. This can work especially if you can offer a quick solution to help your friend, like deodorant or body spray.

,


If you can’t talk to your friend in complete privacy, at least pull him or her aside where others can’t hear, and don’t draw attention to yourselves.
You might consider sending an anonymous email to your friend about the problem, if you really aren’t able to talk to him or her. However, this might not work well; your friend might think the email is a prank, for instance, or he or she might feel anxious about who sent it. The best option is usually just to talk face-to-face with your friend.

, Try starting with something like: “This is going to be awkward, but I’m your friend and I’ve got to tell you something…” Stress that you’re trying to help your friend without embarrassing him or her. You should also let your friend know that you won’t tell others about the problem, and keep your word.

,


Try something like: “Your hair looks great today! But you know, there’s something else I’ve noticed. I wonder if your deodorant’s not working right….”
You can also try the “positive sandwich” method, where you say something nice first, then break the bad news, then end by saying something encouraging again. After telling your friend about the odor problem, say something like “it should be really easy to take care of,” or offer another compliment.

,


Sometimes saying less is more. You don’t have to give a long explanation or beat around the bush. Just be clear to your friend about the problem and he or she should get it.

, If you can suggest a possible cause of your friend’s odor—even if it’s a white lie—it might help him or her feel like you’re being helpful rather than just critical. Some possibilities include:


Bad breath could be caused by certain foods, such as garlic.Food odors might also linger on clothing. Try saying something like: “Wow, that pizza must have been heavy on the garlic, because I can kind of smell it on you. When that happens to me, I make sure to wear X kind of deodorant.”
Synthetic fabrics like nylon can retain moisture and odor more than natural fibers like cotton and wool.If your friend is wearing synthetic fabrics, mention the odor problem and say that it happens to you when you wear fabrics like that unless you wash them frequently, wear plenty of deodorant, etc.
Many people are susceptible to body odor after hard physical labor, playing sports, or exercising.Heat can cause people to sweat, which can contribute to body odor. Say the problem might be caused by the weather, if it is really hot and/or humid.
Some people sweat more when they're nervous. Suggest that maybe your friend is stressed about something, and that is causing sweating and an odor problem.
Remember that certain illnesses and medications can cause body odor. Since health can be another sensitive issue, you might not want to discuss these causes as a possibility unless your friend brings it up first.

, Mentioning to your friend that it’s not his or her fault if he or she wasn’t aware of the odor problem shows sympathy and can make the talk easier.


You can mention again that it has happened to you, too.

, If you are direct and kind with your friend, there may be no need to tell him or her whether or not others have noticed the smell.

, In some cases, you can give your friend direct help with his or her odor problem. For instance, you can offer personal care items—just make sure to do it in private so that others don’t see and make your friend feel embarrassed. You can also offer social support.


If the problem is caused by bad breath, you can offer mints or gum.If the problem is caused by body odor, you can offer deodorant, by saying something like: “Hey, I’ve got some stuff with me that will help.”Alternatively, you can just mention a good type or brand for your friend to try, if you think that he or she wouldn’t react well to actually being handed deodorant or similar items.
Offer to check how your friend smells in the future, since it can be hard to tell on one’s own.
Let your friend know again that you won’t tell others, and stick to your word.

, Let your friend know you’re glad he or she let you talk to him or her, and ask that your friend does the same for you if you ever need it.

Talk to your doctor about a sympathectomy.",How to Deal with Hyperhidrosis or Hyperhydrosis (Excessive Perspiration)," Hyperhidrosis is a relatively mysterious condition where the nerves responsible for triggering the sweat glands become overactive for reasons unknown — although the problem becomes worse with stress or nervousness. Hyperhidrosis usually affects the hands, feet, underarms or face bilaterally (on both sides of the body) and episodes occur at least weekly during waking hours.Some people suffering with hyperhidrosis constantly sweat throughout the day.


People with severe hyperhidrosis can run the risk of dehydration unless they replenish their lost fluids with plenty of water.
Approximately 3% of the population experience bouts of hyperhidrosis, particularly adults aged 25 to 65 years.;
, Most antiperspirants found in grocery stores and pharmacies contain aluminum-based compounds that can temporarily block the pores that release sweat.Consequently, the sweat doesn't reach the surface of the skin and eventually gets reabsorbed by the body. As such, apply liberal amount of antiperspirants under your arms, as well as onto the palms of your hands and soles of your feet. It may feel a little strange, but likely better than the clamminess that's commonly associated with hyperhidrosis.


Over-the-counter antiperspirants are usually best for cases of minor hyperhidrosis only.
If you're applying antiperspirant to your hands, you may want to use unscented varieties, especially if you anticipate greeting people and shaking hands with them.

, Choose clothing wisely if you have hyperhidrosis. You should always wear clothes that are breathable and made from natural fabrics, such as cotton, light wool and silk.When you exercise, consider wearing more advanced fabrics that are designed to wick moisture away from your skin. Cotton socks are best for sweaty feet, although you still might have to change them multiple times per day. Shoes made from natural materials (especially leather and suede) can help prevent excessive sweating by allowing your feet to breathe.


Rotate the shoes you wear because they may not completely dry overnight. If you must wear damp shoes, use a hair dryer to get them as dry as possible.
Using talcum powder in your shoes might help absorb moisture and prevent them from being constantly damp. Chronic dampness increases the risk of mold growth.

, The more you sweat, the more salts, toxins and sugars get deposited on your skin, which attracts bacteria. The compounds in sweat combined with the waste material from the proliferating bacteria greatly contribute to foul body odor. As such, people with hyperhidrosis need to bathe more often (at least daily if not twice daily) to help keep the number of bacteria in check and to keep from becoming too malodorous.Regular soap is fine for combating bacteria, but buy brands that have natural moisturizers (aloe, almond extract) in them so your skin doesn't get too dry and flaky. After taking a shower or bath, make sure to dry yourself thoroughly, especially between your toes and under your arms.


People who sweat profusely on a regular basis are more prone to bacterial skin infections, particularly from ingrown toenails and minor abrasions.
Excessive loss of electrolytes is another issue for people with moderate-to-severe hyperhidrosis because sweat contains salt. Loss of electrolytes often leads to muscle cramping.

, There are a variety of herbal preparations that have been used by various cultures over many generations to combat excessive sweating, although none have been thoroughly studied by Western scientists to determine their effectiveness. However, there are many anecdotal reports that applying certain herbs as antiperspirant or consuming them internally can help combat hyperhidrosis. For example, witch hazel extract is strongly astringent, which dries skin and acts as an effective antiperspirant virtually anywhere on the body.The tannic acid in black tea is also very astringent, so washing parts of your body with cold tea may be very helpful to combat sweating.


Other herbs traditionally used to reduce sweating include white vinegar, sage tea, slices of raw potato, tea tree oil, and camphor combined with coconut oil.
Most herbal preparations diluted in water are safe and appropriate to use in all areas of the body, although some might sting your eyes, so be cautious when washing your face.

, Stress caused by your job and/or personal relationships can create anxiety and trigger bouts of hyperhidrosis. Consequently, try to deal with the stress in your life by making positive changes and/or train yourself to combat anxious thoughts by being more optimistic and innovative. In other words, try to ""turn lemons into lemonade"" more often. Excessive stress triggers the sympathetic nervous system to release hormones that prepare your body for ""fight or flight"" — and a side effect of that mode is more sweating.Avoid reading about stressful events in the newspaper and watching stressful, scary or thrilling shows on TV. Instead, read more motivational, inspiring and/or comedic material and watch comedies or documentaries.
Try natural relaxation techniques such as meditation, tai chi, yoga, breathing exercises and/or biofeedback — all can help reduce the stress that triggers sweating.

, If your efforts at home aren't satisfactory, then your doctor may prescribe an antiperspirant with a higher percentage of aluminum chloride (about 20%), such as Drysol or Xerac Ac. This is the first line of treatment against hyperhidrosis.Prescription antiperspirants are usually applied just before bedtime and left on overnight, then washed off in the morning. It often takes three to five days to see noticeable results.


Aluminum chloride products work best if applied to a dry area and then covered with plastic wrap overnight.
Prescription antiperspirants can cause skin and eye irritation, so be careful handling them. If your skin becomes chronically irritated, hydrocortisone cream is usually recommended in combination with the aluminum chloride product.

, The injection of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox, Myobloc) into particularly sweaty areas is another treatment option for hyperhidrosis.Botox also has anticholinergic effects as it decreases the transmission of the nerve impulses to the sweat glands and reduces sweating. Botulinum injections for the underarms to reduce sweating is approved by the FDA. However, several injections are required for significant results, which can relieve symptoms for between three to nine months, but the potential long-term dangers of Botox injections are not well understood.


Keep in mind that this is a second line treatment. Botox injections can be painful and expensive, so it is bets to try first line treatment options first.
Just like getting Botox for facial wrinkles, your underarm skin is iced or anesthetized before getting injected.
A 2008 study found Botox to be more effective than topical 20% aluminum chloride antiperspirant for the treatment of moderate-to-severe underarm hyperhidrosis., Microwave thermolysis is a procedure that uses microwave energy to destroy the endocrine glands that produce sweat. The FDA approved this treatment for hyperhidrosis in 2011. However, your body will still be able to cool itself down after the procedure because only 2% of your sweat glands are in your armpits.Most insurance companies do not cover microwave thermolysis, so check your insurance before you consider this treatment.
The procedure is painless because your doctor will numb your armpits before starting.
Multiple sessions are required. Each session lasts about an hour, but most patients report reduced sweating after only two sessions.

, Common systemic agents (taken orally) used to treat hyperhidrosis include anticholinergic medications (propantheline bromide, glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, benztropine).Anticholinergics are relatively effective because they block the preglandular neurotransmitter (acetylcholine) that triggers sweat secretion. However, the down side is that these medications commonly create numerous side effects such as mydriasis (pupil dilation), blurry vision, dry mouth and eyes, difficulty urinating and constipation.


Anticholinergics used to treat hyperhidrosis are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for that purpose and are being used ""off label"", which is legal, but not always considered ideal.
Other systemic medications used off label for hyperhidrosis include sedatives and tranquilizers, indomethacin (anti-iflammatory drug) and calcium channel blockers.

, Iontophoresis was introduced over 50 years ago and consists of passing a direct low-level electrical current across the skin of water-soaked hands, feet and armpits in order to reduce sweating.The mechanism of action remains debatable, but it is effective and without any significant side effects. Treatment is usually 2-3 times a week for 20-30 minute sessions, and slowly decreases over time (like once every two months), although the devices are often required to be bought or some hospitals/GPs might loan them out for patients to take home for the sake of convenience. Most hospitals that have a dermatological area have one and the waiting lists are usually quite short. Iontophoresis is not an option for people who have pacemakers or are pregnant.
Anticholinergic agents can be mixed in water to soak the skin to make the procedure a little more effective, but it also triggers occasional side effects.
Side effects such as irritation are common, and also some patients experience light electric shocks after the treatment.

, A sympathectomy is a surgical procedure to reduce sweating by blocking a group of nerves in your chest. This nerve group sends signals to your brain that cause your body to sweat. In someone with hyperhidrosis, cutting off this signal can put a stop to excessive sweating.Like any surgery there are risks,but new endoscopic techniques have made the surgery safer than it used to be.
A sympathectomy should not be your first choice. It is a last resort treatment. If nothing else works for you, then a sympathectomy may be a good option.

Apply an antiperspirant.,
Eat a healthy, well-balanced diet to maintain a normal weight.,
Wear breathable fabrics.,
Reduce stress.,
Avoid foods and drinks that can increase sweating.,
Minimize foods or situations that trigger hot flashes.,
See your doctor about underlying conditions that can cause excess sweating.,
Consult a dermatologist for medical treatments.",How to Control Sweaty Smelly Underarms1," Perspiring is your body’s natural way of cooling itself in a number of situations. While sweat alone is normal and indeed healthy, there may still be situations where you would prefer not to sweat, such as during a date or during an important presentation. The aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants actually block the pores to prevent sweating.If you feel as though you produce more sweat than your over-the-counter antiperspirant can handle, you can speak with your doctor about prescription-strength antiperspirants.Use this nightly; it may take up to a week to notice a difference.
If you would prefer a natural alternative to chemical-laden antiperspirants, then try rubbing a raw potato under your arms. The starch contained in a potato can similarly block pores to reduce the amount that you sweat.Dusting your armpits with cornstarch can also help.;
, Individuals who are obese will often sweat more because it requires more energy to move. Skin folds will also trap moisture and increase body odor with an increase in bacterial growth., Synthetic fabrics that do not allow your armpits to breathe will increase your sweat response. Natural fabrics — cotton, wool, and silk — are better at letting your skin breathe.As an exception, certain synthetic fabrics, especially those meant for exercise wear, have been developed to absorb or wick moisture from your skin.Purchase active wear made from these materials to help reduce sweat.

, Emotionally and physically stressful situations will increase the sweat response in your body. Learn stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, meditation, affirmations, listening to music, getting enough sleep, and eating a balanced diet.


This also includes trying to disarm emotionally stressful situations in your life, such as those surrounding work or relationships.

, Caffeine, alcohol, spicy foods, garlic, curries, and onions can all increase the amount that you sweat.Try cutting back on dishes and beverages that contain these ingredients.

, Women going through menopause often have particular hot flash triggers—such as caffeine and lack of sleep—that lead to increased sweating.Avoid these triggers to help reduce your sweat response.

, Increased sweating can be a symptom of a larger medical condition. See your physician to rule out:Diabetes (or general blood sugar imbalances)
Endocarditis
Generalized anxiety disorder
HIV
Hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating)
Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid)
Tuberculosis
Leukemia
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma
Some medications can also be responsible for your increased sweat response. If you developed the symptoms in association with a new medication, then ask your doctor about similar medications that may not induce sweating.

, If none of these steps seem to have helped with your sweating, then you can consult a dermatologist for medical options. Your doctor and dermatologist will likely only consider medical options if you have actually been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). Options available include:Botox injections, which use botulinum toxin to help reduce the amount of sweating produced by the body under the arms. This works by blocking the release of acetylcholine, thereby temporarily reducing sweat production. This can be an effective, but expensive, treatment.
Surgical removal of the sweat glands, which is an outpatient procedure performed using local anesthesia.
Microwave thermolysis, which is used to destroy the sweat glands with microwave energy. It is usually administered in two 20–30 minute sessions, separated by three months.
Iontophoresis, which uses electrical currents to decrease sweating.
Oral prescription medications that systematically limit sweating. These include anticholinergics such as glycopyrrolate, oxybutynin, benztropine, propantheline, and others.
Sympathectomy, which is where your surgeon attempts to stop the nerve signals that your body sends to sweat glands. It is a major surgery, requiring hospitalization. Possible side effects include loss of feeling under the arm, low blood pressure, inability to tolerate heat, and even an irregular heartbeat.

, One of the simplest way to stop sweaty palms is to avoid activities that trigger them, such as:


Spicy foods, alcohol, caffeine and nicotine.Excessive physical activity or heat., For many, sweaty palms are triggered by emotions like fear, anxiety or anger.. Counseling with a psychologist or psychiatrist may help deal with these emotions and reduce sweating. Acupuncture, yoga or meditation may also help reduce the stress that leads to sweating., There are a variety of herbal remedies that may reduce sweating. Try soaking your hands in sage or chamomile tea, or taking tablets containing sage, valerian root, or St. John’s Wort.Check with your doctor before taking St. John's Wort, especially if you take other medications., Combine equal parts baking soda and warm water and soak your hands for 25 minutes. The baking soda will help keep your hands dry for several hours., The drying agents in baby powder will help counteract mild sweating."

Learn what causes underarm odor.,
Identify times and situations that cause sweat-related odors.,
Shower daily.,
Change your clothes daily.,
Use a deodorant.,
Shave your armpits.,
Avoid specific foods and drinks that can increase body odor.,
Eat green vegetables.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Control Sweaty Smelly Underarms2," Your body has two distinct types of sweat glands — eccrine and apocrine.Apocrine glands are located in areas with dense hair follicles, making them the types of glands associated with your underarms.However, neither type of sweat gland produces odor. Sweat is primarily a combination of water and salt, and the odor associated with sweat actually comes from the combination of the sweat and the naturally occurring bacteria that lives on your skin., Since the sweat itself does not actually contain a bad odor, you may notice specific situations where you sweat without any associated smell. Try to isolate the specific situations where you become painfully aware of the odor caused by sweating.


Some of these situations commonly include after exercise, if you haven’t bathed, if you haven’t changed your clothes, or if you’ve eaten pungent foods or consumed alcohol., Showering every day helps to reduce the bacterial growth on your body and therefore the potential for body odor.You should also shower after intense physical exercise such as playing a sport or a trip to the gym because the excess sweat during the activity produces a breeding ground for more bacteria.

, In addition to showering daily, you should also change your clothing daily. Contact with your underarms spreads the bacteria on your skin to the armpit crease on shirts as well, which will produce smelly results if you wear the same shirt for several days.

, Deodorants are over-the-counter products that eliminate odor while still allowing your body to cool itself through perspiration.They’re typically alcohol based, making the applied area acidic and uninviting for bacteria.If you prefer a natural alternative to a deodorant, you can use white or apple cider vinegar or even a fresh lemon under your arms since these will also affect the pH of your underarms in ways that reduce the growth of bacteria.You may want to mix these (especially any vinegar) with a few drops of an essential oil of your choice since they can also leave you with a particularly strong smell.

, Most men will likely scoff at the idea, but hairy armpits provide a much larger area for odor-causing bacteria to spread. By reducing the overall amount of bacteria, you can reduce odor.


Even if you’re opposed to shaving your armpits entirely, you can still trim down the hair significantly, which will work better than not at all.

, The foods you eat can have an effect on your natural aroma, which is then exacerbated when sweating. Common foods and drinks associated with pungent body odors include garlic, onions, curry, alcohol, and caffeinated beverages.Try temporarily cutting these out of your diet or at least minimizing them to test for a difference in odor.


Even dietary imbalances in vitamins and minerals such as magnesium and zinc can also lead to strong body odor., In addition to avoiding certain foods, eating more of certain foods can also decrease pungent body odors. Food high in chlorophyll (green vegetables) have been shown to have the potential to decrease body odor., Foods that can affect your body odor will have more pungency if you’re dehydrated. By drinking plenty of water, you will give your body the optimal ability to remove waste products without increasing body odor."

Use antiperspirants as a first option.,
Take oxybutynin or glycopyrrolate orally.,
Try iontophoresis.,
Get a botulinum toxin (Botox) injection.",How to Cure Sweaty Hands2," Your doctor can prescribe an antiperspirant containing aluminum chloride, which plugs the sweat glands. Prescribed antiperspirants are stronger and much more effective than antiperspirants you can buy over the counter. Apply it at night just before you go to sleep and wash it off in the morning., Oxybutynin and glycopyrrolate are anticholinergics: drugs which inhibit the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, thereby inhibiting the nerve impulses that trigger sweating.This can help reduce sweating of the palms and other areas of your body. Studies show improvement in over 80% of patients, with limited side effects.Side effects may include blurred vision, dry mouth, and difficulty sleeping.

, Iontophoresis uses a weak electric current passed through water or a wet pad to temporarily shut down the sweat glands. It is effective at reducing sweating in 50-75% of cases.Treatment sessions last 20 to 30 minutes. You will need 2 to 3 a week at first to shut down the sweat glands.Once you see results, you will need to repeat treatment as necessary, typically between once a week and once a month.You can be treated at your dermatologist’s office, or purchase an at home iontophoresis kit for $200-1000. Your insurance company may cover the cost if you don't respond to other treatments.

, A number of injections are given to the palms. This should only be done by a trained physician. Botox treatment has been shown to be highly effective, significantly reducing sweat production in 84% of individuals after 1 week, 76% after a month, and 50% after 6 months.Botox injections are more effective and last longer than iontophoresis. Although, you will need to receive the injections every 3-6 months.
However, the potential side effects, though usually short lived, are more serious, including possible pain at the site of injections, nausea, and compensatory sweating on other areas of the body."

Use surgery to permanently cure sweaty palms.,
Know the risks of ETS.,
Consult your doctor to see if ETS surgery is right for you.",How to Cure Sweaty Hands3," An endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a major surgical procedure in which small incisions are made in the side of the chest, and the nerves that control sweating in the palms are cut or clipped.It has been shown to cure sweaty palms in up to 92% of patients., While ETS can permanently cure sweaty palms, it has serious associated risks:


Sweating returns in approximately 6% of patients who are initially cured.The more effectively ETS reduces sweaty palms, the more likely it is to lead to compensatory sweating elsewhere, particularly the face and neck.It can lead to bleeding into the chest during surgery.
Air can become trapped inside the chest, causing pain and difficulty breathing.
Damage to the nervous system many cause the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop permanently., Because of the possible serious side effects, doctors will usually try to control sweaty palms in other ways before resorting to surgery. However, if preventative treatments fail, ETS may be a good options. 92% of patients who receive ETS say they would ask for the operation again if it were to be redone."

Develop and follow a good daily hygiene routine.,
Make your skin less hospitable to odor causing bacteria.,
Use baby wipes on the go.,
Buy a deodorant that contains aluminum chloride.,
Prepare your armpits before you apply deodorant.,
Apply deodorant to your underarms twice daily.,
Always wear clean clothing and wash your clothing after each use.,
Spritz your dry clean only items with a vinegar and water solution.,
Keep a set of clean dry clothes handy.,
Invest in some moisture wicking clothing.,
Evaluate your diet.,
Reduce or eliminate the foods that you identify as potential contributors to your body odor.,
Incorporate more foods and beverages into your diet that help to make you smell nice.",How to Control Body Odor," A good daily hygiene routine will help minimize the bacteria that cause offensive body odor. Include the following practices in your daily routine.



Shower or take a bath daily. Wash your entire body with antibacterial body wash or soap, paying special attention to your underarms, groin, and feet. Use a washcloth or pouf to wash these areas thoroughly.

Shave your armpits daily. Hair provides additional surface area for bacteria to multiply, but by shaving daily you will reduce the number of odor causing bacteria on your body.

Dry yourself thoroughly. After you get squeaky lean, dry yourself off with a clean, dry towel. Excess moisture provides a breeding ground for bacteria, so dry your armpits especially well.;
, After showering and before applying deodorant, spritz your underarms with white or apple cider vinegar and then wipe them dry with a cloth. This extra step will reduce the number of odor causing bacteria on your skin and help you to smell better all day.

, In addition to showering daily, keep your armpits and other parts of your body clean and sweat free by using baby wipes or adult body wipes.

, Although some scientists have suggested a link between aluminum chloride deodorants and breast cancer, conclusive evidence of this link has yet to be found.If you are still concerned, you can purchase a deodorant without aluminum chloride. However, deodorants without aluminum chloride will not be as effective against sweating. The aluminum chloride in antiperspirant deodorants will reduce sweating and less sweat means less odor causing bacteria. If your body odor is especially strong, ask your doctor about a prescription strength deodorant.

, Make sure that your armpits are clean and dry. It is best to apply deodorant right after you have showered, but if it has been a few hours since your last shower, use a washcloth and soap to clean your armpits and remove any excess sweat. Then, dry your armpits thoroughly before you apply your deodorant.

, Apply your deodorant once in the morning and again in the afternoon or evening. Deodorant wears off as you move and sweat throughout the day, so a second application is crucial for keeping dry and maintaining a pleasant scent.

, Do not re-wear clothing—especially shirts, undergarments, and socks—because odor causing bacteria can attach to clothing and multiply. , Since washing your dry clean only garments every time you wear them may not be an option, you can keep odor causing bacteria at bay with a simple vinegar and water solution.For your dry clean only items, prepare a 50/50 mixture of vinegar and water, turn the garment inside out, and spritz a little of the vinegar/water mixture onto the underarm area of your garment. (Spot test your garment first to make sure the vinegar solution does not cause any discoloration.) Repeat this process after each wear.

, Stash an appropriate spare shirt in your car, gym bag, and/or office so that you can change out of sweaty clothing on the go.

, Moisture wicking clothing is specially designed to help keep you dry during workouts. Wearing moisture wicking clothing will reduce the amount of sweat and bacteria on your body and your clothing.

, Some foods can contribute to body odor, so it is worthwhile to think about what you eat and consider reducing or eliminating foods that may be making your situation worse. Think about how often you include the following foods in your diet.



Spicy foods. Foods that are spicy may significantly raise your body temperature and make you sweat more than usual.

Meat. A study published in Chemical Senses found that men who abstained from meat for 2 weeks smelled better to the opposite sex than men who did not abstain.Sulfurous foods. Some foods contain higher amounts of sulfur than other foods, which contribute to body odor. Limit your intake of eggs, cheese, onions, garlic, broccoli, cabbage, and cauliflower. Alcohol. When you drink alcoholic beverages, the unpleasant smell of of the alcohol may linger on your skin and breath.Caffeine. Drinking too much coffee or other caffeinated beverages (cola, tea, etc.) may cause you to sweat more than usual., This process may be difficult, especially if some of your favorite foods and beverages seem to be contributing to your body odor. But remember your reasons for reducing or eliminating these items and go slowly. Try reducing or eliminating one item per week until you have made the necessary adjustments.

, Chew on parsley after dinner, eat oranges or apples between meals, drink water with lemon throughout the day, sip herbal tea instead of your usual afternoon coffee, or add a sprinkle of cinnamon to your morning oatmeal."

Wear comfortable and sporty clothes.,
Maintain good hygiene practices.,
Adopt Artemis' attitude.,
Have courage.,
Love nature.,
Take up archery.,
Be respectful towards males but keep your distance.,
Love the night.",How to Act Like the Greek Goddess Artemis," Try to stick to a color-scheme of grey and silver (silver is her symbolic color). Add moon accessories (for example, a necklace).;
, Artemis is supposed to be beautiful so take care of yourself (she is not vain, though). If you wear makeup, do it naturally or try a little silver eyeshadow. Otherwise, simply be clean or be natural.

, Artemis is very mysterious and quiet. This doesn't mean that you can't have any friends but make sure they are close and you can trust them. She enjoys solitude; learn to enjoy being alone without feeling lonely.

, Artemis is not afraid of anything and has a tough attitude. She is pretty intelligent as well.

, Naturally, get involved with environmental organisations. Try joining Greenpeace, for example. You can also get a pet, like a dog. Also respect nature (don't trample on plants, don't throw trash on the ground, take your bike instead of the car etc.).

, Artemis' weapons are her bows and arrows so you should definitely take it up. Maybe you can even get your own bow and arrows but don't tell other people that they are ""mythical"" or anything like it. That is not a very Artemis-like thing to do.

, Artemis was quite hostile towards males. However, this is not recommended; do not be unnecessarily rude to men, seeing that you're not actually an all-powerful goddess. Instead, be respectful and simply keep your distance and don't be fooled by their wiles.


Artemis is chaste, so at least consider not having any male friends or a boyfriend.
If you are a teen, remember that teenage boys are still immature and they are not worthy of your time. Focus more on yourself and more important things in life.

, Know everything there is to know about the moon, for Artemis is the goddess of the moon. Study all the constellations' it's not impossible to learn all of them. Learn a lot about stars, their cycles, read quick facts, watch documentaries to help, etc. Basically. know a lot of facts about the night and embrace your love for it."

Steer clear of triclosan.,
Consider avoiding products with aluminum.,
Watch out for parabens.",How to Decode Your Deodorant Label1," Products that include triclosan usually market themselves as a relatively safe or environmentally friendly alternative. However, this antimicrobial agent can disrupt your hormone balance and affect thyroid function or have other serious effects on your health. Further, triclosan accumulates in your body, increasing the risk of detrimental effects.


Note that, as of September 2016, triclosan can no longer be included in certain over-the-counter antibacterial cosmetics, as it has been proven to be both dangerous and ineffective.;
, Artificial antiperspirants rely on aluminum, which some experts believe is a significant factor in the development of Alzheimer's disease.That said, other sources point out that a definitive link between antiperspirants and Alzheimer's disease and/or cancer has not been demonstrated., It’s likely best to avoid products that contain parabens. Parabens have been proven to complicate your body’s ability to regulate estrogen. Though unproven, its has been theorized that this may increase the risk of cancer. Fortunately, most deodorant and antiperspirant brands no longer contain parabens.If you wish to avoid parabens altogether, avoid ingredients that contain “methyl,” “ethyl,” “propyl,” “benzyl,” and “butyl” within their names.

, This is a hint their armpits don't smell too pleasant. Ask them to use it many times, before and after going to public places. Also ask them if they will use it before doing a physical activity.

, Ask them to take a shower about 2 times a day. This removes the sweat and gives them a fresh scent. Also ask them to use soap.

, If they hear people like their aroma, they will probably keep doing it to get noticed. Don't get too into it or they might get grossed out.

, They will probably ask him/her to smell good also. If you want to, you can even bribe them to ask him to.

Get the right clothes.,
Invest in some good high heels, such as thigh-high stiletto boots.,
Wear a corset.,
Other accoutrements associated with being a domina, include:


Fishnet stockings or garter stockings.",How to Act Like a Dominatrix1," A full-bodied (often black) catsuit is a mainstay of fetish and bondage culture. There's a difference between a dominant lifestyle and fetishism, but the skintight black bodysuit remains an iconic garment in both communities. Make sure your suit is made from leather, or rubber latex. This is much more suited to use in the bedroom (or otherwise) than day to day use. Find some sexy, designer dresses. Make sure they suit you, and fit you well.;
, Like the catsuit, these boots represent dominatrix attire to mainstream culture. Platform boots can also be worn. Try Christian Louboutin heels; the red sole reflects your secret, sexual nature.

, A corset is a close-fitting undergarment (often worn as outerwear) that helps shape (and hold) your body. A bondage corset has become a staple in fetish wear. A bustier can also be worn as an alternative.

,
Gloves; try finger-less or elbow length.
A whip or riding crop.

Look for deodorant with baking soda and coconut oil.,
Add scent yourself with essential oils.,
Use deodorant instead of antiperspirant.,
Look for ingredients like cornstarch and arrowroot powder.,
Get a deodorant with Aloe or Vitamin E. Both of these ingredients can help reduce skin irritation after shaving.,
Don’t be alarmed by a transition period.",How to Decode Your Deodorant Label2," These are two of the safest and most effective ingredients you can find in deodorants. Baking soda helps neutralize odor surprisingly well, while coconut oil kills fungi, yeast, and bacteria that contribute to unpleasant aromas. Coconut oil also naturally moisturizes.For an especially economical option, go with a Tom’s of Maine product, such as Beautiful Earth women’s deodorant, or Mountain Spring men’s deodorant.
Some other products you can find at a healthy cosmetics store or online include Bare Bones Body Deodorant Stick and Schmidt’s Deodorant Jar.

, Not do only do essential oils have powerful and appealing aromas, they have naturally antibacterial properties. Simply purchase an unscented deodorant and add a drop of any essential oil to avoid artificial aromatics.


A good example of an unscented or essential oil deodorant is the Nourish Organic Deodorant Sticks. There is an unscented version, and there are also options that are already scented with essential oils and extracts. Aromas include lavender, fig, and almond vanilla., While this article focuses on deodorants, it’s worth noting that many ingredients commonly found in other popular underarm products may give cause for concern. In any event, they are also often unnecessary.Antiperspirants work by blocking your body from sweating, which hampers your body’s ability to release harmful toxins. Stated most simply, it's healthy to sweat.
In short, products marked only as “deodorant” are almost always a better option than those marked with something like “antiperspirant and deodorant.”

, There are certainly occasions when you may wish to reduce the amount you normally sweat. In these scenarios, consider using a natural antiperspirant.Arrowroot powder and cornstarch, for instance, will help keep your pits dry and control odor. Meanwhile, they won’t clog the pores in your pits, so they still allow your body to get rid of toxins.

, If you shave your armpits, choose a deodorant that includes these ingredients to help diminish both post-shave discomfort as well as the little red bumps that sometimes follow a close shave., You may notice that you will actually sweat a bit more after you switch away from a synthetic product. This will occur precisely because your body is expelling toxins, including preservatives and artificial fragrances. After this purge concludes, you may find yourself sweating less than you used to, as the body has fewer toxins to get rid of."

Use the Healthy Living App.,
Default towards organic deodorants.,
See through false marketing claims.",How to Decode Your Deodorant Label3," The non-profit Environmental Working Group has created an app that you can use to check any cosmetic product for potential risks to your health. Download the app, which is available for free. Use it by scanning a product’s bar code, see its health and safety rating, and read reviews.The app also allows you to check food products. It can greatly diminish the research you would otherwise need to do to ensure the products you’re purchasing are safe.

, One of the easiest ways to ensure you’re not exposing yourself to too many potentially dangerous ingredients is to choose an organic deodorant. You won't have to read the label too closely; they will include ingredients of all sorts, all of which will be natural.


Organic deodorants don't necessarily come in traditional deodorant applicators. For instance, they may come in roll-on applicators, jars, and even pump-top bottles of deodorizing lotion.
Good examples include Ambre Blends Natural Deodorant, Nubian Heritage All Natural Deodorant, Lavilin Deodorant, and Soapwalla Deodorant Cream.You can find them online.

, The vague benefits that cosmetic labels often imply can make often be hard to decipher. For instance, the phrase “clinically proven” indicates only that the product was tested on people experimentally. It does not mean that a rigorous clinical study was done with a large number of test subjects. In short, never assume that something a cosmetic label claims is backed up by legitimate scientific studies.


FDA regulations on the claims that cosmetics labels make are much less stringent than they are on drugs.
""Dermatologist tested” does not necessarily indicate that the product was legitimately scientifically tested.Similarly, “hypoallergenic” does not necessarily indicate that a product is any safer than another, even for those with sensitive skin. This is purely a marketing term."

Be confident.,
Have a plan.,
Be flexible to your partner's needs.,
Hold yourself correctly.,
Keep in mind that it is not the clothes that make a domme.",How to Act Like a Dominatrix2," How can you dominate someone if you can't assert yourself? Focus on the fact that you are in charge.

, There's a big role-playing component with being a dominatrix. Be creative.

, A dominatrix must be well versed in common BDSM practices.


A pro-dominatrix may choose to have little or no sexual contact with her clients. However many do offer a full range of sexual services for their clients. Regardless of this she holds her submissive clients power in her hands - with mutual consent - and if she has sexual contact with a client she remains in complete control of what is happening.
Train to use a whip or a riding crop correctly. It requires some exercise to use it the right way where it gives the desired level of pain and burning red stripes on the skin of your client - but no wounds. Don't use too much power.

, Remember; you hold all of the power; maintain good posture and carry yourself up right at all times. This lets people know subconsciously that you are in charge.

, Rather it is her self confidence, self awareness, and ability to control the conversation. The women in tight revealing clothes is more an image that can bring out the wrong behaviors in male, as it can simply reinforce that it is all about him. Instead, make it clear that it is all about you and your pleasures and amusements.


Also keep in mind that becoming a dominatrix takes other skills. Some of which are interpersonal and customer service oriented. Proper money management and perhaps marketing. Also like most self employed people you may go through phases of little to no business. In other words if money is the only reason you'd like to become a dominatrix you may want to save up an actual nest egg to venture into it.

Be self-reliant.,
Practice self-denial.,
Make the best of every situation.,
Chase meaning over money.,
Speak with your actions, not your mouth.,
Have a sense of humor.,
Read often.,
Never walk past someone in need.,
Practice kindness.,
Accept responsibility for your actions.",How to Act Like a Man," Entitlement is your enemy! Stop looking for handouts. If you haven’t earned it, don’t expect it from anyone. Be the guy others lean on for support.;
, Life is a marathon and real life isn't full of immediate gratification. Understand this, and conduct yourself as such. If you feel that you struggle with self-denial, reflect on your day to day routine and take out all the junk. This could be TV, junk food, or even pornography.

, Make the observation that there's someone who could have the life you live, and win with it. In order to make wise decisions you cannot be afraid to stand alone on your principles and values. Men don't need groups or numbers to validate decisions that work best for everyone. No matter how dark a situation is, learn to always see the light at the end of the tunnel. Look at the lives of the greatest leaders and philosophers of all time: Mandela, Gandhi, MLK Jr.; all had the profound capability to make the best of every situation. No matter what turn their journey took, they always remained courageous within. This characteristic is so necessary that those who have it become heroes.

, Write a mental wish list right now. Was it all materialistic things? If so, understand that your life’s meaning cannot be found in things, or even considered valuable because you have money. Money with no meaning leads to an expensive funeral. As you grow older, you realize that. You may even began to feel that these 'things' lack meaning in your life, that they go from you owning ""it"" to the feeling ""it"" owns you. Fill your life with meaning. Live for experiences and adventure. Live for others, and the money will follow.

, Most talk, but don’t do. Men who are meek and simple get it done. Live deliberately and be firm with your actions and wise with your words.

, Laugh daily, especially at yourself. It’s important not to take yourself too seriously. Use humor as a scapegoat in life. Make jokes about yourself because it's medicine for the soul. Not only will humor help you socially and make you more likable, but it’s a great exercise to build confidence.

, Read everything. Read the experiences of other heroes. It will help you put things in perspective for your own life. Read about the industry you’re in, read about your community, and even read what you think you already know. The formula for your self-discovery may be hidden in a book.

, Gentlemen were knights. Since the beginning of time, men were protectors. We protected the hut, the family, and the village. Never ignore injustice, because men never turn away from violence on the defenseless.

, Be kind. Help others without looking for anything in return. Entitlement is weakness. Do what ought to be done because it's the right thing to do.

, Go out of the way to take the blame. A coward rarely sees his own faults, and blames others for his lack of success. Take ownership of your life. Realize that if you don't accomplish anything in life, it won’t be anybody's fault but yours.

Identify the character’s motivation.,
Find some humanity for the character.",How to Act Evil," Evil is typically associated with dark, foreboding colors, so when you’re planning a costume for a villainous character, that’s the color palette that you should start with. Black is the traditional option, but any dark shade, such as midnight blue or eggplant, can work well. Opt for clothes that have sleek, clean lines too. For example, a well-tailored suit is an attractive option for a male, while a form-fitting cocktail dress is an ideal costume for a villainess.Shades of red can work well for an evil costume too because it’s a color usually associated with the Devil. Opt for a bold bright red if your character is outgoing, or a deep maroon or brick red for a more reserved evil look.
Think about the fabrics that you choose for your clothing too. Leather tends to work well for evil characters, so consider incorporating a leather jacket, blazer, or vest in your costume. You can also opt for leather pants or a leather skirt.
If your character’s evilness is a surprise that comes out during a climactic moment, you shouldn’t go with an obvious costume of head to toe black. Instead, give subtle cues with your clothing that your character might be evil, such as a black t-shirt with a basic pair of jeans.;
, When you're planning your costume, you have to take the type of play or scene that you're working in, as well as the time period, into account. For example, while a villain in a Western and an evil character in a futuristic Sci Fi play might both wear black, their outfits will likely be very different otherwise. Make sure your clothing fits the tone and time period for the character’s story.If you're not entirely sure what's appropriate for your costume, consult movies or TV shows from the same genre for inspiration.
If the play takes place in a specific historical period, you can also do an online search for information about clothing from the era so your costume is historically accurate.

, While your clothing will probably stand out most about your costume, small details can really help bring your evil look into focus. That’s why you should also find some accessories to help bring your villain to life. For example, edgy jewelry, such as a spiked choker or bracelet, can help give you a sinister look. Leather gloves are another item that can give your character’s costume a more menacing feel.Your character may require a specialty accessory, such as an eye patch, that can help add to the villainous persona.
Don’t forget weapons, such as a gun or knife, that your character might use to cause harm to others.

, While there may be a variety of hairstyles that work well for your character, a sleek, slicked back do is usually the traditional look for an evil character. With short hair, that usually means just using some type of hair styling product to flatten your hair against the scalp. If you have long hair, you may want to slick your back in a similar way but pull the length into a sleek ponytail or bun.With short hair, you'll get a more intense look by slicking it straight back rather than parting it to the side.
Pomades work best for slicking back short hair. A clay-based formula gives you a matte finish, while an oil- or water-based pomade provides some shine, which is usually a good look if you’re on stage.
For women with long hair, start by applying mousse to the roots of your hair before blowing it back and away from your face.When you’re pulling your hair into a ponytail or bun, make sure that you brush all of it back and pull it as tightly as you comfortably can. Add some gel to the sides for a wet appearance.
Whether you have short or long hair, give your slicked back style a final spritz with hairspray to ensure that it stays in place.
Don’t overlook facial hair. A mustache or goatee can help give you a more evil look.

, For an evil look, it usually helps to go with dark, bold makeup. Go for a dark, smoky eye shadow look, and add plenty of black eyeliner. Even male characters who aren’t wearing much other makeup can look a little more sinister with some black liner around the eyes.For a simple smoky eye, apply a dark shade, such as black, navy, plum, brown, or charcoal, over your entire lid, blending upward toward the crease. Next, apply a light shade under your brow and blend it into your lid shade. Finish off with black liner and mascara.Pair your smoky eye with a mean red or dark colored lipstick for a more dramatic look.

, Making your face appear more angular can help give you a more severe, menacing look. Contouring your cheeks can do the trick, so apply a brown powder directly beneath your cheekbones, from the hollow where your cheek meets your ear to below the middle of your eye. If you’re going to be on stage, create a stark line so it will stand outMake sure to choose a brown contour shade that has gray undertones so it mimics the look of shadows.
Use a small brush to apply the contour powder, so you keep the line defined.

, To look the part of an evil character, it’s important to have a trademark glare that you can direct at other characters -- and in some cases, the audience. Think about how people look at you when they’re angry and try to mimic the expression. You can start by narrowing your eyes and squaring your jaw. Make sure to maintain eye contact with your co-stars as well because that can very intimidating.Avoid looking away and blinking. Try to imagine that you’re having a staring contest with your co-stars -- that can give you a more threatening look.
Practicing your evil stare in front of a mirror can help you perfect it. You may also want to try it out on friends and family, so they can provide feedback on how to make your look even more sinister.

, While a specific character might call for a certain type of voice, villains generally have deep, throaty voice that makes them sound more evil. If you have a naturally deep voice, you probably don’t have to alter it much. However, if your voice tends to be higher-pitched, try to give it a lower, more menacing sound. That means you want to speak from your chest register, so you sound deeper and more threatening.Identify your chest register by saying the word “whoa” in as deep a voice as you can. Keep your hand on your chest as you speak to feel the vibrations. Repeat the exercise several times. It may help to record yourself, so you can listen back to what your voice sounds like.
If you’re having trouble connecting with your chest register, get down on the floor on all fours with your head down. Say “whoa” in as deep as voice as you can without straining yourself, and concentrate on the vibrations in your chest so you know how you should speak for a deeper sound.
Practice your lines in your deeper voice to get used to speaking that way. You may also want to record yourself saying the lines so you can listen back and make improvements.

, Most evil characters have trademark laugh that makes them seem especially sinister. When you’re trying to find one for yourself, it’s important not to go too over the top, though, or you may wind up sounding like a cartoon character. The key to sounding evil is usually prolonging the laugh for an extended period. Making the laugh especially deep or loud can also help it sound more threatening.It often helps to start with a low laugh and have it become louder and deeper as it progresses.
The pace of your laugh can help it sound more sinister too. For example, slowing down your normal laugh may be enough to give it an evil feel.
Consider the context of the laugh when determining what it should sound like. For example, a light hearted, joyful laugh in a scene where your character has just witnessed the death of an innocent person can sound very evil.

, When you’re trying to act evil, the way you speak your lines is almost as important as the lines themselves. An villainous character should emphasize words that have a threatening connotation or mock the other characters. For example, if you tell another character, “You’re pathetic,” you may to make sure that you say “pathetic” with a hard edge so it feels like you’re really twisting the knife.Read your lines out loud so you can hear can hear which words you should stress. Highlight them in your script to help you when you practice.
If you’re not sure which words to emphasize, talk to your director to see what they works best for your character.

, An evil character likely carries a great deal of rage, but you can’t play every scene with uncontrolled anger. Instead, try to give shades to your character’s evil rage according to the story. For example, in an early scene, you may just glare at another character to convey your low-key anger. However, as you approach the climax of the story, you may lose control and start yelling and get physical with other characters. Vary the level of anger that you show so the evil doesn’t feel one note.Make sure that you understand what the character is angry about in every scene. It’s important to be able to justify it in your own mind.
The amount of anger that you display should relate to what’s at stake. For example, if your character is about to lose all of his power, you should probably play full-on rage. On the other hand, if the character’s only been insulted, you may opt for more controlled anger.

, Part of being truly evil is taking satisfaction in the misery of others. When you’re trying to act evil, it’s important to show how much joy your character gets when other people suffer -- and convey that even when you don’t have any lines that spell it out. For example, show a pleased smile when another character is crying or is worried about a loved one.If your back is to the audience for a certain scene, laughing at another character’s misfortune is an effective alternative to smiling.
In some cases, simply continuing to watch while another character suffers physical or emotional abuse can indicate that your character enjoys their misery.

, When you’re playing an evil character, you may have lines where you taunt or make fun of other characters. But even if you don’t, there are still ways to mock them so it’s clear that your character enjoys hurting others and making them feel inferior. You can try mirroring their expression, gestures, and posture in an obvious way or simply making faces when they are speaking., One of the reason that villains are often scary is that they have complete confidence in themselves, as well as their actions and beliefs. In fact, they’re usually the most confident characters in a story.To convey that type of confidence, pay attention to your posture. Stand up straight and expand your chest, almost as if you want to take up more space. Avoid fidgeting too.If you’re sitting down, lean back in your chair so you look as relaxed as possible.
When you’re moving, do so in a slow, steady manner so you appear more purposeful.

, There are many different kinds of evil characters that you can play. Your character may be someone who started out good but was betrayed so badly that they became evil. On the other hand, they may be someone who is pure evil from the start. You’ll likely have an easier time acting evil if you understand exactly where it’s coming from.Your evil character may be a sociopath or a psychopath. If that’s the case, it’s important to understand what that means. A sociopath typically has a weak conscience that may make them feel a little guilt after an evil act, but not enough to stop them from committing the act. A psychopath usually doesn’t have any conscience and feels no remorse for the evil acts they commit.Sociopaths are typically a product of their environment and experiences, while psychopaths usually have their evil ingrained in them.

, No matter what type of character you play, it is essential to understand what motivates them. However, it’s especially important with an evil character if you want to make them convincing. Three-dimensional villains usually believe that their behavior is justified, and you must know what justification your character uses. Determine what the motivation behind your character’s evil actions are, so you can make them believable.Some evil characters are motivated by the desire for power, while others are motivated by revenge. In some cases, it may simply be the misery of others that motivates a villain.

, If your evil character doesn’t feel human to the audience, you run the risk of creating a cartoon villain. Instead, try to find your character’s humanity even amidst all the evil. Think about what might make your character cry or laugh, or the soft spots that they might have that make them feel.In some cases, evil characters may only be able to feel for themselves, but that’s okay -- fear and self-pity are still emotions that can make a character seem human.

Throw yourself down into your chair dramatically. Sigh often and roll your eyes. Think about what dramatic actors and actresses do in movies and follow their example


If you want people to believe you, though, don’t go overboard. Make sure whatever you do is believable and goes along with whatever you’re talking about.
Waving your arms while you’re telling a story, or jumping up and down excitedly when you see a friend are both examples of exaggerated gestures.;
, Dramatic people cry very easily, and usually cry pretty often. It doesn’t take much to set off a dramatic person and make them cry. To act dramatic, cry a lot and do it in front of people. Make a big deal out of things that might seem trivial or silly to others. Maybe someone bumped into you in the hallway—you can act dramatic and cry over this small infraction.If something actually worth crying over does happen, a dramatic person would probably cry the loudest and longest. Taking a while to get over things and not letting things go are also things you can do to act dramatic.

, Drama doesn’t always mean sadness or anger. Sometimes, people who are dramatic take all emotions to the extreme. When something is funny or amusing, be the one to laugh the loudest. This will draw attention to you, which is an important part of acting dramatic.


Use your hands when laughing or reacting to things. Slap your thighs, clap your hands, or do other things to draw attention or make noise.

, By being flirtatious and flirting or being a little bit suggestive in your normal conversations, you will draw people in. Dramatic people love when others are drawn to them, and want to keep as much attention on themselves as possible. Lean in close when talking to people, brush your hand over their arm or shoulder, or give them a wink.You can flirt in non-sexual ways, even with people that aren’t of your preferred gender. Just be overly friendly, and a little suggestive in conversation. Adding phrases like “If you know what I mean…” to the end of things with a little wiggle of your eyebrows is suggestive, for example.

, If you want to be the center of attention and come off as dramatic, making sure you’re heard is important. Speak over other voices if you’re in a crowd, or even in a small group. Make your words and your conversation seem like the most important one happening, even if it isn’t about anything important.

, Dramatic people have a tendency to think about the worst possible scenario and focus on it. No matter what’s happening, express to everyone around you the worst thing that could happen, or the worst consequence. Try framing it as “What if…” until people pay attention to you.Jumping to conclusions and thinking negatively about even simple situations will help you come off as dramatic, or as someone who tends to blow things out of proportion. It can also help you draw attention to yourself by making others start to think the same way as you.
If something does go wrong, dramatic people are usually the first ones to point it out. Say something like “I told you so” or “I knew this would happen.”

, The way you react to things will really show others you are dramatic. If you don’t react at all to something that affects you, then you won’t appear as dramatic. Instead, if you have an over exaggerated reaction to even small things, like crying over a TV commercial or getting angry over something that happened to a friend but not to you, you will appear more dramatic.


Gasping is a great reaction tool. Gasp loudly and put your hand on your chest like you cannot believe what you just heard.
Exclaim things like “Oh my goodness!” when things happen. However you react, make sure it draws the attention to you.

, Dramatic people tend to move quickly from one feeling to the next, and they express each emotion to its extreme. One minute, you might act really happy about something, and then the next be very upset or angry. This will show others you’re dramatic, and it will keep the attention on you.Let people know exactly how you’re feeling all the time. Your emotions should be very clear to everyone around you. By over exaggerating your emotions or taking them to the extreme, no one will really ever wonder what mood you’re in.
Laughing loudly when you’re happy, or snapping rudely (or loudly) at others when you’re angry are good ways of going to the extreme. Stomping your feet, groaning when you’re annoyed, glaring when you’re mad, whining and complaining are also great options.

, Wearing loud or bright clothing can also draw attention to your outer appearance. Bright patterns and lots of accessories can make people look your way. Red is also a great color to wear if you want to nab some attention. It has been shown to be one of the most eye-catching colors, as it is often used to sell products and in advertisements, so pick a red shirt, dress, or accent piece to get noticed more., Especially when it comes to your eyes and lips, you can really use makeup to up the dramatic factor of your look. Dark, smoky eyes and dramatic red lips can really draw attention your way. Try using a dark eyeliner with a thick point that you can smudge around your eye, rather than relying on eye shadow. Put on some red lipstick for a pop of head-turning color.Apply your eyeliner along the top lid as you normally would, then use a cotton swab or your pinky fingertip to gently smudge it to create a smoky look.
Experiment with dark or bright lip colors to see what color best suits you.

, The most dramatic thing you can do is to make sure you remain the center of attention at all times. Dramatic people keep the focus on themselves, no matter what’s going on. It’s actually human nature to need and require attention, but dramatic people take that need to an extreme. Use this to your advantage. No matter the situation, turn the attention on yourself.Thriving on drama and attention this way can actually become an addiction for some people. Make sure that if you are only trying to act dramatic, you don’t let this get to you and become a problem.

, You don’t necessarily have to say anything negative or blatantly mean about someone, but passing along things you’ve heard and making a big deal out of it will work. For example, if you’ve heard about a new couple amongst people at your school or your group of friends, bring them up. Ask prying questions.Starting conversations with phrases like “Did you hear about…” is a way to grab people’s attention and keep it on you.

, For example, you might be telling a story about how you crashed your bike. In reality, all that happened was that you hit the curb, but instead, you’ll tell everyone that you smashed into the curb, flew through the air, and fell into a pile of garbage. It’s the language you’re using that changes the story and makes even small things seem like a big deal.


Think of words that signify extremes: huge, awesome, gigantic, horrible, to name a few. Apply these “big” words to “small” things. For example, if you broke a nail, you would describe it as having had a horrible day, and that there is no way it could be worse.

, Is it for an acting role? Is it because you want to fit in with a certain group of people? Whatever your reason for acting dramatic, make sure your reason is worth changing your personality and behaving in a new way. Even if you’re just going to be practicing for a short term role, changing your behavior can affect the people around you, so make sure you have a clear purpose in mind before you do that.


Make sure you aren’t trying to act dramatic to distract yourself from the real problems in your life. You should handle these problems properly so you can get past them., Acting dramatically all the time can really be draining and exhausting for the people around you to deal with. They might become tired of dealing with your dramatic behavior and end up distancing themselves from you to get a break from it. Make sure you’re prepared to deal with this if you plan to act dramatically all the time.


Acting dramatic can often be seen as a negative personality trait. You can eventually be seen as someone who is high maintenance, and your friends might not want to deal with that., If you’re preparing for a role or acting dramatic for a reason, let your friends and family know what’s going on. This will prepare them for your shift in behavior, and they might be able to handle it a little better. Since you’ll probably be acting dramatic around them, it’s not a bad idea to give them a head’s up about what you’re doing.


Acting dramatic and being the center of attention can give someone a sense of importance, or make them feel like their problems are more important than others. If you don’t let your friends and family know ahead of time what’s going on, they might start to feel like you don’t care as much about them."

Be comfortable with yourself.",How to Act Cool In Front of Girls," Stand up straight whether you’re walking, standing or sitting. Pull your shoulders back slightly to expand your chest and hold your chin up high. Good posture alone can speak volumes for confidence, and you’ll be putting off the appearance of coolness whether people consciously notice or not.Posture is one of the core elements of body language, and it’s one that stands out the most. Your posture is a reflection of the way you feel about yourself, and can betray a lack of confidence, even if you’re well dressed and smiling.;
, No matter what you’re doing, smile. Smiling not only shows that you’re comfortable doing what you’re doing, it sends the message to others that you’re comfortable around them and that they should be comfortable with you in turn. Don’t ham it up. A small, pleasant angling of the mouth and a brightening of the eyes is all it takes to announce to people that you’re a nice guy who knows how to have a good time… and maybe even has a little mystery about him.Smiling has also been linked to heightened levels of physical attraction, so you’ll be doing yourself an added favor by displaying a friendly exterior., This is a physical extension of being comfortable with yourself and has to do with the way you move around and deal with your environment. Keep your movements smooth and deliberate, and avoid any wasted motion. You should strive to always be composed and carry yourself with ease. This tells people that you’re in complete control over yourself and your surroundings.If you don’t learn to move economically, your movements will look clumsy and uncoordinated, which can act as a sign of incompetence.
Don’t gesture wildly when talking to people, as this can be off-putting during conversation. At the same time, don’t stand there inanimate like you’re too timid to move. Try to strike the right balance., When standing or talking with someone, “open” yourself to them physically by keeping your body facing them directly. Look at who you’re speaking to and maintain eye contact. You’ll be much more approachable and inviting than you would appear if you were unwittingly closing the people around you off by having your body turned away from them, diverting your eyeline when they’re talking, etc.Try not to cross your arms, fidget or tug at your clothing absent-mindedly. In addition to being examples of “closed” body language, it make look like you don’t know what to do with them., Without boasting or acting like an egotistical jerk, take possession of the room and everyone in it. Whether you’re talking or listening, you want to give the impression that you’re a person of importance. Do this by employing assertive body language (standing tall, remaining open, moving about easily) that encourages those around you to pay attention to you and being staying engaged but considerate. Behave as though everything you say and do has as weight that impacts others.Give the “fake it ‘til you make it” approach a shot—assume that all eyes are on you and that people look to you to serve as an example of what “cool” is.
Take a moment to think about what you’re going to say before you say it. You’ll come across as thoughtful, and you’ll also be less likely to stutter or make mistakes while talking., Display interest when talking to people and be enthused about whatever you’re doing. You should make it a goal to become the kind of person that can talk to anyone. That kind of magnetism will pay off once it’s time to really start drawing attention; if the girl you’re trying to impress happens to be watching, this will convey to her that you’re friendly and show a genuine interest in others.Be an active listener. Use verbal cues like “yeah,” “mhmm,” and “I agree” when conversing to demonstrate that you’re paying attention.Encourage equal input in discussion with the person you're talking to and thereby establish rapport. After they say something about themselves, agree or mention something about yourself that you can use to relate to them, then give them the floor again.

, It won’t matter how cool you look if you constantly put others down or hog all the attention for yourself. Rather than using your time to show off or brag about your accomplishments, maintain a modest attitude toward yourself. Accept compliments graciously, and break yourself of the need to talk about yourself all the time. The fact is, no wants to be around someone who thinks they’re better than everyone else, so be sure to give praise and attention where it’s due, not just take it.Those who are truly cool don't feel the need to prove it to others because they are sure of themselves.
Being able to recognize the qualities of others is a sign of self-confidence, as confident people know it and don’t always need the spotlight on them.

, Above all, you should respect yourself and let people see who you are without the fear of judgment or ridicule. Self-consciousness is almost impossible to hide, and the reality is that it’s unwarranted in most situations. If you’re not worried about what pretty girls or anyone else will think, you won’t have anything holding you back. You’ll have a better time, and your personality will shine through.Focus on enjoying yourself. Don’t let looking good in front of girls turn into a joyless mission. Cool people always manage to have a good time no matter the environment they’re in.

, Don't let yourself get flustered if things don't go your way in social interactions. If you want to show people that you're cool, it's important to be in control of your emotions. Keep a level head, and try not to appear indignant when you get uncomfortable. When you find yourself getting agitated, take a few deep breaths until the feeling wears off, and remember to keep smiling. Whatever the situation, stay relaxed and make sure that your personable demeanor doesn't miss a beat.Don't take offhand remarks personally. When someone criticizes you or says something you don't agree with, just remember that they're only voicing a single opinion. Your own peace of mind should remain unfazed.
If you simply can't help but become anxious or upset, put on a poker face. Even if you're unable to shake it off, you can at least maintain a cool persona by keeping other people from seeing it on you., When picking out an outfit for going out, choose pieces that fit comfortably, accentuate your physique and make you look good. Know how to match clothes and how to dress for the appropriate season. A person who is well-dressed is always eye-catching, no matter where they show up; if you want to come off as cool, you’ve got to look the part first.Wear clothes that are in style to show that you are hip to modern fashions; matching seasonal colors, popular fabrics and patterns and slim fitted garments will all broadcast that you're a man of the times.

, Eat right, get regular exercise and go easy on unhealthy indulgences like junk food and alcohol. Make yourself look like someone that knows how to take care of themselves. If you tend to be lazy or act like a slob, this will likely come across in your appearance. Working out and practicing solid dietary habits will make you look better, which will make you feel better, and that will help you project confidence when you’re around girls.Eat a diet that is high in protein, with a moderate amount of refined carbohydrates (bread, pasta, etc.) and a minimum of fat. You should consume at least one meal every day containing fresh fruit and green vegetables.You don’t have to become a gym rat to look and feel your best, just spend a few hours a week getting your body up and moving. Keep exercise fun by performing activities that you enjoy, like swimming, hiking or cycling., In addition to knowing how to dress well, take special care to make sure that you’re clean, your hair is combed and you’ve put on deodorant. You’ll feel fresh and reinvigorated and are sure to turn heads. Clothes are only one component of looking good—stay on top of good hygiene practices and you’ll look like someone who’s really got it together.Get in the habit of going through a personal hygiene routine daily. Shower, clip your nails, brush your teeth and make sure you’re clean and presentable before going out., Relax! This is one of the most important steps for acting cool. No matter what you’re doing, try to be confident and at ease. Treat every action or conversation like it’s something you’ve done a thousand times. This is especially critical when interacting with or around girls you’re attempting to impress. If you’ve taken all the steps necessary to look good but appear uncomfortable in your own skin, you’ll just end up signaling that you’re trying too hard.If you tend to be tense in public places or when meeting new people, take a few moments to prepare yourself mentally before you go out. Plan your activities in advance so that there will be no surprises. Practice things you might say when making an introduction.
Be able to laugh at yourself when you goof up. It indicates a positive attitude and a sense of humor, both traits that people are drawn to."

Keep it up.",How to Act Cool and Dangerous," No one who looks cool or dangerous pulls it off by wearing the wrong clothes. You don't need to go overboard and buy designer heels, an expensive leather jacket or the kind of suit James Bond wears to get the right look.

Most cool-and-dangerous people wear dark clothes, but they don't need to be expensive. Black jeans, t-shirts, boots, shoes and faux leather jackets can be bought almost anywhere, look into second hand and thrift stores to find unique pieces.
Concentrate on having your hair styled well. Think rock-n-roll, rock-a-billy, or punk for inspiration. Dark browns and black hair can add to your mystic.



 

;
, Make-up is a key component of a dark, dangerous look if you are a girl. Smokey eyes with winged liner and red lipstick is one example.

Red lips always makes your face pop, but make sure your lipstick goes with your skin tone and hair.
There is a fine line between dangerous and goth, watch for too dark of lipstick and too pale of face. When in doubt always use a light touch.
Dark eyeliner and eye shadow will also complement your look.

, You may think that carrying a weapon, drinking too much, taking drugs or driving too fast are all hallmarks of being cool and dangerous, but they don't, they make you look immature and unintelligent. Holding yourself with confidence projects a much better image.

Similarly, just because everyone else is drinking too much or take drugs doesn't mean you have to in order to look cool. In fact you will look more cool by saying no and not following the crowd.







, This doesn't mean you don't talk- it means think about your response or your opinion before speaking. Not only does this give you time to think and develop, but it also means that you are more likely to come up with a response that is well thought out and more coherent. Your silence also adds an air of mystery to you. A considered response sounds more impressive than a petty remark.

,, No Bond villain, no master of devious plots, ever spoke with an Essex accent. A clipped, cut-glass accent will automatically make you sound cultured, refined and ever-so-slightly terrifying, depending on where you are.

You can always add a slight accent to make it appear as though you come from a foreign country but are just that good at English. Also develop your public speaking skills- there's no point looking the part if you can't act it as well.







, With a bit of practice, it will be possible to make the room go silent when you walk into it. Remember, only try it once you have eye contact and don't try to come across aggressive; rather, be cool and calculating, not openly hostile. Give the impression that you are assessing the room.

, Some is fine, but go too far and you'll end up looking more like a rapper then a villain.

, You can always mention in passing that you know people in the aristocracy, the SAS, the FBI, the Increment, MI5, or the KGB.

Don't do it too often or people will know that you are faking it.
Don't tell people you know celebrities, they may be cool but certainly aren't dangerous.
Never be too specific. Just give the impression of having shady contacts.







, James Bond, Jack Sparrow, Jace Wayland, Aragorn, or Robin Hood are good examples. Study these characters and work out what it is that makes them cool and dangerous, whether they give the impression that they can hold their own in a fight, look good in a tux, shoot arrows around corners or always have a come back.

For girls, there are always characters like Hermione, Lara Croft, Katniss Everdeen, Clary, and Arya (The Inheritance Cycle) to emulate. Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery







, Whether it's sports, public speaking or charisma, focus on strengthening the things you are naturally good at.

, Be original, avoid using cliches.Don't drop it into every conversation, use only when appropriate to avoid wearing it out.

, It always looks good if you can whip out your phone and start talking in another language to a mysterious contact.

, Practice expressions, gestures and even lines by imagining possible scenarios. Practice walking into a room and flinging yourself gracefully across the sofa. Remember to keep your gestures confident and open, not cramped, which will make you look uncomfortable.

, Over time you will truly become your persona and you will be able to roll out of bed and be cool and dangerous without trying.

Get involved in your community.",How to Act Heroic1," Anyone can act heroic by recognizing when someone else is in need and taking action to help them. For example, if you see your neighbor struggling with shoveling snow from their driveway, offer to help. This might not seem like a significant gesture, but to your neighbor, who might be suffering from an illness or injury, you have acted heroic.;
, Whether it’s a friend, colleague, or family member, reaching out and supporting someone when they are in a rough place is a heroic act. For example, if you have a friend who is dealing with a divorce, offer to talk a weekly walk with her. Listen to her and be supportive.

, People around the world suffer from bullying each day. This can happen in a seventh-grade classroom or in a boardroom at a Fortune 500 company. No matter the venue, it is important to act heroic and take a stand if you witness someone being bullied.If you see someone being bullied at school, step in and say, “Jeremy, it’s not okay that you’re making fun of Liz.”
If you witness bullying at work, consider stepping in and reporting the behavior to your supervisor.

, Standing up against racism can help support the victim. It also can demonstrate to the perpetrator that their behavior is unacceptable; it can even stop the perpetrator from engaging in racist acts in the future.If you see racist behavior in public, say something. It can be as straightforward as asking, “Why don’t you leave her alone?” If you don’t feel safe, tell someone who might be able to help like a security guard or bus driver.
If you witness racist behavior online, report it. If the perpetrator is a friend, say something like, “Your Facebook post is racist. It is not okay to make fun of someone because they are Asian American.”

, Discrimination and harassment based on sex is unfortunately a regular occurrence. If you witness sexism, take a stand and speak up. You can act heroic by responding to sexism at work, at school, and in public.If your boss is making sexist comments about your co-worker, report the behavior to human resources or through the appropriate channels.

, The world is filled with children who don’t have the mentorship and guidance they deserve. Do you know of a child or teenager who could use your guidance and support? Offer to spend time with them and help them with life’s challenges, such as applying to college or dealing with a difficult social situation.

, You might also consider joining a community group or even participating in local politics. At the very least, stay up to date on local news, politics, and events to stay in the loop and learn about ways that you can help."

Keep playing the game.",How to Accept Defeat Gracefully," Think about what you just experienced, and try to understand how you are currently responding to it. If you are angry, ask yourself why you are angry. If you are disappointed, ask yourself what you hoped to achieve. Before you accept or control your emotions, you must first understand them.Think about how you would have felt if you had not been defeated. Compare the two states, and consider what remains the same between the two outcomes.
Consider writing your thoughts down. Speak to a trusted friend or family member about your feelings. You probably know how you best process emotions – so do what you need to do to come to terms with the situation.;
, Tell yourself that there is no way to ""feel wrong"". No emotion is inherently good or bad. They simply are, and it's healthy to embrace them. Acknowledge the fact that whatever you are feeling is entirely acceptable.


Bear in mind that while it is important to embrace emotions, it may be unwise to follow certain feelings (such as anger or self-loathing) to their logical conclusions.

, You may have not been able to prevent your defeat, but you can control your reaction towards it. Take a deep breath, and try to be as levelheaded as possible. Remind yourself that what has happened has happened, and that you cannot change it. This attitude will allow you to be flexible and adaptable – and you may find yourself better at handling negativity and loss in future situations.

, A situation can always be worse. Consider whether there is a silver lining that you haven't yet seen. Try to find the humor in what has happened, and keep a smile on your face – even though it may be hard for you to crack a natural smile. You may find that the situation is funnier, smaller, or more absurd once you take a step back from your personal investment.

, When you fail, your emotions can distort your perspective. Do not linger on what happened, and do not let your defeat continue to defeat you. You might feel yourself welling up with anger, frustration, or indignation: feelings that, in this case, will only feed themselves. Learn to recognize these non-accepting emotions, catch hold of them, and cast them aside.


You can move on by letting go, or you can move on by seeking retribution. Letting go will release you from your defeat, while the quest for retribution will only tie you to the defeat.
Let go of self-judgment. Accept that failure is merely a part of life. People have and will always deal with defeat – it is a matter of perspective.

, Show respect to whomever or whatever has defeated you. Shake hands with your opponent, and congratulate her on a job well done. Whether you lost a fight, a debate, or a competition, try not to resort to pettiness. You won't be able to reverse the results by complaining about them, or by acting bitter toward the winner. Be as polite and gracious as possible.Thank them for their time and congratulate them on their skills and their win. If you are a gracious loser, the victor will likely feel uncomfortable boasting about their win in front of you. This changes the situation from a winner-loser game into a moment between two people who respect each other and have just finished an enjoyable pastime.

, If others will judge you for being defeated, let them do so. You know who you are, and you don't need to justify yourself to someone else who doesn't know your heart. Be your own center. Losing with class turns your loss into a much bigger victory than any win would.


Others have a responsibility to encourage everyone to participate. If they forget their role, you must not forget yours. Be excited about pursuing your interests.

, If you blame another person, group, or set of circumstances for your defeat, you will keep yourself from accepting what happened. If you blame yourself, you will make yourself miserable, and you'll miss out on the chance to grow from the experience. Try to take the situation exactly as it is: what happened, happened, and no amount of blaming will reverse that.

, Praise them for a particularly clever or effective move. This has the added benefit of letting you take effective strategies from them and figure out flaws in their strategy.

, If you lost a debate or an argument, you can improve your image by admitting that you were wrong or defeated. Consider apologizing, acknowledging your mistake, or explaining how you were wrong; after all, it's more shameful and immature to cling to what's wrong than admitting someone else is right.


Consider that we all make mistakes and are wrong at many points in our lives. It's part of our development, and a large part of what helps us mature.
You will lose credibility if you handle the situation in a petty and immature way. If you respond positively, onlookers and your opponent will see that you can accept when you're wrong., If you can take loss as a learning experience rather than an abject failure, then you can transcend what happened and move on with your life. You may have been defeated, but you need not be defeatist.If you finish tall, reflect and learn, and move on with a smile on your face, you haven't been defeated. You've grown, and you've been taught a lesson. If you carry yourself in the same way any other time you are defeated, you'll find it easier and easier every time – and you may come to realize that you've won in a different way: by improving yourself, and by learning.


Try to take it as a premise that failure has a role in your journey. Ask yourself about the purpose of this failure; what you can learn from it; and why it happened.
Think about why you failed, and whether you could have done anything. Ask yourself whether you unconsciously forced yourself to fail because you are unsure of the goal you're trying to reach.

, Think back on what happened, and look for lessons. Analyse the situation objectively. Figure out what you can realistically do to stop this from happening again – and make it actionable. Focus on the future.


The more you focus on your next win, the better you may feel about your last defeat. Not all winners have won their first match. If you don't accept defeat gracefully, you will act rashly. People may notice if you don't handle your loss in a mature way.

, No matter what led to your defeat, make sure that you don't let it stop you from doing what you love. Most people come up against failure at one point or another – including (and perhaps especially) winners. You'll never improve if you don't keep trying, and you may regret it later if you quit based on this one defeat.

Educate yourself.,
Become more empathetic.,
Interact regularly with friends, family, and your community.,
Volunteer in your community.,
Take a hero pledge.",How to Act Heroic2," The more educated a person is, the more likely they are to act heroic. Take the time to learn about cultures and societies different from your own, as well as issues facing the community in which you live. Expand your heroic horizons by educating yourself about the world. Studies have shown that heroes are more likely to be educated about their own communities and the world at large than those who have not acted heroically., Having empathy means sensing another person’s emotions and trying to understand what they are feeling by putting yourself in their shoes. If you can put yourself in someone else’s shoes, you can understand what type of help might be meaningful to them. Empathy reduces racism and bullying, fights inequality, and fosters heroic acts.If you see someone being bullied at school, think about what it would feel like if you were the person being bullied.
If you see a refugee from Syria on television, think about what it might feel like to lose your home and job and be forced to migrate to another country because of war.

, The more you come to know someone or a group of people who are different from yourself, the more able and willing you will be to stand up for them.In a study of Gentiles who sheltered Jews during the Holocaust, researchers found these heroes were more likely to report having regular interactions with family and friends than their neighbors who did not help Jews during the war.

, Men and women sampled by researchers in one study were asked to report on whether or not volunteering was a part of their lives. One-third of the men and women who researchers classified as heroes spent a significant amount of time volunteering in their communities and elsewhere. Some heroes reported spending as much as fifty-nine hours per week volunteering!You could even get involved in a non-profit organization to have an even broader reach. For example, you might volunteer to help plan events or become a member of a subcommittee.

, Publically declare that you are a hero-in-waiting to your friends, family, and colleagues. Pledge that you will act when you are confronted with a situation you feel is wrong, that you will work to develop heroic sensibilities like empathy and compassion, and that you will strive to believe in the heroic capacities of yourself and others.Make your hero pledge public on social media and invite your friends to also make a pledge.

Realize that a heroic action is voluntary.,
Understand that heroic acts are not performed for personal gain.,
Realize that you take a risk when you act heroic.",How to Act Heroic3," Many people believe that when you engage in a heroic action, you are doing so voluntarily and not because you are obligated to do. This means, for example, that you act on your own accord, and not at the behest of another individual or organization., When you act heroic, you are not doing so to feel better about yourself or for material gain. To most people, a heroic act is selfless and done in service to another individual or a community.

, When most people think of a hero, they think of someone who has risked their quality of life, social standing, or physical health and comfort to help someone else. For example, acting heroic can involve taking a psychological, social, or material risk as you perform an action in the service of another. Many view risk as a defining characteristic of acting heroic."

Remind yourself of your goals.,
Make weekly checkpoints to track your progress.,
Make sure to reward yourself every time you achieve your weekly goals.,
Give yourself breaks.,
Don't be too hard on yourself.,
Watch and read motivational stories or speeches.",How to Stay Motivated1," Usually before devoting time to any specific endeavor, we tend to make short- and long-term goals. Remember to keep your goals realistic, that way you wont be disheartened if you don't reach them. That doesn't mean you can't push and challenge yourself though, if you don't challenge yourself, then it's not really a goal. If you start to lose sight of your goals, then you may be less motivated than if you were always checking to see how much closer you are getting throughout the whole process. Keeping track of your goals and checking your progress can help keep you motivated day in and day out.;
, Everyone needs to see how they are keeping up with their goals if they want to stay motivated. If you see that you are on track or even excelling every time you check your progress, you will be motivated and happy that you are getting there. If you see that you are lagging on your goals, it may be the kick start you need to help get you back on track.

, This could be as simple as a bowl of ice cream after a long, hard week of working out or as rewarding as a trip to the spa for all your hard work. Whatever rewards will keep you going are the ones you should be giving yourself.

, Sometimes even the most determined people get overwhelmed. You may be burning yourself out, and a much-needed break might be just what you need. If it is a fitness goal, maybe take a three- or four-day rest instead of your normal one- or two-day rest. If it is at school, don't try to do all your work in one sitting, but stretch it out over the course of the day or week, if possible.

, Everyone falls short sometimes. If you fail to meet your goals for the week, take it as a lesson. Try to complete your next target before time, so that you can use the saved time to complete the pending work. This way you stay right on schedule even if you have taken a hit. It's not always about how hard you hit, but how well you can take a hard hit and keep moving on. Don't dwell on failure; just accept it as a human occurrence, and continue working towards your goals.

, Everyone deserves a great pep talk every once in a while. Stay elevated by watching YouTube videos of inspirational moments so you can suddenly feel a new sense of motivation to keep striving. Here are just a few example of easily-found inspirational media:


Mary Schmich's famous ""Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)"" speech.
Almost any Hollywood sports movie.
Much rap music - ""rags to riches"" is a common lyrical theme.
Historical stories of bravery or courage (see: Jack Churchill, Audie Murphy, etc.)

Listen more.,
Give others credit.,
Consider other view points.,
Lend a helping hand.",How to Stop Being a Condescending Person1," Instead of dominating a conversation by talking all the time, try to listen more to others’ opinions instead. Don’t just listen, but actively listen to what the person is saying. Focus on understanding the point that they are making, and take a few minutes to digest the information. While they're talking, listen, rather than formulating your answer. Then, provide an adequate response.For example, ""So what you are saying is that by being a vegetarian you are also being environmentally conscious. That is a very interesting point. I never thought of it from that angle.""
Practice active listening by maintaining eye contact with the speaker, nodding occasionally, and asking clarifying questions once the speaker is done.;
, It is normal to want to feel good and give yourself credit for an accomplishment. However, chances are that you did not accomplish it all by yourself. There is always someone, like a friend, family member, mentor, or coworker, that helped you accomplish your goal by supporting your efforts.Take time to give your supporters the credit they deserve. For example, “I worked really hard to get into law school, but I could not have done it without the support of my friends and family. They were always there to cheer me up when my motivation was low.”

, Always acknowledge other view points in a positive manner. Defer judgment by allowing the speaker to finish what they are saying, and by not interrupting with counter arguments. You gain or add nothing by attacking the speaker or by putting them down. When it is your time to respond, be honest, open, and candid in your response.For example, ""That's an interesting point. However, others argue that dogs, especially pit bulls and German shepherds, are not inherently aggressive. Instead, it depends on their socialization and training. What do you think about that?""

, Instead of feeling better because you know how to do something better than someone else, feel better because you helped someone be better. By helping others, you will be able to make lasting friendships.For example, if a coworker struggles with their writing, offer to read and edit their writing, and provide insightful feedback.

Know what constitutes strength in character.,
Understand why strength of character is important to yourself and especially to others:


Strength of character allows you to carry out your will freely, while enabling you to cope with setbacks.,
Empathize.,
Seek the truth.,
Be neither a pessimist nor an optimist, but a leader.,
Guard against irrational impulses.,
Be content with your lot (not imitating).,
Be brave enough to take calculated risks.,
Dismiss external suggestions contrary to the resolution you are fixed upon.,
Learn to do good and eschew/avoid evil.,
Learn to master your feelings.,
Be neither prodigal, nor miserly, but seek the middle ground.,
Be calm in all things.,
Focus on the positives in life, and spare little time for the negatives.,
Oppose fatalism.,
Have patience -- to enthusiastically set, persist and follow-through on your goals, short term, intermediate and long term: which is progress (success).,
Conquer all fears.,
Just as a gardener must remove all the weeds to grow the crops, so you must likewise dispel from your mind all feeble thoughts, that act as weeds undermining your strength.,
Exercise coolness, circumspection, discernment, and prudence in business.,
Always be truthful in all things and every aspect of life.,
Finally, excel wherever you are, and do your best in whatever you do.",How to Strengthen Character," Strength in character consists of having the qualities that allow you to exercise control over your instincts and passions, to master yourself, and to resist the myriad temptations that constantly confront you. Moreover, strength in character is freedom from biases and prejudices of the mind, and is about displaying tolerance, love, and respect for others.;
, It assists you to accomplish your goals in the end.
It allows you to inquire into the causes of ill-fortune, instead of just complaining about it, as many are inclined to do.
It gives you the courage to admit your own faults, frivolousness, and weaknesses.
It gives you the strength to keep a foothold when the tide turns against you, and to continue to climb upward in the face of obstacles.

, As the most important way to strengthen your character: show empathy with others, especially the weaker souls, and love others as yourself. This may come at some cost, causing you to examine your own motives so that you can empathize ungrudgingly. Empathizing differs from sympathizing in denotation, as empathizing requires you to project yourself and engage as needed (walk in and help clear the other person's pathway);whereas sympathy implies an emotional but passive reaction, such as listening, looking and mimicking without extending oneself.

, Favor reason over pure emotion. The person with a strong character will examine all the facts using the head, and not be biased/prejudiced by emotions from the heart. Settle most matters upon reason alone, and avoid entangling yourself in the chaos of your sensations, realizing that though there is ""no explaining tastes"", hunches and attraction, yet reason should prevail on evidence.

, A pessimist complains about the wind, an optimist expects the adverse wind conditions to improve, but the leader takes action to adjust the sails and ensure that they're ready to cope whatever the weather.

, Aristotle and Aquinas considered that there are seven human passions: love and hatred, desire and fear, joy and sadness, and anger. While good in themselves, these passions can bypass our intellect and cause us to indulge in the wrong things: eat too much food, fear things irrationally, or become overwhelmed in sadness or by anger. The answer is found in always looking before you leap and in practicing good habits to free yourself from the enslavement of your own passions. Inordinate, sensual appetites are the marks of a weak character; the ability to delay (suspend) gratification and practice self control is a sign of strength.

, Appreciate your own values and that which you have. Imagining that the grass is greener somewhere else is a recipe for lifelong unhappiness; remember that doing so is actually projecting your assumptions about how others live. It is better to focus on how you live.

, If you shun the battle, you must forgo the victory, and the joy associated therewith. Neither be cowardly, nor aloof, nor evade your rightful duties, but be courageous so as to contribute your part to the progress of humankind.

, Every individual has his or her interest foremost in mind, whether consciously or unconsciously. Neither impose your will upon others, nor allow others to impose their will upon you. Remain aware and accepting that different people will have different suggestions, and that you cannot please everyone. Find the right path, and walk therein, neither turn to the right nor the left. Govern yourself, and never abandon the right path.

, Seek peace and pursue it earnestly. Aim not for personal goals that trample on others' needs, but aim after noble and worthy motives to benefit society as a whole. If you seek personal gains, you will run into conflicts with others, and, in the end, you will inevitably fail. If you seek the mutual good, all will benefit, and you will also find satisfying personal gains as well.

, Avoid letting anything other than sound reason dictate your decisions in the conduct of everyday life. It might often be difficult, and at times impossible, to not yield to feelings deep within your soul, but you can learn to suppress their manifestations, and to overcome them through relying on common sense and sound judgment.

, The ability to seek the middle ground is the mark of a strong character capable of resisting extremes.

, Calmness is a state of quietude that enables you to concentrate and reassemble your divergent thoughts and meditate with profit. Contemplation leads to ideas, and ideas lead to opportunities, and opportunities lead to success. Calmness is a sine qua non of a strong character. Without calmness, there can be no strength in character. Without calmness, passion can easily become overheated, turning into an intense desire and interfering with sound reason. Calmness is not the foe of feelings, but its regulator, permitting their proper expression.

, A physician once said to a young woman complaining of all sorts of troubles for which she asked of him a cure: ""Don't think of them: it is the most powerful of all cures."" Physical and mental pains can be alleviated by effort of the will to divert the mind into opposite channels, and exacerbated by the dwelling upon them.

, Each individual is responsible for his or her own development and fortune. To accept fatalism, that is, to believe that destiny is somehow immovable, is to discourage yourself from attempting all initiatives to improve your life and self. Destiny is blind and deaf; it will neither hear nor regard us. Instead, remember that fixing calamities and changing destiny for the better are ways to strengthen your character and improve your lot in life. Work out your happiness; don't wait for someone else or something else to do it for you because it will never happen unless you persevere.

, Success is a progress -- not a destination. An individual with a strong character will not quit when faced with obstacles, but will persevere to the end and overcome all obstacles. Learn to delay gratifications in life, learn to wait as part of progressing, and learn that time can be your friend, time to learn, apply and see growth. It also helps to know which battles are worth it, and when to let things rest; sometimes letting go is accepting a gift of life, rather than clinging to a sinking ship.

, Timidity is a stumbling block to success. Entertain no superstitions based upon superficial observations, but accept facts based upon solid reason. Avoid building your foundation upon sand, preferring instead to build upon a rock. Once you overcome fear, you will have the strength of character to think, to have resolve, and to act victoriously.

, Guard against excessive emotions, and attribute to them their exact significance. Whenever you find yourself preoccupied with some overwhelming emotion, immediately occupy yourself with something else for fifteen minutes, up to an hour. Many great warriors have lost their lives when they react too brashly to insults, and go to fight prematurely against their taunters without adequate preparations, acting merely upon a hot head. Learn to overcome such a weakness with practice, remembering that anger is a common vice in all those of weak character.

, Cultivate your mind with logic, and conduct your affairs accordingly.

, If you are dishonest, you are dishonest with yourself, and that is an assault upon your own character.

, Work hard, and shun idleness like the plague. By the same token, learn to appreciate quality leisure time for its ability to rejuvenate and inspire you to return to your good deeds.

Realize that your introvert-in-the-house needs downtime.,
Allow space.,
Work to each other's strengths.,
If you are both introverts, be wary of a potential to sidestep problems that neither of you like handling.",How to Understand Introverted People," Introverted personalities tend to be quiet, reflective and easily drained in high energy environments. They are often considered to be ""thinkers"" and are viewed as people who are contented with solitude.;
, This is a key indicator of the difference between extroverts and introverts.


Extroverts tend to recharge by interacting with others, being social and participating in social gatherings, events, etc. The social stimulation energizes the extrovert.
Introverts tend to recharge by withdrawing from social occasions and other people, sitting in solitude or maybe talking to only one other trusted person. This is because the extra stimulation from spending time around people, noise and constant comings and goings drains the energy of an introvert. Without this ability to withdraw, an introvert soon becomes edgy, tense, irritable and ill-at-ease.

, Introverts tend to be very sensitive to external stimuli, such as noise, light and activity. While an extrovert might find working with the radio on a total breeze, the introvert may find the radio so highly distracting that only total silence will allow for him or her to work effectively.

, Neither personality type is better nor worse than the other. During current times, extroverted qualities tend to be lauded as people clamber up the corporate ladder, and in many places, announcing one's presence loudly and selling one's skills to the world is considered to be an essential part of succeeding in competitive job and sales arenas, something many introverts find challenging (although not impossible). However, quiet personalities are as valid and important as their noisier counterparts, they just don't like taking center stage as often.

, What tends to occur however, is that some people are more extroverted and others are more introverted, with some ""central flexibility"" where the two traits cross over. The trait may be evident in just some situations, or in any situation, depending on the individual. Each person is made up of many aspects, with introversion or extroversion being two parts of a greater whole. However, what does happen is that you have a tendency for either one or the other trait and this in turn affects how you balance your time, your social interactions and your recharging needs.


Expression of the extent of introversion is situationally dependent.
Some people are at the extremes of either introversion or extroversion. Life can be a lot harder for these people than those who have a more ""balanced"" leaning towards either tendency. That doesn't mean they are not ""normal"", it does mean they are more likely to experience problems in social contexts where people carry certain expectations of ""typical"" behavior and interaction.
The term ""ambiverts"" is used for persons who display fairly equal amounts of both introversion and extroversion. However, this may just be that the person is either one or the other but is moderate in the expression of the more dominant trait, yet feels comfortable with expressing both.

, While neat boxes are often tempting to apply, the human personality is far too complex for such an approach. Both with yourself, and with others, avoid the tendency to think that the personality trait defines the whole. It does not, and cannot. Much more goes into making up your personality as a whole, along with social skills that you can learn.


Just because a person is considered to be an introvert doesn't mean that that person cannot be in charge, powerful, in the spotlight, etc. There are plenty of renowned introverts who are known as great leaders, inspirers and change-makers.
An extrovert will sometimes make use of taking time to reflect, to think things through and to be at peace in solitude, when needed; it just isn't as pressing or important to the extroverted personality to spend extended periods of time in such modes. However, just as an introvert should not be labeled as ""all or nothing"", neither should the extrovert be so labeled.

, This is both unfair and impolite. Introverts will participate in social occasions and are as likely to be friendly, outgoing and articulate (all personality skills or traits that are learned or innate but that have nothing to do with whether one is an extrovert or an introvert) as the next person. Every human being appreciates contact with others, it is simply a case of how much contact, with whom and for how long. Introverts are more likely to manage the interactions to minimize the exhaustion or overwhelming feelings that can occur, at least for those introverts who have recognized the reality for themselves.


Both extroverts and introverts are equally capable of learning and applying social skills, just as the opposite is true and both can be socially inept; skills are a separate issue from personality traits.
Many introverts are employed in careers that involve a lot of interaction with different people; what you will discover is that they have carefully managed systems in place to be able to cope with the constancy of interaction. For example, they may schedule only a few daily appointments; they may decline any after-work functions that are not a good investment of their time for the expected return. An introvert is less likely to indulge in social events as a form of escapism or habit but thinks through the benefits before wading in.

, As we grow older, we tend to mellow and some of the more evident extremes of either introversion or extroversion become less marked and both personality types shift into a more middle zone. This allows extroverts to access more reflective states, while it also allows introverts to find their voice and stand up for the things they find matter. Much of this stems from the wisdom that comes with experience, provided a person learns the lessons and feels secure in their life.

, This section on interacting with introverts is for everyone; just because you're introverted doesn't mean you automatically know how to interact with other introverts.

, Introverted people like to know they are being heard but they are not going to struggle to ensure that you are listening. If they feel that you cannot be bothered to hang in there and truly listen, they will clam up and fail to articulate any further. This might not concern you if you're flitting from person to person while networking (an event most introverts dread) but if you are wanting to make a real connection with the introvert, you have to make the effort to truly connect and to truly listen.

, Before you think this is all one-sided, you're in for a rude shock. Introverts love to listen to your side of things once you've made it clear you're dedicated to listening to them too; indeed, they can be your rock solid source of a good sounding board for your ideas, notions and worries. Since introverted people are typically good listeners, if you have a problem or need advice, they will listen, wait till you're done talking and then give advice or offer to think over what you've said and return with a solution or idea.

, As already explained, unlike extroverted people, when around people too long, it saps an introvert's energy. So don't feel bad if your introverted friend doesn't want to hang out 24/7. It is not personal, it is essential to their well-being and thriving.


With introverts, a lot of information is processed after the interaction or event. This is why downtime and being away from other people is so important. This is the time of forming clarity, depth of understanding and processing of all that has been learned. An introvert finds instant processing of information during a social interaction nigh on impossible and hence can end up feeling highly distressed or needing to ""shut down"" if pressed to make a decision on the spot or give an opinion there and then.
Respect the need for the introverted person to take more time than you. Even if you feel ready to go ahead with something, to decide something or to do something, you may need to wait a little longer before your introverted friend, colleague or customer comes around to your way of thinking. Do not perceive their quietness and unwillingness to hop on board immediately as a sign of rejection or exclusion; it is not the case. Instead, by accepting that the introvert needs space and time to process, you will be able to see that it's their need, not an insult to or rejection of you.

, A lot of negativity surrounds the introvert. Yet the introvert has amazing qualities that are of great benefit; after all, the trait wouldn't have evolved without being highly useful. Some of the strengths of introverts include:


Being cautious, risk averse and reflective
Writing articulately
Thinking analytically
Staying calm during a crisis (unless overwhelmed); reflecting inner calm and peace
Conscientious and good at concentrating on tasks requiring focus
A great listener, a careful adviser
Being independent
Being tenacious and determined, willing to take the longer-term view
Empathic, diplomatic and willing to compromise.

, You have someone who will make your home a heaven!

, This is not to be taken as personal rejection or any aspersions being cast on you. This is about letting the introvert recharge. If you're concerned, have a discussion and suggest that the introvert-in-the-house at least signal that he or she needs downtime and is going off to be alone. That way, everyone else knows what is happening and won't disturb the introvert or take it personally.

, The introvert needs somewhere personal, quiet and undisturbed to retreat to within the home space. If this is not offered, the introvert can become stressed and tense, a feeling that can impact everyone in the household.


If you are living in an environment where space is a problem, consider making a schedule to get all of the extroverts out of the house once a day, to allow the introvert to have complete peace.

, If you're an extrovert and your partner is an introvert, share out the chores to the person who is best at doing them. For example, your introvert partner may be the best for checking the tax details and choosing the house decorating colors, while you might be best at planning parties and receiving the house guests warmly or cold calling the plumbers to get quotes for renovating your dilapidated bathroom. Talk openly about what the introvert finds difficult to do and reach compromises about who does what.

, Also take care to avoid creating your own bubble and failing to make friends or keep in touch with friends. While you have each other, broader perspective is absolutely essential to feeding your voracious need to process life's deeper meanings.


If you both are too alike, there is a risk of being overly dependent on one another. Be alert to this potential and be sure to widen your social circle and spend time doing some things apart. While it is a source of comfort to be so similar, do not make it into a crutch.
Enjoy the fact that both of you are of one mind while making an effort to keep challenging one another to live life as fully as possible.

Don't let other people's views become the words you mold yourself around. Once you get to the point where you are saying to yourself and everyone else that you're just trying to be what everyone else wants, you have reached a point where you cannot be free.
Detach yourself from ""toxic"" people in your life. These are the people who try to tie you down through manipulation, negativity, and other forms of control. Better still, learn how to disarm such people by learning non-violent communication techniques and standing your ground through being less reactive and more responsive and assertive; you have the power within you to remain free of such people and to live free from their harmful ways. Good friends will help you find your balance.;
, Be free by focusing on what can be done, rather than on what cannot. Shift your attention to what you can do to make things better for yourself and for others. By doing this, you'll find greater freedom to live the life you want to live.


Remind yourself of your successes instead of your failures. If work or school isn't going as well as it might, focus on your family, your relationships, or how awesome you've become at shooting three-pointers. Focus on the positive.
Watch your language. Avoid negative statements like ""I can't."" Language is powerful, both in convincing yourself and in convincing others. By changing these negative phrases to ones focused on what can be done, you will free yourself from inaction and procrastination. Instead, say, ""I've got to do this.""

, Lies create a tangled web of deceit that keeps you from being free. Learn to recognize the lies you tell yourself and others. Being sincere and truthful allows you to connect better with people you can trust because they can identify with your vulnerability.


Lies are one form of reacting defensively; for many of us, it is natural to feel a need to defend ourselves in a situation of conflict.
Lying during a conflict may seem like a good, defensive way of getting someone to leave you alone but it binds you even more tightly to that person because you've made things less clear and have evaded your real needs rather than stood up for yourself.
By responding with loving kindness, you regain your freedom in relationships because you learn to acknowledge the pain, hurt and other negative feelings of others without escalating the conflict and still make it clear that you retain your power to make your own decisions and choices.

, Many people associate ""having enough money"" with freedom, but your attitude toward money says much more about freedom than money itself. Treat money as a tool in your life, not the driver of your life. Learn to save, budget and be a conscious consumer.


Look for what you can do to remove yourself from parts of the consuming cycle that you feel burden you. For example, if you're fed up paying high prices for organic food, dig up your lawn and plant a beautiful vegetable and fruit garden instead. Tend to it regularly, knowing that the fruits of your labor are repaid through communion with nature, health through quality food and role modeling sustainable behavior to your children, neighbors and friends.

, Start bartering your skills with others who have skills in making things you can't or don't enjoy making, so that a virtuous cycle kicks into place. From this, you will also gain friendships and connections that might just amaze you.


Make use of online resources to connect with like-minded people, share items and services, and to encourage others to get involved in ways of living more freely. One site you might find useful is Sharehood, a collaborative consumption website that helps you to bring together local community and your neighbors for sharing resources and skills.

, Exercise can release endorphins that change your mood for the better, and staying in shape will ensure that you're able to do the things you want to do. Don't let your lack of health keep you from being free to do what you want to do. Choose something you enjoy doing, as exercise should be fun in itself rather than being viewed as a means to something else.Release endorphins to free your spirit. Endorphins are your body's own mood lighteners, bio-chemicals produced by your brain in response to pleasant experiences. Endorphins help you to free yourself from unhelpful emotions that can trap you in ongoing cycles of negativity. The ways to help release endorphins do you good, such as exercising, socializing and laughing, all freeing you up to focus on the things that truly matter to you in life.

, Your smile changes your frame of mind. Make a point of laughing at something every day. Start with laughing at your own antics or fun thoughts, then expand to watching a funny movie or going to a comedy club or just doing something that will encourage you to laugh. Laughing and smiling boosts your immune system as well as making you feel better by releasing endorphins. Laughing lets your brain know you're happy, and gets you in a great mood, in the right state of mind.

, The sun can brighten up your day as well as your mood. Go to open spaces, do some trekking, enjoy nature and spend time around people. Obviously, observe sun safe procedures during the hottest months.

, Being with friends brings out your empathy; understanding and being understood can improve your sense of well-being, also helping to release endorphins. In addition, spending time with friends and being social has been shown to increase serotonin levels, also important for improving your inner well-being.

, Being open to new experiences is a source of freedom because you're expanding your horizons, discovering new hidden talents and keeping yourself open to the goodness of life.


See new experiences as opportunities rather than as burdens or something to be worried about. Most of the battle is inside your head, before you've given the new activity a go.
Congratulate yourself every time you try something new. And tell others what you've done, to reinforce its good. Your story may help others to live more freely too

, Movies all have soundtracks and so should you. Walking down the street on a horrible rainy day, pick yourself up with something that gets your feet moving and your mind entertained.

, Spontaneity is often lost upon entering the adult world of work, parenting and societal obligations. Conforming to what's expected of each adult in society tends to quell the opportunities for breaking free now and then, to do something out-of-character. Restoring a little spontaneity and impulsiveness to your life can bring back some balance.


Check out the fun things that Improv Everywhere has done, like gathering over two hundred people to walk around downtown using the famous ""invisible dog"" toy and pretending they were real. Doing something that makes people stare is a great way to live free and get out of the box you're trapped in.
Look for flash mob videos online to find actions that have brought laughter and enjoyment to people's lives.

, Go outside and start walking. Just keep walking in no particular direction and don't stop until you have to. There's something great about taking a walk with no direction or goal in mind.

, It's okay to act on impulse without thinking it through sometimes. Have pie for breakfast or shave your head without warning if you want to. Embrace surprises and spontaneity. Shaking up the regular way of things can help you to become more enthusiastic about each day. Who knows what will happen!

, You don't have to be good at whatever it is that fills you with passion, you just have to love it. Maybe it's writing, maybe it's drawing, maybe it's playing sports of some kind. Whatever it is, embrace it with all your heart and allow yourself to get completely involved with it. Tell your family about it, convince your friends to try it, go crazy and let your life revolve around that something you love.

Keep in touch with your family, old friends, and work actively to get to know the people in your life better. See the good in people.
Try to invest less in what people think of you. Focus actively on doing what makes you happy and keeping people around who will support you and lift you up, not people who'll judge you and bring you down.
Share yourself with the people close to you. When you find people who you can trust and who you enjoy talking to, share good times and bad times.;
, Finding a group of like-minded people is an important part of finding happiness. Whether you participate in church groups, social clubs, or online communities, it's essential that you find people to move through the world with you.


Join a church, join a band, join a kickball group. Join any club that'll have you as a member and that you're seriously interested in.
Communities don't even need to exist in ""the real world."" Online communities that give you joy and fellowship are perfectly healthy and increasingly popular. Whether you enjoy gaming, participating in a wiki, or putting videos on YouTube, throw yourself into the community and get everything you can out of the experience. Find like-minded people wherever you can.

, Variety is the spice. Try to shake things up. When the human brain gets accustomed to the data its already experienced, time moves faster. Doing the same thing over and over makes your life whiz by. Changing things up every now and then, as much as you can, will help you slow down and appreciate the little things.


Do little things, like taking a different route, or method of getting to work. If you usually drive, consider taking public transit, or riding your bike, or walking. If you always walk, take the long way.
Make big changes, if necessary. If you're unhappy in your job, find a new one. If you're bored of your regular relaxation routines, switch it up. Go out dancing, or visit new sections of town. Move somewhere else.

, Are you too predictable? Try to surprise yourself. Walk into places you've never been, talk to people you don't know, change things up for the sake of changing it up.


It's good to cluster in communities of like-minded people for security and happiness, but there's also a lot to learn from people who are very different than you. If you spend all your time with people who think the exact same things you do, things will get boring quickly. Try to actively spend time with people who are very different than you. Visit different areas of the country, different neighborhoods, and talk to the people you find there.

, Don't make life a slog. When there's a reason to celebrate, find the time to party. If there's no reason to celebrate, party anyway. Gathering with friends and loved ones during the holidays is an excellent way to improve your spirits and enjoy life.


Don't let your birthdays depress you. Getting older is a privilege denied many people. Celebrate the wisdom you've gained over the last year, rather than dwelling on aging.

, Essential to a life lived fully is devotion to some work or purpose greater than yourself. How you define that work is completely up to you. It might be providing for your family, pursuing an art, worshipping a higher power, or giving back to your community. Find something that you can throw yourself into completely.


Try to be great at something. You don't have to be ""the best"" at everything you do, but devoting yourself to one thing and trying to reach your fullest possible potential is an integral part of living well. Know some guitar? Practice more. Decent with cars? Rebuild an engine. Like kids? Be a great parent.

, Whatever it is you choose to do on a daily basis is completely up to you, but you should work as hard as possible and be the best version of yourself in light of that work. Take pride in what you do and carry yourself upright. If you're unhappy or unsatisfied in your job, quit as soon as possible and seek employment elsewhere. You only live once.


Alternatively, you might choose to look upon your ""job"" as peripheral to your true calling. Walt Whitman worked as an ambulance driver, but was arguably the greatest of American poets in his ""true"" life. That doesn't mean he looked upon his ambulance work as secondary, though., What do you hope to accomplish in the next five years? The next ten years? Setting goals and feeling as if you're actively improving your life and moving toward some attainable goal creates a sense of purpose and drive in lots of people. If you're one of them, Try to write down meaningful goals for yourself and hang them in your workspace, or your living space. Remind yourself at the end of each day what you've done to work toward that goal. Celebrate even little things.


If goals make you squeamish, forget them. Live day to day. Carpe diem. If you're going to avoid thinking about the future, though, make sure that you're living each day to the fullest. At the end of each day, stop and ask yourself if you're really doing what you want to be doing, if your lifestyle makes you happy, and if you're satisfied in it.

, It's nice to be good at what you do, especially if you're the type of person for whom positive feedback is important. Go into a field or career that you have some innate talent for, regardless of the prestige or the financial gain of it.


Don't go into a field for the money. If you're unhappy but financially secure, cultivate hobbies to which you're particularly talented. Take up sports or music and devote your free time to these pursuits. Remember Whitman.

, No one does everything right. Dwelling on failures, though, is a good way to keep yourself down in the dumps and living less than a life. Let your failures act as fuel in your ambition. Learn from mistakes and do better next time.

, Start getting busy. Don't let your body become a burden to you. Use it, hone it, and enjoy being alive. Find a physical activity that brings you pleasure and take the time to do it on a regular basis. Try to be active for at least 30 minutes a day, every day, even if that just means walking to and from work, or doing some stretches in the evening. Find something that's easy to do and make it part of your life., Few things in life are more pleasurable than a good meal. Learning to balance healthy foods and enjoyable ones is sometimes more difficult, though. Eating nothing but moong bean sprouts and dehydrated kale might be healthy, but it might also be less than living. Likewise, you can't live on bacon and ice cream, however fun that brief life might prove to be. Try to find a balance of good things and things that are good for you.

, Mental health requires variety. As you get older, it'll be easier and easier to relax your brain and stop learning. Avoid this at all costs. Aggressively seek new information, reading a variety of things--online, print, books, etc.--and make lifelong learning a priority in your life.


The difference between becoming a crotchety old person who talks about the good ol' days and becoming a person who ages with grace and dignity is that the latter made staying current, staying smart, and reading a part of their life. Do the same and age with grace.

, Describe yourself when you're at your best on a piece of paper. Write down all the things you like about yourself, the things you do best. Try to come up with at least 10 and keep it in your pocket every day. Try to live up to that standard each and every moment.


Identify the things you don't like about yourself and change them. There's no use in waiting around and wondering what life would be like if you weighed 10 pounds fewer, or guessing what Mexico is like. Drop that weight. Get a passport. Live.
Additionally, though, it's important to accept things you cannot change. If you're 47 and rail-thin, a new career in pro wrestling probably isn't in the cards. Embrace the life you do live and enjoy it.

, A good life isn't one lived to excess all the time. Enjoy the things that give you pleasure, both eat and drink, but don't be a slave to them. It's ok to splurge every now and then and celebrate. Just don't get addicted to the carnal pleasures and cause more problems for yourself.

Eliminate your distractions.,
Raise the stakes for yourself.,
Take some caffeine.,
Move your body.,
Break your task into manageable pieces.,
Surprise yourself.",How to Stay Motivated2," Identify anything that's causing you to procrastinate, then get rid of it. Sell it or put it in a storage locker. Move away from it. Throw it away. You can't become motivated if you're squandering all of your time.


If you're spending too much time aimlessly browsing the internet, install a ""productivity"" extension in your browser. These free extensions allow you to block certain sites and/or set time limits for recreational browsing.

, Hold yourself accountable in your own eyes and the eyes of others. Set personal penalties for yourself if you don't act - throw out some delicious cookies you've been saving or make a donation to charity. Tell your friends and family about things you plan on doing. If you don't do these things, they'll know, and you'll be embarrassed - now you have a great reason to get started!

, Only you know where to draw the line in terms of dosage - one person's typical morning brew might make another jittery and unfocused all day. A moderate dose can make you feel alert, oriented, and focused.


Write yourself little notes to keep you motivated or set a reminder on your phone that reminds you every 20 minutes, this might get annoying enough to make you actually do it.
If you've already got a caffeine addiction - that is, you need caffeine just to function normally - you might be out of luck!
Stay away from more powerful stimulants unless a doctor has prescribed them for a specific condition. They can be extremely habit-forming if used carelessly.

, Go for a short run, do some jumping jacks, or shadowbox. Even light physical exercise can affect our moods, making us feel more active and dynamic. Exercise has even been shown to thwart depression and low self-image - both hurdles to personal motivation efforts., If you're having serious motivation problems, breaking one large task into many small tasks can make it much easier to approach psychologically. Because we get a feeling of accomplishment from completing each step of the task, this trick can increase motivation substantially. Sometimes, all that's needed to gain the momentum to tackle the whole project is to complete the first simple step.

, Even tremendously motivated people can be driven to lethargy and inaction if they have to perform tedious, repetitive tasks for weeks or months on end. Break up the monotony with spontaneous and out-of-the-ordinary activities. Try to create an internal sense of unpredictability - even you don't know exactly what you'll do tomorrow. This can ease the psychological tedium of work that is the same day after day. Here are just a few ideas you might want to experiment with:


Spend a lunch break at a scenic place outdoors.
Have an impromptu soccer game with friends or coworkers.
Surprise your workplace with some home cooking.
Take a friend or significant other out for a night on the town, even if there's no special occasion.
Change your personal style. Cultivate a drastically different look, then wait for reactions from your friends and coworkers.

Know your self-worth.,
Have an open mind.,
Monitor your words.",How to Stop Being a Condescending Person2," Condescension usually comes from a place of insecurity and fear of rejection. However, by knowing your self-worth, you can feel more secure about yourself. When you feel more secure, you are less likely to put others down.Sit down and make a list of your strengths, weaknesses, accomplishments, and failures. By knowing these, you can assess your self-worth and find you inner confidence, as well as humility. For example, one of your strengths could be that you are highly motivated, while a weakness could be that you are quick to disregard opinions that are different from yours.
If you need help, ask a friend or family member what traits they admire about you the most, as well as which traits they think you need to work on.

, Try to realize that you do not know everything and that your opinion is just that, an opinion. Everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, and you shouldn’t look down on someone just because their opinion is different. Instead, have an open mind. Look for similarities between you and others instead of differences.For example, if you have negative views about a religion or a culture, interview someone from that culture. Your intention should be to listen and learn instead of arguing or confirming your suspicions.

, Belittling others ruins your ability to work with and relate to others. It also creates a tense atmosphere where others feel inferior while you feel superior. By monitoring your words and actions, as well as others’ reactions, you can be more aware of condescending language, and its effects.Try to avoid condescending phrases, like, “Oh, you just figured that out,” “Let me see if I can put this in simple terms for you,” “We already thought of that,” or “What she is trying to say is that…”
Instead, say things like, “Maybe I wasn’t clear enough,” “Are you saying that vegetarians are also environmentally conscious?” and “Yes, that is an interesting and valuable point. We are incorporating it.”

"
"
Speak at a normal pace.,
Try to not refer to yourself in the third person.,
Level your head and chin.",How to Stop Being a Condescending Person3," Slowing your speech so others can “understand” you better makes the listener feel inferior since it is the way an adult speaks to a child. When you are explaining something to someone, don’t assume that they are the problem. It is more likely that you are not explaining it clearly or correctly.For example, don’t say, “I. will. be. studying. the. way. humans. interact. in. groups.” Instead, speak normally by saying, “I will be studying the way humans interact in groups. Let me explain what I mean by interact.”

, Referring to yourself in third person gives you an air of superiority. It is something that you should avoid doing if you do not want seem condescending.For example, don’t say, “She won a prestigious award for her paper” if you are referring to yourself.
Also, try not to emphasize the my’s and I’s in your speech, for example, “MY opinion, is that MY book is the better book.”

, While conversing with others, always keep your head and chin level. If you point your chin up with your forehead back while looking down your nose, you will seem superior. This head position signals that you think you know more than the other person, and that your opinion is more important and valid.Also, try to avoid impatient body language, such as loud sighs, eye-rolling, constantly looking at your watch or your phone, drumming your fingers, and yawning."

Sit down with your list in a month and decide how successful you’ve been so far.",How to Improve Your Personality," Try to number them in order of how confident you are that you possess these traits. For example, traits include good listener, outgoing, expressive, introspective, thoughtful or intelligent.;
, These are the things that people tend to respond to, or things you think stand in your way. For example, shy, angry, talkative, judgmental or nervous.


Keep in mind that positive and negative are subjective in this scenario. Someone might think they are too outgoing or that being talkative is a positive thing. Personality changes should be based on your opinions and desires for self-improvement.
It is most likely harder to make this list than your first list. Take your time and consider how your personality when you're with others or when you're alone, since these may be the main things you want to change.

, You can’t instantly change everything about your personality.

, Perhaps you are intelligent, but you would like to become even smarter.

, Changing behaviors is best done slowly, changing a single personality trait at a time through practice and commitment., For example, imagine you want to be less shy.

, You may list items like leaving parties early, not interrupting, not giving your opinion, avoiding people or refusing to volunteer.

, For example, volunteer for a new role at work or accept more invitations to social events.

, This is better done with a single personality trait than an entire set of traits, since personality allows us to be unique. However, you can learn a lot from people who practice positive behavior in their everyday life., Think up a new mantra like “I will be heard.” Put reminders on your cell phone to interact more with people.

, Negative attitudes will reduce confidence and commitment to improving yourself.

, Join a new organization, class, club, team or group. It is easy to go back into old habits with people who know you already; however, new acquaintances won’t have expectations and you may be more successful starting new behavior.

, Personalities don’t change overnight. Give yourself plenty of time and space to turn behavior into an improved personality.

, In some cases, acting like a different person can lead to new friends, behaviors and success. Make sure this “fake” person aligns with your goals, so you don’t end up developing a negative trait. This works for many people, but if you don't know anyone with the traits you want try watching a movie to help you ""fake it"" until you make it. after awhile it will feel natural to act less shy, or more calm for example.

, Move on to a new trait once you are on your way to mastering the first one. For example, if you have made several new friends and started sharing opinions at work, perhaps it is time to work on a larger negative trait.

Warm up with cardio.,
Form a bridge to stretch your back.,
Stretch your lower body with the Runner's Stretch.,
Stretch your upper body with a standing side stretch.",How to Do Gymnastics Tricks1," Warm up the muscles in your body with 15 minutes of cardio. Do what you enjoy as cardio can be repetitive. Whether you jog, run on a machine, or walk up stairs, make sure you loosen up your muscles, slowly working them up for more vigorous activity..


Add squats, knee jumps, or jumping jacks to increase the blood flow and intensity of your warm up.;
, The bridge is a stretch that looks exactly as it sounds. Lay with your back on the floor, knees bent, feet planted, and hands palms down with fingers pointed at your feet. You should look like you are about to crawl on your back but create a bridge instead by lifting your back off the ground and pushing down through your palms and feet.Keep your elbows pointed at the ceiling and try to stretch your back as much as possible. With time and practice, your flexibility will improve and you’ll notice that your back will bend more and more.
Don’t force your back to bend past its capacity. Back injuries can be very debilitating.

, Take a step forward into a lunge position. Touch the ground with your fingertips or as low as they will allow. Inhale and slowly straighten the front leg, raising your butt. Exhale as you stretch the front leg then lower yourself back into the lunge position.Stretch both sides at least 4 times each.

, From a standing position, reach your arms overhead, clasping your fingers together but keeping your pointer fingers out and extended. Inhale and stretch as long and as tall as you can while you simultaneously bend at the hip to one side. Breath slowly and deeply for 5 seconds and return to a standing position with your arms overhead.Repeat the standing side stretch on both sides of your body.

Warm up.,
Check your equipment.",How to Do Gymnastic Moves at Home (Kids)1," Ask a parent or guardian before starting any sort of gymnastics training in the house. Your guardian should be home and available to react immediately in case you are injured. Ideally, an adult should be in the same room with you to act as a spotter.;
, You will need to make sure your garments are not baggy enough that they impede your movements but also not so tight that they cause chafing.


If you are a girl, the best thing you can wear for gymnastics is a leotard.
Singlets are another specialty sports garment and can be worn by gymnasts of any gender. Like the leotard, you may also choose to wear athletic shorts over top of your singlet.
You can also wear a T-shirt or tank top with athletic shorts instead. Make sure that your clothes are free of buttons, zippers, or snaps.
Do not wear socks. Exercising barefoot will prevent slips and falls.
If your hair is long, tie it back securely.
Only wear glasses if they are especially made for sports and won't slip. If not, leave them in a safe place where they won't get damaged., You will need a large area free from clutter. Preparing a room for gymnastics will help you to avoid serious injury.


Only practice on a soft surface. Do not practice on bare hard wood, tile, or laminate flooring. You can also ask an adult to buy a home athletic mat.
Ask an adult to move all furniture against the wall. Make sure that the furniture is free of sharp corners. If necessary, cover sharp edges with a pillow or thick comforter.

, Pull-up bars are relatively inexpensive and easy for an adult to install.There are also athletic bars and balance beams you or an adult may buy for your home.However, these take up a lot of space and are best left for a dedicated exercise room.

, To get the most out of your training, you will need to get warmed up properly. Warming up will boost your performance and prevent muscle soreness.


Start by stretching your whole body. Tilt your head slowly from side to side, and gently roll your head backwards. Stretch your arms by holding each across your chest for a few seconds and then raising it back over and behind your head. Do a few lunges to stretch your legs and lower back. Lift each leg slightly off the ground and roll each ankle. Flex each of your toes. Roll your wrists and flex your fingers.
After stretching, get your heart rate up with a quick aerobic exercise. This can be any kind of simple high-intensity workout you can do on your own in a small space. Examples of these include jumping rope, running in place, or doing jumping jacks. Do this for a few minutes until you can feel your heart beating quickly but not for so long that you start to feel winded.

, Make sure the floor, mat, or rug you'll be exercising on is flat and free of bumps. If you're using a balance beam, get comfortable on it first. Make sure that it doesn't wobble before standing up on it. If you're using bars, try shaking them to make sure they're stable before you put any weight on them.

Extend your back leg out.,
Hold the stretch.,
Ease out of the splits.",How to Do Gymnastics Tricks2," When preparing to get into a split stance, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean forward on your dominant foot. This will be the leg that goes forward in your split.It is best to practice doing the splits on a softer surface, such as carpet or a yoga mat. Try to avoid practicing on tile or hardwood, if possible.

, Keeping your front leg straight, slowly slide it forward directly in front of you.Keep your stance controlled and tight; do not allow yourself to wobble back and forth or slip.


Try taking your socks off to prevent your feet from sliding. Another option is to try performing the splits on carpet flooring with your socks on.

, While your front leg is slowly extending, do the same with your back leg. Propel it outwards and straight behind you while staying upright and controlled. Once you begin to feel a tightness in your thighs, refrain from stretching any further.Forcing your body past what feels comfortable is a sure way to injure yourself.


If necessary, use a small chair or table to help keep your balance as you lower yourself down.

, When your legs are both extended as far as they can go, pause and hold the stretch. Try counting to 15 or even 30. The point is your body will learn to relax while in the splits pose. Rest your arms on a supportive chair, side table or ground if necessary.


Always remember that a stretch will cause discomfort, but not pain. If you feel pain while doing the splits stop immediately., Once you’ve held the stretch as long as possible, slowly ease up back onto your feet.After resting a few moments, you are free to try again if you feel your body is capable. Take your time and focus on technique as you practice.


Most people are not naturally flexible. Mastering the splits may take several months of practice. Be patient and don’t be discouraged if you feel that your flexibility is not improving. Depending on your age, flexibility may take a while to improve."

Place your arms over your head.,
Arch your back and move down.,
Lock your arms and hold.,
Exit the bend.",How to Do Gymnastics Tricks3," While standing, raise your arms straight into the air. Your palms should be oriented towards the sky and fingers pointing behind you.This exercise is best learned with a friend nearby for support if necessary.

, Puff out your chest and slowly lower yourself backwards towards the floor. Take your time and control your movement. Moving too fast can cause you to lose your balance and fall, injuring yourself.If you’re stuck here, you may find it helpful to use a chair or table as a halfway support. You can use the support until you’re confident in your ability to go all the way down.
Bending all the way backwards takes some serious flexibility. If you’re stuck, get into a bridge and rock back and forth. Rock all the way onto your hands and feet. This allows your back to really curve and helps prepare for the standing bend., Once you begin to approach the ground, lock your arms to ensure that you don’t smack your head when you land. After your arms have been locked, keep arching back until your hands are on the ground.Keep your stomach flexed and pointed tight to the ceiling as you hold the position.


While in a backbend, keep your feet firmly planted.Imagine your weight being distributed evenly on all four limbs. This will help you stay balanced.

, While professionals can arch their way back up and out of a backbend, you may find it easier to let your knees drop, and unlock your arms. Tuck your head into your chin and cave your body. This will put you flat onto your back and safely on the floor.

Keep your elbows and wrists locked strong. You may fall on your face if your arms are flimsy and soft when you transition into the handstand.The handstand is one of the core techniques used in gymnastics. Mastering this skill will allow you to move on to walkovers, handsprings and other flip-movements. Learning how to handstand will also be vital for transitioning between bars and floors.Be patient while practicing. The movement can be disorientating and may need time to build the strength needed to complete the movement.

, Keep your back against the wall for stability. From here, lock your knees and kick them up.Don’t be let down if you are leaning completely against the wall. Keep your abdominal and arm muscles strong and engaged to keep your back strong.

, Imagine pointing your toes straight towards the sky. Flexing your ankles, point your toes up. If you’re doing it correctly, the balls of your feet should be pointed towards the wall that is supporting you.Hold for as long as you can. In time, your muscles will strengthen and you will be able to hold the hand stand for longer periods.


Keep your chin tucked into your chest and face towards the wall. This will protect your neck in case of a fall.The rest of your body should feel strong and solid. Keep your back and arms completely straight and strong., Relax your ankles and swing your legs back towards the ground. Bend the knee in preparation for hitting the ground. Allow the blood to rush back to your head before trying again.


Once you’ve mastered 8 reps of 30 seconds each, try moving away from the wall and doing a free-stand handstand."

, Put your feet against the bottom of the wall and ""walk"" backwards. Keep your hands on the ground. Straighten your elbows and knees as you go up.

, Once your legs are straight and your toes are up against the wall, it's time for your hands to do the walking. Start by moving your right hand back slightly. Bring your left hand back to line up with the right. Repeat this until your stomach is very close to or flat against the wall. You have just done an easy handstand., In gymnastics, when a coach or guide tells you to ""return to position,"" you should go back to the stance you started at. In this case, return to the crouch from Step 1. To get back down, walk forward with your hands and let your legs slowly slide down the wall.

The straight jump is a fairly basic jump that is safe to do at home. It will help you to strengthen your legs, improve your cardiovascular endurance, and learn to keep your balance.
While you are unlikely to hurt yourself doing this jump, you could still potentially twist your ankle or fall.

, While you squat, simultaneously swing your arms back behind you. Make sure your arms are as far back as they can go while you reach the lowest part of your squat. Don't go so far down as to lose your balance, but spread your arms to the side if you need to.

, Push off of your feet and extend your legs. You will return to your original position with straight legs and upper body, but now you will be airborne. As you pop upward like a spring, swing your arms back up over your head for added momentum., Gymnasts coined this phrase to describe a method of landing on their feet that absorbs the shock and prevents injuries. To do this, land with your legs apart and knees slightly bent. Hold your arms out for balance. In a perfectly stuck landing, your feet should not move at all."

Until you are well-practice, take this step slowly. Keep your legs straight. Stop immediately if you feel any sort of pain. Forcing a stretch can cause injury., Once you've gone down as far as you can, hold that position for as long as you can. Maintaining this stretch will help improve flexibility and strength. Use your hands for support if you feel wobbly., Unless you are already athletic, you will probably not be able to do the splits on your first try.

The purpose of scales is to learn how to stably balance your body. In order to be a skilled gymnast, you need complete control of your muscles at all times. Scales allows you to practice this skill in a safe environment.

, Hold your arms apart for balance. Keep your toes pointed forward and both legs and torso straight. Once your leg is in position, hold it in place for a few seconds.

, You will want to strengthen and learn how to balance both sides of your body equally.


Bring your foot up higher and repeat your scales after doing them with both legs. With training, you will eventually be able to keep your balance with your leg facing forward at a right angle to your body.

, Swing one leg backwards, keeping both your legs straight. Tilt your body forward to maintain a straight line between your body and airborne leg.


With practice, you will be able to do a back leg scale so far that your body and leg become parallel with the ground."

Land onto your first leg and plant your launching leg.,
Use a spotter when you are just beginning.,
Practice the aerial from a stationary starting position.",How to Do an Aerial Cartwheel1," Before starting the aerial, find your balance by standing with your legs apart and your arms at your sides. Finding your balance will help you execute the aerial more precisely. Don’t do aerial cartwheels on a hard surface. Always do them either outside on the grass or inside on gymnastic mats.Use a spotter who can catch you if you fall.
Don't attempt an aerial cartwheel if you are not already proficient in regular and one-handed cartwheel as well as in other advanced gymnastics moves. If you go into doing aerial cartwheels with no prior gymnastics experience, you run a high risk of getting hurt.;
, Running before the aerial gives you more speed and momentum, making it easier to perform the trick with no hands. Make sure your steps are even and controlled.








Once you master the aerial, you will be able to do it without running first. Running can make it easier to get the momentum you need as you are starting to learn.

, After you have taken a few steps, bring up your launching leg, or leg that you want to launch off of for your aerial, so that it’s parallel to your chest. As you bring up your launching leg, do a small hop with your rear leg. Keep your hands away from your body, outstretched to the side and level with your shoulders. 








If you are just beginning, your launching leg should be your dominant leg, which is generally stronger.
Think of this as a wind up step which will help you generate the momentum you need for aerial.

, After you hop with your rear leg, plant your launching leg into the ground. Keep the knee of your launching leg bent and bring your arms down so that they are still out but are level with your waist.







, With your leading leg planted, kick off with your back leg. Your torso should now be horizontal to the ground, with your leading leg planted perpendicular to the ground and your other leg swinging up behind you.







, Keep whipping up your rear leg, then launch off your leading leg so that both legs are above your head. Keep your hands in fists if you are tempted to reach out and grab the ground.









If you feel like you’re going to fall on your head, put your hands down. It’s better to be safe than to risk getting hurt.
Try to twist your torso so that it is pointed in the direction of travel, with your arms perpendicular from your torso.
Keep looking forwards as you go through the aerial.

, To finish the aerial, swing your leg between your outstretched arms and plant it on the ground. If your leg is swinging down and your arms are in its path, move your arms so you don’t kick yourself on your landing.








Touch down with your launching leg about a foot’s distance from your landing leg.
Straighten up and use your hands to regain your balance if you need to. You’ve just finished your aerial!

, When you are just learning how to do an aerial cartwheel, make sure to always practice with someone there to spot you. Have the spotter stand behind you and over to the side in the direction that you will be doing the cartwheel.A spotter can assist you by putting their right hand on your left hip when you are performing the aerial, and catch you when you are finished by putting their left hand on your right hip so you don't lose balance.
A spotter can also catch you if you can't complete the aerial and topple over.

, When you are just starting learning how to do aerials, it’s easier to get the momentum you need by taking a few running steps. As you get comfortable doing aerials, cut out the running and get your momentum through your hop with your rear leg and an explosive take off.

Understand the toe touch jump.,
Touch your toes.,
Do jumping jacks.,
Stretch first.,
Stretch your hip flexors.",How to Do a Toe Touch1," In order to execute this standard gymnastic move, you'll need to swing your arms down and bend your legs into a crouch, then spring up into the air with a sharp motion. You will extend your arms in a ""T,"" and you will spread and raise your legs in a sort of aerial ""splits."" You'll reach toward your toes, but you don't need to actually touch them. Beyond practicing the move itself, you can prepare for a successful toe touch by stretching all of the muscles and tendons that you will use: your quads, your calves, your back, your arms, your shoulders.;
, This basic stretch is sometimes referred to as a ""toe touch"" as well, and it is a great way to prepare yourself for the cheerleading ""toe touch"" move. Start by standing with your feet together, your back straight, and your hands hanging loosely at your sides. Bend forward at the waist, and reach your hands down toward your toes. Reach as far as you can, then hold your arms and hands steady where they fall. Gradually bend and unbend at the waist, reaching further down each time, until you can touch your toes.


Be sure to keep your knees straight. Bending your knees will make it easier to touch your toes, but it won't help you build flexibility.
You may not be able to touch your toes on the first day, or at all. Everyone's body is different. Even if you can't physically touch your toes, however, the act of reaching further and further toward the ground should improve your flexibility.

, Dynamic stretching is one of the best ways to prepare for an active move like the toe touch. Jumping jacks are relatively easy to do, and they simulate some of the motions that you'll go through as you execute your toe touch. Try to snap sharply through the jumping jacks – you want to be tight and precise, not loose and sloppy.

, Sit on the ground with your legs out in front of you. Then, slowly spread your legs into a ""V,"" as far as they will go without lifting them from the ground. Gently reach your arms down toward one foot, and lean into the stretch as far as feels comfortable. Touch your toe and hold it for 10-60 seconds. Then, straighten back up and repeat with the other foot.After you've stretched each side, try bending your torso forward and extending your arms down the center of the leg ""V."" Then, try bending forward with one arm reaching down each leg. Hold and repeat these poses until you no longer feel tight.

, You'll need to rotate your hips backward as you jump in order to spread your legs in the way you want. Build strength in your hip joints before you try to toe touch to reduce the risk of pulling a muscle. Sit on the ground with your legs spread and your back straight, and place one hand by each knee. Then, point your toes and raise your legs a few inches off of the ground.Do not hold this stretch for long. Lift your legs, then lower them – then lift them again, then lower them. Perform 10 repetitions of the lift-lower cycle, then give yourself a short break before continuing.
Work your hip flexors every couple of days to build power and flexibility. This is one of the most important motions that you'll need for your toe touch. Take it seriously!

Be an inspiration to others and yourself.,

Face challenging or turbulent times head on.,
Follow through with your promises.,
Make decisions rooted in principles, not based on whether the decision will be a popular decision or not.,
Learn from your mistakes and be humble during triumph.,
Do more listening than talking.,
Be curious about new ideas, thoughts and concepts.,
Give others a chance.",How to Lead Like George Washington," When delivering your intent, back your vision of the desired outcome or future state of affairs by painting a vivid picture and describing the desired outcome, the better future, or whatever it is that is hoped for. Do this with passion, the passion that you yourself feel for the matter at hand. If you truly believe in what you're doing and why you lead others, then your passion will shine forth.
Share your plans freely with those you're leading to help them see why you believe so much in your dreams and why buying into your dreams is a good idea for them too.



 


Be actively enthusiastic so that others can absorb your enthusiasm.





;
, People are more likely to follow a leader who is willing to share his or her vision, ideas and plans and who asks for buy-in. Even if those you're leading ultimately expect you to make the hard decisions, having them feel they've shared their ideas and thoughts will allow them to feel a sense of ownership in what you're striving for.


Be collaborative, not authoritarian. One of the best ways to further your inspiration is to include and encourage others around you to join you in the charge. Washington always kept an open mind to a variety of ideas and kept in mind that it often takes a collaborative effort to achieve greatness (for example, he knew that having the French Navy on his side helped defeat the British). By accepting that other people's ideas may have merit, you will always be able to take advantage of the brilliance of others, and not become persuaded that only you have all the answers!







, Rather than simply issuing orders or expecting others to fall in line, challenge people to rise to their best for any occasion. Seek the best they can do for the task at hand by actively noticing and remarking on their talents and good efforts. What you notice and praise, you tend to get more of.


Washington never believed that he was the fount of all knowledge. He relied on and trusted others to fill in his many gaps in knowledge, including Franklin, Mason, Henry, Jefferson, Hamilton and Madison. He wasn't intellectually dependent on others; rather, he was open minded and was willing to listen and learn from others too.

, Making light of hard times or hoping they'll soon pass won't make the situation any easier. Facing the difficulties as they arise and finding strategies for coping and working through them is an important role for you as a leader. Moreover, imparting what you're doing is as important as doing it.
Share your vision of how you expect you/your organization/your team/your family, etc., will survive a hard time you're facing. Washington was able to rally the troops despite failing morale precisely because he had a vision that he refused to let go of and that he was willing to share with others. The way in which he imparted this vision helped the troops to see beyond the paycheck––they became part of the revolution. Think of how you can paint the positive vision for the bad times so that you can engage people to think in a more positive, upbeat way and be inspired by your vision of the revolution too.






There is no point sugarcoating the bad that is occurring––everyone can see it happening with their own eyes. Never make decisions that result in rumors and uncertainty, such as whispers of lay-offs or big changes. Engage those you lead directly and tell them the truth about what is happening and why change is needed, and exactly how you're going about making the change. As soon as you know how others are impacted, inform them rather than leaving them guessing.







, Be a man or woman of your word. Actually follow through with your promises or be courageous enough to explain yourself in those rare instances where you don't feel able to meet a promise you've made. In a society where fast and loose business is commonplace, being a man or woman of your word will provide you with more integrity and credibility. When people know that they can rely on you, they will be happier to follow and trust you.


Don’t make a promise you can’t deliver. There’s a reason why George Washington was the only American President to be elected by unanimous vote. His fellow politicians knew that when Washington made a promise or a statement, he would always deliver.

, Being a leader means that you have to make tough decisions often. What may be healthy, safe or right from an objective standpoint for your company, community or family, may not be the most popular decision with those you're leading. However, sticking to what you objectively discern to be the ""greater good"" will end up being beneficial in the long run. However, be very careful about how you reach an idea of what is ""good"" for those you're leading––keep an open mind, constantly update your information (revising where needed) and always listen to others (including those who hold opposing opinions), so as to avoid becoming obsessed with your own version of what is apparently ""good"".


Before making a possibly unpopular decision, make sure it will be able to stand the test of time. Author Mark McNeilly, who penned “George Washington and the Art of Business,” wrote that Washington “always put the country first. People could trust him to stand above the politics, stand above the fray, and keep the interests of the country in mind.” Check and double check your decisions to ensure that you aren’t pandering to specific individual interests or making a decision that will not be better for everyone in the long run.






While listening to dissent is an important part of being a democratic leader, not all dissenters have a good point. This is not something to be afraid of––instead, recognize that some people are simply vexatious, difficult or personally invested in a particular outcome that doesn't benefit others. You still have a duty to carefully assess dissent but you also have the responsibility to dismiss dissent that is frivolous, cantankerous and trouble-making. That can be harder than it sounds!







, If you are too afraid to make an error or a mistake, you're likely to remain where you are now. Risking embarrassment and failure are a part of being human, and learning and honing your skills is often built on trial and error, through getting on with the task and doing it.


Apply lessons from each endeavor toward the next. Scholars believe that Washington’s Battle of Yorktown victory may have been built on the learning he gained from assessing his previous defeats. Stay in the present rather than obsessing about the past––take only a few minutes to lick your wounds and then stand up and learn from your error.







, In today’s highly vocal 24/7 information-charged age, listening to the chatter and information may be one of the smartest strategic methods in order to effectively lead. However, be discerning about what chatter you choose to listen to––only listen when the chatter is insightful, constructive and learned. The chatter of gossip, rumor and character assassination is never helpful for anyone, let alone someone seeking to lead.


Be aware of your environment. Situational awareness and knowing your audience's preferences will help you size up the competition, any possible threats and all of the opportunities.

, Perhaps you may not completely agree with an idea being shared by the competition or a colleague, but instead of turning a blind eye, listen and absorb what is being said. In fact, seek to stand in another person's shoes and learn their side of the story so well that you could discuss their beliefs, preference or approach to their satisfaction, even though you don't hold the same view. This is possibly one of the most successful means for reaching compromise and understanding with others because the other side realizes that you do totally understand their point of view, and that it is actually a case that you hold a different view.


Be curious about why the idea is being delivered, where it’s coming from and who is delivering it. Washington’s curiosity about the uncharted Virginia territory may have given him somewhat of a tactical advantage––he had explored the area and had prior knowledge before the battles commenced.
Educate yourself. Whether you're college trained or life trained, you have a personal duty to never cease learning. Washington was not highly educated in the sense it is understood today––for example, he didn't go to college. But he didn't use this as an excuse to not learn or to be ignorant––he spent his whole life continually learning from his experiences, from his colleagues and through reading.







, Washington, while beloved, turned down running for a third term because he felt it was time to pass the baton and disbursement of power. While he could have enjoyed a third term and the people were rallying for it, he knew that the country would be better off with new, fresh leadership. Remember that you are human, and that like all humans, you are fallible and there will come a time when your wisdom is best imparted through other channels and you should pass the baton to a new leader in the wings. Never overstay your welcome as a leader––there may be new and different leadership challenges awaiting you, or it may be time to pass to being a teacher, mentor or guide for future leaders.

Find an open, flat section of floor that’s big enough to accommodate the length of your body. That way if you lose your balance while holding the elbow stand, you won’t have to worry about colliding with any obstacles nearby.


Start learning the elbow stand on a carpeted floor, or outside on grass. This will give you a softer surface to work with until your forearms are conditioned to the strain of the technique, and it will hurt less if you fall.;
, Start in a standard downward dog position, or in quarter dog, kneeling with both knees on the ground and your weight over your hips. Place both forearms out in front of you with palms flat on the floor (this is known as ""dolphin pose""). Your forearms should be parallel or in a slight “V” shape, tapering toward the hands.The forearms are used as the base for the elbow stand. They should be roughly 10-12 inches apart to provide maximum stability and put them in the best position to make balance adjustments.It’s important to be low enough in your starting position to be able to get both forearms on the ground in front of you without the need to contort uncomfortably.

, Walk your feet up as close to your elbows as you can can and get up on the balls of your feet to prepare to push off the floor. Swing your first leg up behind you to begin lifting your body into a vertical position. Allow your other leg to come up behind the first. Once inverted, your head should be in alignment with the rest of the body, positioned between the forearms with your gaze fixed down on the hands rather than to the rear of the body. Extend both legs toward the ceiling so that the body is completely upright. Straighten your knees and point your toes for proper alignment.Learn to get a feel for how hard to kick up with your first leg. Not kicking hard enough will cause you to fall right back down into your starting position, while kicking up with too much force might make you to overshoot your balance point and can potentially lead to shoulder injuries if the arms are wrenched behind you.Keeping the body perfectly aligned from head to toe will make balancing easier by preventing any awkward displacements of weight from pulling you down.

, After you’re inverted and upright, you’ve completed the hardest part of the movement! Now all you need to do is hold the position by maintaining your balance. Keep your body tight and use small adjustments of your forearms to keep the body from falling off its axis. Take advantage of your base by using the entire forearm to keep balance. This will feel unusual at first, but is a very stable position as long as the body is kept in line.If your body is leaning too far forward, press with the palms to counter the movement; If you find yourself falling backwards, tense the core by squeezing the abdominal muscles and thrust your elbows into the floor while extending your shoulders.
The straighter you can keep your body, the more effortless balancing will be.

, It’s recommended that you master the basic headstand before moving on to the elbow stand, which removes the crown as a balance point. Try doing a few headstands a day during your training sessions and work up in short intervals until you can hold the position for a minute or longer. The headstand makes use of the same muscle groups as the elbow stand and also serves as good inversion practice.Bridge the gap between the headstand and elbow stand by doing yoga headstands, in which the forearms are also used for base stability and balance., If you’re scared of getting inverted or becoming disoriented once you’re in position, you may need do some conditioning to get yourself used to being upside down. This can be accomplished by simply spending more time with the head below the body. Inch your way up into a steep dolphin pose, practice basic headstands against the wall with a pillow support or hang off the edge of your bed until inversion is no longer intimidating or uncomfortable.You can also perform elbow stands against the wall to build up the amount of time you’re able to spend inverted under tension. This will take the balance aspect out of the movement and allow you to focus on building up the shoulder and core strength necessary to hold the elbow stand for longer., You should always warm up and stretch lightly before any type of physical activity, but this goes double for complex and challenging postures like the elbow stand. Stretching the neck and shoulders thoroughly prior to practicing elbow stands will ensure that you have full mobility of the muscles, making it easier to get into and hold the position. Stretching also reduces your risk of injury by making the joints more supple.Stretch the shoulders and neck independently by putting them through their maximal range of motion, or by transitioning through a sequence of other yoga postures.

, Shoulder strength is an essential function to the stability of the elbow stand. To build strength in the shoulders, perform standard push ups and push up variations that target the muscles of the shoulders specifically. While doing these exercises, concentrate on moving your weight in a slow, controlled manner.Pike and Hindu push ups approximate the positioning of the body during the elbow stand particularly well.Holding handstands against a wall will also be useful for building the necessary supporting strength in the arms and shoulders.

, The shoulders support your body, but the core does most of the work in keeping your body in a straight line and maintaining balance. For this reason, core exercises like crunches, V-sits, and leg lifts should be utilized. When performed statically, the core muscles will spend more time in a contracted state, which translates directly to the constant tension of an elbow stand.To perform static core exercises, begin the exercise normally and then hold it in the hardest portion of the movement (for crunches, this will be in a full crunch; for V-sits and leg lifts, the legs should be kept at about a 45 degree angle to the body, etc.)Incorporate core strength exercises into your weekly training following your regular workouts.

, To add another degree of difficulty to the elbow stand once you’ve got it down, try entering the posture from a pike. Rather than kicking up one leg at a time, keep both feet together and bring them as close to the forearms as you can. Then, lean forward to place your center of gravity over your forearm base, engage the core and lift both legs off floor, keeping them together as you extend into the inversion. The piked entry is an intensified technique that requires loads of upper body and core strength to pull off correctly.The pike shifts emphasis to the frontal abdominals, meaning that your core muscles need to be quite well-developed.

, The simplest positions for entering into an elbow stand demand that you be close to the floor, so doing an elbow stand from a standing position means that your technique, stability and balance must be spot-on. Start in a walking stance, with one foot slightly in front of the other (the leg you intend to kick up with should be in the back). Bend at the hips, reaching down to place the forearms on the ground as you lift with the back leg in one continuous movement. The technical complexity of this variation makes it ideal for beginning to learn handstands.


It may be helpful to “catch” your weight with your hands before resting the forearms on the ground in order to compensate for the added distance between your body and the floor.

, When you feel like your ability to balance in an elbow stand is coming along, you can gradually relax and separate the legs until they’re flared. Bring the toes of one leg horizontally toward the floor with the knee straightened while letting the other fall behind the body so that the sole of the foot is pointed ahead of you. Split leg inversions are typically reserved for high-level yoga practitioners and demonstrate superb understanding and control of the body’s balancing mechanics.Staying upright will be made much more complicated, as the legs now must move independently to offset one another’s weight., One of the most advanced techniques in yoga, dance and gymnastics, pulling off a scorpion requires that the practitioner arch their back to bring the feet as close as possible to the back of the head. This will be especially hard while maintaining an elbow stand. Scorpion inversion demand great flexibility, agility and strength. Once you’re able to achieve this posture you can consider yourself as having mastered the elbow stand.To successfully perform a scorpion, the neck, back, hip flexors and quadriceps must be warmed up and limber. Make sure you’re on an intensive stretching regimen to build up flexibility before attempting the scorpion.This technique places the neck and back in an awkward position, making falls potentially dangerous. If you find yourself falling, always come out of the posture by gradually straightening the back and bringing the hips down until your feet rest on the ground beneath you.

Practice doing regular cartwheels.,
Do one handed cartwheels.,
Do one handed cartwheels and delay putting your hand down.,
Do dynamic stretches regularly.",How to Do an Aerial Cartwheel2," Don’t skip practicing regular cartwheels and move straight on to aerials. Knowing how to Do a Cartwheel effortlessly will strengthen your sense of balance and coordination, which is essential in your training. Keep practicing until you feel like you can do a cartwheel in your sleep!








A regular cartwheel is the foundation for an aerial cartwheel, and if you don’t feel 100% comfortable doing it, you won’t be successful in learning an aerial cartwheel.

, After you have mastered the regular cartwheel, learn how to Do a One-Handed Cartwheel. A one-handed cartwheel brings you one step closer to your goal and will teach you how to momentum your energy through the cartwheel without using both of your hands.








When you practice one handed cartwheels, switch off between your right and left hands. This will prevent you from becoming dependent on one of your hands for the stunt.

, Once you feel comfortable doing one-handed cartwheels, practice doing them and wait until the last possible moment to put down your hand as you flip.









This will stop you from using your hand as a crutch so that you get used to the feeling of moving upside down in the air without your hands supporting you.

, Dynamic stretches are extremely important if you are starting to learn aerials and other tricks. Dynamic stretches differ from regular stretches because instead of stretching and holding a position, dynamic stretches require you to stretch your muscles through a series of quick movements.Because dynamic stretches mimic the quick motions your body goes through as you do aerials or other tricks, doing these stretches before training minimizes the chance of pulling a muscle or hurting yourself.
Examples of dynamic stretches include leg lifts and kicks, body twists and side bends.

Begin with your arms above your head.,
Swing your arms in and down.,
Snap into a ""T."" Swing your arms up and out into a ""T"" position at your sides.,
Jump.,
Spread your legs as you jump.,
Reach for your toes.,
Snap back down.",How to Do a Toe Touch2," Reach up and wide in a high ""V,"" or clasp your hands straight above your shoulders. Prepare to swing your arms down for momentum. This motion should build the power that you need to jump higher.


You can also start by holding your hands together in front of your chest. If you are performing the toe touch as part of a routine, however, it'll make most sense to swing your arms up first.

, Bring your hands together in one smooth motion, straight out in front of your body. Bend your knees into a slight crouch. Rest your weight on the balls of your feet, as a springboard for the jump.Clench your fists and let them hang down before your knees – ready to swing back up., Try to ""snap"" sharply into shape; the motion should be tight and precise, not fluid and loose. Your arms should form a crisp angle: straight out from the shoulders, perfectly parallel to the ground, and perpendicular to your torso. Keep your fists clenched. As you form the ""T,"" begin to rise up out of your half-crouch.You may be told to lower your arms in order to bring your legs higher. Don't bother. It will just make your form look sloppy.

, As your arms reach the level of the ""T,"" use the momentum of the arm swing to burst up into the air. Jump off of the balls of your feet, and keep your toes pointed. Try to make the leap a fluid motion: from crouch to ""T"" to jump.

, As soon as you leave the ground, swing your feet out wide. Roll your hips backward to expose your inner thighs. Try to bring your feet slightly higher than your hips.The rolling motion may happen naturally, but noticing the way that it feels might help you gain more control over your technique.

, At the same time as you spread your legs, reach your arms out toward your toes. Bend forward slightly, if that helps. Don't worry about actually touching your toes – just reach down your legs as far as you can. At the ""top"" or zenith of the toe touch jump, you should reach perfect toe-touching form., From the top of your jump, snap your arms and legs back together as you begin to fall to the ground. Land with your feet together, your knees slightly bent, your back straight, your fists held in front of your knees, and your arms extended fully forward. Hold this position for a moment, then stand up straight. You have completed a toe touch!

Practice with resistance bands.,
Count time as you toe touch.,
Work on your toe touch every day.",How to Do a Toe Touch3," If you have access to resistance bands, wrap these loose rubber loops around your ankles as you work on your toe touch. Then, try to perform your toe touches as normal. It will be much harder to fully extend your legs. However, the bands will bring your legs back together more quickly once they're spread, which might help you perfect the sharp ""snapping"" motion.As an added bonus, this should strengthen your legs.

, If you are going to be doing a toe touch as part of a cheerleading or gymnastics routine, you'll probably need to do it to the beat of a song. Try giving each ""position"" of the toe touch a number from one through eight. On 1 and 2, keep your hands clasped in front of you; on 3, swing into the 'high ""V""' pose, and hold it through 4; on 5, snap down into the crouch; on 6, begin your jump and swing your arms into the ""T""; on 7, hit the peak of your jump; and land on the count of 8.


Listen to a short section of the song on loop, and try to figure out the tempo – the number of beats per minute (BPM). Count to eight in your head as the song loops: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Try to reach each position of the toe touch in time with the beat of the song.
Even if you aren't doing a toe touch to a song, the act of counting might help you space out the movements. Practice counting in your head until you do not need to think about the numbers separately from the positions.

, The best way to improve is to practice regularly. Stretch before and after to build strength and flexibility. Make sure that you have plenty of room to perform the full jump!


Consider practicing the move in front of a mirror so that you can analyze and improve your form. Otherwise, try working on your form with a partner, for feedback – perhaps a coach, a friend, or another member of your gymnastics/cheer team.

Warm up with front splits (optional).",How to Do a Straddle Split," It is important to warm up your muscles and stretch to ensure that you do not injure yourself. You must especially stretch and warm up your legs and back as they will be primarily involved in performing the straddle splits.;
, Lay on your back with your legs in the air and your butt against a wall. Keep your back straight and flat as your press against the wall for support. Wear comfortable clothing and shoes for mobility and traction. Lay on a mat or pillow if the ground is uncomfortable for your back.You will need shoes with good traction in order to walk your legs out across the wall.

, Slowly drop your legs to each side of you along the wall in a “V” shape”. Spread your legs apart until they are tight but not far enough that you feel pain. Hold the V pose for 10-15 seconds., Once you have practiced the V position against a wall, stand comfortable with your feet shoulder width apart and bent over at the hip. This is best done on tile or hardwood but make sure that the floor isn’t too slippery.Practicing barefoot may help you slide along the floor whereas socks may be too slippery and cause injury.

, Using a slow and controlled movement, slide your feet outwards and lower your butt towards the ground. Take your time and use your arms to steady yourself. If you find your feet slipping, try wearing shoes or practicing on a rubber mat.If you feel you can’t get as far as you like, use a chair in front of you or practice in front of a wall to stabilize your body.
Point your toes out and upward towards the sky. You should not let the tops of your feet turn in if you can help it., Once you’ve reached the furthest angle of your splits, hold the pose and breathe as you hold 10-15 seconds. Work your way back up to the starting stance slowly to make sure you don’t injure yourself.Roll your hip downwards to inch further down. This keeps your stomach towards the ground as your legs continue to spread.For a greater stretch, roll your hip backwards to turn out your legs. This is difficult but gives your hips a deeper stretch., Straddle splits take time to master as you need to increase your flexibility. Remember to always warm up before you practice and only push yourself as much as your body will allow. Go slowly and utilize proper movements to make sure you don’t injure yourself. , It’s important to warm up your muscles before getting into the splits. Perform about 15 minutes of cardio to warm up your muscles. There are many options for cardio so do what you enjoy so you don’t get bored by the repetition. Whether you enjoy jumping jacks, climbing stairs, or jogging, get your muscles to loosen up and slowly work them up to more vigorous movements.Increase the intensity of your warm up with jump rope, squats, or box jumps to get your blood flowing in your legs.

, Form a bridge by lying with your back on the floor and trying to push yourself up on your feet and hands. Your knees should be bent with your palms and feet planted on the ground. You should try to form a bridge by lifting your back as far from the ground as you can by pushing down through your feet and hands.Point your elbows to the ceiling and feel your back stretch. It may be difficult at first but with time and practice your flexibility will increase. Don’t force anything if you start to feel pain. Push yourself to feel a stretch but don’t push so far that you feel pain.

, Use the runner’s stretch for your lower body. Get into the lunge position by taking a step forward. Bring your fingertips as low as you can. Raise your butt by slowly straightening your front leg. Inhale as you straighten your leg. Feel your front leg stretch and exhale. Get back into the starting lunge position and repeat.Repeat the runners stretch for both legs, repeating 4x per leg.

, Perform a standing side stretch by reaching over your head, grip your fingers together but extend your pointer fingers and keep them together. Stretch and inhale as you get as long as you can while bending to one side. Take a deep and slow breath as you hold your pose for 5 seconds then return to a tall, standing position with your arms above your head.Make sure to perform the standing side stretch on both sides of your body.

, Open deep muscles in your inner thighs with this pose. Start on all fours, rest on your forearms instead of your hands, and lower your pelvis and hips by slowly spreading your knees apart. Make sure to use control and breathe deeply as you lower yourself.Feel the stretch and don’t go over your capacity. Once you feel a stretch, hold the pose and take 10 - 15 breaths.

, This pose is great for working toward the straddle splits. Sit with a tall posture and the soles of your feet together with you knees dropping to your side. Inhale and exhale as you gently lower your knees. Don’t force your knees down by feel the stretch. Once comfortable, slowly move your chest toward your feet, keeping your spine straight as your fold your body forward. Hold for 10 breaths.If your knees are high off of the ground, add some support under your seat so that your hips lift up off the floor. You want to release the tension on your hip flexors.

, Pancake pose is a high intensity pose. Sit up tall and keep your legs spread wide apart. Lengthen your spine by slowly lifting your chest. Flex your toes to create tension in your legs. Bring your chest to the floor as you move your fingertips in front of your pelvis and continue to walk them forward slowly. Keep your spine straight and only move as far as you feel the stretch.Take 10 - 15 breaths as you move further into the pose.
Let gravity help you open your hips and legs in this pose so that your body becomes familiar with the movements of a straddle splits.

, Sit with your legs as far apart as possible with your toes pointed but legs relaxed. Lean forward to stretch your hips over your hamstrings. Keep your lower back as flat as you can and avoid rounding it., If you have already tried front splits, you may use it to warm up. The front splits is a great way to develop hip and hamstring flexibility in order for you to move on to the straddle splits."

More importantly, you risk injuring yourself if you try to do something that is above your skill and experience level. Here are the skills you should have down before you attempt the roundoff back handspring:


Roundoff
Back handspring
Handstand;
, Before you try the roundoff back handspring on the ground, you should use a running trampoline or the floor at your gymnastics gym. A trampoline and gymnastics floor are springy and more giving, and will allow you to gather more confidence and momentum than you would get from an ordinary floor.


It goes without saying that if you've never done a back handspring, you should try doing one with a spotter first until you feel really comfortable with it.

, It's important to stretch your back, your wrists, your arms, your legs, and pretty much every part of your body before you attempt the roundoff back handspring. Though your wrists and back are the most prone to injury, you shouldn't neglect any part of your body when you warm up. Here are some stretches to try:


Stretch out your wrists by getting on your hands and knees with your palms down. Move forward and back a bit until you feel a deep stretch in your wrists. Then, turn your hands so that your fingers are pointed towards your body instead of away from it. When you're done stretching them, roll them in one direction and then the other.
Stretch your back by pushing up into a backbend and holding it for a few seconds. Then, come down and curl up in a ball on the floor, rolling up and down to roll out your back. This is a great counter stretch  to the backbend.
Stretch your hamstrings by standing on one foot, grabbing your other foot, and pulling your leg back until the back of your calf is on your thigh. Hold for a few seconds and repeat on your other leg.
Roll your head clockwise five times, and then roll it in the other direction, to release tension in your neck.

, Before you do your roundoff, you'll want to run or lunge forward a bit so that your body gathers speed and momentum before you move into your roundoff. If you lunge forward, you should place your dominant foot forward. You can also just slightly lift the foot in the air in front of you and then plant it back down. Remember that you can do a standing roundoff, too. Running or lunging forward a bit can just help you gather some momentum.

, Your arms should be raised over your head, so that your arms are up by your ears. You can lift your arms up at the same time as when you run or move forward. Your arms should be in this position pretty much throughout the roundoff — even when you're upside down.

, Now, turn your body sideways and start lowering your upper body toward the ground while lifting your lower body in the air. You should move so that you plant the hand on the same side of your body as your dominant foot first.

, Now, plant your hands on the ground, with the hand that is the same as your dominant foot landing slightly first. Once both hands are on the ground, you will essentially be doing a handstand, even though you don't have to hold it. In a handstand, your shoulders, arms, and wrists are all parallel, and you generate power from your palms and fingers as you push through your shoulders.


Your feet should be straight up in the air and parallel for an instant as they move toward the ground.

, As you move out of the cartwheel toward your other side, focus on lowering your feet so you land on the ground with your feet together, while you lift your lower body up and finish with your hands over your head. You should land facing the opposite direction that you started from when you began the roundoff.


If it helps, you can think of the roundoff as just a cartwheel with your feet together.

, As you finish your rebound, jump up as high as you can without jumping, keeping your arms up by your head. This will help you generate the momentum you need to move into your back handspring. Ideally, the roundoff back handspring will be one fluid motion, but you can start off by working on your roundoff, stopping, doing a back handspring, and then try to bring it all together.

, After you complete the roundoff, you should use the momentum you generated from your rebound to sit back, as if you're going to sit in a chair behind you. You should position your knees over your feet for balance and to help generate enough momentum for you to jump backwards and land on your hands.


As you get in the sitting position, you should lift your arms high, so that they're directly up above your head, with your ears between your inner arms.
Once you get in the sitting position with those arms up high, you should melt your shoulders down and lower your arms to your sides. After that, you should swing them upwards as you continue to fall backwards, to help generate more momentum.

, You should keep swinging your arms upwards until they reach over your head. As you do this, you'll need to push through your toes to get the upward mobility you need. Swing those arms up as high as they will go. The higher they go, the higher your body will follow. As you push through your toes, you should sink a bit lower into that imaginary chair. Don't worry if you feel like you're about to fall — that's part of the process. The idea is to get low before you fall backwards.


You can also tighten those shoulder and arm muscles to get ready to land on your arms. Your head should be between your arms, with your arms by your ears.

, Try to maintain the same position between your head and your arms as you move backwards. It's important that you avoid arching your back too much. This is called undercutting, and it can injure your back. You also want to fall back a fair amount in a back handspring instead of landing close to where you started; not arching your back as much will carry you further backwards.


Use your legs to help drive you upward and backward.
Point your toes, extending through your ankles. Use all of the power in your legs.
As you move closer to the floor, you can start looking for a landing spot, or a place to plant your hands. It's important to keep your head in between your hands so they plant down before your head does.

, As you fall backwards enough that your hands approach the floor, let your hands touch the floor while your body remains arched. Keep those arms nice and straight so your head doesn't hit the floor in the process. Your palms should be flat on the ground, with your fingers pointing away from your face. The momentum of your legs, with your lower body still following your upper body, should carry you over, so that your legs begin to approach a handstand position.


When your hands hit the floor, you should generate strength and stability from your palms and your fingers, not your wrists. You should also use your arms and shoulders for support. If you put too much pressure on your wrists, you will be likely to injure yourself.

, This will briefly you put you in what is basically the handstand position. Though you won't be staying still on your hands and your legs will be continually moving, the basics of the motion are the same: your shoulders should be over your wrists, with your head looking down between your hands, while your legs are up in the air and relatively parallel. Since this position is essentially the handstand position, it's important for you to know how to do a handstand before you attempt the roundoff back handspring.


Keep your feet almost together with your toes pointed and the soles of your feet parallel to the ceiling.
Avoid locking your knees while keeping your legs almost straight.

, Swing your legs and feet all the way over and snap them down firmly toward the floor. As you do this, you should keep your upper body as straight as it can be so that you land without losing balance. You should land with your legs slightly bent just a bit.


After all, it's called a back handspring because you ""spring"" off of your hands to land on your feet. Think of yourself as a giant slinky, generating momentum.

, The last thing you have to do to finish the back handspring is to plant your feet on the ground and then to pop your body up a bit by swinging your arms straight in front of you and then up. This will allow you to strike the finishing pose, with your arms raised up and your feet straight and just touching each other.

, Chances are that you won't land the perfect roundoff back handspring right away. You may over rotate and land with your back on the ground, or you may not rotate enough to fully plant your hands on the ground. That's why practicing is so important — you'll eventually be able to find balance with your roundoff back handspring.


If you're not comfortable doing it on your own yet, then continue working with a spotter.
If you want extra support, you can use a trampoline or even a floor at a gymnastics gym, which will give you more spring and cushion than the ground.

Depending on the number of rolls you intend to make, determine whether or not you have enough room. If you only intend to perform one roly poly, you may only need a few feet, while much more space will be need for multiple rolls. If you are inside, move any furniture like a coffee table or a chair that may be in your way. If you are outside, ensure the area is clear of any rocks, sticks, etc. that may cause bodily injury. When outdoors, a grassy space is probably best.;
, Lay these down along your rolling path. If you don’t have any available, try using sheets or towels for some added cushion. This will provide an extra sense of security to avoid injury. Consider practicing your first roll at a gym that has the necessary padded flooring.

, Anyone who is planning to snap a photo or take a video while you are rolling should be out of the way of the roll. This will ensure the safety of both parties. Make sure they won’t obstruct your path during the roll but still have a good angle.

, If you have on clothing that is loose fitting or too baggy, it may get tangled up during a roly poly. Instead wear form-fitted clothes like shorts and a tucked in t-shirt. Also, remove jewelry like necklaces as they can sometimes snag and break during activities like these. Be sure to wear sneakers too. Grab a pair that will offer you some support and balance. This is important especially if you are a beginner.

, Whether you’re a novice or a pro, warming up your muscles by stretching will increase flexibility and help prevent injuries. Standing straight up, raise your arms above your head to loosen your back and shoulders. Be sure to breathe in deeply to send oxygenated blood throughout your body. , From the same standing position, lean forward to relax the backs of your legs and neck. Lean forward and touch your hands to the mat with your legs sill straight. Only go as far as your bodily will allow. Try not to force any movements that don’t feel comfortable. , Also referred to as a back bend, this will help loosen your back. Lie down on the floor with your feet flat on the ground. Place your hands up over your head with palms down. Lift yourself into the air by arching your back. You should hold this position for several seconds.

, Crouch down onto the mat with your hands on either side of your knees. Tuck your head into your chest. When ready, use your feet to slightly push you over. Make sure your body stays in a tight ball throughout the roll. Smile! You’ve just accomplished a roly poly!

, You will wind up back on your feet after one rotation and can continue to propel yourself forward to perform multiple rolls by repeating the previous step as many times as you’d like. There is no need to stand up completely when rolling multiple times. Simply use your hands and feet to continue the roll.

, Once you feel like you’ve really gotten it down and are confident in your skill set, find a hill. Adding some speed to your roly polys will only increase the fun. You will barely have to push yourself off as gravity and momentum will carry you.


Remember to make note of the space around you so you don’t bump into anything during all the fun.

Stick your landing consistently (in a row, and without mistakes).
Check to see if your hurdle is high enough. To do this, you could also hurdle against the wall, and see how high you jump; you should be able to jump half of your size (in your round off, more like two fifths).I f you don't want to do a hurdle, you definitely don't have to, unless your coach says to do so.

Grind the oatmeal into a fine powder.,
Pour the oatmeal into the bath.,
Stir until the oatmeal is thoroughly blended into the water.,
Soak for 15-30 minutes.",How to Make an Oatmeal Bath1," Place about one cup of raw, unflavored oats into a blender, food processor or coffee grinder. No need to get too fancy—the kind of normal packaged oatmeal you’d find at the supermarket will work just fine. Blend the oats until they reach a very fine, powdered texture. This will help them dissolve more easily in the bath.The oatmeal particles must be very small in order to spread through the bathwater without simply sinking to the bottom of the tub.
If you’re not sure whether the oatmeal has been ground fine enough, try testing it by blending about a tablespoon into a bowl of warm water. If the water becomes a uniform, milky color, the oatmeal will dissolve in the bath.;
, Run a warm bath. Once the oatmeal has reached a fine enough consistency (meaning it will successfully blend with the water), shake the powder into the bathtub as it fills. If you wish, you can also incorporate other additives at this point, such as whole milk to soften skin, sea salt to exfoliate or essential oils to moisturize and provide a pleasant fragrance.


Roughly one cup of ground oatmeal, along with any other additives of your choosing, will be the perfect amount to add to a full bathtub.Try combining the oatmeal with essential oils that soothe and nourish your skin., Run your hand through the bath water until the oatmeal powder and other additives are completely dissolved. The water will begin to take on a milky appearance. This is a good thing, as it means that the oatmeal has been evenly distributed throughout.The loose oatmeal may create a thin film in the bathtub once it has been drained.

, Climb into the bath. The powdered oatmeal will make the bath extra slippery, so be careful. Relax and soak until the water has cooled to room temperature. If you feel somewhat sticky when you're done, rinse yourself off with clean warm water after you get out of the bath. Use a towel to gently pat yourself dry and ensure that the oatmeal remains under the surface of the skin to provide a protective barrier.For people with persistent ailments like chickenpox, taking multiple oatmeal baths a day can provide much needed comfort.

"
"
Place the oats in a pair of pantyhose or muslin bag.,
Add any other desired elements.,
Make sure the bag is secure.,
Add the bag to the hot bath water as it runs.",How to Make an Oatmeal Bath2," Rather than grinding the oats, leave them whole. Take a muslin bag, thin pair of nylon pantyhose or large coffee filter and add ½ to ¾ cup of oats. When placed in the bath, the bag containing the oats will act like a teabag, infusing the water with nourishing natural compounds.Make large batches of oatmeal bags in advance so that you’ll have them on hand when you feel like plopping one into a bath.

, Depending on the purpose of the oatmeal bath, you might also choose to include other ingredients in the bath bag. A little powdered milk will help soften your skin. A drizzle of olive oil will lock in moisture as you soak. A tablespoon of baking soda can help reset your skin’s natural pH level. What you put in your bath bag is completely up to you, and the choices are nearly endless!If you are using an oatmeal bath to treat an infection or itchy, inflamed or sore skin, it is advisable to either avoid this step or be very cautious, as adding extra ingredients could aggravate the condition.

, Cinch the muslin bag tight or tie off a pair of pantyhose to keep the oats and other additives from being released into the bath water and turning it gritty. If you’re using a coffee filter or some other loose container, hold it closed with a rubber band or a length of ribbon or string. The bag needs to be secure enough to stay shut as it is hit by the running water while it floats around the tub.Coffee filters and other paper-based bags should be handled carefully when wet, as they’re prone to breaking and may come apart if they’re left in the water too long.
Sturdier materials like nylon pantyhose are good for multiple uses, provided they’re rinsed and dried out after each bath.

, Begin running hot water for the bath. Once the tub is about half full, toss in the bag. The heat and motion of the running water will unlock the essences of the oatmeal and other natural ingredients. Let the bath water cool to a comfortable temperature before getting in, and leave the bag in the tub the whole time you’re soaking.Bath bags are easy to make and leave no mess because their contents infuse into the water rather than being added directly to it.

Soothe a sunburn.,
Moisturize and exfoliate your skin.",How to Make an Oatmeal Bath3," Oatmeal baths are perfect for reducing the uncomfortable symptoms of skin conditions such as eczema and psoriasis, as well as infections from poison ivy, oak and sumac. The power of the oatmeal eliminates itch, cuts down on redness and swelling and forms a defensive layer on the surface of the skin. Take a dip in an oatmeal bath one to three times a day until the condition improves.Oatmeal baths will not cure a chronic skin condition, only alleviate the symptoms temporarily.

, A gentle oatmeal bath or two will get rid of the redness and irritation of diaper rash in infants. Simply pour a small amount of finely blended oatmeal into a warm bath (about half as much as you would use for an adult) as you clean your baby. Pat the area with a dry towel. The oatmeal-infused water works much better than regular soaps and powders for clearing up diaper rash, and can be safely repeated as often as you like.Allow the irritated skin to dry completely and rub on a little anti-rash ointment before putting on a fresh diaper.

, For mild sunburns, a specially formulated oatmeal bath can work wonders. Simply add a little powdered milk, mint and aloe vera to the oatmeal as you run the bath. Together, the ingredients can ease pain while speeding up the healing process of sun damage.Taking an oatmeal bath with mint and aloe is an easier way to get full body relief from a sunburn than applying topical creams.
Severe sunburns should always receive medical attention. If you have a sunburn that is swollen, blistered or discolored, see a doctor immediately., Even people who don’t suffer from irritating dermatological conditions can benefit from regular oatmeal baths. When combined with additives like sea salt, lavender blossoms, baking soda and essential oils, oatmeal restores skin to full health while drawing dirt and oil out from the pores. Best of all, it will leave your skin soft to the touch.Olive, coconut and almond oil make great natural moisturizers when paired with oatmeal.Schedule a relaxing oatmeal bath once a week to pamper yourself as part of a home spa session.

It is best to use a cotton or terry cloth robe because they are made from absorbent material and will help with the process of drying off. , Once you are no longer dripping wet it is best to leave the washroom. The hot air and humidity created from the shower will slow down the drying process and leave your skin moist for longer. By entering a cooler and less humid room you will dry faster. It is a good idea to have a few pieces of clothing to put on immediately after the shower so that you can comfortably exit the washroom quickly.
Clothes made from cotton are the most absorbent and can help you dry off quickly.

Take a shower instead of a bath.,
Research low-flow shower heads.,
Only fill the bathtub a quarter or halfway.,
Share a bath.,
Have a sponge bath.,
Take a Navy Shower.,
Think laterally.,
Use baby wipes.,
Medical supply stores carry various brands of hair and body cleaners that don't require rinsing, and use very little water.",How to Bathe when Water Is Scarce," A bath uses a lot more water than a short shower. Considering that each minute under the average shower uses 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) of water and an average full bathtub takes 35 gallons (130 L) of water, a five minute shower will use 12.5 gallons (47 L) instead of the average bath's 35 gallons (130 L). Make the shower even shorter and you're saving a lot more. You don't need more than 10 minutes under a shower to get properly clean - the rest of the stay is enjoyment.;
, The technology has gotten far beyond the drip-drip-drip of earlier days. Most current shower heads use 2.5 gallons (9.5 L) per minute, but you can find and purchase shower heads that use as little as 0.5 gallons (1.9 L) per minute without dramatically sacrificing the shower experience. These shower heads are also perfect for areas with low water pressure.

, Doing this will lessen the water usage. It will also make you colder in colder weather, so the shower is again preferable for colder days. When it's a warmer day, fill bottles with water and put them in your half filled bath to increase the water level but not the water usage. Keep these filled bottles for reuse. It will also make the water get colder sooner. However, this is usually fine for small kids in any weather. A good rule of thumb is to fill no more than five inches (125 mm) for small kids, and ten inches (250 mm) for adults and older children.

, You and your beloved can hop into the bath together rather than filling it up again. Children can share one bath, or at least one after the other can use the same bathwater but there will be complaints from the children following that the bathwater is cold.

, If you've ever been in the Armed Forces, or camped rough, you'll know this one. You simply put water into the basin (you at least have the luxury of warm water!), dip a sponge or washcloth into it, soap up the sponge and then wash over your body. Pay particular attention to underarms, genital region and feet. Your face should be washed separately with a softer cloth. Rinse the soap off of the sponge (put clean water on the sponge) and use the sponge to rinse the soap off yourself. It may sound icky but it works just as well as a shower to remove dirt and germs,-- it is just that we've become accustomed to sheer luxury in our bathroom habits.

, In a dire water emergency, use this to save on water and still get a clean feeling. Turn on the shower and jump under it and wet yourself. Turn it off, soap up. Then jump in and rinse off the soap quickly. Turn off shower and dry yourself.


Try installing a valve behind your shower head. You turn the water on and get wet, then turn it off with the valve at the shower head. The valve keeps the water temperature consistent so you don't have to readjust it for the rinse.

, If you have smelly, tired feet, just bathe them in a bowl. You can also soak scratches and similar injuries in just a small bowl, as long as they are on a leg or an arm.

, You can get quite clean without any water.

, As an additional bonus, it is usually faster to clean up this way than taking a bath or shower.

Use a fan to help speed up the process.,
Dry yourself using a blow dryer.,
Create a fan by using an article of clothing.,
Stand near an open window.,
Walk around.",How to Air Dry Oneself After Showering2," If a fan is available, turn it on and position your back towards it, since that will be the hardest area of the body to dry manually. Obviously, if you have time the fan could be used to dry the entire body.


You should also turn on the exhaust fan in the bathroom, if it has one, to avoid humidity which will slow down the drying process. , Another way to help speed up the process of air drying is by using a blow dryer. You can use the blow dryer on your hair after it has been wrung out by hand. You can also point the hair dryer at the rest of your body to help speed up the drying process. The blow dryer can help with getting hard to reach areas.


Some hair dryers have a cool button which can be used to control the air temperature.

, Use a long, durable article of clothing and hold either end in each hand and twirl the piece loosely in front of your body (similar to the motion of twisting a towel to snap it). This will cause a small vortex of air to dry off your skin. Move your arms up and down in front of you while twirling the shirt until desired dryness is reached.


Undershirts, pajamas, or lightly soiled laundry may work best for twirling, since the article of clothing will likely become wrinkled or creased during the process.
If you don’t have an appropriate article of clothing available you can swing your arms in a circular motion to create a light breeze.

, A fresh, cool breeze from outside can also help with the process of air drying. You will be able to air dry quicker if you use a natural breeze. For privacy purposes it is best to stand in front of a window that does not face the street or directly into other houses.

, Moving around can also help to speed up the process of air drying. Try walking around your bedroom naked. Move your arms in a circular motion, jump, or flick your legs to help shake off the moisture. "

Wet your armpit thoroughly before shaving.,

Don’t stretch your skin.,
Decrease how frequently you shave.,
Consider alternative methods of hair removal.,
Exfoliate your skin regularly.,
Consider buying topical creams that contain salicylic acid.,

Get the hair out.,
Soothe your irritated armpit skin.,
Get antibiotics.",How to Prevent Ingrown Armpit Hair," Wet armpit hair, and wet hair in general, cuts much more easily than dry hair. When the hair is dry, it is much stronger, so when you are shaving dry hair, the razor tugs harder at the hair, causing it to break improperly. It is best to allow your underarms to soak for at least five minutes before shaving.It is better to shave more towards the end of your shower or bath so that your armpit hair has had time to absorb the water.
Use warm water as opposed to cold or cool water, as this will help to soften the hair follicle and also open up the pore around the follicle so that the hair can be cut closer to the base.;
, Shaving foams tend to cause underarm dryness, which can lead to irritation and ingrown hairs when shaving. Choose special shaving gels made for those with sensitive skin. They are usually well lubricated.If you have sensitive skin, you might want to choose a more gentle alternative to shaving gel or shaving foam like coconut oil or hair conditioner.

, Purchase multi-use, changeable razors with at least three blades and a rotating head. Disposable one- or two-blade razors tug at the skin and wear out quickly.


Using an electric razor can prevent ingrown armpit hairs because it does not cut as deeply as disposable razors.
Old razor blades are notorious for creating ingrown hairs, so make sure you change your razor often.

, While many might prefer shaving against the grain to achieve more smoothness, shaving with the grain of your hair will cut the hair straight and leave it long enough so it isn't trapped beneath the skin.


This can be a little challenging when shaving your armpits, as the hairs may actually be growing in different directions. Do your best to follow the direction of growth as you shave.

, Avoid stretching the skin taut when shaving. This will reveal more of the hair from under the skin and cause you to cut the hair too short. Cutting/shaving so close to the skin’s surface will only increase the likelihood of an ingrown hair.


Apply light pressure. Shaving too hard can cut your skin, causing the area to inflame and hairs to be caught under the inflammation.
Run your razor over an area only once. Repeated strokes can aggravate the skin.

, Some people simply have skin that is too sensitive for daily shaving. If you are getting repeated ingrown hairs despite your best efforts, it might be time to start shaving less often.Longer hairs are less sharp at the ends, so they are less likely to curl around and break through the skin to create an ingrown hair.

, One way to stop ingrown armpit hairs is to stop shaving the area entirely. If you're not down to grow out your armpit hair, you can try removing the hair using a different method, such as laser removal or waxing.

Laser hair removal is an effective solution to removing armpit hair.After three to seven sessions, the hair removal may even be permanent, which may offset the fact that it's a fairly expensive procedure. Don't let just anyone perform laser hair removal — check the credentials of the doctor or technician who will be performing the procedure.Though there are at-home waxing kits you might use on your underarms, it's such an awkward spot to try and remove hair you might want to leave it to the professionals. Your hair will have to be a little longer before waxing so that the wax can really grip the hair — usually about 1/2 inch for your first few waxes.The wax will remove the entire hair from the follicle, including the root. Waxing will not completely prevent ingrown hairs, but it may make them less likely to occur. Make sure you continue to gently exfoliate after the procedure.

, Scrub your armpits with an exfoliating pad or glove covered with water and an exfoliating soap. This will remove the dirt and oil on the surface of your armpit skin that prevents hairs from emerging.The frequency with which you exfoliate depends entirely on your skin type. Most people can exfoliate two to three times per week, even on sensitive skin like under the armpits; however, if you notice that the skin is reacting negatively to exfoliation (redness, tenderness, etc.), you should immediately stop exfoliating as frequently.
When exfoliating, you can also use a loofah or special exfoliating sponge. For the best results, rub the loofah/sponge in small, circular motions on the armpit skin you are attempting to exfoliate.

, These creams work well at preventing razor burn. They are also widely used for preventing ingrown hairs.You can use these creams daily, but make sure you apply after every time you shave and/or shower for the most effective help in preventing ingrown armpit hairs.

, Using a moisturizer regularly can help smooth your underarms, which makes for a quick and easy shave.Make a habit of applying the moisturizer to your skin every time you get out of the shower.
Moisturizing is key to preventing ingrown hairs, even in areas like the armpit that you typically want to keep dry. Moisturize after showering, but allow your skin enough time to soak up the hydration before applying other topical elements like deodorants or antiperspirants.

, Regular washing will keep dirt and oil off the area. As dirt and oil builds up, the chances of producing an ingrown hair increases. This is especially important in an area like the armpit where sweat and odor are produced with greater frequency and pores can be clogged by regular use of products like deodorants and antiperspirants.


On days that you might not have time to shower, use a wet washcloth and some mild soap to quickly wash your armpit area to remove any dirt, oil, or residue from your deodorant that may have accumulated since your last shower.

, An ingrown hair needs to come out. Stop shaving or waxing the area immediately when you notice an ingrown hair and let it grow for a little bit. Under no circumstances should you break the skin or dig into the skin to reach an ingrown hair.Let it reach the surface on its own to avoid more damage to your sensitive skin.You can usually use tweezers to extract ingrown hairs in your armpit if they are protruding from the skin slightly. But remember, never break the skin to get an ingrown hair.

, Having an ingrown hair can really damage and irritate healthy skin, especially when it’s in a sensitive area like the armpit. Try soothing your armpit skin by applying some aloe vera or some gentle moisturizer to the affected area.Try to do this during a time that you can relax and let the aloe soak up into the skin. If you have to leave the house immediately, the aloe will rub off and be less effective.
Though not proven to help, there is some evidence that using a topical retinoid may help decrease redness and swelling.Low dose corticosteroid cream can be applied to the affected area for immediate relief, but because long-term use of corticosteroids can thin your skin, it should only be used sparingly.

, Sometimes there is a chance for infection if bacteria seeps into the opening of your skin caused by the ingrown hair. Watch for continued signs of redness and discomfort over the course of more than a few days. If the pain and redness doesn’t dissipate, seek medical attention. Your doctor may need to prescribe you a small dose of antibiotics."

Know what to expect.,
Get a cream bleach kit designed specifically to bleach body hair.,
Do a patch test.,
Wash your arms with soap and cold water, then pat them dry.,
Measure out one part powder to two parts cream on the tray provided.,
Mix the two creams together using the plastic spatula that came with the kit.,
Spread the mixture onto your arm using the plastic spatula.,
Wait 10 minutes.During this time, avoid messing with the bleach.,
Scrape the bleach off with the spatula.,
Rinse the cream off using cold water, then pat your arm dry.",How to Make the Hairs on Your Arms Lighter1," Body hair bleach kits are not permanent; they only last up to 4 weeks.This means that, depending on your hair type, the results may last fewer than 4 weeks. They typically work best on those with fair skin and light, fine hair.


If you have very dark skin, the bleach may actually make the hairs on your arm more obvious. Keep in mind that everyone is different, however, so they may work for you.If you have very dark or coarse hair, the bleaching kit may not be strong enough to lighten the hairs on your arm significantly.You may be able to achieve a golden brown color, but you likely won't get white-blond.;
, This type of bleach is stronger than the type you'd use on your face, but gentler than the kind you'd use on your hair. Some kits also specify what skin and hair type they work best on, so be sure to get the right one.For example, if you have sensitive skin, get a kit that's either gentle, mild, or designed for sensitive skin., It would be a good idea to do this, even if you have used body hair bleaching kits in the past. It is possible to become allergic or sensitive to the ingredients. Here is what you need to do:


Mix up a small amount of the bleach cream, typically one part of the powder and two parts of the cream.
Apply thumbnail-sized amount to your inner arm.
Wait 10 minutes, then wash it off with cold water.
Wait 24 hours. If no irritation occurs, then you may proceed. If irritation does occur, then do not use the product.

, Do not use warm water, as this can open up your pores and make your skin more sensitive. Also, do not use it in a hot or steamy bathroom.

, Most body hair bleaching kits have to containers: one that has powder and one that has cream. Get out the tray that came with the kit, then scoop out some of the powder. Next, scoop out twice as much cream.If your kit came with two tubes of cream, squeeze out equal amounts of both, usually half-way around the tray., Scrape the powder towards the cream, then smoosh the cream flat around it. Keep smooshing, mushing, and pressing until the powder and cream are mixed together.

, Focus on the top of your forearm, where the hairs are darker. You may not need to use any bleach on the underside of your arm, or on your upper arm.

, It may sting a little, which is normal. If it starts to burn or feel too uncomfortable, however, wash it off.

, If your hair still isn't light enough, apply more of the mixture, and wait 5 more minutes. Be realistic, however; the bleach can only lighten your hair so much., Discard any leftover bleach, then rinse out the tray and spatula. Do not take a warm shower afterwards, as this can open up the pores and make your skin more sensitive.

Gather your ingredients.,
Get a medium-big sized pot.,
Pour in the mixture from the bowl into the pot.








,
Turn the stove on to medium or in the middle of medium and high.,
After the frothiness has appeared, keep mixing it occasionally for 5-8 minutes and start to take the pot off the stove and wait for the bubbles to disappear.,
Once you take your wax off the stove, it's recommended to pour it into a jar immediately.,
To apply the wax, use a popsicle stick to scoop up some wax, using your fingers to spread.,
If desired, get paper sheets and put them on top of the wax and smooth it out.",How to Make Sugar Wax," You simply need a cup of sugar, four tablespoons of lemon juice, and four tablespoons of water. The sugar can be any kind of sugar, white, dark, brown, but only granulated. Powdered sugar is not an option. Put the ingredients together in a cup or a bowl.






;
, The reason you need such a big pot for a small batch is that the mixture starts to bubble and it can overflow if you use a small pot.

,, When your mixture starts to bubble or become frothy, start mixing the batch with wooden or silver/metal spoon. Plastic spoons will melt.








, Check the color and see the consistency of the wax. If it is very sappy and syrupy, and the color is a dark auburn or dark brownish, it is ready. If it is not like this, put it back on the stove and cook it some more.








, If action is not taken then the wax will stick to the pot and end up ruining the pot or causing a major cleanup later. Find an empty jar that you won't be needing and let it cool for five to twenty minutes. The wax should be nearly solid, but still malleable. Liquid wax will burn you. If it is too hot to hold your finger to for more than a few seconds, let it cool some more.








, Again, the wax should be malleable but still hot/warm: not liquid. Apply the wax to your destined location in the opposite direction of hair growth.








, Rip in the opposite direction of your hair growth like a bandage. Get a firm grip on it, and it may hurt a little bit. You can also use your fingers to roll or pull it off. If no hair was pulled off, your hair is too short to be waxed or you did not make the wax correctly.

Shave your arm hair.,
Trim your arm hair.,
Use a depilatory cream.,
Bleach your arm hair.,
Try at-home waxing.",How to Make Arm Hair Thinner1," You may shave your arms with a safety razor just as any part of your body. This is a temporary solution, and you may see hair regrowth within a few days. In order to keep up with this method, you will need to shave your arm hair a few times a week. Because you are cutting your hair with a blunt razor, this method may cause noticeable ingrown hairs. The hair may also appear to grow back thicker. Be aware of these side effects when choosing to shave arm hair.;
, Arm hair lies flat against the skin. Trimming arm hair length therefore greatly reduces its appearance. Use an electric hair trimmer with an adjustable blade to trim hair. Do not shave all the way down. Your shorter arm hair will make it look a lot thinner. , A depilatory cream dissolves the hair from the base. This means that your arms will be smooth for about a week. The hair will also appear to grow back in softer than shaving. Do a patch test on your skin to make sure you do not have an allergy, then apply to your arms as indicated on the label. Exfoliate afterward to remove any remaining hairs. It is recommended that you stay out of the sun for 24 hours before and after using a depilatory cream. Consider applying a hair-inhibiting cream in between depilatory cream applications to keep hair thinner and softer. , If you have a lighter skin tone and thin hair, consider bleaching your arm hair. Bleaching uses hydrogen peroxide to remove the pigment from your hair. This may greatly reduce the appearance of your arm hair by turning it a less noticeable shade. , Waxing will keep your arms smooth for about four weeks. At-home waxing treatments are therefore long-lasting and relatively inexpensive. Try a cold wax kit so you do not burn yourself. Apply the strip to your arm as per the instructions on the label.


Hair must be at least a quarter-inch long for the wax to grip it properly. Allow your hair to grow out for a few weeks to a reasonable length before attempting to wax it. You can also make your own wax at home using sugar and water. Combine 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons vinegar, and 2 tablespoons water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce to medium heat. Pour into a glass container when it turns a ginger-ale brown color. Let cool slightly, then apply to skin with a butter knife. Pull firmly upwards and the sugar wax will remove the hairs. Apply corn starch to skin beforehand to get rid of excess moisture. "

Use a razor to shave your body and facial hair.,
Use tweezers to pluck out your body hair.,
Use depilatories to dissolve your body hair.,
Remove body hair using an epilator.",How to Pick Hair Removal Techniques1," Shaving is a fast, inexpensive, easy and safe way to remove the hair from your body and face. Experiment with using your razor to shave your legs and underarms or beard.The only materials you will need are a blade or electric razor and some shaving cream, all of which can be purchased at your local drug store.
Shaving only lasts between 2- 4 days, so know that if you choose to shave, you’ll have to shave often to maintain smooth skin.
Some women also prefer to shave their bikini line (the perimeter around the outside of their underwear).
Choose shaving if you're looking for a cheap and pain free way to remove hair.
Avoid shaving if you have sensitive skin, grow hair incredibly quickly or are strapped for time.;
, Tweezing removes hair by pulling each individual hair out of your skin. Experiment with using tweezers to pull stray hairs from your eyebrows. If you have any moles with hair in them or hair growing out of your chin, you can tweeze these hairs as well.The only thing you will need to tweeze your body hair is a pair of tweezers, which can be purchased at your local drug store.
Tweezing will last a couple of weeks, depending on how fast your hair grows.
Tweezing can be slow and painful, although most people generally adjust to the pain fairly quickly.
Be careful not to over tweeze your eyebrows. You can always take more hair off later, but you can’t put hair back on.
Choose tweezing if you are only looking to remove a few stray hairs from your face.
Avoid tweezing if you have a low pain tolerance or are looking to remove a large amount of hair from a bigger body part.

, Lotions and creams are a fairly inexpensive and painless way to remove hair. Experiment with spreading the cream on an area of skin where you’d like to remove hair (like your legs or underarms) and waiting the instructed amount of time. Rinse the creams off and check out the results.Depilatories can usually be found in your local drugstore.
This hair removal process usually lasts between 2-4 days, so if you choose to dissolve your hair, keep in mind you’ll need to keep repeating the process.
Depilatories are the messiest form of hair removal.
Sometimes the chemicals in the creams can irritate skin, so test out the products on a small patch of your skin before committing to a larger area.
Use depilatories if you have fine body hair and a large bathroom with a tub.
Avoid depilatories if you have coarse hair, sensitive skin or open cuts and wounds.

, An epilator is a tool that looks like an electric razor, but instead of a blade, it has multiple tweezers. These tweezers work to remove hair directly from the root, thereby eliminating stubble.Using an epilator can be painful, generally on par with waxing.
An epilator costs around $100 and can be purchased online or in stores.
Legs should stay smooth for two-weeks after using an epilator.
Epilators can remove hair, even when hair is less than a millimeter long, so you don't have to wait as long to remove new hairs.
Use an epilator if you want your skin to stay smooth for longer than shaving, but don't want to spring for a wax.
Avoid using an epilator if you have a low pain tolerance.

Get a professional wax.,
Try laser hair removal.,
Remove hair permanently with electrolysis.",How to Make Arm Hair Thinner2," Many salons offer professional waxing services. They use hot wax to remove hair from the follicle. Professional waxes are thorough, though often costlier than at-home treatments. Salons may offer a half or full arm wax depending on where your hair grows. Make sure you find a hygenic, experienced technician if you choose to get professional waxing services.

, Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to penetrate the hair follicle and destroy the hair. It is certified by the FDA to permanently reduce hair. This means that hair growth will be reduced over time, and hair may be completely gone for years at a time. Many patients will need multiple treatments to keep hair from growing back. This is not a permanent solution, but may last for years. There are few side effects, although treatments can cause pain afterward. This pain is usually treated with over the counter medication. Visit a dermatologic surgeon to get laser hair removal done. Make sure you find a doctor experienced and trained in performing laser hair removal.

, Electrolysis is the only permanent method of hair removal according to the FDA and the American Medical Association. In electrolysis, an electrode is inserted into the skin and an electric current passes through the hair follicle, inhibiting hair growth. It is not painful, though may cause some redness after each treatment. Patients will need a series of treatments over time, with each treatment lasting 15-20 minutes. You must be a licensed and certified technician in order to perform electrolysis, so make sure the doctor you choose has a license before undergoing the procedure.

Remove your body hair using electrolysis.",How to Pick Hair Removal Techniques2," Waxing is a more expensive but also more low-maintenance solution to removing body hair. Hot wax is applied to a small portion of body hair, then a cloth is used to rip the wax away, bringing the hair with it. Make an appointment at your local waxing salon and have a professional wax the hair on your preferred body part.Waxing is one of the more painful methods of hair removal.
You can buy at-home waxing kits, but for best results you should see a professional.
Waxing generally costs between 15 and 350 dollars per session, depending on how many body parts you are getting waxed.
Waxing generally lasts between 3 – 4 weeks.
The most popular areas to wax are the legs, arms, eyebrows, underarms, bikini line, entire bikini area, chest, feet, toes, butt and back.
Try waxing if you have a high pain tolerance and are looking to avoid cuts and nicks.
Avoid waxing if you are sensitive to pain, don't have a lot of money or are diabetic., Threading is a technique that is newer to the United States, and therefore, far less popular. Like waxing, threading should only be done by a professional in a licensed salon.Threading is generally used to remove eyebrow hair, but has also been used to remove stray hairs on toes and knuckles.
Threading lasts as long as waxing, but costs less (usually around $7).
Use threading if you need a quick and inexpensive way to remove facial hair.
Avoid threading if you are sensitive to pain or are looking to remove hair from anywhere other than your face.

, Bleach doesn’t remove body hair, but it does make it less obvious, which makes it a good solution for arm hair and facial hair. Because bleach is a chemical, it’s recommended that you make an appointment to have a professional do it for you.Do not bleach large areas or sensitive areas of skin.
Use bleach if you have fine hair and light skin.
Avoid bleach if you're looking to remove pubic hair, if you have sensitive skin or if your coloring skews darker.

, Laser hair removal is a newer trend and a much more expensive – and more long-term – hair removal option. Laser hair removal involves permanently damaging hair producing cells by shooting lasers at them, and should only be performed by a licensed professional.


Laser hair removal is very expensive and generally takes several sessions spread over many months to complete.
Laser hair removal is painful, but only about as painful as waxing.
Laser hair removal lasts, on average, for two years.
Choose laser hair removal if you have lighter skin, darker hair and a large disposable income.

If you have sensitive skin, try sugaring.,
If you have fine facial hair, choose threading.,
Do not get a wax if you’re taking retinoids.,
Let your body hair grow out.",How to Pick Hair Removal Techniques3," Sugaring is very similar to waxing, but instead of using wax to remove hair, the solution is composed of all-natural ingredients like sugar, lemon juice and water.In addition to being easier on sensitive skin, sugaring is also less painful than waxing.
Waxing and sugaring both cost similar amounts and last for the same amount of time.

, Very fine facial hairs are often hard to remove through waxing because they’re so difficult to grip. Threading is the ideal solution for people looking to remove very fine hair from their eyebrow and upper lip areas.Threading can sometimes cause irritation and redness on facial skin.
If you don’t want to thread, alternate using hair removal cream every few weeks with some selective tweezing., Retinoids cause skin to become prone to peeling and burning, thereby making your waxing trip a nightmarish experience. If you are currently taking retinoids, opt to remove your body hair by shaving or threading instead.Wait until you’re off your retinoid for at least 10 days before scheduling a wax appointment.
Also avoid getting waxed if you are taking Accutane.

, There is no wrong way to deal with body hair, and many people prefer to let theirs grow out. Letting body hair grow is not for everyone, but there are some health advantages to doing so.Longer hair reduces friction and protects your skin against chafing.
Pubic hair can help prevent bacteria from spreading to your genitals.
Whatever your reasons are for letting your body hair grow, don't let other people make you feel badly about it. It's your choice and it's none of their business.

Put your clean clothes on.",How to Take a Shower," Place your dirty clothes in a laundry basket. Put your clean clothes or pajamas in a safe place where they won't get wet from the shower water.


Take off your glasses too. If you wear contacts you can wear them in the shower as long as you don't get too much water in your eyes.;
, Turn on the water and let it run until it is warm. Check the position of the shower head, to be sure that the water is spraying down rather than out of the shower. However, make sure it is not too hot. Your wrist is a more accurate gauge of temperature than your fingers, so use your wrist to determine if the temperature is actually comfortable.


Consider taking the occasional cold or cool shower, especially when it is hot and humid out or after a heavy workout.
Consider jumping in the shower right when you turn it on, even if it's cold, to save water.

,, Slowly turn around a couple times under the spray to let the water cover your entire body. If you are washing your hair, be sure that your entire head and hair is completely wet. Rinsing off loose dirt and dust is the first step to getting clean—and getting wet, particularly with warm water, helps your muscles relax.

, Work the lather gently down to your scalp, making sure all the strands of your hair are sudsy to their ends. You don't have to use too much shampoo—if you do you might run out quickly and it can strip your hair of healthy levels natural oils. Just a quarter sized puddle of shampoo on your palm will do the trick. Always remember to start with a small amount, and add more if you need it.


Wash your hair every other day rather than every single day. Washing your hair too much can damage it.

, You don't want your hair to dry with soap residue in it.


To check that there isn't any more shampoo still in your hair, wet it and then squeeze your hair and watch the color of the water that runs out. If you still see a little bit of shampoo in it, keep rinsing and repeat!

, In addition to simply cleaning, putting your preferred conditioner in your hair can improve the look, feel and health of your hair. Conditioner does not lather, so work it in from scalp to ends until you feel a layer of slickness all over your hair. Check your conditioners instructions. Many will recommend leaving the conditioner in for several minutes before rinsing it out. Others are actually meant to be applied after getting out of the shower.


Some people prefer to use a combination shampoo and conditioner that doesn't require a separate step to apply.

, Wet your face and apply a small amount of facial cleanser or exfoliating scrub to your face with your fingers or a washcloth. Gently rub the cleanser around your face for at least 30 seconds, getting your cheeks, nose, chin and forehead, and potentially your neck and upper back if you experience acne breakouts there. Make sure you avoid getting any into your eyes. Especially if you use anti-acne wash, leave it on your face for at least 30 seconds so it can seep into your pores. Then rinse the washcloth and your face thoroughly.


You can use basic soap instead of a special face cleanser. This is better than not washing your face, but overuse of the wrong kind of soap on your face can dry out and irritate your skin.

, Apply your bar soap or body wash to your washcloth, loofah (shower poof), body sponge, or just your hands. Now, clean your entire body. Start at your neck and shoulders and work your way down. Be sure to wash under your arms and on your back. Wash your private parts and bottom last. Remember to wash behind the ears, back of the neck, and in between each toe.

, Turn around under the water and rub your body with your hands to get off lingering soap and loosened grime. Run your hands through your hair and make sure all the soap is rinsed out. If there are any areas you have missed, wash them now.

, Many people shave their hair that grows on their legs and in their armpits, and find the shower to be the ideal time for this occasional task.


Shaving legs and armpits is very common for girls and women in some countries, but you can be clean without it. Ultimately it's a personal decision, so speak to a woman you trust if you're not sure what to do, and also consider the customs of your culture. Exfoliating legs with a body scrub helps remove dead skin for a cleaner shave.
Wet and lather shaving cream or conditioner on your legs.
Using a razor, shave upward, against the grain of your hair. Start with your ankles and work your way up. Don't forget the tops of your feet at the end.
Shave slowly to avoid cutting yourself, especially your knees and the back of your legs because you might hit a bump and cut yourself.
For your underarms, lather shaving cream or conditioner on your underarms and shave (slowly) upward and downward—underarm hair grows in both directions.

, Some men prefer to do their shaving in the shower as well. For this you need a shower mirror—one designed not to fog up in the water and steam. If you have one, shaving in the shower can be both convenient and a nice excuse to stay under the hot water a little longer.

, Some men and women also use the shower to trim or shave unwanted hair from around their genitals and bikini area. Be careful, though, and make sure your shower offers you a good place to stand and enough lighting to see clearly what you are doing.

, As weird as it sounds, brushing your teeth in the shower is actually very useful. You can brush your tongue and not be afraid of getting toothpaste in your hair or on your clothes.

, This is important so no soap is left on your body. Make sure that there is no conditioner left in your hair before moving to the next step.


If you are brave enough, turn the water on a cold setting for 3 seconds and let the cold water run over your face to close your pores and give your hair a natural shine.

, Make sure it is turned off tightly so you don't waste any valuable water. Prepare to leave the shower stall and gather any belongings you brought with you into the stall.

, Step out carefully, as slipping on the floor in a bathroom can be dangerous.

, Standing on the rug or mat, grab your towel from nearby. Gently dry your head, face, torso, abdominal area, pelvic region, legs, your private areas, and feet with a towel. If you have done this carefully, the only water should be on the shower mat or rug, not on the rest of the floor. When drying your face, remember to pat it gently with the towel rather than rub it.

, Now is a good time to put on deodorant, lotion, aftershave, hair styling products that need to be applied when wet, or anything else you may need to put on that you can't put on when clothes cover your body.

, Start with your clean undergarment, then put on the rest of your clothes. You are now fully showered and ready for bed or to face the start of your day.

Use a sharp razor.,
Apply a layer of shaving cream or soap.,
Shave at any angle.,
Apply a moisturizer afterward.,
Consider only shaving your underarms in the shower.",How to Keep a Woman's Underarms Hairfree1," Dull razors can cause nicks or cuts while shaving, due to the extra pressure you’ll have to put on them to be effective. They can drag harder against skin and become irritating. Use a sharp, fresh, high-quality razor. Disposables with one blade might not be the best option. Instead, try a razor with at least 3 blades.There are online services that will send you blade cartridge refills for much cheaper than normal drugstore prices. These services are great options for those who want to use a sharp, fresh blade each week.;
, You will want to lubricate the razor as it moves over your skin to prevent it from causing nicks or cuts, so using a layer of shaving cream or soap can help with this. Because the soap or cream will gather on the razor, you’ll want to rinse the razor after each pass to keep it from clogging and becoming less effective.


You can also try using a little bit of hair conditioner instead of shaving cream or soap. This works just as well.
The less hair you have on your underarms already, the more cream, soap, or conditioner you’ll want to apply to protect your skin. Generally, though, an even, thin layer will do well enough.

, Unlike shaving other parts of the body, shaving the underarms can require shaving in all directions instead of just one. Shave up, down, and side to side to remove all unwanted hair. Your shaving cream or soap will help you see better where you’ve already shaved and help you avoid missing any areas.Be careful not to press too hard when shaving. Keep your touch gentle to avoid nicks and cuts.

, Some antiperspirants and deodorants contain moisturizers that can help soothe the skin after shaving, so you can try one of those. Alternatively, you can apply a thin layer of a gentle moisturizing cream or lotion. Try something made specifically for sensitive skin, as this might be better for your underarms.You may have to try a few different after-shave routines until you find the one that best suits you. For example, if deodorant or antiperspirants alone aren’t soothing enough, try applying moisturizer. Or, if moisturizer becomes too irritating, try sticking with your antiperspirant or deodorant.

, Some people shave their underarms at the sink rather than in the shower, while others shave in the shower. It comes down to personal preference and convenience. However, shaving in the shower has its advantages. Letting the hair under your arms soak in the warm shower water for a few minutes before soaking can help soften the hair and make it easier to shave without irritation.If you want to shave at the sink instead of in the shower, try wetting the hair under your arms with warm water a few moments prior to applying the shaving cream or soap, rather than wetting it right before.

Exfoliate your underarms before waxing.,
Make sure your underarms are dry.,
Follow the directions on your chosen waxing product.,
Use an after-waxing lotion or gel.",How to Keep a Woman's Underarms Hairfree2," Because the wax will need to thoroughly adhere to any hair on your underarms, you need the hair to be at least .25 inches (0.6 cm) in order to use waxing as your method of hair removal. If your hair is too short, give it another few days before attempting to wax. Trim down any hair that is more than an inch long to prevent any complications or difficulties when waxing.If the hair under your arms is very long, it could make waxing more painful than necessary. Trimming especially long underarm hair prior to waxing can help alleviate this.

, Use a gentle exfoliating scrub, or simply a washcloth to exfoliate your underarms. This will remove any dirt from your pores and help prevent ingrown hairs when you are ready to wax.Try making your own gentle exfoliating scrub with a tablespoon of baking soda and enough mineral water to make a thin paste. Use your fingertips or a washcloth to gently rub the paste against your underarms, then rinse with warm water., Wax will not function properly if you apply it to wet skin. Before applying the wax, make sure your underarms are completely dry. This means no leftover water from exfoliating, and no sweat. You can even try dusting a little baby powder onto your underarms to ensure they are entirely dry.A bit of baby or talcum powder can also help alleviate a bit of the pain associated with waxing, so even if your armpits are dry, consider dusting on a light layer for your own comfort.

, Some waxing products can be applied cold or at room temperature, while others need to be warmed to be used. Whichever product you’re using, follow all directions on the bottle or box. This will ensure the product works its best.


Make sure you stretch your arm up over your head and keep the skin of your underarms as tight as you can. This will help you make sure you apply the waxing strip evenly over your entire underarm, and insure you are able to wax away all hair., After you wax your underarms, you will want to soothe the skin. You can use a normal moisturizer, specifically one with soothing ingredients like aloe. Or, you can use a product made specifically for use after waxing. These products are available at drugstores. They not only soothe the skin after waxing, but can also help protect your freshly waxed follicles from infection or further irritation.Directly after waxing and prior to applying any cream or gel, you can also try putting an ice cube against your freshly waxed skin. The ice can numb the skin and soothe it instantly after waxing to prevent extra pain.

Apply an after-lotion.",How to Keep a Woman's Underarms Hairfree3," Some people with sensitive skin can have allergic reactions to the chemicals in hair removal, or depilatory creams. To make sure you aren’t allergic to the cream you’ve chosen, dab a small amount onto your skin. Try somewhere like your ankle or arm. If you have no reaction after a few moments of the product being on your skin, you should be fine to use that product.


Red skin, a rash, or intense itchiness are all signs of an allergic reaction.Always check the warning labels and ingredient lists on any skin product you use before using them.

, Since your underarms are particularly sensitive, choose a product that is specifically labeled and made for use on sensitive skin. Some depilatory cream brands offer specific creams for underarms and bikini areas, so try one of these. This will reduce the risk of skin irritation when you use the product.


Even if you choose a product for sensitive skin, it’s still a good idea to do the allergy test prior to using it.

, You want to make sure you don’t have any lotion, deodorant, antiperspirant or skin oils on your skin when you apply the cream. This will ensure there is nothing acting as a barrier between the cream and your skin. Use a gentle soap when washing to make sure all products and oils are removed from the skin.You will also want to make sure you don’t have any cuts in the area you’ll be applying the cream. This can be very uncomfortable and cause a stinging sensation.

, Make sure not to rub the cream in. Instead, dab it over your skin and make sure you cover all the hair you want to remove. Use a thick enough layer to fully cover the area. The cream you bought may have come with a special spatula for spreading and removing, so you can use that. Or, you can use a wooden tongue depressor or put on a plastic glove and use your hand.You can spread the cream with your bare hand, but you will want to wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water promptly after finishing.

, The label will specify how long to leave the cream on before wiping it off, and you should follow those instructions completely. Don’t keep track of the time in your head--use a watch or timer to make sure you leave it on for the exact amount of time. Leaving it on longer could result in skin irritation., Using the spatula that came with your cream, or with a washcloth, apply firm pressure and wipe the cream away. Use a downward motion. Make sure you apply even pressure when wiping away the cream, as this will remove both the cream and the hair in one motion. Extra rubbing could cause unnecessary irritation.If you have any kind of negative reaction during the time the cream is on your skin, remove it. Burning, excessive or painful itching, or a rash are all signs of an allergic reaction. Even if you did a test patch somewhere else on your skin and had no reaction, it’s still a good idea to remove the cream if it causes a reaction when you use it.

, Using warm water, rinse all the excess cream off of your skin. Make sure all the cream comes off. You don’t want any lingering and causing skin irritation or burning from staying on too long. You don’t necessarily need to use soap, but you can if you feel you need to. Or, if the directions on the label call for using soap to wash off the cream, follow those instructions.Be careful not to rub your skin too harshly with washcloths or loofahs when rinsing the cream away. Your skin may be a little sensitive from using the cream, and doing so may cause irritation.

, Some depilatory creams will come with a lotion to apply after using the cream. If yours did, use that cream and apply a generous amount. If your depilatory cream did not come with an after-lotion, you can use a mild moisturizing lotion you have on hand. Consider using one that is unscented to refrain from applying any unnecessary extra chemicals to your skin."

A waxing kit should include wax, waxing strips, and a stick to spread the wax across your skin.
A sugaring kit should include sugaring paste, sugaring strips, and a stick to spread the paste across your skin.
To make a homemade sugaring kit, use muslin or denim for sugaring strips and a Popsicle strip for application to the skin. Follow these instructions to make homemade sugaring paste with sugar, salt, lemon, and water.
You'll also need access to a microwave to warm the wax or paste up from room temperature.;
, Although it's not harmful to your skin if you take the correct steps, these processes could have unwanted effects like redness and soreness if you don't take the appropriate precautions to protect your legs.









Make sure your leg hair is long enough for waxing or sugaring. Ideally, it will be between 1/8"" and 1/4.""
Make sure don't have any cuts, scrapes, irritation, or sunburn on your legs. Pulling hair from skin that's already damaged will only make it worse.
Clean your skin with soap, and dry your legs.
Remove dead skin from the surface by using a body scrub, loofah, or shower glove. Don't rub too hard, though — you don't want to irritate your skin off the bat!
Soak your legs in warm water for 5-10 minutes.
Moisturize your skin with an oil-free lotion. Oil on your skin will prevent wax from getting a firm grip on your hair.

, Over the counter wax and sugaring paste usually comes in microwave-safe containers, but if it doesn't, transfer the product to a container you can either microwave or put on the stove.


Follow the warming instructions on the box.
Properly warmed wax should have a soft, easily-spreadable consistency like honey.
Properly warmed sugaring paste will be soft and sticky.

Be careful not to over-warm it. Hot wax or sugaring paste can burn terribly.

, You want to remove the entire hair in this process, or else you may get painful ingrown hairs. To prevent this, check which direction your hair is growing in. On legs, hair will grown downward.


This means that when you get to these steps, you will apply the wax in a downward motion, then pull the waxing strip off in an upward motion.
If sugaring, you will apply the paste in an upward motion, and also pull the sugaring strip off in an upward direction.

, Remember to apply it in a downward direction if waxing, and an upward direction if sugaring.









Don't apply too much product, or it will be gloopy and won't attach strongly to the strip.
A layer of bout 1/4"" is ideal.

, Rub your hand over the strip to encourage the strip to grip the product, and the product to grip your hair. Do this gently, but firmly.








, Grip it from the bottom with your dominant hand (right, if you're right-handed, left if you're left-handed). With your other hand, hold the skin taut by pulling it in an upward direction from above the removal strip.


Reverse directions (grip the top of the strip, pull skin below the strip in an upward direction) on areas where hair grows in the opposite direction.

, Do this quickly and firmly! If you pull too slowly, the product and hair will be left behind.








, Especially at first, this process may take you a long time. You'll get faster with practice, but the first few times you try, your wax or paste might cool down too much to be effective. If it becomes difficult to spread, reheat it on the stove or in the microwave until it reaches the ideal consistency again.

, Temporary redness and irritation is normal, but you'll want to soothe your skin.









Wash your legs with gentle soap again, making sure not to use overly-warm water.
Spread moisturizer over the entire affected area.
If the irritation really bothers you, try soothing the skin with an ice bag.

Attend your laser hair removal treatment.,
Deal with the immediate effects.",How to Get Smooth Legs without Shaving3," There is a great deal of variation in the effects of the procedure, but it tends to have the most ideal, lasting effects on individuals with fair skin and dark hair.

, In the United States, there is no licensing requirement for laser hair removal technicians, so think carefully about who you trust to perform this procedure on you. A good deal may not be worth the sacrifice of professionalism and technical skill.


Look for a board-certified dermatologist or cosmetic surgeon who has experience with or who specializes in laser hair removal.
Avoid salons or spas that might allow people without medical training and experience to perform the procedure.

, Go to the meeting prepared with your complete medical history and a list of medications you take. At the consultation, the technician should perform a test on a small patch of skin to make sure you have no adverse reactions. Typical adverse reactions might include:


Blistering
Crusting
Scarring

, Although it's not dangerous, laser hair removal is a fairly serious procedure, so you should take the necessary precautions to make sure nothing goes wrong during your treatment.









Protect your legs from the sun; a tan can result in splotchy skin lightening during the process, so let your tan fade if you have one.
Leave the roots of the hairs intact for a minimum of six weeks before your treatment. You can shave your legs or use a hair removal cream, but don't do anything that will remove the hair by the root — waxing or sugaring, for example.

, Although there is disagreement on this, some studies suggest that a close shave immediately before laser hair removal treatment improves results and possibly even decreases the pain you experience. Even if there's disagreement about whether or not it's true, it can't hurt!








, It's going to hurt, but you'll get through it. Make sure to let the technician know if the pain is becoming unmanageable. They can take short breaks, adjust the intensity of the laser, or apply a numbing cream to help you manage the pain.








, It's perfectly normal to experience discomfort after your treatment session. To soothe your skin, try pressing ice or aloe creams to especially sensitive areas. Take over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen and Tylenol to help manage the pain. Redness and irritation should subside within a few hours.

Find a sanitary pair of scissors.,
Avoid trimming when you're sick.,
Stand in front of a well-lit mirror.,
Snip the hairs that drive you crazy, but don't trim away everything.,
Carefully clip the longest protruding hairs.,
Clean up.",How to Get Rid of Nose Hair1," The tip of the scissors should be small enough to fit comfortably into your nostril, and the blades should be sharp enough to sever a hair cleanly with a single snip. Avoid using shared or communal scissors. Avoid using wavy ""craft scissors"", and avoid using dull, rounded children's scissors. You don't want to wrestle with your nose hairs, nor accidentally pull them out; you want the trimming process to be as neat and as smooth as possible.


Use special trimming scissors, if you can find them. Trimming scissors have a rounded tip that's designed specifically for safely trimming hair in sensitive places like noses and ears. You can find facial hair trimming scissors in the cosmetics section of many drugstores, department stores, and personal-care stores.
Clean the handles and blades of your scissors with water and antibacterial soap, and towel them dry before you use them. Consider using antiseptic to sterilize the scissors: if they have been used before, especially by other people, they might carry germs and bacteria that you don't want to inhale.;
, Make sure that your nose is clean and dry. Blow your nose beforehand, if need be, to remove any gunk. If you're battling a cold, a flu, or any other sinus-related infection, wait until the sickness subsides before you try to trim away your nose hairs: if you clear too many hairs, you may give new contaminants an easy passage into your already-compromised immune system.

, Make sure that you have a place to dispose of the hairs that you snip--a sink, a waste bin, or a disposable towel will do. Make sure that the lights are bright enough to clearly see into your nostrils: good lighting helps you see the lighter hairs that may be sticking out of your nose.


You may need to get close to the mirror to see enough detail. Try using a magnifying mirror or a hand-held mirror to get the right angle.
Nose hairs may stick to the scissors as you trim, and you don't want to wipe them directly back into your nostril. Keep a tissue, napkin, or towel on hand to wipe the scissors down. If you have access to a sink, you can rinse the tweezers clean of any clinging hair after each snip.

, Try to snip only the most visible hairs: the hairs near the rim of your nostril, and any large hairs that noticeably protrude from your nose. Smile at yourself in the mirror--or push your nose straight up with your finger--to reveal nose hairs that don't poke out otherwise. Trim only what you absolutely need to trim. Your nose hairs serve an important function by protecting your body from infection, and removing nose hair completely could have negative side effects., Line the tip of the scissors up with any thick bunches or particularly long hairs, make sure that your skin is clear of the blades, and snip with a gentle but decisive motion. Find the roots of the longest hairs, and trim them closely so they'll take longer to grow back. Only cut the hairs that people will notice: the hairs that stick out directly from your nose. Resist the urge to completely clear out your nostrils.


Be gentle when sticking the scissors into your nasal canal. Never shove the trimming scissors into your nose: you can do a lot of damage--and put yourself at further risk of infection--if you slice open your nasal passage. Watch your hand and the scissors closely, even if the scissors are rounded at the tip.
Trim until you're satisfied with your appearance. Smile at yourself in the mirror, again, and trim any hairs that stick out. If you look at yourself straight-on in the mirror and you can't see any obvious nose hairs, then you've probably done enough. Bear in mind that you may judge your appearance harshly than others do.
Dispose of the nose hair trimmings as you go. Hairs may stick to the scissors blades. You can rinse the hairs down the drain with water, or you can wipe them off of the scissors with a tissue, napkin, or towel.

, Throw away your nose hair trimmings, or wash them down the drain. Blow your nose to expel any clinging hair trimmings--and consider cleaning out your nostril with a tissue, a sanitary wipe, or a nasal spray. Clean up any stray trimmings that have fallen onto the sink, the counter, or the floor. Wipe the scissors with antiseptic before you put them away, or at the very least wash them with soap and water. This is especially important if you used communal scissors: would you want to use scissors that had just been up someone's nose?

Buy a nose hair trimmer.,
Avoid trimming when you're sick.,
Stand in front of a well-lit mirror.,
Buzz the hair that peeks out from your nostril.,
Trim the hairs that drive you crazy, but don't remove everything.,
Clean up when you're finished.",How to Get Rid of Nose Hair2," This is a more expensive option, but it's the quickest and the safest. Decide whether you want an electric trimmer or a manual trimmer. Electric trimmers are quicker and more efficient, but manual trimmers don't need electricity to work, and they may not tickle your nose so much as the vibrating electric models. You should be able to find a trimmer at a pharmacy or department store for less than $20 USD. Some trimmers even come with attachments that help you shave eyebrows, beards, and other facial hair.


Manual trimmers don't require batteries or a plug, and they tend to avoid the tickling sensation that results from the vibrating electric models. Instead, manual trimmers use a simple spring-loaded ""punch"" mechanism to trim hairs from your nose--something like a single hole-punch or a pair of wire cutters.You will need to use two hands to operate most manual trimmers.
Electric trimmers cut hairs quickly and efficiently, and most can be used with one hand. Some trimmers are battery-powered (and hence, cordless), while others must be plugged into an outlet. Some electric trimmers feature a rotating blade that spins in one continuous direction, while other trimmers work with an oscillating blade that rotates from left to right. Neither option works significantly better or worse than the other., Make sure that your nose is clean and dry. Blow your nose beforehand, if need be, to remove any gunk. If you're battling a cold, a flu, or any other sinus-related infection, wait until the sickness subsides before you try to trim away your nose hairs: if you clear too many hairs, you may give new contaminants an easy passage into your already-compromised immune system.

, Make sure that the lights are bright enough to clearly see into your nostrils: good lighting helps you see the lighter hairs that may be sticking out of your nose. You may need to get close to the mirror to see enough detail. Try using a magnifying mirror or a hand-held mirror to get the right angle. Keep a towel on hand to wipe your face when you're done, and keep tissues on hand to clean the trimmings out of your nostrils.

, Tilt your head back and carefully insert the nose trimmer, looking into the mirror for accuracy. Try gently pulling down your upper lip to open up the nasal passage. The trimmer should fit comfortably; don't push it all the way in. Stir the trimmer in a slow circular motion, moving up and down the nostril.


Your trimmer shouldn't hurt you or cut your skin--especially not an electric trimmer. The blades are covered such that they buzz nose hair close, but never actually touch the skin. Some trimmers, however--especially the manual variety--may occasionally (and painfully) yank a hair from the root.
Be careful not to insert the trimmer too deeply in your nose. You only want to trim the hairs peeking out below your nose--the ones that people will notice. Leave the rest of the hair alone to help protect you from bacteria.
Buzz until you're satisfied with your appearance. The trimming shouldn't take you long--perhaps only a matter of seconds. If you aren't sure, pull the trimmer from your nostril and inspect the situation in the mirror.

, Try to trim only the most visible hairs: the hairs near the rim of your nostril, and any large hairs that noticeably protrude from your nose. Smile at yourself in the mirror--or push your nose straight up with your finger--to reveal nose hairs that don't poke out otherwise. Trim only what you absolutely need to trim. Your nose hairs serve an important function by protecting your body from infection, and removing nose hair completely could have negative side effects.

, Clean the nose hair trimmer, clean your face, and wipe up any stray nose hair trimmings that have spilled onto the sink, the counter, or the floor.


You can clean most manual nose hair trimmers by rinsing the blades with running water, but many electric trimmers are not wet/dry capable. Wipe an electric trimmer clean with a moist or dry towel, and be careful not to submerge it in water. Unplug or switch off electric trimmers before wiping them clean.
Use a towel to wipe off any hair that's fallen onto your face. Lightly blow your nose into a tissue to catch any remaining trimmings--and consider cleaning out your nostril with a tissue, a sanitary wipe, or a nasal spray.
Use a towel, tissue, or sponge to clean stray hairs from any surfaces. Dispose of your cleaning tool or wash it clean.

Consider trimming instead of plucking.,
Find a sanitary pair of tweezers.,
Don't pluck when you're sick.,
Stand in front of a well-lit mirror.,
Pluck the hairs that drive you crazy, but don't remove everything.,
Pluck any offending nose hairs.,
Pluck until you're satisfied with your appearance.",How to Get Rid of Nose Hair3," Many doctors advise against plucking nose hairs: not only can plucking be much more painful than trimming, but it may leave your nasal passage vulnerable to dangerous contaminants and bacterial infections. If you do decide to pluck, be judicious with the tweezers and don't pluck everything.Keep in mind that nose hairs serve an important biological function: they grow so thickly in order to prevent bacteria and other foreign contaminants from entering your nasal passage. When you clear away the majority of your nose hairs, you open yourself up to infection.When you pluck a hair from your nose, the tender hole that the plucked hair leaves behind can easily become infected by any bacteria--including potentially dangerous Staph bacteria--that happen to be lurking in your nostril. It is rare for serious infections to take root in the wake of plucking, but it is always a risk. If you notice redness, oozing, or a non-healing sore in your nose, ask your doctor to test you for infection.

, Ideally, they should be small enough to fit comfortably into your nostril, but not so small that they're flimsy. Clean your tweezers with water and antibacterial soap, and towel them dry before you use them.


Consider using antiseptic to sterilize the tweezers: if they have been used before, especially by other people, they might carry germs and bacteria that you don't want to inhale.
Consider making your own nose hair plucker using a metal spring. This design may enable you to pull out many hairs at once, but it won't necessary alleviate the pain or protect you from infection.

, Make sure that your nose is clean and dry. Blow your nose beforehand, if need be, to remove any gunk. If you're battling a cold, a flu, or any other sinus-related infection, wait until the sickness subsides before you try to pluck your nose hairs: not only will the procedure further irritate your nasal passage, but it may give other contaminants a ready passage into your already-compromised immune system.

, Make sure that you have a place to dispose of the hairs that you pluck--a sink, a waste bin, or a disposable towel will do. Make sure that the lights are bright enough to clearly see into your nostrils: good lighting helps you see the lighter hairs that may be sticking out of your nose.


You may need to get up close to the mirror to see enough detail. Try using a magnifying mirror or a hand-held mirror to get the right angle.
Nose hairs may stick to the tweezers as you pluck. Keep a tissue, napkin, or towel on hand to wipe the tweezers down. If you have access to a sink, you can rinse the tweezers clean of any clinging hair after each pluck.

, Try to pluck only the most visible hairs: the hairs near the rim of your nostril, and any large hairs that noticeably protrude from your nose. Smile at yourself in the mirror to reveal nose hairs that don't poke out otherwise. Resist the temptation to pluck hairs toward the back of your nostril, and by all means leave most of your hairs intact. Again, your nose hairs serve an important function by protecting your body from infection, and removing nose hair completely could have negative side effects.

, Focus first on one nostril, and then move on to the other. Stick the tweezers directly into your nose, but not so far up that it's painful. Grip each hair firmly at the root and give it a quick, sharp tug. Wipe the hairs off onto a clean tissue, or rinse them off of the tweezers with water.


Be prepared for sharp, fleeting pain--it hurts to pull out any hair, but the skin inside your nose is especially sensitive. Make quick, purposeful plucks, and give yourself a few moments for the pain to subside between each tug.
Your eyes will water, and you may feel a sudden urge to sneeze. A sneeze is a muscular twitch that expels airborne irritants from your nostrils. When you pluck a nose hair, it can irritate the skin of your nostril and trigger the ""expel airborne irritant"" response. You can push your tongue against the roof of your mouth to suppress the urge to sneeze, or you can just let the sneeze happen.
Consider numbing the pain: you can use a quick-acting topical analgesic like IcyHot, or you can try sticking a small ice cube up your nostril for 20-60 seconds. Be aware that if you can't feel any pain, you may pluck so much that your nose hurts later on.

, Remember: you may be scrutinizing your own face much more closely and critically than everyone else see your face. When you're finished, clean the tweezers: wipe them with antiseptic or wash them with soap and water. Blow your nose to expel any hairs that you missed--and consider cleaning out your nostril with a tissue, a sanitary wipe, or a nasal spray. Clean up any stray hairs that have fallen onto the sink, the counter, or the floor.

Get 3-5 hours of aerobic workouts in each week.,
Try sprint or interval training.,
Do lunges.,
Try groin exercises like leg lifts.,
Do calf raises.,
Lift weights to build leg muscles.,
Make sure you are exercising effectively and safely.",How to Have Perfect Legs3," An aerobic workout is one that speeds up your heart rate and breathing. Think of swimming, running, or biking. Even going for a walk is a great way to get your legs into shape and cut fat around your thighs. Try leg-specific exercises, such as


Riding a bike
Swimming
Stair climbing
Elliptical

, Toning your muscles requires periods of intensity to mold muscle fibers. Jogging is not going to do this for us, but interval running will. To interval train, run at top speed for 30 seconds and then jog for 1 minute to relax. After the minute is up, start sprinting again for 30 seconds. Repeat this pattern 10-15 times.


Remember to warm up and cool down before and after your workout.

, Deep lunges tone the thighs and the butt. To do one, step forward as far as you can with your right foot. Slowly lower your left knee and your waist down towards the floor, “sinking” into the lunge. Stand up and alternate sides, repeating each side 10 times, 3 sets in a row.

, These tone your inner thigh, or “thigh gap.” Lay on your right side and lift your left diagonally into the air, as if you were trying to fit a ball in between your thighs. Repeat 20 times, then switch sides. Work out each side 3-5 times.

, These are easily done anywhere you have a small ledge. Stand on a step or any raised surface on the balls of your feet, leaving your heels off the edge. Slowly stand up on your tip-toes and then lower your heels back down below the edge. Repeat 20 times, 3 times in a row for killer calf muscles.

, One of the most effective ways to build killer, perfect legs is to grow and tone your muscles. The rumors that lifting makes women look “bulky” are largely lies—weightlifting is a simple way to get better results, faster, and you will be in control of how big you get.While there are a lot of different exercise machines, these few exercises are a good way to start toning your calves, thighs, and butt:



Deadlift.
Squats
Leg Curls

, Proper technique is the most important thing to master when trying to tone muscles. Being sloppy leads to injuries and prevents your muscles from growing as quickly as they could otherwise. Some basic principles to remember include:


“No pain, no gain” is a myth. Exercises should be challenging but not painful, otherwise you are risking injury.
Aim for 3-5 sets of 10-15 reps with every exercise for the best results.

Keep your posture strong – back straight, joints never fully extended, and feet firmly planted on the ground.

Gather the necessary supplies and ingredients.,
Prepare the sugaring paste.,
Keep an eye on it.,
Stir in the guar gum using a rapid motion.,
Pour the sugaring paste into a storage container or a glass mason jar while it’s still liquid.,
Use anywhere there is unwanted hair.,
Prep your skin.,
Begin with clean, dry skin.,
Stretch the paste by pulling it against the direction the hair grows.,
Sugar the area numerous times if necessary.,
Use the pan on only half the burner, or quickly turn it down if it boils over.,
Cook it longer if it melts and is too soft when you try to apply it.,
Add water and microwave the mixture if it’s too hard.,
Stretch a new piece of sugar over it when some of the paste gets stuck to your skin.",How to Use Body Sugaring Paste," You can use any kind of sugar. The guar gum is optional. It just helps the paste to last longer. You don’t need to squeeze your own lemon or lime juice either. Pre-packaged juice works just as well.;
, Measure the lemon or lime juice, sugar and water into your saucepan. Turn the heat on high, and stir until it dissolves. If you’re using a non-stick saucepan, it’s best to use a rubber spatula. On the side of the pan, attach the thermometer. 







, Once it starts to heat up, the temperature rises quickly so watch it carefully. Take the pan off the burner when the thermometer reaches 240 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature may vary slightly depending on your climate. This temperature is based on a dry, mild climate.








, The color of the sugaring paste will depend on how long it’s been heated. Sugar caramelizes and generally turns brown when heated for a long time, which is fine for sugaring purposes. It could also look deep maroon or light or dark amber. Basically, as long as the mixture is soft enough to use at room temperature, any of these colors are fine. 







, However, you don’t want it to be so hot that it cracks or melts it. Allow it to cool to room temperature for a few hours. Don’t try to use it hot.








, Because the ingredients are mild and non-toxic, it can be used on any part of the body -- the legs, underarms, the bikini line, and even the face. While many people say it’s not painful, it really depends on the person. Those who tend to be immune to pain, have sparse hair, or have sugared or waxed before may find it less painful., You definitely want to do this. It’s an important part of the process. Sugaring works best after a shower or bath but not right after, as the moisture will prevent the sugar from sticking. The reason you want to bathe beforehand, though, is because it opens the pores, which helps lessen any pain.

, Sprinkle talcum







, If the hair is long, this can pull! Sugaring works best on hair that’s short, so it’s a good idea to trim longer hairs before starting. After you’ve applied it, wait a few seconds to give it time to sink into the pores. This helps it to grip better. To remove it, use a flicking motion going in the same direction that the hair grows. Use a new piece of sugar when it stops feeling “stretchy.”








Flick only as far as your wrist can go. For instance, if you’re waxing your leg, don’t go all the way from your knee to your ankle.
Don’t pull up or out; pull along. Basically, what you’re doing is sliding the hairs out from the natural way they grow.
Use your other hand to hold the skin taut. You don’t want it to bounce as you’re doing it.

, Unlike wax, it’s common to sugar an area a few times. If it’s painful afterwards, (which it sometimes is on more sensitive areas), gently rub it with the other hand. The rubbing action acts as a slight pain blocker. The results from sugaring last for weeks at a time. Similar to waxing, the hair gets sparser and softer with repeated sugaring.








Gather the little bits that are leftover with the sugar that’s in your hand, the way you pick up Playdoh, as sugar sticks to itself. Overall, you will find it’s a lot less messy than waxing. If you get it on anything, it’s okay. It’s water-soluble and should wash right out. , The size of the pan could cause it to react differently. Usually a non-stick, small saucepan is the best choice. Even with the right pan, you may still need to use only part of the burner or a lower heat.

, If this occurs, perhaps the thermometer wasn’t working right or some other unknown factor. Try re-heating it again or start from scratch. Jot down the temperature that ends up working for you.

, If you leave it on the heat too long, this can happen. But it can usually be saved by adding water and microwaving it for 10 seconds at a time until it softens throughout., Usually it flicks right off, but if you handle it for too long, it melts and gets too gooey. Once this happens, you can’t use it anymore and it sticks to the skin. Scoop a new piece out, place it over the old, flick both off, and start over with another piece."

Find a pumice stone.,
Decide where you want to use the pumice stone.,
Wash your body in warm water.,
Use soap or shower gel to clean the area you plan to use the pumice stone.,
Lather soap, shower gel, baby oil, or other lubricant over the area you want to buff.,
Gently rub the pumice stone against your skin using small, circular motions.,
Continue this process until you have buffed the entire area.

,
Rinse the buffed area with water and apply a mild moisturizer.,
Clean the pumice with warm, soapy water and a brush.,
Be patient.",How to Get Rid of Hair Anywhere on Your Body With Pumice," Pumice stones are inexpensive (usually between $3-$10) and can be found in drug stores, natural grocery stores, and online. You can identify pumice by its porous surface. It is lightweight and usually grey or black.You can find pumice stones with rubber grips attached or as part of a brush (usually with a nail brush or other buffering tools). Use whatever you're comfortable with.;
, Though it is possible to use pumice anywhere on your body, that doesn't mean you should. Areas with delicate skin and coarse hair (like your bikini area or face) should be avoided if possible. Removing the coarse hair would require too much pressure and damage your skin.Maybe you'd get the hair off your upper lip with time, but you'd have a very red, irritated, possibly cut upper lip instead. Not a great trade-off.


The pumice method works best on legs, arms, scalps (if you're bald and looking to get that shine), and shoulders.
The pumice method is a good way to perform upkeep between waxing sessions.
If you do plan to use the pumice on your face or bikini area, be extremely gentle. Consider other methods first, like waxing, tweezing, hair removal creams, or shaving.
Do not use the pumice on skin that is already irritated, red, sunburned, broken, or peeling., This method of hair removal will work best if the hair is softened. A warm shower or bath will give the hair time to soften up before you begin., Any time you use an abrasive on your skin (pumice, hair removal mitts, sandpaper), you risk scratching the skin, which makes you susceptible to infection. Cleaning the skin beforehand will minimize the chance of contaminating a scratch with bacteria.

, This can help prevent chaffing and irritation when you begin using the pumice stone., Alternate between clockwise and counter-clockwise. Your strokes should be brisk, but you should apply very little pressure to the skin.If your skin begins to feel irritated, or the process is painful in any way, stop immediately.
Do not use an up-and-down or sawing motion, as this is more likely to cut your skin.
Start at the edge of the area where you are removing hair. If you are using it on your arm, begin at your wrist. That way, if you stop partway through, you won't have random patches of missing hair.,, Your skin may be red and slightly irritated from the process. Moisturizer will keep your skin from drying out and may soothe any irritation.


Do not use a perfumed moisturizer, as this may further irritate the skin.

, Remove all the hair and dead skin from the pores of the stone so it will be ready for your next use.


The pumice will exfoliate your skin, so you shouldn't have to worry about ingrown hairs. Your skin should also be very soft, since the stone removed the top layer of dead skin.

, You may not see results immediately. Removing hair by this method is gradual, and it may be days or weeks before you see a difference, depending on your skin and the type of hair you are removing.Wait 1-3 days before using the pumice stone again. Using this method too often can cause severe irritation or over-exfoliate your skin."

;
, Shave gel helps razors move across your skin more smoothly, preventing cuts and nicks.







, This movement pulls your skin taut. You’ll now be able to remove hair from hard to reach areas with your razor more easily.







, Underarm hair grows in a swirl pattern. Using an X motion helps to prevent skin irritations and ensures a closer shave.







, The cool water will close your pores.







, Once you’ve finished shaving the first underarm, follow the process again on the second underarm.









Use warm water to rinse your razor. You should rinse your razor in-between each shave to keep it clean., You apply more pressure against your skin when you use a dull razor, which can lead to razor burn.

Trim thick or long patches.,
Exfoliate.,
If you have an electric shaver, use this first.,
Apply the shaving cream or gel.,
Shave.,
Optionally, shower.,
Dry off.",How to Get Rid of Back Hair1," If you have thick, dense back hair growth, this can clog the razor. Trim it down first to ensure the best results with shaving.


There are several ways to do this. For example, you can have your assistant cut it with a pair of scissors and a comb or use a heavy-duty set of electric clippers.;
, Have your assistant scrub your back with warm water and a mild abrasive. You can use a shower brush, a mild body scrub, or a pumice stone — whatever you're comfortable with. This will exfoliate your skin, getting rid of dead skin cells before you shave.


The main benefit of this is that it reduces the chance of ingrown hairs.However, it's not strictly necessary, so you can skip this step if you're in a hurry.

, Electric clippers aren't as good as razors for getting a close, smooth shave, but they are good at getting through a lot of hair fast. If you have a set, have your assistant go over your entire back once, giving it a rough shave.


You don't need to shave all the way down to the skin — just cut down on most of the ""bulk."" When you shave with a razor in a few steps, your work will go quicker and there will be less hair to clog the razor.

, Have your assistant apply your preferred shaving lubricant all over your back in a single layer. Whatever you normally use for your face should be fine.


Keep in mind that this will use a lot more lubricant than your typical face-shaving session. Make sure you have plenty before you start or you may need to make a trip to the store mid-shave.

, Tell your assistant to start shaving. You'll probably want to be near a sink for this so your assistant can rinse the razor. Have your assistant apply more gel or cream as needed until your entire back is shaved.


To get a smooth shave without discomfort, shave your entire back once with the grain, then shave again against the grain.Shaving against the grain first can cause minor pain and irritation.

, You don't need to, but this is a great way to rinse off stray hairs that can become uncomfortable when you put on your shirt. Plus, it feels great — especially if you haven't had a smooth back in a long time.

, Pat the skin dry lightly with a clean towel. Be sure to use a patting motion, not a rubbing one. Rubbing can irritate the newly-exposed, delicate skin.To keep the skin smooth and supple, you may want to apply unscented lotion all over the back. Avoid scented lotions — the chemicals in these can irritate post-shave skin (especially if your assistant accidentally gave you tiny cuts or nicks).

Shave your body hair.,
Open your pores with hot water.,
Wet the area you want to shave (for example, your leg).,
Take your razor and shave a line smoothly upward.,
Moisturize your skin.",How to Get Rid of Body Hair1," Shaving is the most basic method to get rid of body hair. You can buy a razor and shaving cream in most grocery stores, pharmacies, and even gas stations. Shaving is a fast and painless way to get rid of hair, however it doesn't prevent hair from growing back.


Unlike waxing, shaving does not hurt, but because of the sharp blades from the razor, you can cut yourself frequently.
Shaving only lasts for up to a week, until the hair is visible again. Some hair grows back within 1-2 days.;
, Open the pores to ensure a smooth shave by either submersing the skin to be shaved in a hot bath or taking a hot shower. If you shave as part of your shower routine, wait until the end (making sure the water is hot at least a few minutes before you begin) to begin shaving.

, Apply shaving cream/gel liberally to the area you intend to shave and wait a few minutes for it to set in. This time is critical to ensure the skin is properly lubricated to protect against the razor. Cover the entire area you want to shave.

, Slowly run the razor across your hair. After 5-6 inches, rinse off the shaving cream and hair and repeat. Slowly (as slowly as you can) shave and with each stroke, wash the blade under hot water. Continue until your skin is smooth.


Make sure not to press to hard on your skin. Lightly graze it.

, You must moisturize to maintain your skin! Shaving removes the most superficial layer so skin is extra-sensitive to damage, but also will absorb moisture better, so take advantage of the time. Use moisturizers with vitamin E or shea butter to help soothe skin and keep it looking young.


If you need extra protection against razor burn, use an astringent cream or oil (usually containing an analgesic) to prevent irritation.

, Depilatory creams usually work in 10 minutes or less, but it’s always good to check the instructions for the one you’re using.Wipe off the cream immediately if you experience a burning sensation. Any pain means you’ve left the product on too long or your skin is too sensitive.You may want to do an allergy test 24 hours before you intend to use the depilatory cream.

Do not use the cream if you have a reaction., You’ll see both cream and hairs in the towel. Don’t freak out!

Have an assistant help you if you're even a little worried about not being able to reach the middle of your back — you don't want to miss any spots. You don't need to vigorously rub the cream into your skin. Just apply it gently over all of your hair.


Wash your hands after your have applied the cream. The cream can irritate your skin if it's allowed to dry (not to mention that it will remove any hair on the backs of your hands it is allowed to work on).

, The cream's packaging will tell you how long to let it sit. Usually, this will be somewhere in the neighborhood of about three to six minutes.


After waiting, use a damp cloth or towel to wipe a small area of your back. If the hair does not come off easily, wait another couple of minutes.

, When the hair comes off easily, use the damp cloth to gently wipe it off. Again, if you can't reach the center of your back, get an assistant to help.

, This is a quick, convenient way to rinse all of the cream (and the dissolved hair) off. You can rinse your back with water from a towel, but it's much easier to miss spots and allow the cream to sit for too long this way.

There will probably be many different varieties of available. All other things being equal, hot waxing kits work tend to work best for the back because they can cover a larger area.Note: Waxing will leave your back red and sensitive, so start this method at least 24 hours before you want to show it off.

, This is usually easiest in the shower. This is an important step — the wax has a much easier time grabbing your hair if it is free of sweat and oil.


After showering, be sure to dry your back thoroughly.

, For most hot waxes, you'll need to heat the wax up (usually in the microwave). The temperature of the wax should be warm, but not painfully hot. Different products will have slightly different sets of instructions.

, Use the included waxing stick (or a clean spatula) to spread the wax in the direction of hair growth. Work in small patches of no more than a few inches around at once.

, While the wax is still hot, firmly press the paper or fabric strips into the wax. Let the strip sit for for a few moments to allow it to stick.

, Pull the strip in the against the direction of hair growth. This is the opposite of the direction you applied the wax. Use a quick, fluid motion. Don't go slowly — this will hurt.


To reduce pain, do not pull straight up or up at an angle. Keep the strip close to the body as you pull in a direction parallel to the skin and pull as quickly as possible.

, Continue until all of the hair on the back has been removed. This will take many applications. Don't be afraid to take breaks if the pain becomes too much. Future waxings tend to hurt less than the first.


If the pain is ever unbearable, stop — burning or injuring yourself isn't worth worrying about uneven back hair.

, After you finish your waxing, your back is likely to be a little red and irritated. In this state, it's more vulnerable to infections than normal. To reduce this risk, wash it with soap. An easy way to do this is to simply take a shower."

Prep your back.,
Find an appropriate workplace.,
Use the smaller mirror to see your work.,
Shave your upper back.,
Shave your lower back.,
Double-check to ensure you haven't missed any spots.",How to Get Rid of Back Hair4," Everything you need to do to shave with a back shaver is the same as if you were working with a normal razor and an assistant. In other words:


Exfoliate with water and a gentle abrasive or brush to reduce the risk of ingrown hairs.
Clean and dry your back if you are using an electric razor.
Wet your back and apply shaving cream/gel if you are using a standard razor.

, While a back shaver will allow you to reach your whole back, you'll still probably miss spots if you can't see what you're doing. Find a bathroom that has a large mirror. Grab a smaller mirror and face away from it.

, With one hand, hold the shaver. With the other hand, angle a smaller mirror in front of you. Adjust it so that you can see your back in mirror behind you with the reflection from the small mirror in your hand.

, Fully extend the arm of the back shaver. Lift your arm up over your head with your elbow bent and position the shaver in the center of your back. Use gentle, controlled motions to shave the hair on your back in rows from your mid-back up to your shoulders.

, Bend the shaver at an angle (if your shaver has this option). Angle your arm to reach your lower back hair from the side. You'll probably need to adjust the mirror so you can see what you're doing.

, Since it's hard to look at your entire back at once with the two-mirror setup, take a few minutes to look at each spot individually. If you see any leftover hair, shave it as normal.


After you're done, take a quick shower to wash off stray hair. Pat dry with a towel and, if desired, apply a gentle unscented lotion to keep the skin soft and smooth.

Try waxing your hair.,
Start with clean dry skin.,
Buy hair removal wax.,
Pull the skin taut with one hand.,
Pull the wax strip in the direction opposite hair growth with the remaining hand.,
Care for your skin before and after waxing.",How to Get Rid of Body Hair2," Waxing strips out all of hair at once by pulling it out of you skin with a strong adhesive. Hair removal wax comes in two forms, a wax that you apply then press paper strips to, or strips with wax already stuck to them. This is often done at a salon, but you can buy at-home waxing kits as. Waxing is another relatively safe way to remove hairs, though it is not recommended around sensitive areas of skin as it can cause injuries, rashes and discomfort. Waxing is generally done on the chest, arms, legs and armpits.


Every time you wax, your hair gets thinner, so over time, you may barely have any hair on your body.
Waxing hurts, but the pain is brief.
Waxing can result in skin burns, irritation, and redness for hours after treatment. If you have sensitive skin, try looking for Sugar Wax, or Beeswax. Many salons have their own formula for wax, but don't be afraid to ask.

, Wash the area thoroughly with soap and water and exfoliate with bath salts or a loofah before drying to make sure to remove any moisturizers or natural skin oils and prepare the skin for waxing.

, You can buy cold wax strips or heatable wax, which must be warmed in the microwave and then applied to your skin. In general, the strips are much cleaner and easier to use, though they are less precise.


Consider sugar waxing. Sugar waxing is much like waxing, although it is applied in the opposite direction of hair growth, then torn in the direction of growth. This causes the hair removal process to be less painful than waxing, but still may cause redness after treatment. This is often done at salons, but you can make your own sugar wax from sugar, water, salt, and lemon.

, You want your skin to be tight so that wax does not get into creases or wrinkles, causing pain. Rub the wax strip in the direction of hair growth multiple times to ensure maximum adherence.

, This is essential and necessary to remove the maximum amount of hair! If some is left behind, the same strip can be re-applied, rubbed and pulled in the same manner until the strip seems to lose its stickiness (you'll be able to tell by both the appearance-covered in hair, and the degree of stickiness: less sticky= more hair on strip that was already removed= less area to stick to remaining hair).

, With waxing (unlike shaving), it is ESSENTIAL that you use an after-wax treatment, such as Tend Skin -a celebrity favorite! But any astringent with analgesic (for pain) will work. Aloe vera gel will also work.


Using aloe vera or tend skin 4 days before waxing can help make the hair easier to remove. Ibuprofin before hair removal can also alleviate pain and swelling.
Heavy exercise immediately after waxing is not recommended as it can irritate the skin. Swimming should wait at least 24 hours. Moisturize the area daily to soften new hair growth that could become ingrown if left unchecked.

"
"
Consider epilating.,
Pull your skin taut.,
Move the epilator across the skin in the direction opposite hair growth.,
Use tweezers for small areas of body hair.,
Pluck your eyebrows with tweezers.",How to Get Rid of Body Hair3," An epilator is made of many many tweezers that pluck out the hair, and can remove your hair for up to two weeks on average. Epilators are painful and more time consuming than shaving, but because it removes the entire hair follicle the results will last much longer. Instead of cutting the hair, an epilator has grooves and small indents where, as you run it up your body it grips the hair and pulls it out at the root.


Epilators, however can cause a lot of problems with ingrown hairs - be sure to use a hair reduction cream like Depil or Vanish PFB after use.

, Epilators cannot reach into creases or wrinkles, but they may grab exposed skin painfully. Use one hand to pull your skin tight as you use it.


Wet epilation requires submerging the machine and skin underwater during use.
Dry epilation requires clean, dry skin.

, Multiple passes and directions may be used to achieve best results by removing the most hair (not all hair grows in the same direction).


If irritation occurs, apply an astringent/analgesics (such as Tend Skin) and follow up with lotion to soften and soothe skin. Redness may appear for the first 24 hours following epilation. Plan to perform hair removal at least a day before scheduled events.

, Tweezing the hair can be very time consuming, especially if on a larger body part, however it is very effective in reducing and stopping hair growth on your face. Pulling hair out individually ensures that you are pulling the hair out from the root. While it can be painful, it is also the cheapest form of hair removal.

, You can't shave or 'wax' your eyebrows. Most people use a pair of tweezers to pull all the hairs out individually.


Use a bright light to see all your eyebrow hairs.

"
"
Buy Nair, Veet, Nad's, or a similar hair removal cream.,
Apply to a small portion of your skin at first, such as an upper leg.,
Watch the area overnight to make sure no irritation appears.",How to Get Rid of Body Hair4," Hair removal cream is similar to shaving, since the effects last a short amount of time, but does not use a razor or shaving cream. The Nair cream is applied to the hair for specific amount of time, which dissolves the hair, and then is scraped off.These creams chemically remove hair without pain; results can last up to two weeks. This is bought at most drugstores such as Walmart, RiteAid, or Target.


This is done in the comfort of your own home as well, but is slightly more time consuming than shaving. This method is easier if you're prone to accidental cutting from razors, or have trouble shaving.
There are some limitations to this method. You can't put them anywhere near your face, breasts (women) or genitals. Some people have an allergic reaction to the chemicals which may result in a rash, extreme tingling sensation or general discomfort to the area. If any of these occur, you should seek medical advice.
Hair removal creams are one of the safest options providing you don't have an allergy to them. To check if you do have an allergy you can start by applying a small amount to the back of your hand, waiting five minutes and noting if any symptoms occur (Itchiness, Rash, Redness, Irritation, inflammation etc.). If you do get symptoms, maybe hair removal cream isn't your best option.

, It's best to do this before you shower. Wet your skin down, apply the cream and lather it up, wait for up to 10 minutes (5 normally does it), then scrape the cream off. Most creams come with a soft plastic scraper, don't let it intimidate you, just press it to the skin and glide. Afterwards you can rinse the rest of it off with water as it may leave the area feeling sticky/slimy.


Don't leave the cream on your skin for longer than the specified time.
Wash yourself thoroughly with warm water and mild soap, and rinse twice according to the directions.

, If you experience irritation, you'll need to try another method. If you do it too much, it can damage the layers of your skin. It does not hurt, but the hair and the cells inside your skin remain damaged and the hair grows thicker.

Wash your skin with warm water.,
Dry the skin with a clean towel if you wash.,
Epilate the back.,
Wash your back with soap.",How to Get Rid of Back Hair5," Taking a quick bath or shower softens you back hairs and relaxes your skin. This can make it a lot easier to remove the hair, so while it's not essential, it's usually a wise idea.


You don't need to wash with soap yet — this will come later.

Note: As with waxing, it's best to do this method the day before you need to show off your back so any redness and irritation will have a chance to subside.

, Most epilators work better on dry skin.Some, however, are designed to be used in wet environments — check the packaging if you are unsure.


Optionally, you can apply some talc or baby powder after drying off with a towel. This will further dry the hair in addition to getting it to stand up, making epilation easier., Turn the epilator on. Get an assistant to drag it slowly across the patches of hair on your back. The teeth of the epilator will pull the hairs out (similar to how a waxing strip would). This is generally described as being painful, though there is some debate about whether waxing or epilating hurts more. As when waxing, don't hesitate to take breaks.


If the pain is too intense, dragging the epilator across the skin more quickly can reduce the amount of time you have to endure the pain. However, you may need to go back over the same patch multiple times if you miss hairs.

, When you're done, your back will likely be red and irritated. To help prevent infection, wash gently with soap and warm water. Pat dry with a clean towel when done.

"
"
Get a professional waxing.,
Consider laser treatment.,
Consider electrolysis.",How to Get Rid of Back Hair6," A professional waxing will work more or less the same way as if you were doing it yourself or having a friend help you. The level of pain is likely to be roughly the same. Professionals may be able to work more quickly than amateur assistants and, depending the service you use, you may be in a more comfortable environment than you would be at home.


Back waxing fees will vary by location. $40-$70 for just the back is typical — costs will be higher if extra areas are waxed., This option uses a precisely-controlled medical laser to burn individual hair roots. Multiple treatments are usually needed over time to get permanent results. Some limited hair regrowth can occur over time, though multiple sessions make this less likely.This procedure tends to cost about $400-$500 per session.
One advantage of laser treatments is that they allow the option of ""thinning out"" patches of hair, rather than removing all of it., This option uses a small electrical probe to individually shock each hair follicle. Electrolysis is truly permanent — once each cell is treated, it is very rare that hair will regrow. However, since each hair follicle must be treated individually, it can be very time-consuming.


This procedure costs about $40 per treatment, but a large area like your back may require many treatments."

Know the difference between deodorant and antiperspirant.,
Consider if deodorant is right for you.,
Consider if antiperspirant is right for you.,
Consider a combo.,
Understand where the research stands on health risks.,
Understand labels.,
Look past “men’s” and “women’s” varieties.,

Be prepared to change it up.,

Make your own.,
Experiment to see if you really need deodorant.",How to Choose the Best Deodorant," Deodorant reduces odor by eliminating the bacteria in sweat, while antiperspirant reduce sweat by stopping up sweat glands and keeping it from reaching your skin., If sweat is not really an issue for you, and you are only looking to control odor, this is probably your best bet.

, Some people sweat excessively, although this is only a medical condition in about 2% of the population.Still, athletes and others who sweat profusely may feel that deodorant alone doesn’t do the job.


Antiperspirant has its drawbacks, however. While researchers are not sure exactly how this happens, the aluminum in antiperspirant can lead to yellow stains on your clothes.You can often get these stains out with bleach, but if this is a big concern to you, stick with deodorant.
It’s also possible that antiperspirant actually causes your body to start producing excess sweat to circumvent the blocked glands —the opposite of what you want!
For all of these reasons, unless you really need antiperspirant, you might want to keep it simple and stick to deodorant.

, While the availability of combination antiperspirant/deodorant—the majority of mainstream choices falls into this category, actually—means you can get the benefits of both, you will also have to deal with the drawbacks of both.

, Over the years, there have been many rumors about health risks associated with antiperspirant and deodorant, including that they cause breast cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. Many of these concerns have been connected to the presence of aluminum in antiperspirant. Research has not determined any clear linkage, however.


Researchers at the National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration have determined that there is not evidence to conclude that these products cause breast cancer.Scientists have also not found compelling evidence to associate antiperspirant or deodorant with Alzheimer’s disease.However, research in these areas is ongoing, so some consumers may still wish to be cautious.

, Antiperspirant and deodorant aren’t magic. The FDA regulates antiperspirant and deodorant, but it only requires that antiperspirant cut down on sweat by 20% to be considered “all day,” and 30% to be considered “extra strength.”, There are some differences in men’s and women’s sweat glands—women have more individual glands, but each gland on men’s bodies produces more sweat—but these differences do not affect how deodorant will work.Ingredients do not really change between men’s and women’s varieties, although they may look and smell different.
Women will probably save money by switching to a men’s product, since there tends to be a price mark-up for items marketed to women.

, While Americans tend to prefer solids and roll-ons, sprays account for half of all deodorant sales worldwide. There are several factors to consider when deciding which is right for you.Many roll-ons go on clear, but they create a wet feeling that some may find uncomfortable.
Solids feel drier, and they often contain soothing ingredients to counteract irritation. However, it is difficult to avoid getting solid deodorant on clothing.
Sprays dry quickly and last longer than roll-ons and solids, but they are often more expensive than other products.

, Especially if you shave your armpits, this area of skin can be very sensitive. Certain ingredients in deodorant can exacerbate this problem. Read ingredient lists very carefully if you tend toward dryness or sensitivity. Just like laundry detergent, perfume, and other products, deodorant often contains fragrances, which can irritate your skin and cause reactions similar to seasonal allergies.
Many products also contain alcohol as a propellant (sprays) and/or antimicrobial agent. This may also be a deterrent to those with dry or sensitive skin.

, Your body can develop resistance to specific formulas, so experts recommend switching brands every six months.Scientists aren’t exactly sure why this happens, but it may be due to excess sweat breaking through.
You can also avoid resistance by applying antiperspirant at night, when you sweat less, anyway., If all else fails, your doctor can write you a prescription for a product stronger than those available over the counter.

, Many people prefer to use natural deodorant. For some it is about avoiding artificial ingredients that they can’t pronounce; for others it is a desire not to interfere with the body’s natural sweating process. Whatever your reason, there are many natural choices on the market.


As with all products, people find natural deodorant to be of varying levels of efficacy. You’ll have to experiment to find what works for you.
However, many people find that roll-ons and sprays work better than sticks. You will not find natural antiperspirant.

, Plant oils and extracts have been proven to have antimicrobial effects.These oils can be combined with other readily accessible ingredients.Try combining solids like beeswax, cocoa butter, or shea butter with oils including thyme, rosemary, or lavender.
Baking soda is also a common ingredient in homemade deodorant.

, While wanting to smell nice is not a new phenomenon, it was not easy to convince American consumers to buy deodorant. Keep in mind that companies’ business depends on convincing you that you stink!There is actually a single gene that controls whether or not you have the chemical that bacteria like to feed on, causing smelly sweat. If you don’t have this gene, you don’t need deodorant.Short of coding your DNA, you can get an idea of whether you have this gene or not by looking at your earwax, which is controlled by the same gene. If it’s dry and flaky, you likely do not produce stinky sweat.Of course, no one needs deodorant for health reasons. It’s not something you need to spend money on just because everyone else does.

Decide from where you want to remove unwanted hair.,
Take a hot shower.,
Clean and exfoliate the skin.,
Shave.,
Get a wax.,
Use a depilatory cream.,
Invest in a hair removal system.,
Pluck.",How to Get Rid of Unwanted Hair1," Hair grows on all parts of the body. Find which parts of the body you would like to remove hair from. This might influence which method you use to remove the hair.;
, For effective hair removal on any part of the body, pores need to be open. This can help reduce irritation of the skin. Soaking the hairs in warm or hot water also makes the hairs soften, resulting in easier hair removal.








, Whether you are shaving, waxing, or using a cream, washing the area and exfoliating before you remove the hair is essential. Proper pre-care is extremely important, especially if you are waxing. Removing dirt, oil, and dead skin cells increases the hair removal process, and helps to prevent irritation, redness, and ingrown hairs.









Do not exfoliate the skin right after you have removed the hair, especially just after you have shaved or waxed. Shaving exfoliates the skin, so you don't need to exfoliate again right away.Exfoliating right after you wax can irritate the skin.
Exfoliate your skin 24 to 48 hours before you wax. Exfoliating right before you wax can cause irritation.

, Shaving is perhaps the easiest and most inexpensive way to get rid of large areas of unwanted hair. This method works well for your legs, bikini line, arms, back, and chest.









Coat the area in a shave gel or cream and let it set for a few minutes before you begin shaving. Never shave dry skin or without a lather. Keeping the skin moist helps reduce irritation by helping the razor glide along the skin instead of dragging, reducing irritation and ingrown hair.Make sure to use a sharp razor; dull razors can cause irritation and cut your skin. Change the razor blades every 5-6 uses.

, Waxing is an inexpensive, effective method because it removes the hair from the roots and gets rid of the hair for longer periods of time.Home wax kits can be purchased online, at major retailers, and at beauty supply shops. They usually come with cloth strips and wooden applicators. Read the directions carefully.
Let the hair grow to about a quarter of an inch before waxing. However, don't let the hair get too long or thick.
Apply the wax on the area in the direction that the hair grows. Place the strip on top. Hold the skin taut, and then quickly pull the strip off in the opposite direction that the hair grows.Don't overheat the wax. Wax must be heated to a hot temperature to melt, and can burn the skin when the hot wax is applied. Follow the directions of your kit carefully to avoid injury.
Waxing can cause redness and irritation to the skin. In some instances, waxing can cause infection.Waxing can also cause acne or darkening of the skin., Hair removal creams contain mildly caustic chemicals made of thioglycolates.These creams dissolve the hair at the skin's surface.








Clean and moisturize the skin before applying the cream. Just like with shaving or tweezing, hairs that have been softened are more easily removed.
Depilatory creams contain chemicals, and some people's skin may have adverse reactions to them. Test a section of your skin before removing the hair to prevent rashes and breakouts.
Read the instructions carefully. Don't leave the cream on the skin longer than the directions state. Don't try to leave on longer to get rid of stubborn hair.
Make sure you buy a depilatory cream intended for the body. The formulas for the body have higher concentrations of the chemicals., Many at-home laser hair removal products are on the market. Many of these products emit light pulses or flashes that help get rid of hair, and can be used on the entire body for a full body hair removal treatment.


Look for a system that is FDA approved. FDA approved systems are generally more expensive than ones offered through private companies whose products have not been FDA approved. These systems can run as expensive as $600.Many of these systems result in 70% hair reduction after 3 months of use.
When using a hair removal system for large areas, like the legs or back, you may have to buy an attachment or larger head for the machine that covers a wider area. These tools have limited numbers of flashes, so using them on large areas of the body may mean you'll have to buy replacement cartridges.

, If you only have a few errant unwanted hairs on your chest, shoulders, or back, use tweezers to remove them. Tweezers are the most effective method for removing small areas of hair.

Consider laser treatment for a lasting solution.,
See a laser hair-removal specialist for a consultation.,
Know that it takes 6-10 appointments to fully remove hair.",How to Get Rid of Body Hair5," Laser hair-removal is a proven method to remove hair completely from your body, minimizing future hair growth. Although the process is effective, laser treatment requires a lot of patience and money.

, If you have decided to go for a laser treatment, go when you have a full hair growth. This will help the specialist to have a thorough idea about the thickness and properties of your hair which would help them to decide the radiation intensity to use.

, In order to completely clear your body, you need to have at least 6 sittings of laser hair removal. This is not only time-consuming, but painful. However, results can last a long time.

Choose a method.,
Prepare the hair.,
Exfoliate the skin.,
Tweeze the hairs.,
Shave the hair.,
Wax the skin.,
Try a depilatory cream.,
Buy a hair removal system.",How to Get Rid of Unwanted Hair2," There are many at-home hair removal treatments. These include waxing, tweezing, shaving, and depilatory creams. Depending on your level of hair and the size of the area, one method might not be appropriate for all your hair removal needs.

, Before you remove the hair, you should always prepare the hair and skin. This makes the hair more susceptible to removal by removing impurities, making it softer, and opening your pores. Preparing your skin helps to prevent irritation and ingrown hairs.


Make sure you clean your face to remove dirt and oil. This helps prevent breakouts, and also helps prepare the hairs for shaving.
Rinsing your face and neck in warm or hot water helps moisten the hairs and make them softer, making them easier to shave.A hot shower may be the most effective way of softening your hairs, especially if you want to shave or tweeze large portions of it.
Another method for softening the hairs is wrapping a warm towel around your face. Barbers use this trick when they shave customers because it opens the pores, relaxes the face, and makes the hairs easier to shave. Leave the hot towel on the face and neck for a few minutes.
You can either rinse the towel in warm or hot water, or you can heat a wet towel in the microwave for 30 seconds. Do not over heat the towel, because a microwave can heat the water in the towel to temperatures that will severely burn your face.Always test the towel before wrapping it around your face.

, Before shaving or waxing, exfoliate the skin. This process removes dead skin cells and helps bring hairs to the surface of the skin.If you are shaving, these dead skin cells can prevent a close shave.


Choose an exfoliating scrub that contains sugar, oatmeal, or salt. If you don't have an exfoliating scrub, use an exfoliating glove or a loofa.

, One of the fastest, most effective methods for getting rid of unwanted facial hair is plucking. Pull the hairs out right after you moisten and heat them. This ensures that the pores are open and the hairs soft so they will come out easily.


Use a well-lit mirror to catch all the unwanted hairs, both light and dark.
Use a good pair of tweezers that will grab onto the hairs. To properly remove the hairs, the tweezers must be able to yank it out without losing grip on the hair. Pull the hair quickly to ensure that the hair is removed and you minimize irritation.
Do not use this method for large areas. It can cause ingrown hairs and scarring.But this is a great method if you only want to pluck errant hairs on your lip, cheek, or chin, or to shape areas like the eyebrows.

, If you have thicker hair growing on your lip, cheeks, chin, or neck, shaving is an easy and inexpensive way to get rid of the unwanted hair.


Cover the area in shave gel or cream. Apply a liberal amount to the area and let it set for a few minutes before you begin shaving. Never shave dry skin or without a lather. Your bare skin needs a barrier between it and the sharp razor.Shaving without gel or cream can cause irritation and ingrown hairs.
Shave the hairs in the direction that the hair grows.Reapply shaving cream as needed to keep the area lubricated. Make sure to use a sharp razor; dull razors can cause irritation and cut your skin.

, Home wax kits can be purchased at both major retailers and beauty supply shops. There are generally two kinds of waxes: wax that needs cloth strips to remove, and wax that can be removed without strips. Choose which kind of wax suits your needs.


When waxing at home, make sure not to burn your skin. Wax must be heated to a hot temperature to melt, so be careful when applying this hot wax to your skin. Also, make sure to pull the skin taut in the opposite direction than you are pulling the strip. This prevents bruising.Whether done by a professional or done at home, waxing can cause redness and irritation to the skin. In some instances, waxing can cause infection.Waxing can also cause acne or darkening of the skin., Depilatory creams are hair removal creams that contain mildly caustic chemicals made of sodium, potassium, and calcium thioglycolate.These creams dissolve the hair at the skin's surface.Make sure the skin is clean and moisturized before applying the cream. Just like with shaving or tweezing, hairs that have been softened are more easily removed.
Always test a section of your skin before removing the hair. Some people's skin is sensitive to the chemicals, which causes a rash.
Read the instructions carefully. There are many different kinds of depilatory creams on the market, and they have different directions. Only leave the cream on for as long as the directions state. Don't try to leave on longer to get rid of stubborn hair.
Make sure to buy hair removal cream designed just for the face.

, Many products are on the market now that are at-home laser hair removal products. Many of these products emit light pulses or flashes that help get rid of hair.

Invest in laser hair removal.,
Go to a salon.,
Consider electrolysis.",How to Get Rid of Unwanted Hair3," Laser hair removal is a cosmetic surgery that beams concentrated light into the hair follicles. When the light is absorbed, the follicle dies.This method is effective for most areas of the body, especially the face, legs, and arms.


Laser hair removal is a medical procedure. Before getting the procedure, carefully select a doctor or technician who you trust.
Do not pluck or wax hairs in the area that will undergo laser hair removal for a month or two before the procedure. Laser hair removal targets hair follicles, and the hair is pulled out by the root in both waxing and plucking.
Laser hair removal takes up to 9 months to complete, and the procedure can be expensive. However, laser removal is a permanent solution for getting rid of hair. This can save you money on waxings, shaving cream, or depilatory creams in the long run.

, Salons offer wax treatments for just about every area of your body. If you are waxing hard to reach places, or you are sensitive to pain, go to a salon and let a professional do it.


Waxing specialists can shape hair, like the eyebrows and bikini area, and also treat your skin with moisturizers before and after to help reduce redness.
Getting a professional wax may be the best option for your bikini area. The skin in that region is extremely sensitive and prone to irritation and infection. Plus, it's difficult to see. Many salons offer bikini area waxes for both women and men.

, During electrolysis, the hair is destroyed with chemicals or heat. A probe is inserted into the follicle, and then the hair is removed with tweezers.Electrolysis can be used on most areas of the body.
The number of treatments needed will vary from person to person. Most people have one treatment every week or two until the treatment period is complete."

Choose a stick deodorant.,
Wash your armpits.,
Dress first.,
Unwind or pull off the deodorant cap.,
Remove plastic casing.,
Apply deodorant evenly to the underarm region.,
Replace the cap and put the deodorant away.",How to Apply Stick Deodorant," Go shopping and decide which brand of stick deodorant and which fragrance is best for you.


If you are buying stick deodorant for work or playing sports, you might want to consider an unscented deodorant to avoid offending anybody with a strong fragrance.
Read the label to make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients.;
, Before applying the stick deodorant, either take a shower or wash your armpits thoroughly to freshen up. Dry with a towel so that the deodorant will roll onto your skin smoothly without smearing.

, Deodorant is known to streak on clothes, therefore, it is better to roll the deodorant under your armpit after you get dressed.


Although this might wrinkle your clothes a little bit that is more acceptable than walking around all day with white streaks on your shirt.

, As with most cosmetic products, deodorant containers come with a tight cap that requires you to unwind it or pull it off.

, There is often a special seal located under the cap and firmly on top of the deodorant stick that needs to be removed before use.


The actual deodorant stick is made from alcohol, which needs to remain moist. A tight plastic casting keeps the stick moist and avoids evaporation.
Sometimes you need to turn the dial on the bottom of the deodorant container until the plastic cap pops off.

, Apply the deodorant at the center of your armpit, working your way outward in all directions until your underarm is completely covered. Reapply throughout the day as needed.


Raise the deodorant stick high enough above the container so that you do not rub your skin up against the protective plastic covering.
Make it easy on yourself by using the opposite hand to apply the deodorant to each of your armpits.

, Otherwise the stick will dry up without the cap on and you will no longer be able to use it.

Use panty liners.,
Create shields out of socks.,
Sew shields using muslin.,
Use an absorbent fabric.",How to Make Underarm Guards1," While panty liners aren’t meant be used to absorb sweat from your armpit, they are designed to absorb liquid. You can buy a batch of panty liners for much cheaper than predesigned underarm shields. You can cut a panty liner in half and use one for each armpit. Use some scotch tape or a safety pin to connect the pad directly on the clothing.


You could alternatively fold the panty liner in half and place the fold over your clothing’s armpit.;
, You can create your own underarm shields out of your old socks. Salvage the sock that formed a hole by transforming it into a underarm pad. Use scissors to cut out a thin oval from the sock’s fabric. Attach the pad directly to your clothing or let the pad hang over the pit crease.


If you don’t attach the sock shield, it helps if your shirt or dress is tight.Athletic socks will give you the most control of sweat. Cotton socks will also handle liquids better than a synthetic, polyester blend.

, Acquire muslin fabric from a textiles store, or from a crafts supplier. Fold the muslin about three times. Draw a thin oval, about the size of your armpit, onto the folded muslin. Take a pair of scissors and cut along the outline. You can sew these together in a couple of different ways:


Use loose flannel to cover the muslin. Use a spare strip of flannel fabric and wrap the layers of muslin.Cut the flannel so that it matches the cut out design with a little bit of overlap for sewing. Sew the flannel together using standard thread.
Sew the muslin together using a thread and needle. The sew doesn’t need to be perfect, but it should hold each layer in place.
The more layers of muslin that you use, the more absorbent the shield will be.

, Buy an absorbent fabric from a fabrics supplier or from the internet. There are a few types of fabrics that are notoriously absorbent like: zorb, hemp cotton, bamboo cotton, and polyurethane laminate. These are the types of fabrics that commercial underarm pads are made from. Use the raw supplies to create your own pads at half the cost.


If you need help measuring the fabric, place the uncut fabric to your armpit. Use a mirror and a pen to outline your armpit.
Outline an oval that fits your armpit using a marker. Then cut out the outline with scissors.
The absorbent fabric can be layered like the muslin pads were. You can alter the pads based on your personal needs.

Choose garments to fit with underarm pockets.,
Take down the measurements.,
Create the pockets.,
Attach the pockets to the garment.,
Test the visibility and comfort of the pocket.",How to Make Underarm Guards2," You can create permanent pockets that will hold the underarm shields if you don't want to attach new guards every few days. This is a good idea if you have a limited wardrobe and will likely be wearing the same outfit often, like a uniform or a suit.Pockets will also hold other odor fresheners, like baking soda or powder deodorant, that you can use in addition to your underarm pad.
It will take a little longer than installing a new set of underarm pads each time, but the pockets will last a long time.

, Take a t-shirt from your wardrobe to get a measurement for the pocket. A starter measurement you can use is 2”x3”. You can also take a piece of fabric, pen, and measure the dimension in front of a mirror. Use your armpit as the basis for the size of your pockets.

, Determine what type of material you want the pockets to be. You can create the pockets out of socks or use mesh fabric. Socks are more comfortable in cooler months, while mesh pockets are more comfortable when it's hot outside.


If you use socks, it is best to use baby socks. Baby socks don’t require any alterations and are already the right size.
Mesh fabric works well, but you have to measure, cut, and sew the pockets together. Cut out a long strip and fold the fabric together. When you sew or glue the fabric leave the top open. This will allow you to insert disposable guards with ease., Attach the pockets directly to the underarm area of your clothes using buttons, safety pins, or Velcro. You can attach them permanently by sewing but this could make cleaning them difficult. If you wear the same shirts repeatedly, it won't be too much work to sew buttonholes or glue/sew Velcro onto each garment.


The pockets alone should absorb sweat and odors, but you can fill each bag or sock with baking soda if you have a serious amount of sweat.
This technique will work best with relatively tight shirts or dresses that will hold the pockets to your underarms and absorb the sweat before it travels.

, Try on the shirt and look in the mirror. Are the pockets visible? If the pocket appear to be bulging out, consider reducing the amount you place in the pocket. Make adjustments to the underarm pad or reduce the amount of powder deodorant.


The pockets will probably not be comfortable at first. You might need to wear the pockets for a week to determine if you can stand having them attached to your clothes.
If you are constantly becoming annoyed by the pockets, then remove them from your clothes and use a pad.

Create a chest strap.,
Attach two shoulder straps.,
Acquire a pair of shields.,
Attach the guards to the harness.,
Put on the harness before your other clothing.",How to Make Underarm Guards3," Measure the distance between your armpits to your upper torso. Use a simple piece of string, a small-diameter rope, or a body strap. Cut two pieces of material to this length and see if they fit around your body. The chest strap should be leveled to your arm pit on your upper chest.


Once you find a comfortable fit, seal the ends with a knot to prevent unraveling.
You can also use Velcro to attach the chest strap.

, Measure and cut out two thin strings that will go over your shoulders and attach to the chest strap to hold it in place. Take a measurement while the chest strap is attached, then remove the chest strap to attach the shoulder straps.


You can knot the straps in place or use velcro to secure the shoulder straps to the chest strap.
Imagine the design of a bra to help construct this design.

, There are plenty of options for underarm guards or pads. You can either make your own pads or buy a pack of premade pads designed to attack the sweat. Use whatever product or design that fit your needs., Use a safety pin or tape to attach the underarm guards to the harness where it crosses under your armpits. The guards should fit snugly against your underarms without impeding circulation.

, The easiest way to put on the harness is to insert each arm as if pulling on a cut-off T-shirt. Put your head through the harness. Adjust the length of the shields as needed. Once you're satisfied with the placement of the guards and harness, put the rest of your clothing on.


Determine if you can see the harness while fully clothed by looking in a mirror. One way to hide the harness is by wearing an under shirt over the harness and then wear an additional shirt.
Loose fit clothing will also help conceal the harness.
Give yourself at least one week to test the comfort of the harness before trying a new technique.

Remove your shirt.,
Spray your upper body.,
Apply the spray once per day.",How to Apply Body Spray1," Body sprays for men usually double as deodorants. So it is more effective to use the spray on your body as opposed to your clothes.

, In general, body sprays have a very strong scent. By applying the spray only once per day, you can avoid overloading your senses, and the senses of the people around you. You also want to avoid over spraying since there may be negative health effects associated with using body sprays excessively.The only exception is if you plan to exercise or engage in sports or another physical activity that will cause you to perspire. If this is you, then you may re-apply the body spray after the physical activity.

Spray your pulse points.,
Spritz your clothing.,
Spray your hair.",How to Apply Body Spray2," Hold the body spray four to five inches (102 to 127 mm) from your pulse points. Spray each pulse point with one spray. Try to avoid rubbing in the spray. Instead, let the body spray soak in and dry on your skin.








Your pulse points include your wrists, the insides of your elbows, the front of your neck, the back of your knees and between your breasts.

, Do this once you have spritzed your pulse points. However, hold the spray can seven to nine inches (178 to 229 mm) from your body








Alternatively, you can spritz the air in front of you and walk through the mist to scent your clothes.

, Try to avoid spraying your hair directly. Instead, spritz the air above you once or twice with the spray. Quickly stand underneath the mist to lightly scent your hair.

Choose a fragrance you like.,
Apply the body spray after you shower.,
Layer fragrances.",How to Apply Body Spray3," Choose a scent that matches your personal taste and style. Start by sampling popular fragrances to see which scents appeal to your taste. Then explore other fragrances that are made with similar scents.


If you are a girl, then you may prefer sweet, floral scents or musky scents.
If you are a guy, then you may prefer woodsy or spicy scents.

, Applying body spray on a clean body will help the scent stick to your body better and last longer. After you shower, lightly towel off. Spritz your damp body with the body spray.








, Layering fragrances will also help your body spray last longer. While you are showering, use a body gel that has similar scents to the ones in your body spray. After your shower, apply a lotion with similar scents to your damp body. Once the lotion has dried, spritz your body with the body spray.


For example, if your body spray contains vanilla, lavender and mint notes, then choose a body wash and lotion that contains lavender, vanilla or mint to layer with.
If you cannot find a complementary lotion or body wash, then use an unscented lotion or soap.
Some body sprays come with complementary lotions and body washes.

, You can easily vary the fragrance of your deodorant by using different essential oils in place of the tea tree oil.

Hold for one second, then release, to avoid creating an excessive cloud of spray. Wait until the mist disperses before applying more one-second bursts if needed.Recap the can when finished.


You should only need about two to three seconds’ worth of total spraying.
Hold your breath with your lips sealed while spraying to minimize the amount of mist that you breathe in.
Do not hold the can upside-down. If it isn’t held upright, the can may fail to spray its contents, even though it isn’t empty., Make sure the deodorant is applied over the entire area. Rub the residue around so that all of your pores receive an equal amount. If you have a significant amount of hair growing there, use your fingers to work the deodorant through the hair so that it reaches your skin.You can also spray your hands directly and apply the deodorant to other areas by rubbing it in.This method may be preferable to your armpits, so that you don’t have to aim the nozzle so close to your face.

Consider your needs.,
Try a natural spray.,
Experiment with different brands.",How to Apply a Spray Underarm Deodorant2," Choose deodorant to reduce body odor. Use antiperspirant to reduce both body odor and sweating.For pronounced problems, consult a doctor or athletic trainer for recommendations. Otherwise, consider the following:Does a deodorant's scent complement your own after application?
Is a regular formula strong enough to last you all day, or would a longer-lasting or time-released formula be more beneficial?
Is your skin prone to allergic or other severe reactions to common ingredients like aluminum?
Is regular-strength deodorant sufficient to kill all of your odor-causing bacteria, or do you need an extra-strength formula?

, If you use antiperspirant as opposed to pure deodorant, be aware that most products contain some form of aluminum. Some debate exists over the possible link between this and cancer, plus other diseases.If this is a concern, try a “natural” product that uses mineral salts in place of aluminum derivatives. Avoid those with a high amount of zinc, since this can irritate the skin., Find more than one that works well for your body. Expect your body to build a natural immunity to a particular formula after repeated use. Change your brand or formula of deodorant every half-year or sooner if you notice more B.O.To save money, start with sample or travel sizes, if available, to test each product's quality.

Choose a well-ventilated area.,
Follow the directions.,
Keep the product away from children.",How to Apply a Spray Underarm Deodorant3," Spray yourself outdoors or in a room that provides plenty of air circulation. Do not use in cramped bathrooms with small windows or no windows at all, especially if you have asthma. Allow plenty of air movement to dissipate the cloud of spray upon release so you don’t inhale it., Expect commercials to portray actors using deodorants in a manner that is in direct contrast to the instructions on the can. Do not regard advertisements as visual demonstrations of proper usage. Read and follow the instructions on the packaging for safe use., Store all chemical products out of reach from younger children as a general safe practice. But consider aerosol spray cans in particular as a tempting toy in the eyes of kids. Also, store cosmetic and hygienic products separately from other household items. Don’t confuse your children by spraying yourself with one aerosol product that came from the same cabinet where you keep, say, your foaming-bubble bathtub spray or WD40.

Bathe or shower regularly.,
Make sure you dry yourself completely.,
Eliminate bacterial breeding grounds.,
Wear fresh cotton clothes.,
Avoid wearing closed footwear with socks for a long period of time.",How to Get Rid of Body Odor Naturally1," Since bacteria reacting with sweat produced by your sweat glands causes body odor, it is important to bathe or shower regularly. Use a gentle, plant-oil based soap and lather up. The greater the amount of lather and the longer you lather up, the more effective you are likely to be in removing bacteria from your skin.


Not all soap is antibacterial, nor do you necessarily need antibacterial soap. Try using peppermint castile soap when you shower. Peppermint oil is mildly antiseptic and can help fight body odor.
Although soap-and-water showers are best, rinsing the skin with water is better than nothing. Scrubbing with sand or even just a washcloth helps dislodge bacteria and oils is even more effective. This can be an issue in situations like camping.;
, This is especially important in those areas that are prone to body odor: the groin, armpits, and around the nipples. Also ensure that any areas of skin folds (under the breasts, in the groin, at the abdomen) are completely dry.


Avoid using cornstarch as a dusting powder. Many physicians believe that cornstarch can be used as “fungi food."" Instead, use unscented talcum powder.

, For instance, shaving your armpits may be helpful in reducing odor. Also, clean the inside of your shoes on a regular basis, as these can be a great breeding ground for bacteria.

, Wear natural-fiber clothing like cotton, silk or wool. If you exercise and sweat, using synthetic materials that “wick” away moisture may be useful, but change back into the natural fibers after you shower away the sweat.


Cotton clothes allow the skin to breathe, reducing the amount of sweat. Therefore, wearing cotton clothes keeps the skin healthy, dry and odor-free.

, Closed footwear will lead to offensive odor from the feet if you sweat a lot, as there is lack of aeration. This is especially true if shoes are made of non-breathable materials. Aim to wear sandals, flip-flops or more breathable shoes as much as possible.

Gather the ingredients.,
Melt the Shea butter and coconut oil together.,
Stir in the arrowroot and baking soda.,
Add the essential oil.,
Store in your chosen container.,
Keep in a cool place.",How to Make All Natural Deodorant1," This method calls for just a few easy ingredients, and it makes a semi-solid stick of deodorant similar to stick deodorants you find in stores—minus all the chemicals. This recipe requires:3 tablespoons wet-milled, virgin coconut oil
2 tablespoons Shea butter
2 tablespoons arrowroot (or cornstarch)
3 tablespoons baking soda
1-2 drops of your favorite essential oil (optional);
, If you have a double boiler, you can use this to melt the Shea butter and coconut oil together. If you don’t have one, you can simply place both ingredients in a heavy mason jar and place the jar in a pan of hot water.Use low heat and stir often to ensure an even distribution as the two ingredients melt together.
Remove the mixture from the heat as soon as it’s melted together.

, After you turn off the heat, slowly stir in the arrowroot and baking soda.Mix the ingredients in well but quickly before the mixture begins to harden.

, If you’re choosing to add an essential oil to provide a pleasant scent, then stir in one or two drops (more will be overpowering) of the oil now as well.Certain essential oils may irritate those with sensitive skin. Try rubbing a drop of the oil on your underarms to test for any skin irritation before adding it to your deodorant recipe. Some common options include:


Lavender
Patchouli
Eucalyptus
Lemon
Orange
Bergamot
Tea tree
Cedarwood
Lemon balm
Cinnamon
Sage
Frankincense

, You don’t have to store this deodorant any special way. If you want, you can simply pour the mix into a jar and allow it to cool and solidify. You can then use your fingers to apply it your underarms as needed.As an alternative, you can pour the mixture into popsicle molds and place the molds in your freezer for an hour to shape the deodorant into a familiar stick shape. Wrap each stick in wax paper or parchment paper before storing to stop them from melting together.

, You do not need to store the deodorant in the fridge, but it can melt in warm weather.Store the container out of direct sunlight in a cool spot in your home.

Quit smoking and chewing tobacco.,
Drink lots of water.,
Eat food products containing probiotics.,
Eliminate odor producing foods from your diet.,
Eat enough green vegetables.",How to Get Rid of Body Odor Naturally2," Smoking and chewing tobacco lead to the production of free radicals which damage the body. They also lead to the formation of bacteria on the skin, which emit bad odor.

, Water is an excellent solvent that flushes all the toxins from the body. Water is the most neutral substance and reduces the formation of bacteria in the intestines. Drinking around 8 to 10 glasses of water daily will help keep the skin healthy, hydrated and odor-free., Probiotics are natural, gut-friendly bacteria which help to control the growth of other toxic bacteria in the intestines.Probiotics promote the growth of the bacteria lactobacilli bifidus, which improves digestion and reduces gut toxins. Substances like yogurt and buttermilk contain probiotics.


Consuming one cup of a probiotic substance each day is very helpful and should be continued for a period of six months. It will improve your overall health as body odor may be just a matter of good digestion!

, There are a number of foods that may change your body odor. Fatty foods (fatty meats, poultry with skin, fried foods) and some spices (curry, garlic, onions) can change your body odor. Omit these foods at least for two to four weeks and see if that makes a difference.


Coffee and caffeinated soft drinks can cause body odor in some people.Other foods and beverages that can cause body odor are: alcohol, asparagus, cumin, and red meats., Not eating enough green vegetables can result in body odor. Green vegetables contain chlorophyllin, a natural odor-absorbing substance."

Use a commercial-made natural antiperspirant.,
Make your own antiperspirant.,
Treat your body odor with a solution of hydrogen peroxide as an antibacterial solution.,
Wipe your skin with apple cider vinegar.,
Treat the skin with tea tree oil.",How to Get Rid of Body Odor Naturally3," If you are uncomfortable with using a conventional commercial antiperspirant or deodorant, find a natural product instead. There are many popular products, such as Tom’s of Maine and Kiss My Face, which are widely available.

, You can find a variety of recipes online, but here is one you can try. Mix 3/4 cup arrowroot powder and 4 teaspoons aluminum-free baking powder. Melt 6 tablespoons organic cocoa or mango butter and 2 tablespoons unrefined coconut oil together in a double boiler. Stir together the melted ingredients and the dry ingredients and then add 1/2 teaspoon lemongrass essential oil to the mixture.


Store in a lidded glass jar. This does not need to be refrigerated.

, Take 1 teaspoon of 3% hydrogen peroxide and mix with 1 cup of water. Using a cotton washcloth, soak the washcloth in the hydrogen peroxide-water solutions, squeeze out the excess, and wipe your underarms, groin and feet with the solution.

, You can use apple cider vinegar to help kill off the odor-causing bacteria. Soak your feet daily in a solution of 1 part apple cider vinegar and 3 parts water. Pour the same solution into a spray bottle and spray on your armpits. Apple cider vinegar is very strong and people with sensitive skin may experience adverse side effects like burning or itching. Therefore, a small patch test is recommended before using this product and make certain you have not just shaven your armpits.

, Add 8 to 10 drops of tea tree oil to 1 cup of witch hazel. Pour this solution into a spray bottle and use as a natural deodorant, especially after exercise. The witch hazel acts as an astringent and reduces sweating. The tea tree oil acts as an antibacterial agent.Tea tree oil is known for its anti-septic properties as well as its strong but pleasant odor.
When used as an external application, it kills the bacteria present on the skin and thus reduces toxin formation.

Investigate why body odor occurs.,
Figure out where body odor is likely to occur.,
Understand that foot odor is different than other types of body odor.,
Investigate other factors affecting body odor.,
Assess whether you should see a doctor for your body odor.",How to Get Rid of Body Odor Naturally4," Body odor, technically known as bromhidrosis, osmidrosis or ozochrotia, or more simply as BO, is caused by the breakdown of skin proteins by bacteria on the skin. The specific odor depends to some extent on the type of bacteria on your skin, the proteins they break down, the acids that are produced, the foods you eat, the amount of sweat you produce, and your overall state of health. Individuals with diabetes, hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating), who are taking specific medications, or who are obese, for example, are more at risk for body odor.
When we sweat, bacteria on our skin breaks down the sweat and skin proteins into a two main types of acids -- it is these acids that result in body odor. The two main acids are produced by two different types of bacteria: Propionic acid and Isovaleric acid. Propionic acid is produced by Propionibacteria. Propionic acid tends to smell vinegar-y. Isovaleric acid is produced by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Isovaleric acid tends to smell cheesy-- perhaps because the same bacteria are used to made certain types of cheese.

, Body odor tends to occur in folds of skin or in areas of the body that are either covered or more prone to sweating-- these are the feet, groin, armpits, genitals, pubic hair and other areas with hair, the belly button, the anus and behind the ears. Other areas can be sweaty and produce odor as well, but generally to a lesser degree.

, Foot odor can be somewhat different. Feet have eccrine sweat glands, but since most individuals wear socks and shoes (most of which are made of synthetic materials) most of the time, the sweat doesn’t evaporate as easily.


Synthetic materials (as opposed to cotton or leather) tend to hold in sweat and prevent evaporation unless they are specially made to allow evaporation.
Sweat which doesn’t evaporate tends to provide a good environment for fungi-- and many forms of fungi produce unpleasant smells as well.

, For instance, age can make a difference for the type of body odor produced. Children before puberty do not produce much body odor. Androgens that are produced during puberty are associated with the production of unpleasant body odor., Most body odor can be dealt with using home remedies, but there are times when body odor signals the need to see your physician. In some cases, your physician may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist). Call your physician for an appointment if:


You have attempted to deal with the problem but all treatments do not help reduce or eliminate the body odor within two to three weeks.
You begin to sweat much more or less than you normally do.
Sweating disrupts your daily routine.
You begin to experience night sweats.
Your body odor changes dramatically.

Gather the ingredients.,
Melt the coconut oil, Shea butter, carrier oil, and beeswax together.,
Remove from heat.,
Add the arrowroot, diatomaceous earth, vitamin E, and your chosen essential oil.,
Pour the mixture into your chosen storage container.",How to Make All Natural Deodorant2," Some people also develop redness and irritation from using baking soda on their underarms. If this happens to you (or even if you just want to try another method), then this recipe is for you. Begin by gathering the necessary ingredients. You’ll need a digital kitchen scale to measure out the ingredients. This recipe calls for:30g coconut oil
20g Shea butter
10g carrier oil (your preference of almond, castor, or avocado oil all work well)
10g beeswax
15g arrowroot powder
15g food-grade diatomaceous earth
1 vitamin E capsule (400 IU)
10 drops of essential oil

, If you have a double boiler, you can use it to melt these ingredients together, or you can simply place all of them in a heavy, heat-safe jar and place the jar in a pan of boiling water.Use low heat and stir everything in evenly. The beeswax will take the longest to melt, but have patience., Once the beeswax finally melts and you stir it in, remove the mixture from the heat and give it a couple of minutes to cool—up to five., Before the mix hardens and begins to solidify, mix in the rest of the ingredients (break the vitamin E capsule to add it). Whisk all of the ingredients together well to ensure an even distribution of the materials.If you’ve never tested the essential oil you’ve chosen on your skin before, then try a drop or two on your underarm first and wait several minutes to make sure that it doesn’t irritate your skin at all.

, This recipe will set into a roll-on solid deodorant fairly quickly.Once the final ingredients are whisked in, you can pour it into a storage container of your choice. A shallow jar will do. You can simply rub some of the deodorant onto your fingers and then apply it to your underarms as needed.If you prefer the familiar, roll-on stick form, then you can pour the mixture into popsicle molds and place them in the freezer for an hour before removing them. Wrap each individual stick in wax paper or parchment paper before storing them to help avoid having them melt together.

Gather the necessary ingredients.,
Make your own magnesium oil if you choose.,
Stir in the essential oil.,
Store in a spray bottle.,
Replace often.",How to Make All Natural Deodorant3," If you prefer spray-on deodorants to chalky stick deodorants, then you will love this all-natural recipe. Additionally, this recipe cuts out the baking soda found in some other recipes, which can give some people a rash from constant use.Begin by gathering the simple ingredients. This recipe requires:4 ounces of magnesium oil
10-15 drops of your favorite essential oil

, You can either purchase magnesium oil from a health retailer or simply make your own at home. To make your own simply boil half a cup of distilled water and pour the boiling mix over half a cup of magnesium chloride flakes (in a heat-safe bowl).Stir the mix together well and then allow it to cool.

, Use your favorite scent of essential oils, or you can also experiment with a mixture. Stir the ten to fifteen drops of the essential oil into the magnesium oil.You should test just a few drops of the mixture on your skin to ensure that it won’t irritate your underarms.


If the mix does irritate your skin, then you can dilute the mix with water until you find a ratio that doesn’t cause any irritation.

, You may have to test a couple of spray bottles to find one with an output you like. Find a bottle that spritzes your underarms and avoid ones that spray a stream of the deodorant. You don’t have to store the mix in any particular environment, so once you find the proper bottle, you can simply store it in your bathroom., As you get toward the bottom of the mixture, you may find a higher concentration of the essential oil than the magnesium oil, which can sting your underarms, especially if you apply just after shaving them.To help avoid this, add a new batch of the deodorant to the bottle rather than using the last little bit before replacing it.

Ask your doctor about experimental treatments.",How to Avoid Sweating Too Much," Check the label to make sure that you're using an antiperspirant and not just a deodorant. Deodorant will mask smelly armpits, but it won't attack the excessive sweating.;
, You'll have to pay more for a clinical strength antiperspirant, but these products will be more effective at cutting down on sweat production.

, Applying antiperspirant twice a day has been clinically shown to be extremely effective in preventing excessive sweating. If you only apply it once a day, apply it before bedtime rather than in the morning. Also, try massaging the antiperspirant into your skin.

, If your armpits are sweaty or if you've just gotten out of the shower, then dry your armpits with a towel or blow-dry them with a hair dryer set on a cool setting. If you apply antiperspirant to wet armpits, you may experience skin irritation.

, An aerosol antiperspirant can be a great solution for sweaty feet as long as you're sure to spray not just the soles of your feet but also between your toes. If your face sweats a lot, try applying some antiperspirant along your hairline. Just test it first before you take it out in public to make sure that the antiperspirant doesn't irritate the skin on your face., Cotton will absorb moisture as will fabrics found in athletic wear that are designed to wick away moisture. You can also choose clothes with a loose weave, such as clothes made of linen.

, Guys should wear cotton undershirts to absorb excess sweat, while women can wear an absorbent camisole or use sweat absorbing pads.

, If you wear white, people are going to notice that you're sweating. If you choose dark colors or prints, then your sweat isn't going to show up as much.

, Brands like Geox have absorbent insoles and also let moisture out through holes in the soles of the shoes. You can also reduce foot sweat by wearing shoes made of leather and other natural materials.Wear sandals or go barefoot when you can so that your feet can breathe.

, Bring an extra shirt or blouse that you can change into midday if you have sweaty spots on your outfit. Change your outfit in a restroom or in your car, and use a cloth or a handkerchief to wipe away excess sweat before you put on your new top. Also, if your feet are sweaty and smelly, bring an extra pair of socks and shoes., Foods like hot peppers can make you sweat more, while onions and garlic can make your sweat smell unpleasant. Eat more bland foods throughout the day when you're at work or out in public.

, If you're overweight or obese, losing weight will help reduce the amount of sweating that you experience because the heavier you are, the more you'll sweat because it's harder it is to cool down efficiently.

, The odor of sweat can be reduced considerably by frequent hygiene practices that are very simple.


Have a daily bathing routine of either a shower or a bath and in particularly bad cases, consider bathing twice a day. Use a deodorant soap that will help to wipe out the bacteria that cause odor.
When you're out and about, carry baby wipes or similar wipes that you can use underarm and on your body to mop up sweat quickly in the bathroom and feel fresh again.
Carry an antiperspirant with you at all times for quick touch-ups, especially after physical activity or a stressful experience such as delivering a presentation. If you have a permanent workspace, keep a stick of antiperspirant in your desk drawer. Just make sure you don't leave your antiperspirant in a hot car where it could melt.

, These drinks can cause you to sweat excessively.

, Some people believe that sage can soothe the nerve fibers that cause you to produce excessive sweat. Try these sage recipes to prevent sweating too much:

Add 4 tablespoons of sage leaves to 2 cups (500 ml) of boiling water. Simmer the sage for 5 minutes, pour the liquid through a mesh sieve to strain it and drink the liquid.






Combine 5 tablespoons of sage leaves, 1 tablespoon of valerian root and 1 tablespoon of horsetail. Pour 1 cup (250 ml) of boiling water over the herbs and bring the liquid to a boil again. Filter the leaves out and drink the mixture daily.







, Mix equal amounts of eucalyptus leaves, oak bark, walnut leaves, witch hazel leaves and tormentil root. Place 5 tablespoons of the mixture into 2 quarts (about 2 L) of water. Boil the mixture for 5 minutes and remove it from the heat. Add 1 quart (about 1 L) of cool water and bathe your hands and feet with the liquid.

, Mix 3 parts sage and walnut leaves with 2 parts stinging nettle and strawberry leaves. Add 1 cup (250 ml) of steaming water to the mixture and drink it before bedtime.

, Drinking these teas before bed can help you to relax and get some rest, which will reduce your anxiety levels.

, Try rose, lavender or orange oil to produce a pleasant smell and hide body odor.

, Choose geranium oil, tea tree oil or cypress oil., If you are experiencing drenched clothing, embarrassment or an inability to control odor as a result of sweating, then it's time to speak to your doctor or dermatologist. Your health care professional may need to take blood tests to check your thyroid or to look for infections or run other tests according to their professional examination.

, Your doctor can prescribe an at-home electric iontophoresis machine, which uses a mild electric current run through water to shut down your sweat glands., Botox can temporarily paralyze sweat glands for 7 to 19 months per injection. These are usually given for sweaty underarms but can also be injected on the face, hands or feet., These devices work on the armpits or other sweaty areas that have a layer of protective fat. The handheld device delivers controlled electromagnetic energy, and the heat causes the sweat glands to decompose. Doctors usually recommend 2 treatments spaced 3 months apart., These drugs are not FDA-approved, but they have a long history of being prescribed for excessive sweating. Athletes, people who participate in sports and people who work outdoors should avoid these drugs because they disable the body's sweating mechanism, which would cause difficulty with keeping the body cool., If you're experiencing anxiety triggered sweating, a course of cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy might be just the ticket to relieve such sweating.

, You have a couple of options:



Local underarm surgery. This procedure is performed under local anesthesia in a dermatologist's office. Your doctor will use liposuction, curettage (scraping) or lasers to destroy the sweat glands. Recovery usually takes 2 days, although you'll need to limit arm activity for about a week. Unfortunately, health insurance does not always pay for this procedure.

Endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy. Surgeons put the patient under general anesthesia and attempt to cut the nerves from the spinal column that stimulate excessive sweating. This surgery could have serious side effects, including low blood pressure, heat intolerance and heart arrhythmia, so it's only recommended when all other treatment options have failed.

, Examples include acupuncture, biofeedback, hypnosis or relaxation techniques..."

If you try to dress like a twenty-year-old, do your makeup like a twenty-year-old, and get a haircut like a twenty-year-old, then you'll end up looking like you're trying to be something you're not. Being a cougar is all about owning your age and looking even hotter -- not wearing a lacy top or pair of shoes that make you look like you're trying to be a sorority girl.


Sure, you can shop at Forever 21 if you find an outfit that really rocks. But you have more luck looking for sexy clothes in the stores where you're used to shopping.;
, Highlights work well as they cover up the grey hairs that have begun sprouting and give an even color tone. Most cougars are opting for sexy, younger looking hairstyles. Just make sure that the haircut looks good on your face and fits your age and body type. Don't try to rock the Miley Cyrus super short spiky haircut unless you think it's really right for you. You can try updating your look by getting bangs, layering your hair, or cutting off hair that is so long that it has started to look a bit stringy.


You can go for a shorter bob if you think your long hair is too messy and unruly, but you should be careful. You don't want to cut your hair so short that you're starting to rock the Grandma look.
Years ago, middle-aged women would cut their hair into a “sensible” style and let the greys pop. Today, no way. It’s about sweeping, shapely, sexy hair. Think Jennifer Aniston and Demi Moore, not Martha Stewart. (However, think Helen Mirren if you do want to go grey and sexy; it's all in a good haircut coupled with the independent attitude.)

, Choose clothing and shoes that are runway ready. The latest fashions and styles are always worn by powerful cougar women. That doesn't mean that you actually have to shop at the most expensive store in town, but you should find clothes that flatter your body and make you look smoking hot. For dating, wear clothes that accentuate how hot and toned your body is, or how curvaceous you are. If you have a tracksuit, burn it, now.


Show off your best features. If you've got legs to die for, flaunt em.

, Although some may say that once you hit 40, there is nothing you can do about the battle of the bulge, cougars say, “give me a break.” You can look as good as you want if you put your mind to it. And if you don't want to look like a runway model, that's perfectly fine, too. Just hit up the gym enough that you feel good about your body and feel like you're in a healthy frame of mind.


However, don't forget that curves can be ultra sexy too, provided you're still toned and svelte. Go with what works for your body type.

, A true cougar is independent -- both financially and emotionally. Though it would be fun to meet a new guy and to hook up with him or even have him romance you, you shouldn't need to meet a new guy every time you go out. A true cougar is comfortable enough with herself that she doesn't need some eye candy by her side to make her feel whole. You should have your own friends, your own hobbies, and your own meaningful career or passion instead of depending on another man to make you feel complete.


The guys you meet will be used to having young girls who are needy trying to take up all of their time. You'll show them that you're different from these girls because you don't need them. In turn, this will make them want you even more.

, If you're setting out to be a cougar, then you obviously know that you're going against many people's traditional ideas about how a woman your age should act. And that's perfectly okay. It's up to you to own your lifestyle, and to be proud of the woman that you are. If some men make fun of you for it -- or, more likely, some other women, then learn to brush them off and move on with your day. You don't have time for it.


If people tease you for going clubbing instead of staying at home, don't sweat it. You're just living it up and going for the life you want. Everyone has their own definition of happiness.
Then again, a cougar is more likely to not even think about failure in dating. She knows there are men who will drool over her beauty and sophistication and provided she chooses the right man when it suits her, she'll never be at a loss for a date. Remember that not wanting commitment, only wanting a short-term relationship and being very sexy are enormous turn-ons for younger men. Plus, they get the chance to be shown the ropes.

, If you're in your forties, then it's likely you've had some challenges at this point in your life. Maybe they were professional, maybe you had to go through a rough divorce, or maybe you're having trouble dealing with your young children. Whatever your problems are, try to kick them to the curb whenever you go out. If you're serious about dating the young man you find, you can open up to him eventually, but try to keep things fun and light when you go out into the dating world.


This doesn't mean that you should lie if you just went through a divorce or whatever. Just try to open with the light stuff and talk about the serious stuff later.

, If you want to be a cougar, then you've got to own it. March into a room like you own the place, not like you feel like you're crashing your daughter's prom after-party in your own basement. Show the guys that you love who you are, love where you are in life, and are happy with what you do. Smile, make eye contact, and stand proud and tall. Be optimistic when you make conversation, and show people that they should feel happy to be in your company.


If you want to wear a tight dress and high heels in your forties, then woman, you've gotta have confidence to tie it all together. If you have the right attitude, you'll be catching every guy's eye.

, Don't think that all of those years you spent dating, in marriage, or being out and about in the world are worth nothing. This is different from casting your baggage aside; you should realize that you are a woman of experience and be proud of all of the different things that the people in your past and present have taught you. If you've had three careers, be proud of it. Lived in five states? Even better. Don't try to downplay all of the fun and exciting things you've done in your life -- they'll only make you sound more impressive.


When you meet a new man, tell him about all the cool stuff you've done. He'll think you're even more awesome because of it.

, Younger men and women, your peers and those you work with are attracted to or inspired by a woman who doesn’t second guess her decision making, has some life experience and knows how to get what she wants. Indeed, this is a time to be a great mentor to younger people who look up to you; you'll be helping them and you'll feel useful and important imparting your knowledge to them. If you feel as if you aren’t ready to go for the gusto, recall your life achievements and what you did to get there. It's time to stand tall and be the woman you know you really are deep down; life isn't waiting for ever and it's time to seize the now.


Think about what it took to land your current job or routine. Did you impress your boss or others with your knowledge or demonstrate unwavering decision making? Are you one of the best in your industry and why do your peers respect you?
Consider the many things that you do well. Are you a great mom who can clean a mean house? Or are you a shark in the boardroom, typically getting the wavering board members to bow down to you?

, With age and increased experience, many an overly responsive woman realizes that people own their own problems and that she doesn't have to anymore (not that she ever did). Let those family members and friends who have over-relied on you to this point find their own way in life. Detach yourself gently or boldly, depending on whom you're dealing with, and let people make their own decisions so that you are free to make yours.


Learn to blow off people who make your life lesser. You don't need people who drain you of energy, take advantage of your or drag you down. No self-respecting cougar tolerates such people.
Being cold and distant is often considered cruel. However, it's an art form and using such a demeanor with some people is essential so that they get the message and know that they're cut out of your life. Moochers, users and narcissists beware.
Feeling a little disconcerted at being the one to take control and get what you want? Realize that being in control and getting what you want are actions taken for granted by many men; the cougar learns this to her advantage, gaining both power and respect.

, If you want to find younger men, meaning men who are 25 and younger, then you can't go to the typical places where you would go, such as nice restaurants or spas. You'll have to check out happy hour in your town's financial district, go to a sports bar on game day, or check out bars or clubs in your neighborhood that cater to a younger crowd. This doesn't mean you have to go slumming and go to a sketchy bar that only serves $2 PBRs, but it does mean that you should go to a place that a younger guy would like and one that he could afford.


If you want 'em really young, go to bars that cater to a college audience. Just make sure your man can legally drink.

, True cougars don't date men their age (or older). You've already been there and done that and this age group has been found wanting. The point of being a cougar is to date younger men, whose experiences and way of thinking are fresh, enthusiastic and more women-friendly. Of course, avoid dating anyone under the age of 20 because you could be dealing with jailbait (underage partner), plus you have to consider that you're old enough to have given birth to someone this young.


While you may like your men young, try to remain within an age range where you could possibly be their date but not their mommy––you don't want to play wet-nurse to an immature fledgling of a man still trying to find his way in life.
Look for confident, sexy and well dressed young men. Seek eye contact; if they meet your gaze and hold it, you're onto a good thing.
Avoid young men who clearly have insecurity issues. They need to grow up without the lessons you have to teach; your experience and sexiness might be the last straw in their fragile egos.
Choose between men you befriend and men you date. Those you befriend are your long-term friendships (with or without benefits); those you date tend to be very short-term, perhaps even one night stands, and are easily blown off.

, The advantage of being a cougar is that you've had a lot of experience and know what to do with it. So, if you meet a guy you like spending time with, you should teach him a thing or two without sounding like his mom or his teacher. It doesn't have to be anything too serious. Order your favorite drink for him or give him some advice on getting a promotion. Let him know that you're fun to have around and knowledgeable.


You can do this as long as you don't threaten the guy's manliness. Teach him a thing or two without making him feel like he's clueless.

, This goes without saying. Once you've got the guy in bed with you, you don't have to follow his lead. Hey, he's 22 and has probably had the same boring sex with his ex-girlfriend from high school until he saw you and your amazing moves. Don't wait for him to give you what you want; show him how to do it. He'll be turned on when you take the initiative, and both of you will be grateful that you took the time to tell him what's really going on.


Young men are grateful in bed and love the experience of older women. Also, guys in their early twenties are more at their sexual peak than men your own age, so enjoy the benefits.

, If you want to have fun with your new boy toy, then you have to stop mentioning the fact that he's young enough to be your son. That's not what matters. What matters is that you're having a good time and want to keep having one...instead of worrying that he's not even old enough to rent a car.


Don't bring it up, and if it does come up, just laugh. You can teach him a thing or two without reminding him that he's half your age.

, A cougar never lets the man take control of the entire relationship, even if she lets him “think” he has it. Be one step ahead of the men and anticipate his next move. Be ready to walk away at any time should he start to get too serious or if the relationship is headed in the wrong direction.


This is your ultimate power; just remain calm, stick with your long-term plan to date widely and freely and you'll be fine.

Be true to yourself.",How to Feel Alive," Trying new things is one of the best things that you can do to feel really alive. The fact of the matter is that humans are smart. We're all smart. And because of this, our brains need stimulus. If we keep doing the same things we always do, we get bored and after enough of that we start to feel dead inside. Try new, exciting things and you'll find yourself getting more excited about life in the process.


You can try creative activities, like learning to play an instrument or drawing.
You can try activities that really exercise your brain, like learning a new language or playing chess.
You can try activities that push your body, by taking up sports like swimming or jogging.;
, Get outside your comfort zone. For the same reasons that you should try new things, you should also push your personal boundaries every now and again. In fact, the more you push them, the more you'll find that you grow as a person. When we push ourselves, we find out what we're really capable of and we find new things to enjoy about life. This makes us happier, more fulfilled, and confident people.


You can push yourself to travel somewhere that you never imagined yourself going.
You can push yourself to meet a goal you thought was impossible, like losing 50 lbs.

, We tend to feel the most alive when we're in pursuit of a challenging goal. Now, this can be something like getting in shape, learning a new skill, or working towards a promotion at work. It can even be something like getting straight A's, if you're still in school. The important part is to give yourself a challenge and then throw all of your energy and effort into it!

, Pursue something that you've always wanted to do. When you chase the things that make you happy, keeping your mind off of fears of consequences or hurdles, you will find that you feel like you've been reborn.


Try starting a new career path by doing something that you always wanted to do. When you work a job that you don't like or that doesn't leave you feeling fulfilled, it's easy to start feeling dead inside. Find a new career path doing something that you enjoy or that makes you feel good about yourself at the end of the day.

, If you're not in a relationship, start one (go here for help for getting girlfriends and go here for help finding boyfriends). Find someone that's good for you and whom you can also fill a void in their life. Humans are social creatures. We need other people and being with someone can often make your life more exciting and fulfilling.


It's important to be in a healthy relationship where you're both helping each other. Don't get in a serious relationship with someone you don't care about just to try to make you feel better.

, If you get up and go to sleep at all sorts of weird hours, this can lead your body to feeling sick, lost, and dead inside. Regulate your schedule as much as possible and consider making some sacrifices in order to get that regular schedule for awhile while you take care of yourself.


If you're having trouble finding space in your day, try cutting out the time wasters that are so easy to forget about. Facebook, checking email, and time waster mobile games can suck more time out of your day than you think. Save those actions for when you really can't do something else (like when you're sitting on the toilet!).

, Every body is different and your sleep needs might not be the same as everyone else's, but if you're going through your day feeling dead inside and exhausted, it might be because you're either not getting enough sleep or you're getting too much! Start by getting the standard 8 hours of sleep, on a regular schedule (at the same time every night), for a couple of weeks. How do you feel? Some people only need 6 hours of sleep, some might need more like 10! You may have to experiment, but give your body a chance and lots of time to adjust before you write it off.

, Eating a healthy diet is crucial to keeping you feeling strong, healthy, energetic, and ready to tackle your day. Diet can also play a huge role in depression! Make sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean protein. Cut unhealthy fats and sugar from your diet as much as possible. Eat with a purpose...don't just grab whatever tastes good and is easy!


Healthy vegetables and fruit include: kale, spinach, broccoli, bananas, and citrus fruits.
Healthy grains include: quinoa, brown rice, rye, and oatmeal.
Good lean proteins with healthy fats include salmon, tuna, sardines, and nuts (soy nuts make a great snack!). You can also try lean proteins like chicken and eggs.
Avoid junk food like chips and crackers. Even crackers that label themselves as healthy, like Wheat Thins, aren't healthy any more if you eat half the box and are still much less healthy than a snack of carrot sticks!

, If you drink a lot of coffee or energy drinks, or take other ""supplements"" that boost your energy, you might want to consider that these might be part of the problem. Caffeine especially is additive and while it might give your body a temporary boost at first, it will crash later on as your body needs more of the drug. Consider taking a break to cleanse your body, to see if this is part of your problem.

, It's hard to find time sometimes, we know, but exercising is one of the best ways to get you feeling more energetic. Go for a 15 minute jog in the morning can be enough to wake you up! Do some squats while you wait for your coffee to brew in the lunch room. Take the stairs instead of the elevator. All these little pieces add up to a healthier you and you'll usually find it more effective than a dose of caffeine.

, Even on days when you don't have to go anywhere or you don't feel like going anywhere, you should still put in effort and wake up at your usual time, get dressed, eat, and do things with your day. This is important for maintaining your mentality. It will keep you from feeling lazy or even hopeless. Too many days of not taking life seriously and you'll definitely stop taking life seriously!

, If you're feeling lost, try taking in the wisdom of others. Many people find inspiration and new life direction in the works of people like Joseph Campbell and Alan Watts. Both of these men wrote lots of great books, but you can also find their inspiring words online in interviews (try searching Youtube). While they might not be up your ally, you're sure to find someone that inspires you if you book. Try the inspirational or self-help section at your local library!

, Traveling is one of the most powerful transformative experiences you can undergo. In traveling to distant places where you're outside your comfort zone, you'll be forced to take on challenges and actively be alive (often proving to yourself that you can in fact do those things still!). Traveling does have to be as expensive as you think, either. If you travel on your own instead of with a touring company, buy early (usually 4-6 months ahead of time), and go places in the off-season, you'll find that it doesn't take too much saving to get away for a little while.


If this is very scary for you, start by traveling to local areas before moving on to distant lands.

, Music can be incredibly inspiring for many people. It is one of the most powerful tools for reaching directly into the soul and making you feel a deep and powerful connection with the singer or composer. For some people the most transformative music is classical music (we recommend Beethoven's Piano Concerto #5, 2nd and 3rd movements). For other people, more modern music is helpful. Some people find traditional folk music, like Celtic music, to really wake them up. Experiment and find something that works for you.

, There's an often intangible feeling of connection to the greater human spirit that you can tap in to and harness. For everyone, the medium that creates this feeling is different. Some people read poetry. Some people volunteer. Some people raise children. Find something that makes you feel connected to the greater experience of being human and then take your own approach to capturing that feeling. Take inspiration and create something, a painting, a song, a dance, that lets you express that you too are human and are apart of the great beating heart that is this planet and universe.

, When we're living a life that gives us purpose and lets that purpose be realized, that is when we will feel most inspired and awake to possibilities this world has to offer. Everyone has something to offer: either something to offer the planet, something to offer others, or some other purpose to serve. Find what you're good at, find what makes you happy, and do it. If you keep living for the sake of living, rather than living for the sake of making your existence mean something to the universe, then you will always find yourself feeling lost and without inspiration. Embrace what you can offer and stop thinking only of the hurdles!

, Start to feel connected by giving others the benefit of the doubt. When people invite you to things, don't just assume it's because they want to be nice. They might really want your friendship. They might really want to see what you have to offer the world! Assume the best in them and let them pleasantly surprise you. If you don't try, after all, you'll never even have the chance to find out if something could have been wonderful and fun!

, Humans naturally gain the greatest sense of satisfaction from helping each other. Not just the surface help of carrying someone's groceries. Instead, give someone deep, meaningful help that becomes one of the most positive forces of good in their lives. This will leave you feeling deeply connected to the greater human experience and get you ready to embrace life and all that you have in yours to be grateful for.


Try working with Big Brothers Big Sisters, which provides mentorship to at risk youth, or building homes with Habitat for Humanity, which works to build permanent residences for people who drew the short straw in life.
Volunteering is also a great chance to make new friends and meet people who share similar values and interests to you.

, If you're not great with meeting people in real life or if your schedule or lifestyle is just not good for being with people, then try meeting people and joining communities online. There are lots of different ways to do this! WikiHow, for example, has a great community and we're always happy for another friendly face and helping hand. Another option would be, for example, playing an MMO. This is a special type of video game that lets you take on a new life and make friends in a completely different world. Guild Wars is known for having one of the friendliest communities.

, Sadness is a natural part of life and a healthy emotion to have. If you're feeling dead inside because something bad just happened to you, then that's okay. Be sad for a little while. Embrace the emotion and learn to move past it. This will help you cope with tough situations in the future. However, if you've been sad for a long time and that feeling of deadness inside is beginning to run your life, recognize that while sadness is normal, it is also supposed to end. We go through lots of emotions but each needs their time in the sun.

, Sometimes, babying yourself and taking in too much supportive advice might actually be hurting you, not helping you. Sometimes what you really need is a swift kick in the pants. Tell yourself to man-or-woman-up and take this negative feeling like an adult. Start doing something about how you feel, instead of just letting the emotion control you.


Don't be your own worst bully though. Don't talk down to yourself. Just take a firm hand, like any good parent would.
If it makes in any easier, pretend it's not you giving the firm advice. Pretend it's Albus Dumbledore. Or Morgan Freeman. All advice sounds better when it's coming from Morgan Freeman.

, It's easy to get caught up in thinking about our problems or all of the things that we wish we had and forget about all of the incredible things happening around us. You can forget about all the things in your life that are good and make you happy. Don't forget about those things! Appreciating what you do have will make you feel better bout embracing those things while you have them. Remember, everything in life is temporary, and you have to learn to love things while you have them.


This can seem depressing, but remember that losing one thing that you love opens you up to new things that you can love and experience instead.

, Of course, sometimes our brains just get a bit sick. Sometimes we feel like we're dead inside not because we've lost sight of good things but because our brain has become blind to them. When you feel really lost, and especially if you feel like you might hurt yourself or someone else, please seek professional help. It doesn't make you weak or broken; just like you'd go to the doctor if you had cancer, you should go to a doctor when your brain isn't doing what it should.

, All in all, if you don't feel alive, it might be because you're not really living. When we live a life that's not true to ourselves, we're really living someone else's life and it's easy to feel like we're not really living at all. If you aren't being yourself, if you're lying about who you really are to those around you because you think it's going to make them happier: screw them. This is your life and at the end of the day, you have to do what makes you happy and be the person that you really are. This will reawaken your spirit and make you feel alive again!

Measure the quality of your relationships.,
Reflect on your conflict resolution skills.,
Think about what you look for in a romantic relationship.,
Imagine your perfect social gathering.,
Consider how you relate to children.",How to Know when You Are Grown Up1," Friendships take more effort to maintain as you age. You may find your social networks becoming wider, yet you may not have as many close, tight-knit relationships.

You may have a few friends you’ve known all your life as well as some dedicated new friends from different points in your life. Look at how long your current relationships have lasted — both romantic and non-romantic.

Have you been able to maintain quality relationships for a long time?
Are you able to get through difficult periods and keep your friends around?
Have you had long-term, stable romantic partnerships?
If you said yes to any of these questions, you may be managing grown-up relationships.;
, Even the most mature adults get into arguments. How you handle the argument is more telling than what started it. Grown-ups know how to respect each other’s differences. They remain calm during tense situations. They can agree to disagree or compromise to find a solution. They also know when to apologize and forgive without holding grudges., When you're young and immature, it's all about the chemistry and fireworks. As you grow older, you may look for a partner who is as much compatible as they are exciting. Ask yourself the following questions. If you answer yes, you may be involved in a mature relationship.


Do you and your partner work through your problems? Do you apologize to one another? Can you forgive each other during arguments?
Do you and your partner make compromises? Do you accommodate their needs? Do they accommodate yours?
Do you and your partner respect each other’s boundaries? Are you both able to have separate social lives, hobbies, interests, and jobs without becoming jealous or controlling?, Where does it take place? How many people are there? What are you doing? When you were younger, you may have wanted loud, crowded parties at clubs or bars. As you grow older, you may find yourself seeking quieter time with your friends. Sometimes, you might still want that big party. Generally, however, you may find that hosting dinner and game night at your home is more entertaining.

, As you grow up, you begin to separate yourself more and more from the younger generation. You may dislike their taste in music, clothes, or entertainment. You may find yourself disapproving of their choices in life. You may think that they are badly behaved compared to your generation. You may also might appreciate their innocence, play, humor, and freedom from responsibility that is often lost in adulthood. This shows that you are creating a difference between yourself, as an adult, and children.


If you have children, you may start worrying about their future. Children often force people to grow up quickly, no matter how old they are. You may be more aware of how your decisions affect their life, their behavior, and their future. Your decisions will start to include their welfare as well as your own."

Be sincere.,
Listen and learn.,
Compliment the work of others.,
Sympathize with others.,
Keep in touch.",How to Earn Respect1," If people sense that you're speaking from the heart and that you believe and will stand behind your actions, words, and beliefs, you'll present yourself as a person to be respected. Learn to cultivate sincerity among your friends, at work, in school, and in all parts of your life.


When you're among different crowds of people, act the same way you act when you're alone, or when you're with other groups. We've all experienced the social pressure to act a certain way, or seen a friend suddenly fawn over a successful business contact you were moments ago trash-talking in a private conversation. Be consistent in your personality, regardless of who's around.;
, Many people wait to talk in conversations, rather than listening what the other person has to say. This can give off an unpleasantly self-centered vibe. We all have things we want to say, but learning to be a good listener will ultimately make people more interested in what you have to say. If you want to earn the respect of people you talk to, learn to listen actively and cultivate a reputation as a good listener.


Ask lots of questions. Even if you're talking to someone you know well, learn as much as you can by asking questions, follow up questions, and personal questions. People like to feel interesting when they're listened to. Showing a genuine interest in what other people have to say will earn you respect. Follow up specific questions like ""How many siblings do you have?"" with deeper questions that show you're interested. Ask, ""What are they like?""






Follow up on conversations. If someone recommends a book or album to you, shoot them a quick text when you've read a few chapters to let them know what you think of it., When the actions, ideas, or statements of a friend or colleague stand out to you as being particularly notable, compliment them with brief praise. Some people let jealousy fester when someone else meets success. If you want to earn respect, learn to acknowledge greatness and praise it.


Be honest in your compliments. Overly enthusiastic blanket praise of anything someone does won't earn you respect, but might give you a reputation as a brown-noser. When something genuinely impresses you,
Try to compliment actions, deeds, and ideas rather than superficial things like possessions or looks. Saying, for instance, ""You've got such a great sense of style,"" is better than ""That's a nice dress.""

, Learning the skills of empathy are an important way to respect others and become respected yourself. If you can anticipate someone's emotional needs, you can be respected as a caring, thoughtful individual, attentive to the needs of people around you.


Notice people's body language. If people are upset or frustrated, they might not always be willing to voice their frustration. If you can learn to notice this, you can adjust your behavior appropriately.
Make yourself available for emotional assistance if it's required, and back off if it isn't. If your friend has just ended a messy relationship, gauge their needs. Some people will want to blow off steam by talking about it endlessly and wallowing in the details, in which you might lend a sympathetic ear. Others might want to ignore the matter and go about their business solo. Don't pester them. There's no right way to grieve.

, Everyone needs a favor every now and then, but it's a sign of respect to keep in touch with your friends, colleagues, and family members, even when you don't need anything from them.


Call or text your friends just to chat. Send them funny links on Facebook or other social media, just to let them know you're thinking of them.






Keep your family updated on your successes and failures, especially if you live in different places. Talk to your parents and let them know how you're doing at school, what you're feeling about your relationship. Let people into your life.






Treat work friends as real friends. Don't just hit them up when you need to find out what time you're supposed to show up next week, or to find out what you missed at the last meeting. Learn about their lives and treat them with respect to earn respect yourself.

Create a list of your obligations and responsibilities.,
Identify your priorities.,
Analyze your living situation.,
Ask yourself who depends on you.,
Consider your financial stability.",How to Know when You Are Grown Up2," Being a grown-up is not just about having responsibilities; it’s about fulfilling your obligations and promises in a timely manner, too.Think about all the things you are responsible for. Do you accomplish tasks quickly and without being reminded? Some common grown-up responsibilities include:


Taking care of children
Caring for elderly parents
Paying a mortgage or rent
Maintaining a working car
Shopping and cooking for a household

, When you were young, your top priorities may have been to take care of yourself and to have fun. As you mature, your priorities start to revolve around taking care of others in addition to yourself. You may be more concerned about health, retirement, or your debt. You will plan to be financially stable instead of rich. You will start to save money for your children's education or for insurance costs. You may even have a plan in the event of your death or the death of your spouse.

, Living independently is often a goal of adulthood. Being able to clean, fix, and manage your own home is a sign that your personal life is in order. Look around your home, and consider the following:


How clean is your home? Tidiness is often a sign of maturity. You may start washing your dishes immediately after dinner, or you may start to dust once a week.
Who do you live with? Living alone may indicate that you are independent. Living with roommates and significant others shows that you can maturely share a space with others. Living with your parents might be a sign that you haven’t quite transitioned into adulthood, or it may mean that you need some time to achieve financial independence.Who fixes your home? If something breaks, taking care of it yourself is a major sign of responsibility. If the problem is outside of your ability, you should be able to call a professional in a timely manner, instead of waiting until the problem worsens.

, Being grown-up isn’t just about taking care of yourself. It also involves taking care of others. You may have many people who rely on you for certain things. Being dependable is a strong sign of maturity. Answering yes to any of the following questions means that you have grown-up responsibilities.


At work, do you lead any teams? Are you responsible for certain clients? Do you manage certain tasks? Do you lead a carpool?
Do you take care of any family members? Do you have children? Do you have pets? Is anyone in your family sick or disabled?
Do you help your friends out when they are in need? Are you in charge of certain group activities?

, Many people use financial stability as the ultimate mark of an independent adult. This can be difficult for some people, and many young adults must rely on some sort of aid from their parents.

Look over your finances. Consider how well you manage them. Ask yourself the following questions. If you say yes to many of these questions, you are probably at least somewhat financially independent.

Do you pay taxes?
Do you pay rent or a mortgage? Do you pay on time?
Do you save money or invest?
Do you pay your bills on time?
Do you worry about things such as your credit score?
Do you have debt? Are you able to pay it off in a timely manner?

"
Think about the future.,
Consider how important your health is to you.,
Notice how you make decisions.,
Determine how your tastes have changed.,
Map out your routines.,
Reflect on your nostalgia.,
Track your awareness of current events.,
Record how much sleep you get.",How to Know when You Are Grown Up3," Where do you see yourself five years down the line? Ten? Do you have a plan, or are you still waiting for things to just happen? When you're a kid, your mindset is in the here and now. Maybe you think about what's going to happen tomorrow or this summer. You know you're a grown-up when you think seriously about your life many years down the line. You might want to take action to influence your future life. You may look more for stability instead of adventure.This can manifest in a few different ways:


You invest in a retirement fund.
You purchase more expensive but sturdier products that will last you for years instead of cheap goods that you plan to throw out.
You’re planning to have children. If you have children already, you’re planning for their futures as well as your own.

, The more mature you become, the more you realize how your decisions can impact your health. You start thinking about the long-term effects of your diet and exercise regime. You may even start working out more to keep a youthful figure. You might worry about dying.Reflect on your health habits.


Do you worry about joint pain or flexibility?
Do you exercise so that you can live longer?
Do you exercise because of your cardiovascular (heart) health or to improve a medical condition, such as high cholesterol?
Do you worry about high salt, sugar, or fat intake?
Do you often think about your own mortality?

, When people are young, they often care a lot about what their peers, family, and conventional society will think of them. They may make decisions based on what their parents wish for them or what is a ""normal"" path for people in their community. Making decisions based not on these influences but instead on what is best and most fulfilling for you is a sign of true maturity. There may come a point in your life in which you care less about prescribed or conventional opinion and focus on what will bring you satisfaction. This may end up being in line with what is ""typical"" or expected, or it may look very different., What did you like 10 or 20 years ago that you don't like anymore? What do you enjoy now that you hated when you were a kid? You may have changed your mind on things you used to think were boring or gross. Some signs that you are growing up include:


You may start to think that the music teenagers and college students are listening to is awful compared to the music you listened to at that age.
You might start to like movies and TV shows that you would've thought were boring in the past.
You might take the time to decorate your home instead of just slapping up posters.
You may typically prefer cooking for yourself rather than getting fast food.

, Mature adults tend to have many routines and habits that they adhere to religiously. Think about all of your routines and habits. What do you do every day? Is there something you can’t do without? Are there certain rituals that help you get through tough patches? These may include:


Drinking a cup of coffee every morning
Having a date night with your significant other on the same day every week
Not being able to fall asleep without brushing your teeth
Eating dinner at the same time every day

, Adults often love to reminisce about their past. If you find yourself daydreaming about your youthful glory days, you may be experiencing one of the key markers of adulthood.While you can remember the old days fondly, try to have fun in the moment, too. Perhaps in ten or twenty years, you will consider this period of your life to be the best.

, You may find yourself more concerned with current events than you used to be. Perhaps you read or watch the news more often than you used to. You may find yourself more politically active. You might be worried with how global markets or disasters affect your lifestyle. You might also be more persuaded to donate to charities. These are all signs of a mature interest in world events and causes.

, Recall a time when sleeping for ten hours straight was a treat. If it’s now impossible, you're probably growing up. Older people need less sleep.

They will often use the extra time to take care of their responsibilities. You may find yourself waking up earlier, or you may not take as many naps as you used to. Getting up early to do extra chores may not bother you as much anymore."

Do what you say you'll do.,
Offer to help, even if you don't need to.,
Go above and beyond.,
Learn to anticipate the needs of others.",How to Earn Respect2," No one will respect someone viewed as flaky or unreliable. If you want to be respected, come through on your commitments and promises to the people in your life. Call when you say you'll call, turn in assignments on time, and stand by your word.


If you need to cancel or otherwise change your plans with someone, try not to get in the habit of using white lies or coming up with excuses to get out of it. If you said you'd come out drinking on Friday night but now would rather curl up with a bowl of popcorn and watch TV, it's OK to say, ""I don't really feel like going out tonight"" and make concrete plans for later in the week. Always try to give an ample margin.

, When one of your friends moves, it can start to feel like a teacher's just asked you to solve a quadratic formula on the board. Everyone looks at their desk. To be respected and reliable, volunteer your talents and efforts to projects that need help. Volunteer to do things that need to get done, not just things you think you'll do well.


Alternatively, learn to take a step back and focus on the talents of others. If you're known as a reliable person, people might call on you for all sorts of things while other talented people hesitate to step up to the plate. Invite them in by calling on them for help, or suggesting them as possible candidates for the job. This will earn you respect from both parties.

, You can either do the minimum requirement, or you can make the extra effort necessary to make a job, assignment, or project perfect. Do the latter and you'll earn respect.


If you finish something early and have extra time, take advantage of it. Often, we wait till the last minute to write an essay or start working on a project and cram to finish it all. Give yourself false deadlines to ""finish"" early and then use the extra time you've earned yourself to really polish it and make it shine.
Even if you end up coming short of your goals, if you exhaust your ideas and efforts, at least you'll know that you did your best and threw everything you had into that presentation or paper, which is something that will earn you respect.

, If you know your roommate or partner's got a terrible day of work ahead of them, clean the house and make dinner, or have cocktails prepared when they get home. Taking a little initiative to make someone's day a little easier will earn you respect.

Be humble.,
Talk less.,
Take responsibility for your actions.,
Assert yourself.,
Respect yourself.",How to Earn Respect3," Downplaying your successes and maintaining an even perspective in the world will keep you happy, humble, and will earn respect from people. Let your actions speak for themselves and let people come to their own conclusions about your skills and talents. Don't trumpet your own horn, let other people trumpet it for you.


You won't need to play up your abilities if you spend all your time proving that you're great.

, Everyone's got an opinion about everything, but that doesn't mean you've always got to share it. Sit back and let other people talk while you listen sometimes, especially if your tendency is to chatter. Take in the perspectives and offer yours if you have anything to add to the discussion. If you don't, keep quiet.


Sitting back and letting other people talk will also give you a leg up by allowing them to reveal themselves to you, giving you the opportunity to understand them and relate to them a little better.






If you're a quiet person, learn to speak out when you've got something to add. Don't let humility and a desire to be a stony stoic get in the way of you sharing your perspective. People won't respect you for that.







, Just as you wouldn't say one thing and do another if you want to earn people's respect, you've got to be consistent in your actions. Finish what you start. We all screw up sometimes. If you do, own up to it and maintain the respect that you've cultivated for yourself.


If you can do something by yourself, don't ask for help. Let a one person job remain a one person job, even if it's going to be difficult.

, Nobody will respect a doormat. If you don't want to do something, say so. If you've got a dissenting opinion and know in your heart that you're right, say so. Being assertive in a polite, courteous, and respectful way will earn respect from people even while you're disagreeing with them.

, There is a popular proverb: ""Respect yourself, then you will be respected"". If you wish to earn respect of people, you should respect yourself first for whatever you are. You need to assess yourself and feel good about things that make you a better person. Charity begins at home."

Switch to a stronger antiperspirant.,
Apply antiperspirant at night.,
Choose clothing wisely.,
Bring a change of clothes.,
Avoid spicy foods.,
Keep your bed cool.,
Reduce stress.,
Use dry shampoo.,
Cut back on bad habits.",How to Control Excessive Sweating1," The first thing to do when attempting to combat excessive sweating is to switch to an antiperspirant with a stronger formula. While prescriptions are required for the strongest of these, there are several clinical strength formulas available over-the-counter from brands like Dove and Secret.


Be aware of the difference between antiperspirants and deodorants. Antiperspirants will actually clog the sweat glands and prevent excess moisture, while deodorants simply mask odors. Therefore, if you are suffering from excess sweating, it's important that you use an antiperspirant (although antiperspirant-deodorants are also available).
Prescription-strength antiperspirants typically contain 10 to 15 percent of an active ingredient called aluminum chloride hexahydrate. This ingredient is highly effective at reducing perspiration but can sometimes cause skin irritation, so you may need to shop around to find a formula that works for you.
Some people are also opposed to wearing antiperspirants due to the alleged links between the aluminum-based compounds found in antiperspirants and diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's. However, multiple clinical studies have found no evidence to support this link.;
, This may come as a surprise, but doctors recommend applying your antiperspirant at nighttime, just before bed. The reason for this is that it takes approximately six to eight hours for the antiperspirant to enter the sweat ducts and adequately clog the pores.


Your body also tends to stay cooler and more calm while you're sleeping, which reduces sweating and prevents the antiperspirant from being washed away before it has time to sink in (which is what happens when you only apply antiperspirant in the morning).However, it is a good idea to apply the antiperspirant a second time, after your morning shower, for optimum results.
Remember that antiperspirants aren't reserved for use on the armpits, they can be used almost anywhere you find yourself sweating - like the palms, feet and back. Just avoid using them on the face, as stronger formulas have a tendency to cause irritation, especially on sensitive skin.

, Wearing the right clothing can make a huge difference when it comes to keeping sweating under control. Firstly, wearing breathable clothing can prevent you from sweating excessively in the first place and secondly, making clever clothing choices can help to mask sweat stains and stop you from feeling self-conscious.


Wear lightweight fabrics. Lightweight, breathable fabrics - such as cotton - will allow your skin to breathe and prevent your body from overheating.
Choose dark colors and patterns. Wearing dark colors and patterned clothes can help to make sweat stains less obvious or even unnoticeable, giving you greater peace of mind as you go about your day.
Wear breathable shoes. If you suffer from sweaty feet, it's a good idea to invest in high-quality, breathable shoes which prevent your feet from over-heating. You can also place moisture-wicking insoles inside shoes, for added sweat-reducing benefits.






Layer up. Layering your clothing, no matter what the season, can help with the appearance of sweat, as the bottom layers can soak up any excess moisture before it gets a chance to soak through the outer layers. Men can wear undershirts, while women can opt for a camisole.






Consider using dress shields. If it's too warm for extra layers, you can also consider using dress-shields. These are small adhesive patches which you can stick to the inside of your clothing to soak up an excess moisture. They are available at most pharmacies., Keeping a spare (non-creasing) shirt or blouse in your bag at all times is a good idea if you suffer from excessive sweating. Just knowing that you always have a fresh change of clothes readily available can decrease your anxiety levels and make you feel more secure.


It has been proven that worrying about your sweating can actually cause you to sweat more, so knowing that you have a safety net (in the form of a change of clothes) to fall back on can actually prevent you from sweating so much in the first place.
Carry a handkerchief. Another sneaky back-up is to carry a handkerchief in your pocket at all times. That way, if you're confronted with the necessity of shaking hands with somebody, you can quickly and inconspicuously dry your palms first.

, Spicy foods such as hot peppers or Indian curries can increase the amount of sweat you produce, so avoid eating anything spicy - at least during lunch on workdays or on a date.


Also avoid eating foods such as garlic and onions, as the strong odors associated with these foods can come out through your sweat.Overall, eating clean foods such as whole grains, fruit and veg is a good idea. Although, they won't stop you from sweating, they can improve the odor of the sweat.







, If you suffer from nighttime sweating, there are several things you can do to keep yourself cool in bed.


Make sure you are using breathable, lightweight bed linen no matter what time of year it is. Also make sure to choose sheets in an absorbent material such as cotton - silk or flannel sheets are not ideal.
Opt for a lightweight duvet or comforter. You can always layer more blankets on if necessary, but if you're sleeping under a heavy down duvet - even in summer - its no wonder you suffer from nighttime sweats., Feeling stressed, nervous or anxious is a major sweat trigger for some people, so it makes sense that by controlling your stress levels, you can control your sweating.


When you're stressed or nervous, these feelings stimulate neurotransmitters in the brain which send signals to your body to start sweating, leaving you feeling hot and bothered.






To cut down on stress, try to avoid biting off more than you can chew at work. If you find yourself sweating due to nerves before a presentation or meeting your boss, focus on relaxation techniques such as deep breathing and meditation.In the long term, things like frequent exercise and making time for family and friends will help you to reduce stress. Find other stress reducing ideas here.







, If you find that your scalp gets sweaty at the slightest physical activity, consider spritzing your hair with some dry shampoo every morning. Most dry shampoos have a powdery finish which soaks up additional moisture from the hair and scalp.


Keep a travel-size bottle of dry shampoo in your purse or in a desk drawer at work - then you can have a quick spritz in the bathroom whenever you want to freshen up.
Scented dry shampoos also smell great - helping to mask any sweaty odors. However, if you're looking for a more D.I.Y. option, baby powder or baking soda will also do the trick.

, Things like smoking, drinking alcohol and excessive caffeine consumption can all lead to increased sweating, so it's a good idea to cut back on these things where possible.


Being overweight also leads to increased sweating, so if you could stand to lose a few pounds, that's a good place to start.

Accept that some days will be better than others.,
Stand up for yourself.,
Stand up for others.,
Stand up for those you stood up to.",How to Be Yourself," Oscar Wilde once said with his usual wit: Be yourself; everyone else is already taken. As humorous as this might seem, it's a basic summation of the truth. Yet, you can't be yourself if you don't know, understand, and accept yourself first. It should be your primary goal to find this out.


Find the time to learn upon what you value and take time to consider what makes up the essence of who you are. As part of this, contemplate your life and choices. Try to think about what kinds of things you would or wouldn't like to do, and act accordingly; finding out through trial and error helps more than you might think it does.
You can even take personality tests, but be careful to only take what you want from them so that you do not let such tests define you. Instead, ensure that the defining you do is based on your own terms and is something you feel absolutely comfortable with. You may feel self-conscious, but over time if you are around the right type of people for you, they will accept you for who you are.;
, This is a natural result of taking on broad values from a variety of sources, including culture, religion, mentors, inspiring people, educational sources, etc. What does matter is that you continue working through these conflicts to resolve what values feel most true to yourself.


Just because your values seem to conflict doesn't mean you necessarily have to abandon them. Consider it all a part of a dynamic you. You cannot be shoved into any box or pegged. You have values for all different aspects of your life, so it's natural they be different.

, One of the most unhealthy approaches to being oneself is to make a decision that who you are is defined by a moment or period of time, after which you spend the rest of your life trying to still be that person from the past rather than someone who is still you but grows with the passing of each season and decade. Allow yourself this space to grow, to improve, to become wiser.


Allow yourself to forgive past errors and past behaviors you're not so proud of. Work on accepting mistakes and choices you've made; they're done and in the past. You had your reasons for them and the decision made sense at the time, so instead of harnessing yourself to past mistakes, allow yourself to learn their lessons and continue to grow.
Look for people around you who proudly proclaim they are no different than they were the day they turned 16 or 26 or 36, or whatever. Do these people seem flexible, easygoing, happy people? Often they are not because they are so busy insisting that nothing has changed for them ever, that they're incapable of taking on new ideas, learning from others, or growing. Growth into every new age and stage of our lives is an essential part of being true to ourselves and to being emotionally healthy and whole.

, Over time, these may change and thus, so may your definition of yourself, but never let up in focusing and refocusing on them. They more than adequately balance out your flaws and are the principal reason for not comparing yourself to others.


Comparison leads to resentment. A person filled with resentment cannot focus on the mantra of ""be yourself"" because they are too busy hankering after someone else!
Comparison leads also to criticism of others. A life filled with criticizing others stems from low self-esteem and a need to pull others off their perches that you've placed them on. That's both a way to lose friends and respect, and it's also a way of never being yourself because you're envy-struck and spending too much time on admiring others for their characteristics and not on yourself.

, Stop worrying about the worst that could happen, especially in social situations. So what if you fall flat on your face? Or get spinach stuck in your teeth? Or accidentally head butt your date when leaning in for a kiss? Learn to laugh at yourself both when it happens and afterward.


Turn it into a funny story that you can share with others. It lets them know that you're not perfect and makes you feel more at ease, too. It's also an attractive quality for someone to be able to laugh at themselves and not take themselves too seriously!

, What have you got to hide? We're all imperfect, growing, learning human beings. If you feel ashamed or insecure about any aspect of yourself and you feel that you have to hide those parts of you, whether physically or emotionally then you have to come to terms with that and learn to convert your so-called flaws into individualistic quirks or simply as basic, down-to-earth acknowledgments of your own imperfections.


Try the tactic of owning up to your imperfections mid-argument with someone. You will often discover that suddenly you've removed the very reason for stubbornly holding the line of argument, which is often about preserving face and not giving in. The moment you say, ""Yeah, look, I get really irritable when the room's in a mess too. And I acknowledge that I shouldn't leave my clothes in a pile on the floor and yet I do it because that's a lazy part of myself I'm still trying to train out of the habit. I'm sorry. I know I could do better, and I will try,"" you suddenly infuse an argument with genuine self-honesty that disarms the entire point of the argument.

, If you're always striving to be someone you're not already, you'll never be a happy person. This comes about through comparing yourself to others and finding yourself wanting in certain ways. This is a slippery slope to tread, where your thinking will only become more and more negative.


You can always see the appearances others wish to portray publicly but you won't ever see what's really going on behind their facades in their apparently perfect world. By comparing yourself to others, you give their image-portrayal way too much power and reduce your own worth based on a mirage. It's a useless activity that only brings harm.
Instead, value the person you are, love your personality, and embrace your flaws; we all have them, and as explained earlier, being honest is better than running from them.

, Some of them will like you and some of them won't. Either attitude is as likely to be right or wrong. It's next-to-impossible to be yourself when you're caught up in constantly wondering ""Do they think I'm funny? Does she think I'm fat? Do they think I'm dumb? Am I good/clever/popular enough to be a part of their group of friends?"" To be yourself, you've got to let go of these concerns and just let your behavior flow, with only your consideration of others as a filter — not their consideration of you.


If you change yourself for one person or group, another person or group may not like you, and you could go on forever in a vicious cycle trying to please people instead of focusing on building up your talents and strengths.

, Always wanting everyone's love and respect is a totally pointless exercise in the end that can harm your personal development and confidence. Who cares what other people say? As Eleanor Roosevelt said once, no one can make you feel inferior without your consent and what matters most is that you listen to your own inner confidence and if it's missing, that you start developing it!


Does this mean no one's opinion in life matters? No. It hurts if you're socially rejected. If you're forced into a situation where you must spend most or all of your time among people who can't stand you for reasons of their own, it's dangerous to internalize their negative ideas of who you are. What you can do is exercise some choice in whose opinions you value more than others. It's much healthier to pay attention to people who genuinely mean you well and who agree with you about what you want to do with your life.

, Don't trivialize what you're going through if you face negative social pressure or bullying. It's easier to withstand it if you are aware of it as pressure and build healthy defenses. Building up a circle of trusted friends and people who share your views and beliefs in life is a good way to help reduce the impact of hostile people. You can tell yourself their opinions don't matter, and they shouldn't, but that's a lot easier when there are others who agree with you and stand by you.


Compare those who love you to whoever the bully is; suddenly you can realize that their opinion of you, your family or your lifestyle, is worthless. We inherently care about the opinions of those we respect and look up to. This works both ways; if someone has no respect for you, then what they say about you is just empty words coming from someone who is one step above being a total stranger.

, It will focus on real faults that you don't know about, and could do with remedying. In the latter case, people such as parents, mentors, teachers, coaches, etc., might well be telling you things that you need to digest and mull over at your own pace, to make self-improvements for the better. The difference is that their critique of you is intended to be helpful.


These people care about you and are interested in how you grow as a person, and are respectful. Learn how to spot the difference and you will live well, dismissing pointless negative critiques, and learning from the constructive critique.

, You value your friends and those close to you; well, who is closer to you than you are? Give yourself the same kind, thoughtful, and respectful treatment that you give to other people you care about. If you had to hang out with yourself for a day, what is the most fun/enjoyable/fulfilled/calm/contented type of person you could be, while still being yourself? What is the best version of you?


Be responsible for yourself and for boosting your self-esteem. If others aren't telling you you're great, don't let it get to you. Instead, tell yourself you're special, wonderful, and worthwhile. When you believe these things about yourself, others will recognize that glow of self-confidence and begin confirming your self-affirmations in no time!

, Whether it's your sense of style, or even your manner of speaking, if your preferred way of doing something strays from the mainstream and produces positive outcomes, then be proud of it. Be a character, not a type.


Learn to communicate well – the better you can express yourself, the easier it is for the people who like you as you are to find you and the ones who don't to just steer clear.

, Sometimes comparison causes us to compare apples with pears. We'd like to be a top movie producer in Hollywood when we're a lowly, aspiring scriptwriter. To see that top producer's lifestyle and find yourself wanting as a result is an unfair comparison – that person has years of experience and hobnobbing behind them, while you're just starting out, testing the waters with writing skills that may one day prove to be exceptional.


Be realistic in your comparisons and only look to other people as inspiration and as sources of motivation, not as a means to belittling yourself.

, The common thing a lot of people do is copy others' actions because it seems like the better route to fit in, but really, shouldn't you stand out? Standing out is very hard, yes, but you need to try avoid assuming other people's perspectives of you, even if it's not something you would normally do; that's what being yourself is all about.


Whatever you are, accept it. Being different is absolutely beautiful and it attracts people to you. Don't let people change you!

, People might raise eyebrows and even make fun of you when you feel like you're truly being you, but as long as you can shrug and say, ""Hey, that's just me,"" and leave it at that, people will ultimately respect you for it, and you'll respect yourself. Most people struggle being themselves; if you can do it, they might even admire you.


Sometimes it will hurt when you're teased. While this can be very difficult, and far easier said than done, try your best to flick it off your shoulder. In the end, you'll be a bigger and better person, know who you are, and better able to survive whatever obstacles arise in your future.

, When someone bullies you, why let them? They never got a certificate saying they had the right to bully! If you have a problem, there are so many good, understanding people eager to help you.

, When you catch a bully, it is in your good nature to stop them. No matter how you do it, you have the right to stop it. You believe in yourself.

, Just because you had to defend yourself doesn't mean these people have no heart!

Bite your tongue and smile.,
Have an exit strategy.,
Establish healthy boundaries.,
Be tactful.If the opinionated person is constantly giving advice or trying to show you a better way to do something, simply respond with a respectful “Thanks for the suggestion” or “I appreciate you pointing that out to me.” If he or she is correct, you’ll want to follow the advice.,
Remember that having an opinion is OK.,
Remember that everyone is entitled to his or her opinion.,
Realize opinionated people might have no insight into their behavior.,
Try to get to know the person at a deeper level.,
See the opinionated person as a potential resource.,
Find common ground.Even if you find the person obnoxious, you almost certainly have areas of interest that overlap.",How to Deal With Opinionated People," Interacting with opinionated people is unavoidable, so, you’ll have to pick your battles wisely to make sure that you’re not engaging in verbal warfare when such people cross your path. Not every annoying comment needs to be dealt with. Also, it may not be in your best interest to try to confront a person.


Is this an opinion worth spending your time disputing? Some opinions may be annoying but is pointless to argue. For instance, the science fiction community may likely never agree if Star Wars or Star Trek is the better franchise, and the die-hard factions are not likely to be swayed by any argument by the other side. In the end, it is a matter of personal opinion.
Are you going to win this battle? Fighting the good fight is a laudable action. However, there are places and situations that your actions are not going to change anyone's mind and you will be impacted quite negatively (or worse, an innocent person) in the process. This also means your energy, time, and mood.
Is this opinion hurting someone else? Calling out someone for a racist, sexist, bullying or otherwise harmful action or words is generally the right thing to do. Just having a different opinion may not be.;
, People tend to become very defensive if corrected in public, which may make the situation worse. If appropriate and possible, take that person aside and have the conversation in private. Having the conversation in public will only cause embarrassment and hurt feelings. Maintain a respectful tone. Your tone and attitude will be important if you want to take the step of addressing the situation with the opinionated person. Make sure your tone isn’t angry or sarcastic, and speak softly while maintaining a nonthreatening posture. If the other person gets angry, don’t raise your voice or get similarly agitated.
Remain calm and restrained in your interactions. The worst way to interact with an opinionated person is to be combative and domineering. This approach will invariably lead to a game of one-upmanship to prove who knows the most or who can dominate the other. No one wins in this situation.

, You can’t hold someone else to a standard that is higher than the one you use for yourself. Thus, for the know-it-all, you should model that you don’t know everything and that you recognize that admitting your shortcomings is not a sign of weakness.


Use “I” statements instead of “you” statements. Though you’ll feel as if the other person is causing the problem, you should resist the temptation to speak in an accusatory manner. Instead, frame your issue from your perspective.

“I have been interrupted by you several times now” is better than saying “You talk all the time and you don’t respect me.” Listen as much as you talk. It is possible that the opinionated person will be angry or indignant that you are confronting him or her. If that happens, take a deep breath and make sure to listen and not talk over the other person. If you need to walk away before the conversation escalates, don’t be afraid to do so.
Practice active listening.If the person is defensive and tries to explain his or her perspective, repeat what the person says to prove that you’re hearing the words accurately.

You could say something such as, “I hear you saying that you don’t want to offend me and that I’m overreacting. But what you are saying is , and I do not like it.” , Even if the opinionated person is a buffoon who knows nothing about the topics he or she is spouting off about, you should always treat that person like a human being with sincere beliefs and feelings.


Asking questions also signals respect. The opinionated person is less likely to dismiss your concern if it seems as though you are trying to understand their perspective.

Examples of questions to ask during confrontation include: ""How can I better communicate with you?"" or ""What do you think we both can do to improve our working relationship?""


Arm yourself with facts. When confronting an opinionated person, it's important to demonstrate how their behavior is detrimental to others, including yourself. Share facts and figures about how workplace collaboration is diminished when one person runs the show, or, how friendships are broken when one person's voice isn't valued., In some cases – such as when the opinionated person is in a position of authority over you – you’ll have little choice but to make the best of a bad situation.


Reframe your conversations away from topics that make you uncomfortable. If you don’t want to talk about the topics that the opinionated person brings up, shift focus to topics that you are more comfortable discussing. It does not have to be something you are even interested in, just steer the conversation away from sensitive topics. Ask the person about his or her family or interests.

, If you know you’re going to have to spend time with an opinionated person, make plans for minimizing the time you spend together.At work, this could mean avoiding areas where that person is or having a reply prepared so that you can excuse yourself and leave the situation. At family events, plan activities that will allow you to avoid face-to-face conversations.

, If the opinionated person insists on talking about religion, politics, money, or any topic that makes you feel uncomfortable, attempt to privately tell that person that you don’t like to talk about such things and that you’d appreciate avoiding those discussions.


Be firm. If the person keeps bringing up those topics, remind him or her that you don’t want to have that discussion. For example: ""I'm so glad you have gotten so much from your faith. But I feel my belief in God is a private thing, and I'd rather talk about something else.""
Say something such as “I know you have strong opinions on that, but that topic makes me uncomfortable. I really don’t want to talk about it.”
Or, simply deflect: ""Let's talk about something lighter, huh? Tell me, how is that new baby of yours?""

, If not, simply ignore it and do what’s best.


Realize that you might find yourself reacting against the opinionated person. There might be times when the opinionated person really does know what he or she is talking about but is putting forth his or her opinions in an obnoxious or domineering way. In those cases, you might be tempted to ignore his or her advice, simply to make a point. Don’t let anger cloud your judgment.
Resist the temptation to be passive-aggressive. Even if you don’t get into a shouting match with an opinionated person, you might be tempted to roll your eyes at them or mutter snide comments under your breath. Doing so will only increase the tension between you and the opinionated person.

, Many individuals are taught to not really have or express an opinion at all. If this is so, it can feel really uncomfortable to be around someone who not only has a strong opinion, but willing to clearly articulate this fact. And especially so if he or she finds lively debate enjoyable, even seeking it out unsolicited. This can be for a number of reasons:


Cultural differences: Some cultures downplay frank open discussion on sensitive matters, while others treat it as rude not to talk out things.
Gender upbringing. Women more often than men tend to be taught to be quiet and demure, not outgoing and outspoken. A woman who is articulate and outspoken may be considered domineering, while a man doing the same thing is often evaluated much more positively.
Family upbringing. In some families, children are encouraged to speak up on opinions, while others are taught children are seen and not heard. Birth order can make a difference, too.
Personality differences. Some people are more outgoing and judgmental, while others are more concerned with getting along with others and keeping an open mind than on making hard and fast assessments. One personality type is not better than another. The personality type well suited to being a judge may not be the same as one best suited for being a minister.

, Different people do not see eye-to-eye on the same things. And sometimes this can be difficult for some people to handle. It seems so wrong for another person to feel the way he or she does! But here are some things to remember:


Having a different opinion does not mean he or she is less than you. The opinion is not the same as the person. One can have the same opinion as you, but that does not necessarily make the person better than someone with a different opinion.
Listening does not mean agreeing. Simply listening to another person's point of view does not mean you agree with him or her. It just means you are hearing him or her out.
You do not have to engage in every argument you are invited to. Some people live to argue, but this can get exhausting. And you will not win every time. And it is OK to simply give a pass to arguments, especially if you have little or nothing to gain or a lot to lose.

, In most cases, an opinionated person isn't trying to be offensive and might wonder why people avoid him. If you offer empathy instead of judgement, you might be integral in helping him better understand his situation.

, If you already don’t like the person, it will be difficult to want to get to know him or her better. Even so, try to see the person as a human being, with a family and friends and a life. The more you get to know them as a person, the easier it will be to show empathy., Since the opinionated person has no shortage of opinions to offer, you might be able to use whatever knowledge he or she possesses to your advantage.


For instance, the person might know something about office dynamics where you work and be open enough to give you information that no one else will. If the person is a family member, he or she might tell you stories that everyone is too polite to mention. You might be surprised what you’ll learn.

, If you don’t want to talk about politics, maybe you share an interest in music. Or, if you don’t want to talk about sports, maybe you can discuss adventures with family and parenting. Find those areas you have in common and focus on them.

See your doctor for a possible cause of your excessive sweating.,
Try laser hair removal on your underarms.,
Use prescription medication.,
Consider iontophoresis treatment.,
Consider botox injections.,
Resort to surgery, if necessary.",How to Control Excessive Sweating2," In some instances, excessive sweating may be due to an underlying medical condition, such as menopause, heart disease, hyperthyroidism or some types of cancer.


It is important to identify this underlying cause as soon as possible so treatment can begin. This is particularly true since some of these causes can become potentially life-threatening if they are left unchecked. Once the underlying problem is successfully treated, the patient can effectively reduce the excessive sweating as well.
It is also important to consider whether any medications you are currently taking could be causing the problem. Some medicines can contribute to excessive sweating, such as drugs used to treat psychiatric conditions or high blood pressure. Antibiotics and some types of supplements can also lead to the problem.
This is of particular concern if the sweating appeared after the medication was started, or if the sweating is a generalized, rather than a localized, variety.

, Laser hair removal is often recommended by doctors to curb excessive sweating and eliminate bad odors.


The reason this works is fairly simple - hair is present to keep the body warm, but sometimes it causes it to sweat more. Bacteria also cling to hairs much more easily, which leads to bad odors. By removing the hair, the area will sweat less and hold onto fewer bacteria, resulting in reduced odor.
Laser hair removal works by targeting hair follicles with pulses of laser light which destroy them. The treatment is relatively non-painful, but may require several sessions to complete. From then on, hair growth will be significantly reduced. Laser treatment can be somewhat pricey, but the results are permanent., Several drugs exist to control excessive sweating. They work by blocking nerves in the brain from communicating with sweat glands.


These pills have been found very effective in some patients, so if you're interested, talk to your doctor about a prescription.
Some reported side effects of these medications include blurred vision, bladder problems and a dry mouth., This FDA-approved procedure is typically performed by a dermatologist and uses electrical impulses to ""turn off"" the sweat glands temporarily. It is particularly effective in the hands and feet.


Most patients require multiple sessions to see positive results. These sessions are typically performed once a day for up to 2 weeks. After that, maintenance sessions can be done on an ""as needed"" basis.
Few side effects are reported with this procedure and some patients eventually perform maintenance sessions as needed in the comfort of their own homes. Machines can be purchased from R.A. Fischer Co. and generally cost around $600. Patients must be trained by their doctor to use the machine properly.

, While typically considered an anti-aging treatment, these injections have also been proven effective in treating hyperhidrosis. The procedure works by temporarily blocking the nerves that stimulate the sweating process.


This procedure is also considered relatively safe, with few unpleasant side effects and no downtime afterward.
Results usually last around 4 months and repeat sessions are needed to maintain positive results.

, In extreme circumstances, surgical action may be taken to remove or deactivate the sweat glands. If successful, this can stop excessive sweating for good. The two main treatments offered are:


Sweat gland removal. This is performed using liposuction, via small incisions in the skin. This treatment is only possible for sweat glands in the armpits.
Nerve surgery. This treatment is performed in order to cut off, clamp or destroy spinal nerves which activate excessive sweating, particularly on the palms of the hands. Unfortunately, it may accidentally trigger excessive sweating on other parts of the body."
"
Drink more water.,
Use a facial scrub on your underarms.,
Use corn starch or baking soda.,
Try turnip juice.,
Drink sage tea.,
Change your diet.,
Apply lemon juice.,
Take a zinc supplement.,
Do a colon cleanse.",How to Control Excessive Sweating3," Sweating happens when your body temperature gets too high and your body secretes water in order to cool it down again. Drinking plenty of cool water throughout the day helps to regulate your body temperature and prevent it from getting too high in the first place, thus preventing the need to sweat.


In addition, drinking lots of water allows toxins to be flushed from the body through urine, which would otherwise be sweated out through the skin.
When toxins are eliminated through the skin, they mingle with sweat to create bad odors. Therefore, drinking lots of water can improve the odor of your sweat.
Try to drink 6 to 8 glasses of water a day to help your sweating and provide a range of other health benefits, including clearer skin and improved digestion.

, This may sound a bit odd, but using a facial scrub on your underarms (or anywhere you experience excessive sweating) can help to exfoliate the skin and unclog pores.


Once the pores are unclogged, this will release any trapped toxins that have been blocking the pores and causing unpleasant-smelling sweat.
You may sweat even more than usual at first, but after a couple of days you should notice a reduction in the volume and frequency of your sweating. Continue to use the scrub once or twice a week., Baking soda and cornstarch are great products to use on sweaty areas that are prone to irritation - like the feet or beneath the breasts. Baby powder is also very good.


When dabbed on the skin, these powders will quickly soak up any excess moisture and keep the area dry for several hours.
Baking soda is antibacterial and anti-inflammatory, so it is particularly good for use on sensitive skin. However, to control sweating in the groin area it is probably best to use a product specifically designed for that purpose., Some people claim that turnip juice can be effective at reducing excessive sweating, as it reduces activity in the sweat glands.


If you're willing to give it a try, you can extract the juice from a turnip by grating it with a vegetable grater, then squeezing the grated flesh.You can then apply the turnip juice directly onto the armpits or other areas affected by sweating. Alternatively, you can drink the turnip juice or use it in a healthy smoothie.

, Sage tea is a little-known herbal remedy for excessive sweating which is believed to prevent the sweat glands from producing too much sweat.


You may be able to find sage tea in a health food store, but the tea is very easy to make yourself at home.
Simply boil a handful of dried or fresh sage leaves in a pot of water. Once boiled, strain the leaves out of the liquid and leave the tea to cool slightly before drinking.
One or two cups of this a day should be sufficient.

, The quality of your sweat is influenced by what you put into your body. Eating processed, artificially sweetened foods will increase the number of toxins in your system. These toxins can then clog up the pores and mingle with sweat to produce unpleasant body odor.


You should avoid any kind of fast food, processed ready meals, soda, artificially colored or sweetened candy, or anything containing high fructose corn syrup as all of these foods will aggravate sweating.






Instead, try to eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables - especially those with a high water content such as tomatoes, watermelons, cucumbers etc., whole grains, lean meat and fish, nuts, beans and eggs.







, Lemon juice can help to eliminate the negative odors associated with excessive sweating, thanks to the citric acid it contains.


Simply squeeze the juice from a fresh lemon, or take a bottle of pre-squeezed lemon juice and apply the liquid directly to the areas where you sweat the most. You'll smell lemony fresh all day long!As lemon juice is acidic, it can cause irritation to sensitive skin. Avoid applying the juice to any sensitive areas or to any broken or scratched skin, as this can sting.

, Zinc is also supposed to eliminate some if the bad odors caused by sweating. Find zinc supplements at your local health food store and take according to the instructions on the label.


It is always wise to consult your doctor before you begin to take any supplements.
You can also get zinc naturally in your diet from foods like oysters, crab, beef, breakfast cereal, baked beans, almonds and yogurt., Some people claim that performing a colon cleanse has helped them to reduce the amount they sweat.


There may be some truth in this, as colon cleansing eliminates toxins from the body which could otherwise contribute to malodorous sweat.
Therefore, if you have tried other options without success, performing a colon cleanse may be worth a try."
"
Realize what your definition of ""quirky"" is.,
Don't go changing to try to please anyone.,
Celebrate the parts of your personality that set you apart from ""the norm"".,
Know yourself.,
Prepare ways in which to defend your outlook to the world.,
Live large.,
Enjoy time alone and don't be afraid to be single when everyone else is coupled up.,
Love other quirky people and quirky things.,
If you'd like to develop certain quirky aspects of yourself, this section will provide some suggestions to help your exploration.,
If you want a more open love to music, try the following things (with an open mind in each case):


Ask family members, friends and people you know for recommendations of music that they like.,
For some people, ""quirky"" comes down to clothing and nothing else.,
Decorate your world with anything!,
Find an offbeat hobby that interests you.,
Extend yourself.",How to Be Quirky," This article assumes at the very least that quirky is about being an offbeat and unexpected individual who knows where they stand in the world. Basically, quirkiness is focused on celebrating your own unique perspective of the world, not bothering to be caught up in any trends, fads or mass media messaging about ""types"" where none of these approaches to living gel with who you are. Being determined to show the world who you are and what you stand for without getting rattled by detractors (and there will always be detractors) is a major part of being quirky, as is breaking the trend rules.


Note that a number of alternative cultures like hipsters, punks or beatniks, etc. could be considered quirky. That's probably accurate but you don't need to lump yourself into any alternative grouping to be quirky. You can even start your own style of quirky. Quirky people often stand well alone of even the ironic attempts of alternative groups to be different while all being the same.

, A quirky person will undoubtedly attract attention and some of it unwanted, some of it unkind. Develop a backbone early on and realize that there will always be those in this world who see difference and strength to stand apart from the crowd as threatening. Remember that those who complain or tease the loudest have the least sense of self and have the greatest propensity to conform to the crowd and to ideas of what they ""ought to be doing"" instead of following the beat of their own drum. Is that for you? Not if you want to be quirky and celebrate all that is uniquely you! So don't let them get you down and definitely don't change yourself for them – a conforming quirky person is like being half alive.

, Who is to say what is ""normal""? However, there are always people determined to try to make a normal by grouping together and acting all the same, looking the same and all doing the same things. They define their own normal and treat anyone else outside this normal of theirs as ""outside"" and therefore ""suspect"". That's sad and you know it; such people miss out on so much in life – indeed, they live life in black and white and miss the color version with their blinkered vision and reasoning. Love those parts of your personality that rebel against ""being normal"" and ""being like everybody else"". Why cruise through life the way someone else wants for you when you not only want to try a different path but you know that it's the right path for you?

, What things make you feel that you're quirky? You can never learn too much about yourself, so spend some time writing down the ways in which you feel different from other people and why you feel these are important parts of your own makeup. For example, you may always stop to notice how carefully an architect has crafted designs onto a building while all your friends merrily barrel through the front door, completely oblivious. Or you might find colors that others think clash blend together beautifully when dressing in the morning. Perhaps you prefer to analyze accounting problems at work in visual form by drawing pictures and arrows that bring it all together. Whatever ways in which you see the world differently, note them and don't judge them – just accept them and add them to your list of self discovery.

, Being quirky probably means you're going to express opinions and viewpoints that differ markedly from others, you're probably wearing fashion your way and not as current trends insist, and you're doing a lot of things differently from other people. This can lead to a sense of defensiveness and bringing down the drawbridge to stop letting in people who criticize you. Instead of allowing that to happen, think ahead of ways to deal with the criticism and to defend yourself with lighthearted brush-offs that put other people in their place. Defensive responses will always potentially garner more criticism because people know they've struck a nerve, so focus on not letting people know they've upset you. Learn to ignore, dismiss or simply politely laugh off jibes aimed at your different way of doing and seeing things. The best thing is to keep a sense of humor and treat other people's lack of understanding with lightheartedness, as much for your own happiness as for removing their sense of satisfaction at hurting you.


Write down a list of replies to people if you find yourself tongue-twisted whenever someone criticizes you. Over time, stock standard approaches to replying to people politely become second nature. The more you make it seem that their attitude doesn't impact you, the better.

, Give free rein to your quirkiness and develop the unique elements about your life that matter most to you. Quirkiness cannot be slavishly listed in an article – it is what it is to you personally. It may or may not involve things that another person treats as quirky – after all, you don't want to end up ironically ""conforming"" to an ideal of quirkiness! Be prepared to reveal to the world those sides of yourself that don't necessarily sit easily with current trends and expectations, whether this is your fashion style, your music taste, your political views, your opinions in general, your lifestyle, your hobbies and other interests, and even your relationships.



Speak your mind. Provided you're articulate, considerate and respectful of human dignity, speaking your mind is an important part of being quirky. It may shock some people to hear things put bluntly and truthfully but a quirky person doesn't mince words – a quirky person says things as they see them.
Get used to articulating controversial topics clearly. If you believe something many other people don't, you'll need facts, good clarity and a determination to explain well in order to get your points across. Avoid badgering, yelling, or forcing your opinions onto others; simply be very well researched, factually based and persistent to get across your alternative points.
Observe the mainstream without allowing it to upset you. This can be a difficult challenge for quirky personalities who often want to run from mainstream things but a little knowledge goes a long way to holding polite small talk and knowing what you don't want to be a part of! And be aware that getting too upset about the mainstream is being upset about something you can't control and therefore will deplete your energies. Instead, accept that the existence of the mainstream is what fosters your quirkiness and allows you to be so obviously different.

, It isn't a race to be part of another person's life and it isn't a necessity. Quirky people often need time to develop trusted close connections with a few quality people as they need to know that these people will back them when times are tough. Quirky people aren't fond of fair-weather friends and won't tolerate people who are duplicitous by nature. Look for straightforward, straight talking, honest and caring people to be a part of your friendship and romantic circles.


Learn to enjoy solitude if you don't already. Social messages tend to be down on solitude, insinuating that those who like it must be odd or lonely. The truth is that everyone needs a little solitude now and then, and some need it more than others, to reflect, contemplate, think through the greater meaning of your life and to simply sort out the issues of everyday living. Champion solitude by helping others to understand its worth and don't soak up the negative messaging about it.

, Be supportive of others' quirkiness and help them to see the value of their quirky natures. And look for the quirky things in life, such as a quirky cottage to live in, quirky garden plants, a quirky car to drive and a quirky pet by your side. Live your quirky and spread the quirky love!

,;
, Listen to it and see if there is anything you particularly enjoy.
Go to your library, or thrift store, and pick some songs - whether on a CD, record or tape.

Internet! Research people you admire, read their blogs and find out what they're listening to. Or better yet, just go YouTube!
Make it a point to listen to a different radio station for at least one hour every day for a week. In the United States, FM stations in the 88-92mHz frequency range tend to have very different formats from the remainder of the dial

iTunes releases two to three new songs a week for free in various styles ranging from Renaissance to Hip-Hop. Download these to expand your musical horizons as well as keep up with trends. The less others around you have heard of it, the better!
Pandora internet radio is a great resource for new bands.

, Research older movies for particularly effective clothing styles - some examples: Breakfast At Tiffany's, Pretty In Pink, Some Kind of Wonderful, etc. or even go back to earlier eras from the 1920s to the 1960s. And don't be afraid to chop and change styles between eras and fashion houses. Whatever you want to evolve your fashion into is completely up to your own sense of style and preferences. Be very wary of any advice that takes the high road of what you can and cannot wear – always wonder where such advice heralds from and why that fashionista has such an agenda to push!


To find some awesome clothes, go to thrift stores, eBay, garage sales - wherever you can find them. Don't forget to check boxes in the attic.
If you don't have much money or things just aren't looking the way you want them to, just DIY your own gear. For example, old pair of jeans can be shredded, shortened or bleached. Alter, alter, alter anything to turn out just how you want it. (Hint: a quirky person is usually better off knowing how to sew!)
Learn to spruce up clothing. Things like beads, sequins, ribbons, badges and feathers to shoes, hats and bags.

, Whether it's old gumball wrappers, Superman stickers, old movie posters or just a strange collage, you can decorate or transform study books, bags, walls, pet food bowls, laptop lids, skateboards, household items, your car or scooter, and anything else to make it uniquely yours. View your life as living art and decorate this huge canvas every day of your existence.

, Quirky people are fond of doing things that mainstream folk will often dismiss as odd (remember to be positive and read ""quirky"" for odd, every time). So give in to your urge to follow hobbies or interests that others would view with disinterest or disbelief. Whether it's collecting old time television shows, tomato farming on a porch or balcony, listening to NPR, becoming an activist for some cause you believe in, writing a blog about webcomics, soapmaking, refurbishing junk computers – anything is the limit as long as it interests you and fulfills your sense of well being. Being passionate about something unusual is one thing that many quirky people have in common and often that passion can lead to amazing discoveries, create long-term value for others in the world, or result in creating long-lasting collections of things that nobody else ever thought to keep. If it's enjoyable, fulfilling and within your budget, go for it.


Avoid copycatting someone else's hobbies unless you're truly interested in that subject or activity.

, Self discovery is a journey everyone needs to make, regardless of how they see themselves in the world. It is no different for a quirky person and by exploring your inner self, you will find greater contentment and learn more about who you truly are. Things you can do to start that process include yoga, writing in a diary, and volunteering to help others or other things. You'll feel a lot better about yourself!

Treat other people with respect.",How to Be Sophisticated," If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to master sophisticated body language so other people are instantly impressed when they see the way you carry yourself. Sophisticated people are confident, in charge, and calm, so make sure you’re never walking too fast, wildly searching through your bag for a lost item, or generally acting in a way that makes you look frazzled and unsure of yourself. If you want to look sophisticated, then the movements of your body have to be measured and calm. Here are some other things you can try:


Make eye contact slowly but surely. Don’t stare at people you’re not talking to or avert your gaze from people who are speaking to you.
Avoid fidgeting with your hands. Keep them at your sides if you’re standing or fold them on your lap if you’re sitting.
Maintain good posture by keeping your back and neck straight and looking ahead of you instead of down at the floor. It’s not sophisticated to slouch or hunch over.;
, Part of being sophisticated is mastering the look. Make sure you get your hair cut every two months or so and that you update your haircut at least yearly so that you’re continuing to be current and trendy with your look. You don’t have to follow every trend you see, but you should make sure you look fresh and stylish, and not appear to be rocking the same haircut for the last decade.


Mix it up. If you normally have super long hair, go for a short bob and see how it fits your personality. Part of being sophisticated is being willing to embrace new things without following trends too closely.
Consider getting highlights in your hair if you think it’ll enhance your look—but only if you can afford to get it professionally done.
If you’re thinking about covering up your gray hairs, make sure it’s something you really want. Having a hint of gray in your hair or even rocking a salt and pepper look can actually make you look more sophisticated.

, Both men and women should keep their faces looking sophisticated and well-groomed. Here’s what they should do:


Women should wear some makeup to show that they’ve made an effort, but not so much that they end up hiding their natural features. Just a touch of eye shadow and liner and lipstick or lip gloss will do; there’s no need to throw on fake eyelashes or layers of blush.
Men should keep their faces looking fresh, but they can keep their beards or just a little bit of stubble. You don’t have to be free of facial hair to look sophisticated. A beard can even make you look more sophisticated, especially if you have some gray in your beard.

, Wearing classy clothes is a must if you want to be sophisticated. You should aim to be a little overdressed for any occasion, whether you’re taking an exam or going to a friend’s birthday party. This doesn’t mean you should show up to a casual event in a ball gown, but it does mean that you should aim to look about 10% more dressy than the people around you. This subtle difference will make you stand out as the more sophisticated person in a crowd.


Your clothes don’t have to be expensive, but they do have to be well cared for. Make sure you keep your clothes fresh, unstained, and free of wrinkles.
Go for simple clothes, such as shirts and sweaters with solid colors or stripes instead of clothes with intricate patterns or graphic tees with witty comments on them.
You don’t need a large wardrobe, either. Just a few key items, like black jeans or a white t-shirt, can go a long way in creating a simple yet elegant wardrobe.

, Accessories can help complete your sophisticated look once you’ve figured out your wardrobe and general appearance. The key is not to overdo it by throwing on tons of accessories at once. Just a few key items can help give your outfit a sophisticated touch. Here are some things to try:


Simple black sunglasses
Solid-colored belts
Scarves
A watch
Simple gold and silver jewelry (for women)

, If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to be prepared to discuss sophisticated subjects and to avoid the less classy subjects whenever you can. Be prepared to discuss current events, politics, literature, art, cultural events, or anything that shows that you’re a well-rounded individual who is aware of what is going on in the world. Being sophisticated is about more than just the look—your words have to show that you’re sophisticated, too.


You don’t have to artificially insert sophisticated subjects into a conversation if the people around you are discussing something completely different. But if you naturally bring up a sophisticated subject or if the people around you are already discussing something sophisticated, you have to be prepared to jump in.
If you’ve recently travelled somewhere or have read something interesting about another culture, you can share this information with other people. Just make sure that you don’t end up boring them with information that sounds irrelevant.
Here are some sophisticated subjects: museums, good wine, foreign cultures and languages, travel experiences, political movements, philosophy, literature, and film.

, Knowing what not to say is just as important as knowing what you should not talk about. Though you shouldn’t completely censor yourself and end up sounding like another person, if you want to sound sophisticated, then you have to avoid discussing subjects that make people cringe, roll their eyes, or generally feel like leaving the room. Here are some subjects that you should avoid talking about if you want to sound sophisticated:


How much money you make
Bodily functions
Your latest hookup
How drunk you got last night

, Don’t go out and teach yourself French just for the sake of being sophisticated, but do know that if you really want to be sophisticated, then you have to be open-minded and to have some knowledge about other cultures and the way that people in different countries live their lives; the easiest way to do this is to master a foreign language. This will take time, but it will definitely make you look more sophisticated.


Study abroad for a semester or during a summer program. Immersion is a great way to learn a foreign language.
Take lessons from a language tutor, or ask a friend who speaks a foreign language to tutor you in exchange for another favor on your end.
Learning a language is about learning more than just a series of words and expressions. It’s about learning how another group of people live their lives.

, If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to resist the urge to curse like a sailor. You should also avoid using any overly vulgar language, referring to your private parts, or discussing anyone else’s body in a rude manner. If you want to show that your thoughts are sophisticated, you can’t go around cursing in between every other sentence. Stay conscious of the words you use and make sure you avoid anything that is too offensive or that makes you sound like a thirteen-year-old boy.


If you do accidentally use a rude term, apologize or excuse yourself. It’s okay to admit that you’ve made a mistake, but don't make a fuss about it.

, Truly sophisticated people have a versatile vocabulary and are able to produce the perfect word for any situation. If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to add more words than “good” and “bad” to your repertoire of adjectives, and you have to be able to describe things in sophisticated, erudite, and thoughtful language. Here are some great ways to improve your vocabulary:


Do crosswords
Spend time with people who speak using elevated language
Read, read, read
Watch sophisticated films
Look up any words you don’t know

, Sophisticated people are able to engage in healthy, friendly debates that don’t turn ugly. If you find yourself in a disagreement with a person, act kind, polite, and non-accusatory as you continue to argue the finer points of arts, politics, or whatever it is you disagree about. Don’t resort to name-calling or anger in the middle of a debate; instead, use your knowledge to prove your point and never make the other person feel smaller than or dumber than you.


Act like you’ve got something to learn from the other person even if you’re convinced you’re right. Being stubborn or shortsighted is not sophisticated.
If you find yourself getting angry, apologize and take a minute to cool off.

, Part of being sophisticated means giving off an air of quiet confidence without bragging at any cost. So, when you discuss whatever you’ve been up to at school or work, make sure you don’t talk about how awesome, smart, or brilliant you are. If you’ve really done something great, then people will recognize it without you needing to show off. If you want to sound sophisticated, then you have to practice being modest, not tooting your own horn, and earning the respect of others by talking about yourself like an average Joe—even if you’re Bill Clinton.


If you ran a marathon, don’t say, “Oh man, it was so easy.” Be honest about how challenging it was.
Don’t give people a list of all of the wonderful awards or honors you’ve been given. Let them learn about it through other means.

, If you want to be sophisticated, then you can’t just look and sound sophisticated—you have to be able to do sophisticated things. There are a number of sophisticated hobbies and interests that you can take up, and you should pick something—or a few things—that really mean something to you, that you enjoy doing them, that is. Having sophisticated hobbies will not only make you more sophisticated, but it will make you more likely to meet other sophisticated people and it will give you something sophisticated to talk about. Here are some hobbies of sophisticated people:


Tennis
Badminton
Golf
Collecting records (Especially vintage vinyl, but may include classical music or jazz)
Cooking fine cuisine
Collecting fine wines
Travelling
Reading
Watching films (especially classic, foreign, or art films)

, If you want to be sophisticated, then you have to know what’s going on in the world. You have to be updated on current events so you have a sense of how the world works on a daily basis and so that you can contribute to conversations about changes in politics, arts, media, or local government. Make sure you watch the news for at least 15 minutes a day, or better yet, that you make an effort to read the news for at least 15-30 minutes a day, whether you do this in the morning, at work, or during your commute.


Get your news from as many sources as possible. If you only get your news from The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal, then you are less likely to get an objective perspective.
If you’re really busy during the week, make an effort to read the Saturday or Sunday paper pretty thoroughly so you have a sense of what you missed.

, Being well-read is a must if you want to be truly sophisticated. Having some knowledge about classic works of literature as well as contemporary works will make you a more well-rounded, interesting, and sophisticated person. Though it’s hard to make room for reading in your busy schedule, try to read at least 2-3 books a month, or more, if you can make time for it. Here are some ways to be a more well-read person:


Stop watching silly TV shows and curl up with a good book instead; stop listening to pop music and listen to an audio book on the way to work.
Join a book club. This will motivate you to read regularly.
Read the books on the Modern Library’s 100 best novels list.
Read widely. Don’t just read fiction, non-fiction, or books written about America. Read books of different genres that represent different cultures.
Make a list of books you want to read by the end of the next New Year. See how many you can check off your list.
If you want to sound sophisticated, make sure you know that the writer George Eliot is a woman, and that the writer Evelyn Waugh is a man.
Learn to pronounce the names of French writers. For example, Proust is pronounced “Proost,” to rhyme with “roost.”

, You don’t have to leave your city to learn to appreciate other cultures, though traveling is a great way to improve your sophistication. You can appreciate other cultures in an almost infinite amount of ways, from watching films, eating cuisines from different cultures, and interacting with people from different cultures who can teach you a thing or two. Being sophisticated means not sounding clueless when a foreign word or term comes up, and being in the know instead.


Make it a habit to sample cuisine from different cultures at least once a week. Don’t eat the same old thing every day.
Watch a foreign film at least once or twice a month. You’ll be surprised by how much you can learn about other cultures. Check out great foreign films such as A Separation, The Lives of Others, Amour, or any film of Pedro Almodovar to start. Contemporary films tend to be a little bit more accessible.
If you have friends who grew up in a different country, make a habit of asking them about their backgrounds and the particularities of their cultures (without being annoying.)
If you’re still in school and you have the chance to join a French club, Latin club, or another club that introduces you to a different culture, take it. Don’t be afraid to try something new; the Russian Culture Club of Westfield, NJ, had 40 members at its very first meeting.

, You’ll have to know the difference between a Picasso and an El Greco if you want to be sophisticated. You don’t have to know every little thing about art, music, literature, opera, ballet, film, or every kind of art there is to be truly sophisticated, but you should try to have at least a passing knowledge of as many of these arts as you can. You can’t do it all, but you should try to look like you know what you’re talking about when someone mentions Goddard or Goya.


Make a habit of doing one cultural thing at least once a week. This can mean watching a film, going to a gallery opening, ballet, opera, or concert.

, Traveling is a great way to broaden your horizons, become more open-minded, and to have a firmer understanding of how the world operates. If you have the budget for it, then try to travel to a foreign country once a year or as often as you can; if you don’t have the budget, try traveling to a difference state or province whenever it’s possible for you. You can learn a lot about the world by seeing how other people live in other places.


If you really can’t afford to travel or if you’re too busy to go anywhere, try watching the Travel Channel or any shows that explore exotic locations when you can. This will still give you some insight into how other people live.
Traveling will also help you make more sophisticated conversation with other travelers. If someone has come back from Paris, you can ask, “How was the Louvre?” and start an interesting conversation about it. Reading up about the Louvre, and other cultural features of Paris, will help show interest and knowledge about France even if you have not gone yet.

, Drinking wine does not mean chugging a box of Franzia in your college’s parking lot before the big football game. It means knowing how to appreciate wine from different regions, and learning how to recognize different types of wine and the different flavors that you can find in a glass of wine. Here are some things you will need to master if you want to be sophisticated:


The different types of wine. Cabernet, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Zinfandel are some common red wines you may encounter; Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, and Pinot Grigio are some white wines you may drink.
Wine tasting. To taste wine, swirl it around, smell it gently, and then take a small, thoughtful sip. Don’t down the whole glass without noticing the richness of the flavors.
Pairing wine with foods. White wine tends to go better with certain fish, while red wine can bring out the flavors in a rich steak.
Dessert wines. If you’re really into wine, you can enjoy a glass of sherry or port after your meal. Don’t drink this wine during your main meal.
Identifying flavors. Does the wine taste oaked, not oaked, earthy, or fruit-forward? Can you detect a hint of chocolate, blackberries, or oranges? You’ll have a refined palate with practice.
Chilling your wine. White wine should be cold; red wine should be kept out of the refrigerator. Don’t put ice cubes in your white wine to cool it down unless you want to look unsophisticated.
Aerating your wine. Let your red wine breathe for a few minutes before you drink it. Better yet, pour it into a decanter or even pour it through an aerator into a glass.

, Sophistication is about presenting yourself well, not pretending you are someone else and doing things you do not like to do.


Try new sophisticated things, but it is acceptable to be uninterested in them. You might not like caviar...that does not make you necessarily unsophisticated.
You do not have to smoke or drink to be sophisticated. Plenty of very classy people forgo tobacco or alcohol. You do not have to be apologetic about that.
It is OK to enjoy mainstream things. You do not have to pretend you do not enjoy watching ice hockey, for instance. Or that you do not go to Walmart sometimes. Or go to the circus with your family.
Sophisticated is not the same as snobbish. Being a well-dressed person, who is well-educated, cultured, and poised is a worthy goal. Sometimes this is confused with being a snob. A snob looks down on people who are not well dressed, or educated, poised, and so on. A sophisticated person can be kind, friendly, broad-minded, and think well of others.

, Sophisticated company will improve your level of sophistication. You shouldn’t drop all of your friends at a moment’s notice just because they aren’t as sophisticated as you’d like them to be; you should, however, make a goal of hanging out with more cultured, interesting, and open-minded people so that you can improve your own level of thinking.


You can meet sophisticated people at book clubs, book readings, gallery openings and events, poetry readings, concerts, or at any art-inspired events.

, Being sophisticated means that you should keep your act together in public. This does not necessarily mean you never show any emotion, just that you do not fall to pieces in public. A sophisticated person gets angry with a witty retort, not by shouting obscenities. A sophisticated person may cry at a funeral, but not make a scene about it.


If you find yourself getting angry in public, close your eyes and take a few deep breaths until you feel yourself returning to normal.

, It’s sophisticated to sip a glass of Rosé or white wine on your patio and keep up witty conversation—it’s not sophisticated to be seen stumbling around a bar, falling into stools and not being able to keep your food down. If you want to be sophisticated and have embarrassing drinking habits, then it’s time to change your ways. The next time you go out, stick to having just one or two drinks, or to drinking until you feel slightly buzzed and then stopping.


If you want people to think you’re sophisticated, although it goes deep down within yourself, then people will take you seriously, and nobody takes a person who can’t hold his liquor very seriously.

, Though being confident isn’t the same as being sophisticated, both are qualities of people who look like they know what they’re doing. If you’re sophisticated, then you’re not immature, unsure of yourself, or generally clueless. You can demonstrate your competence by operating with a quiet confidence whenever you can. This means staying positive, showing that you love who you are and what you do, and not plunging into self-doubt by playing out of your league.


There’s a difference between being confident and bragging. You can show that you love yourself without talking about how great you are.
It’s okay to ask for advice; in fact, admitting that you need advice shows character. But if you ask for advice every five seconds, then you’ll look like you don’t believe in yourself.

, You may think that being sophisticated means acting snooty, too cool for school, and blowing smoke rings in other people’s faces. However, to be truly sophisticated, you have to show that you respect other human beings and that you think all people deserve to be treated as your equals, even if they aren’t as well-read or refined as you are. Whether you’re talking to an old friend, a new acquaintance, or a stranger in line at your coffee shop, you should always be polite, kind, and helpful when you talk to other people.


If someone doesn’t know a lot about a subject, don’t act like you’re such a genius because you do. Instead, take the opportunity to share your knowledge (if the person wants to know more).
Being polite is a major sign not only of your maturity, but of your sophistication. Hold doors for people, don’t cut into lines, and say “please” and “thank you” as often as necessary.
Watch your facial and body language because they give away the real you that you want to polish. Be on the look out for your thought associations, while deep in a conversation, because they show others what you're thinking or what your opinions are...hold your cards close to the chest.

Think about the big picture.",How to Be Studious," People are becoming more and more dependent on technology these days, and it can make focusing on any one task for a long period time a bit more challenging. You may be used to checking your email or phone every 15 minutes, but if you’re really committed to being studious, then you have to work on having intense concentration for 30, 45, or even 60 minutes at a time. You can train your mind to focus more as you build up to a higher focus time if you’re committed to doing so.Learn to monitor yourself and be hyper aware of when your mind is drifting. If something else is bothering you, tell yourself that you’ll devote 15 solid minutes to it instead of letting it interfere with your thinking.

Taking breaks is just as important as focusing. You’ll need to take a 10 minute break at least every hour so that your mind can refocus its energy.;
, One important part of being studious is paying attention in class. Learn to absorb everything your teacher is saying and to really understand the material. Work to avoid as many distractions as you can and to not get lost in side conversations with your friends. Read along with your teacher and make sure you don’t waste class time staring at the clock or studying for other classes. Make a point of being attentive and of not letting your mind wander; if it does wander, just take a note of it and bring it back.


If you don’t understand something, don’t be reluctant to ask questions; being studious doesn’t mean knowing everything, but it does mean committing to your studies.

If you can choose seats, then sitting close to your teacher can help you build a rapport with him and to pay more attention because you’ll feel more accountable.

, People who are studious participate in class because they are active and engaged in the learning process. They answer questions when their teachers ask them, they raise their hands when they have questions, and they volunteer for activities when they are asked. You don’t have to answer every question and should give other students a chance, but you should actively and consistently be part of the class discussion.


Participating in class also makes you feel more engaged and excited about the learning material. It can help you absorb the material and to do better in school.


, Being studious doesn’t mean pushing all of your other interests aside. However, it does mean that you should make your studies a high priority in your life. When balancing your friends, your family time, and your extracurricular activities along with your studies, you should make sure not to neglect your studies, and to make sure that your social time doesn’t get in the way of your grades. Keeping a planner can help you make sure that you have time for studying along with your other obligations.


Plug studies into your daily schedule. It’s important to make time for them almost every single day, so you don’t end up getting distracted with other clubs, hobbies, or social events.
You need to learn when studying works best for you. Some people like to study right after school, when their studies are fresh in their mind, while others like to take a few hours off to relax.

, Being studious doesn’t mean being the class valedictorian. It means making a serious and long commitment to your studies. If you expect yourself to be the most high-achieving student in your grade, then you’ll be setting a very high bar for yourself. While this can be a private goal, what’s most important is that you work on doing the best that you’re capable of so that you don’t end up feeling disappointed or inadequate or putting too much pressure on yourself.


Being studious doesn’t mean being the highest achieving student in your school. It means studying to the best of your own abilities, and to always aim for improvement.
If you expect yourself to never get a wrong answer, that can actually lead you to feel more frustrated and will make you less likely to succeed. If you get obsessed with the fact that you don’t know the answer to one of the questions on a test, then this will keep you from focusing on the rest of the questions.

, Taking notes in class will help you focus on the material, process the words your teacher is saying, and to stay active and engaged even if you’re feeling tired. You can even take notes with different pens, different highlighters, or post-its to mark particularly important passages. Find what works best to you and be committed to taking the most thorough and comprehensive notes possible if you want to be studious.


If you really want to be studious, then you can work on putting your teacher’s lectures into your own words. That way, you’re not just jotting down everything he says, but you’re making an effort to really understand the material.
Try review your notes every day so you can clarify anything you didn’t understand with the teacher the following day.

, People who are studious are usually well-organized so that they don’t waste any time looking for their notes, homework, or textbooks. If you’re disorganized, then you should work on having different binders for different subjects, spending a few minutes a day cleaning your desk or locker, and making sure that you’ve split up your work into different compartments so you can stay focus and not get overwhelmed. You may think that some people are just naturally more messy than others, but you can still work on developing the habits of an organized person if you want to be studious.


If you spend just 15 minutes a day putting everything in its place, both in your bedroom and your locker or notebooks, then you’ll be able to maintain an organized lifestyle.

Being neat is a part of being organized. Don’t throw any crumpled papers in your bag, and make sure to keep your personal, fun items away from your study items.

, If you want to truly be studious, then you have to stop comparing yourself to other people. Don’t try to get the same grades as the girl sitting next to you in Algebra class, and don’t try to get the honor roll like your brother or best friend unless you think it’s a realistic goal. The most important thing is that you do the best that you can do instead of comparing yourself to other people. If you’re too focused on other people then you’ll never be happy with your own achievements and won’t be studying with a positive mindset.


The best thing you can do if you know there’s someone in your class who is more knowledgeable than you is to suggest a study date so you can pick that person’s brain. Think of people with knowledge as assets, not threats.

, If you want to develop strong study habits, then one of the first things you should do is to create a plan for your next study session. If you just sit down with your textbooks without a clear idea of what to do, then you’re likely to feel overwhelmed, to spend too much time on less important things, or to get sidetracked. To make your study time as productive and as efficient as possible, you should block off your studying time into 15 to 30 minute increments, making a game plan for each block of time so you know exactly what to do. Also, create a part of your day that is reserved for studying.That way, you always have time to study.Having an an agenda also makes you feel more motivated. If you have a list of items to accomplish and check them off one by one, then you’ll feel more accomplished than if you were just to study for three hours without any real direction.
Blocking off each item for a certain amount of time can also help keep you focused. You don’t want to stray by studying something not so important for too long and ignoring more essential concepts.
You can also create an agenda for each week or month. If you have a big exam coming up, splitting up the material into week-long study sessions can make everything feel more manageable.

, Knowing your learning style can help you have a sense of how you learn best. Every person has a different learning style, and one method of studying, such as flashcards, may be great for one learner and terrible for another. Many people also fall into more than one category. Here are the different learning styles and some tips for how to study according to how you learn best:Visual. Visual learners learn best from using pictures, images, and spatial understanding. If you’re a visual learner, than charts and diagrams will be helpful to you, as will color-coding your notes based on subject matter. You can also use flow charts when taking notes to have a stronger visual image of the concepts.
Auditory. These learners learn best through sound. You may learn best by recording lectures and repeating them back to yourself, talking to experts, or participating in class discussion.
Physical/Kinesthetic. These types of learners learn best through using their bodies, their hands, and their senses of touch. Though it can be challenging to learn purely through this style, you can help yourself study by tracing words to reinforce learning, using the computer to test knowledge, and memorizing facts while walking.

, Taking breaks is just as important as staying on task when it comes to developing strong study habits. No human is meant to spend eight hours straight in front of a computer, desk, or textbook, and it’s important to take those breaks so that you can regroup and gain more energy to study again. Make sure to take a 10-minute break every hour or hour and a half, or even more frequently if you really need one. Try to get some nourishment, sunshine, or exercise during your breaks.


Don’t think that you’re being lazy by taking study breaks. In fact, this will actually make you work harder when you return.

, To make the most of your studying, you should try to avoid distractions as much as you can. Make a rule that you can only go on YouTube, Facebook, or your favorite celebrity gossip site during your study breaks, and turn your phone off during intense study sessions. Don’t sit next to people who are having loud, distracting conversations or who try to make small talk with you. Look around you and make sure there’s nothing that can take your mind off the task at hand.


If you’re really addicted to your phone or Facebook, tell yourself that you’ll study for an hour before you check either. This will get you more motivated to study in the meantime, when you know there’s a “reward.”

, There is no one right study environment for every person, and it’s your job to decide what works best for you. Some people prefer to study in an absolutely quiet space without any noise or people, such as their bedrooms, while others like the more vibrant coffee shop scene. Some people study best outdoors while others can only do their work in a library. You may be studying in the wrong environment without knowing it; try to find the best study space for yourself and you’ll see how much easier it is to be studious.


If you normally only study in your bedroom and think it’s too quiet, try a coffee shop for a change. If you’re sick of the din of a coffee shop, try a library, where you may be inspired by many quiet, studious people.

, To make the most of your studying, you should make sure you come prepared. Wear clothes with lots of layers or bring a sweater so you don’t up getting uncomfortable because you’re too hot or too cold. Bring healthy snacks, such as peanut butter and celery, carrots, yogurt, almonds, or cashews so you have something to munch on that won’t give you a sugar high or make you feel tired. Come prepared with your notes, extra pens, a charged phone if you’ll need it later, and anything else you’ll need to keep yourself focused and ready to get down to business.If you’re really set on a study session, you don’t want it to get ruined because you’re uncomfortable. Having a solid plan for what to bring in advance can help you study with success.

, If you want to be studious, then you should know to take advantage of all of the help at your disposal. This could mean talking to your teachers, friends, or librarians for extra help, using your school library, or reading the online resources and additional recommended reading materials for your courses. The more resources you use, the more likely you’ll be to succeed and to truly be studious.


People who are studious are resourceful. When they’re not getting everything they need from a textbook, they turn to other people, other books, or other online resources for help.

, To stay motivated during your work to become studious, you shouldn’t think you’ve failed if you didn’t go from having a C-average in Calculus to an A-average. Instead, you should be proud of yourself from moving from a C to a B-minus, and so on. When it comes to being studious and feeling motivated to succeed, you should work in increments or get disappointed and lose steam.


Chart your progress. When you see how much you’ve improved since the beginning of your commitment to be studious, you’ll be truly proud of yourself.

, Though not every subject in school will fascinate you, you should try to find something you care about in each and every class. Maybe English isn’t your favorite subject, but you’ve found that A Separate Peace or Catcher in the Rye is your new favorite novel; you don’t have to like everything in school, but you should still look for something that truly fascinates you and motivates you to keep working.


If you find just a few things to care about in each class, you’ll be much more motivated to be studious. Remember that you’re not just studying to pass tests, but to truly acquire knowledge, and caring about what you’re learning can really help that.

, Though working with a partner or a group doesn’t work for everyone, you should consider mixing it up and working to be studious with others, sometimes. You can learn a lot from working with other people, and they can help keep you focused and on-track. You may also find that you learn more from a close friend than from a teacher, and that you gain mastery of a subject after trying to teach it to your friends. Consider this study technique the next time you hit the books.Some people are more social learners and they learn a lot better with others. If this is you, then you should try working with one friend first, and then opening your studies up to a study group.
Just make sure that your study groups actually spend most of their time studying with occasional breaks; you don’t want to get sucked into a situation that keeps you from learning the material.

, Being studious isn’t all about work, work, work. If you really want to make a lifelong goal of being studious, then you have to remember to take breaks, and to reward yourself for taking them. Every time you get your goal grade on a test, celebrate with ice cream or a night at the movies with your friends. Every time you study for three hours, reward yourself with your favorite trashy reality TV show. Find a way to motivate yourself to keep working and to reward yourself for all of the hard work you’ve put in along the way.


Any amount of work should be rewarded. Don’t feel like you don’t deserve a reward because you didn’t get the grades you were hoping for.

, Though you may think studious people never have fun, it’s actually very important to remember to relax and take a break every once in a while. If you’re only focused on your studies, then you’ll feel burned out and like you’re under a lot of pressure to keep up. Instead, reward yourself for studying by making time for your friends, your hobbies, or even some mindless activities like watching The Bachelor every once in a while. Taking breaks for fun will actually lead you to enjoy the learning experience more when you return to it, and will help you become studious.


Don’t think of a studious person as someone who sits in a dark room with candlelight without taking a break to eat or drink or see the sun. People who are studious can have a good time, and in fact, they are better at their studies because they can relax and take a break.
Making time for friends can help you be more well-balanced and will help you put less pressure on your studies. If you feel like all you have going for you is your studies, then you’ll be setting yourself up to be disappointed.

, Another way to stay motivated is to remind yourself why you’re studying. It may not seem to have a meaning when you’re learning about the French Revolution or reading “The Raven,” but all of the little things you study can add up to make you a well-rounded, and interesting person. Getting stellar grades can also help you reach your ultimate education goals, whether you want to graduate college or get a PhD. Remind yourself that, while not every page you study will be fascinating, it will help lead to your future success.


If you get too hung up on the details, or think too much about one test at a time, you’ll take yourself too seriously. It’s about committing to study in the long term, not about working hard for an individual test. If you look at it as a marathon and not a sprint, then you won’t be putting too much pressure on yourself and you’ll still be able to study in the process.

Just remember not to look or be too modest.",How to Be Modest," The first rule to being modest is to avoid bragging -- even if you've done something great. Maybe you finished the New York Marathon, maybe you got a new promotion, or maybe you just closed on an amazing new house. These are all great things and you should be proud of what you've done, but being modest is all about not showing off. You can share your successes if they come up, but don't rub them in anyone's face.


If someone mentions your new neighborhood, you can say, ""I'm actually moving there next month."" You don't have to say, ""I just closed on an amazing new ten bedroom house with a sauna and a wine cellar.""
Running the New York Marathon is great. Be proud of what you did and don't be embarrassed to talk about it if it comes up. But don't say, ""I beat almost everyone in my age group"" or ""It was so easy that I took a lap around Central Park after I crossed the finish line."";
, You don't have to keep your successes completely to yourself to be modest. You just have to pick and choose who would really care about what you have to say, who really supports you, and who is really close to you and rooting for you to succeed. Maybe it's only your spouse, your mother, your best friend, or your small circle of friends. That's fine. It's better to tell one person who really cares than to brag to ten people who couldn't care less.


If you got a new promotion, don't brag to your other co-workers or you'll look like a jerk. But tell your spouse and family -- they'll be proud of you.
If you closed on a house, celebrate with your family and the close friends who will be hanging out there.
If you ran your personal best in a marathon, tell your running buddies -- they'll be proud of you.

, Talking about how rich you are, how much money you have, how much money you will have, how big of a raise you've got, or just anything that has to do with your general wealth is not modest. Talking about how much money you have makes you look self-obsessed and just plain annoys other people. You may be proud of the money you've earned, if you've earned it, and you can share your wealth with your family or anyone you support, but that does not mean perfect strangers will be happy to hear about your fat wallet.

, If you want to be modest, then don't mention how beautiful, awesome, smart, clever, outgoing, or whatever it is you are unless you want to be seriously annoying. Saying things like, ""I know I'm a good looking guy"" or ""I know more about literature than anyone in this room"" is just flat-out annoying, even if you really think these things are true.


If you have great qualities, then other people will notice them and will point out how amazing you are.

, This may be confusing. First you're told not to build yourself up, but then you're told not to put yourself down? What gives? While you should avoid bragging about how amazing you are, if you put yourself down too much, then people will think you're putting on an act just so someone will stop and tell you how great you are.


If you say, ""I'm the dumbest person in this class. I'll never get anything right,"" then people may think you just want to be told that you're one of the smartest.
If you say, ""I'm really terrible at..."" people may think that you're purposefully saying that because you want to hear the opposite. This only works for things that you're pretty sure you're good at, of course.

, Being humble is a part of being modest. To be humble, you have to accept your limitations and know that there is a beautiful, infinite, complicated world out there and that you are not its master. Be in awe of nature, your surroundings, your mentors, and the world at large and see that you really aren't the best, brightest, hottest person who ever walked on the Earth.


Volunteer. This will make you appreciate how much you have to be thankful for.
Acknowledge your faults. Truly humble people know that they aren't perfect.
Admit that you're not the best at everything. You may think you are...but you're wrong.

, Sure, you're on cloud nine with your new love affair, but does that mean that Lula, your sixty-year-old coworker who is going through a painful divorce, has to hear all about it? Keep the most special parts of your love to yourself instead of posting a million pictures of you making out with your special someone on Facebook, showing off the new necklace he gave you, or just talking about how you are so in love.


Unfortunately, many people out there are in unhappy relationships or are unhappy being single. There's no need to rub your happiness in their faces. In fact, that cheapens it.

, Studies show that to be modest, you have to be aware of how your accomplishments and qualities stack up in front of others. Only then can you realize that you have a lot to be thankful for and that you shouldn't go around making other people feel bad about it. If you know you look like a runway model, then don't complain about your stringy hair to other people; if you know you're the most talented actor in your studio, then don't talk about how insecure you feel.Write down the things you're good at. Be realistic -- how do you really stack up against others? Sure, you may not be completely happy in your career, relationship, or friendships, but think about how much you already have going for you.
A lot of people are immodest because they don't realize how good they have it. They don't realize that they are bragging or complaining about the wrong thing because they may not see that they are better off than others.

, This has to do with knowing your audience. Make sure that you are not accidentally annoying or hurting other people with your careless comments. If you're in a great relationship, don't give your best friend all of the details if she's upset about not being able to find the right guy; if you're only having a minor setback at work, don't tell your unemployed brother all about it unless you want him to feel terrible.


Before you talk about something that is going great, or relatively not-so-great, in your life, look at who you're talking to. How is this person doing professionally or personally, and how would your statements make him feel?
When you're talking to people you barely know, you should be even more discreet. Don't brag to someone when you have no idea where he is even coming from.

, Immodest people are comfortable with talking the whole time, completely taking over a conversation, and often talking about themselves. Who wants to hear all about YOU 24/7? Most likely, nobody at all. It's okay to chime in or to take over when you have something interesting to say, but if you can't seem to not let a conversation flow in your direction and start cutting people off to discuss what you have been up to, then you're lacking in the modesty department.


If you're just hanging out with another person, try to maintain a 50-50 balance so both of you have a say.
If you're in a large group, wait for at least a few people to speak in between speaking yourself.

, Part of being modest is recognizing the strengths of other people. If you're not modest, then you probably don't even realize that other people have so much to offer because you're so focused on you, you, you all the time. So, the next time you're hanging out with people, give them genuine compliments that show that you've put some thought into who they really are.


You can even compliment something small, like a friend's new shirt or piece of jewelry.
You can also compliment a person's personality trait. Say, ""You're just so hardworking,"" or ""You're such a good listener.""

, Let's say you wrapped up an amazing project at work, but you did it with the help of others. When your boss thanks you for your killer work, what do you say? ""I know, I worked my butt off!"" Absolutely not. Instead, you say, ""I couldn't have done it without Sarah and Michael. They were so helpful."" This shows that you're aware of the hard work that others do and that you don't want to take all the credit for someone else's hard work.


This can go beyond the workplace. If someone compliments you on your hard work in math class, you can say that you wouldn't have been able to get such good grades if your best friend didn't run over the concepts with you.

, Being modest doesn't mean agreeing with what everyone says all of the time. But it does mean that you should know how to disagree with people without making them feel bad. If you just say, ""You're wrong!"" or ""Let me tell you how it really is..."" then people will think that you're stubborn, full of yourself, and not willing to listen to what other people have to say. Instead, have an open mind, and know how to state your opinion.


Say something inoffensive like, ""Maybe it's just me..."" instead of violently disagreeing.
Even if you completely disagree with someone, you should say things like, ""I can see your side of it"" or ""I've never thought about it that way before."" Don't make people feel bad unless you want them to think you're stuck up.

, Saying ""thank you"" and showing gratitude can go a long way in making you look modest. If you're modest, then you should be thankful for all of the people who make your life better and who are there to support and help you no matter what. Make sure these people know how much they mean to you and that you remember to always thank them for what they do--or just because.


Get in the habit of saying ""thank you"" as much as you can, whether you're talking to your best friend or your repairman.
Elaborate. Say, ""thank you for helping me redecorate my house. I couldn't have done it without you.""
Get in the habit of writing thank-you cards. They can help you express gratitude.

, Another part of being modest is to know how to accept a true compliment. Don't say, ""That's not true..."" and then put yourself down. Instead, keep it simple. Just say something like, ""Thank you, I really appreciate that you would say that."" Let the person see that you've accepted the compliment and that you're not going to fight it and disagree.


You don't have to jump back and compliment the other person right away, either, or you may look insincere.

, If you want to be modest, then you have to look the part. Don't hover over people, wave your hands wildly when you gesture, touch people you barely know with too much confidence, or stand with your hands on your hips and a giant maniacal smile planted on your face. Just stand with good posture, smile when the occasion calls for it, and keep your hands at your sides.


You don't have to hunch over or look at the ground to be modest. Just don't go so over the top with your body language that people think you're full of yourself.

, If you're modest, then you shouldn't march right into a room like you own the place and start chatting away like the belle of the ball. Stride into a room with confidence, and calmly greet people or give them hugs, but don't show up and throw your hands in the air and cry, ""The party's here!"" The way you carry yourself, especially when you enter a new environment, can influence how modest you really look.

, This doesn't mean that you should dress like you just arrived to America on the Mayflower. However, if you want to be modest, then you should avoid clothes that are too flashy and which draw too much attention to you. Wearing obscene graphic tees, neon colors, or zebra or leopard print patterns may not be your best bet. Wear something that accentuates your best features without putting it all out there.


Women should define what dressing with modesty means to them. There's no harm in showing off a little cleavage as long as you've got it under control.

, Part of being modest means not acting or looking like you're better than everyone else. So, that $1000 Prada purse or those expensive diamond earrings may have to go if you want to look modest in front of other people. It's okay to own some nice things and to bring them out from time to time, but if you're rolling in with $5000 worth of electronics, jewelry, watches, shoes, and any other accessories that you can think of, then other people will raise their eyebrows.


Maybe you worked hard for that $1000 Prada purse. It's okay to wear it. But try not to flash it around and show it off, or people won't think you're very modest.

, Modesty can be a positive trait that helps you gain friends, be respected at work, and improve your relationships. Just don't let people walk all over you because you're so busy being modest that you don't even get recognition for what you have achieved, and get overlooked in the workplace or the dating arena as a result.


There are contested debates over whether the ""modest is hottest,"" mantra is a good one, or whether it keeps women from expressing who they really are. When you decide on your level of modesty, think carefully."

If you're irritated by a co-worker and do nothing to address it, then yeah, you are unlikely to feel mellow when you're at work. If your closet door is driving you crazy but you don't try to fix it, then you won't be feeling mellow for very long. The important thing is to approach the fixable problems in life with calm and resolve.


Ask yourself about which things in life are causing you to not be mellow. Work to find a way to solve or address the problems that you are able to deal with.;
, Along with changing the things you can change, in order to truly be mellow, you have to be able to learn to accept the things you cannot change. You can address a problematic co-worker to discuss issues you've been having, but you may not be able to change the fact that you hate the weather in the place where you live or that you have to live with siblings who pester you. Learn to recognize when a situation is out of your control and accept it with a calm mind.


Let's say your new boss is driving you crazy, but you really love your job. If you try to resolve the issue and fail, then you have to learn to focus on the parts of your job that you love in spite of being annoyed by your boss.

, If you're the kind of person who doesn't know how to forgive and forget, then you are guaranteed to be less mellow. If one of your friends or family members has truly upset you, you have to work on being able to talk about it and to move past it, even if you haven't completely forgiven the person. If you walk around holding a grudge, then you are guaranteed to be in an angry, riled-up state instead of facing the day with calm and peace.


If you spend so much time obsessing over being mad at people who rejected you or fuming over people who have harmed you, then you will never be able to mellow out.
Sure, it can help to talk about how someone has hurt you. But if you keep talking about it to everyone within earshot, you're only going to work yourself up into a frenzy.

, Keeping a journal can help you feel in touch with your thoughts and ready to face new challenges. Making a goal of writing in your journal at least a few times a week can help you check in with yourself and feel like you are in touch with your mental state. Doing so also helps you establish a healthy routine and gives you time to slow down and accept whatever the day has thrown at you. If you don't take a moment to breathe or relax as you write down your thoughts, then you will not be feeling mellow any time soon.


Use your journal as a place for honesty and a reservation of judgment. Write down what you're thinking and feeling without fear or lies and you'll be on your way to feeling more at peace.

, A lot of people don't feel mellow because their wheels are always turning, trying to play out every move of life like it's a chess game. Let's say you're a writer who is deciding whether to be a librarian or to go to graduate school. Instead of planning out the next ten years of your life, wondering if you'll ever be able to publish a book, just do what feels right to you during that particular stage of your life. Focus on whatever you're doing right now and think about your next move without worrying about the next ten moves you'll have to make.


If you learn to live in the present and to fully immerse yourself in what you're working on now, you'll be much more likely to succeed at what you're doing than if you're constantly wondering about where this step will lead you.

, Taking walks has been proven to relieve stress and to help you stop worrying about all of the things that are bothering you. If you make a goal of taking just one or two 15-minute walks per day, then you can help yourself get some fresh air, be out in the sunshine, and to make an effort to break your usual habits or routine. If you're feeling overwhelmed or angry and not sure how to proceed, taking a walk to clear your head can have a powerful positive effect on your mental state.Sometimes all you need is a change of scenery. Just being out in the world, seeing trees, people, and others going about their days can make you feel more peaceful.

, Exercising will also make you feel more mellow, and more in control of your mind and body. Just making a habit of exercising for 30 minutes a day or as many times as you can a week can help you have a lifestyle that makes you feel more calm and at peace. Any form of exercise will help you focus on your body and relieve some of the anxious energy you've been carrying around, though every person has a different form of exercise that can be best suited to his needs, such as yoga or hiking.


You can even make exercise a part of your daily life, if you're short on time. Instead of driving to the grocery store, take a 15 minute walk there. Instead of taking the elevator to work, take the stairs. These little efforts at activity do add up.

, Being out in nature can help you feel more calm and at peace, and can give you a sense that most of your problems really aren't that big of a deal. It's hard to worry about your upcoming project or job interview when you're walking through the woods or standing on top of a mountain. If you're in a more urban environment, visit a public garden or a lake just to get a taste of nature. It's more important than you think when it comes to mellowing out.


If you find a hiking, swimming, or biking buddy, then you'll be even more motivated to spend time in nature.

, Listening to classical music, jazz, or other music that makes you feel more calm and mellow can have a big impact on your inner and outer state. Try to minimize the death metal or other music that gets you riled up and turn to more calming sounds. You can go to concerts or just experience this music in your own home or car, especially when you're feeling stressed out.


If you just plug in for a few minutes and listen to mellow music, you'll find that your mind and body will relax more easily. If you're in the middle of a heated argument, you can even excuse yourself and spend a few minutes listening to calming music before you return to the conversation.

, Sometimes, all you need to do is to take a few minutes of time out. If you're feeling really overwhelmed and not mellow at all, just lie down or sit down, close your eyes, and try not to move your body for a few minutes. Shut down your mind and focus on the sounds around you, and see if you can even fall into a light sleep for a few minutes. Try this for 15-20 minutes. You don't want to end up taking a long, hour-plus nap and wake up feeling groggy or worse than usual.


If you feel anxious because you're tired and don't feel capable of dealing with a lot of your problems, making a power nap a part of your routine can help you feel more mellow.

, Making laughter a bigger part of your routine will definitely make you feel more relaxed and at ease, and thereby more mellow. You may feel like you don't have time for laughter, or that laughing isn't ""serious"" enough, but you should really make an effort to spend time around people who make you laugh, watching comedies, or just to do things that get you out of a serious frame of mind. Get silly with your friends and dress up in goofy costumes, dance for no reason, run around in the rain, or do whatever you can to shake yourself out of your stressed-out funk and to crack up more.


Making a goal toward laughing more is something you can do today and start right now. Even if you're just watching a cat do something ridiculous on YouTube, you'll still be headed in the right direction.

, It's a known fact that caffeine can make you feel more anxious and less at peace. Though drinking coffee, tea, or a soda can definitely give you the burst of energy you may be looking for, if you drink too much of it, or drink it too late in the day, then you are likely to feel more jittery and less mellow than you may want. Ask yourself how much caffeine you regularly drink and slowly work to cut this number in half — if not eliminate your caffeine intake completely.It goes without saying that if you want to be mellow, you should avoid those energy drinks at all costs. They will give you a quick high and then will make you crash and feel anxious.

, One way to instantly make your life more mellow is to hang out with more people who have a mellow mindset. Being around people who are calm can soothe you and make you feel more at peace. Seek out people who have a more zen approach to life and try to emulate them. If you're close with them, ask them what makes them tick and talk to them about how they approach their lives. Though it's unlikely that you'll be able to act exactly like these people all of a sudden, it will be possible for you to pick up some tricks from them, and to mellow out just by hanging out with them.


In addition to hanging out with more mellow people, you should also try to weed out the people who cause you unnecessary stress or anxiety. Though you shouldn't drop your high-strung friends completely, you should think about spending less time with people who rile you up.
That being said, you should know that there's a different between being mellow and being indifferent or just not caring that much. If you have friends who really don't care one way or the other because they don't have too many goals or ambitions, then they are not necessarily being mellow. It's important to be motivated and to want to achieve something in life, even if what you want is happiness or inner peace — being mellow just means having a more healthy mindset while you go about your day.

, Another way to make yourself feel more mellow is to pay more attention to how you keep your space. Keeping a clean desk, a made bed, and a room that is free of clutter can have a positive impact on your mental state. Taking the time to put everything in order at the end of your day, even if you only take 10-15 minutes, can have a big impact on how you approach your day and how much you feel that you have on your plate. Make a concerted effort to keep your space in order and you'll be surprised by how much more mellow you feel.


Of course you'll feel frazzled if you wake up and your desk is scattered with paperwork, or if you spend half an hour trying to find the shirt you wanted to wear. Keeping your space clean will make your life feel more balanced.
You may think that you don't have the time to keep your space clean. However, you will find that if you put just 10-15 minutes a day into managing your space, that it will actually save you time because you'll never waste time looking for anything.

, Another thing that mellow people do well is to not stress about running out of time or getting somewhere late. You need to work on managing your time so that you have plenty of time to get from one place to another, and that you leave early enough to get somewhere on time instead of stressing out about running late. If you're running late, you're going to be frazzled, not have time to manage your appearance, and will likely forget something, which will make you eve more stressed out. Leave for school or work ten minutes earlier than normal and see how much better you feel when you stop running from one place to the next.


The unexpected can always happen. Even if you end up getting to school or work 20 minutes early, it's better than being late because you ran into an unexpected traffic jam. If you plan your life this way, you will feel more mellow when you approach any situation.

, Keeping a reasonable schedule is tied to not being in a rush. If you want to be mellow, then you can't have eighty different balls in the air at once. You have to work on finding a way to give yourself enough time to move from place to place and to not be overwhelmed by all of the things that life throws at you. It's important to make time for your friends, but not so much time that you have no time for yourself. It's great to engage in many different projects, from weaving to doing yoga teacher training, but you shouldn't feel like you are committing too much and not being able to do any one thing well.


Take a look at your schedule. Do you see anything you can drop without missing it too much? Think about how much calmer you feel if you take 2-3 kickboxing classes during the week instead of 5-6.
Make sure to always save at least a few hours for yourself, if not more, during the week. Every person needs to spend a different amount of time by him or herself; get to know how much ""me time"" you really need and don't ever back out on it.

, Making yoga a part of your life will have countless benefits, from giving you inner peace to helping you develop a toned body. Making a habit of practicing yoga several times a week will make you feel more mellow, more calm, and more in control of your mind and body. When you're on the yoga mat, your goal is to forget all of the distractions around you and to focus on syncing your breathing with the movements of your body; for that time, your other cares and worries should melt away. But doing yoga isn't just a coping mechanism for forgetting your stress for a little while; it helps you build a road map for tackling stress, whether you're on or off the mat.Ideally, you should practice yoga at least 5-6 times a week. This may sound like a lot, but you don't need to go to a studio to practice more than a few times a week, or at all. You can practice in the comfort of your own home, as long as you have the space to do it.

, Meditation is also a way to become a more mellow person and to learn to quiet all of the voices that may be agitating you throughout the day. To meditate, just find a place where you can sit down for at least 10-15 minutes and learn to relax your body, one part at a time. Close your eyes and focus on the breath rising in and out of your body. When you open them and feel alert again, you'll feel more capable of dealing with what the day throws at you.


The best part is, you'll feel more capable of tackling challenges with inner calm and can return to the place you reached in meditation during any part of your day.

Find a comedic angle to everything.,

Let it slide.",How to Be Nonchalant," The benefit of being nonchalant isn't about not being happy – it's about not easily getting upset, angry, or stressed. And how might one do that? Well, when everything is comical is a good start. Just like most things have a silver lining, most things have a comedic edge to them, too.


Though it's a simple example, let's say you trip onstage at some award ceremony. Instead of turning bright red in shame, you either brush it off like you meant it to happen and and accept your award from the floor, or you put up your arms in a ""tada"" moment and embrace the spotlight. Let the hooting and hollering commence.;
, All of us have that little voice in our head that's telling us to look cool and to act socially acceptable. This is generally a smart voice in our heads – it makes us friends, gets us connections, and makes life a little easier. But sometimes it halts us in our tracks, keeps us from growing, and just makes us worried, emotionally erratic, and anxious. Instead, pretend for a moment that you don't have it. How do you act? What is your body telling the world? That's nonchalance.


So much of what we do is to avoid shame and to feel accepted. If that urge wasn't within you, what might you do differently? Would you really care if Joel liked your shoes or if Marcia texted you back? Probably not. Start out by focusing on this just for a few minutes a day until it becomes naturally nearly all the time.

, The world is going to end at some point. Do you worry about that? Probably not. Your mom sometimes wears the ugliest sweaters. Do you worry about that? Nope. If you can't change it, there's no point in worrying about. What can you do? Worry about it...and then just worry some more? Yep. There's no point.


So when your teacher announces a pop quiz? No reaction from you. There's no point in worrying about it – the only thing you can worry about is doing well. And when your crush doesn't text you back? Moving on – you were just feeling it out anyway.

, All of life becomes infinitely easier when you come to the conclusions that nothing is that big of a deal. We are all well-oiled specks of dust on this amazing blue planet, and if today isn't going our way, well, that's just how the cookie crumbles. Bad things will happen and good things will happen. Why get worked up about it?


You've probably met someone who takes themselves way more seriously than they should. They're wound up, constantly caring what other people think of what they're doing, saying, and what they look like. In reality, others aren't really thinking about them at all. Just watching them is exhausting because they're wound up so tight. Be the opposite of that person, and the nonchalance will come.

, Along with yoga being a decent way to burn calories and tone your muscles, it's also fantastic at getting rid of all that mind-chatter so many of us have. Many studies have shown that ""yogis"" suffer from less stress, less anxiety, and even lower blood pressure rates.If you're having trouble changing your thinking patterns, yoga may be able to do it for you.


Another good idea is doing deep breathing exercises. Concentrating on your body and your breathing takes you out of your mind and into the here and now. You focus on more tangible realities, like how the chair you're on feels on your skin and the temperature of the room – and not on whatever's been worrying you lately.

, When we get worried and anxious, we also get self-righteous and selfish. All of a sudden, it's about me, me, me and whatever you're demanding needs to be met and now – in other words, we become children.Recognize this part of you (we all have it), and instead opt for the adult in you (we all have that, too). How would the older, more mature side of you react?


Let's say you just sent a text to your boyfriend or girlfriend. They haven't responded yet. The clock is ticking, minutes are passing, and they still haven't responded. The child in you wants to go, ""What are you doing? Why aren't you responding?! Is something wrong?! Why are you being mean?!"" Nope. You're not gonna do that. Instead, you're gonna pick up a book. If they don't text back, fine. You can't really remember what you texted them anyway.

, The very definition of nonchalant is to be calm and relaxed, pretty much 24/7. You can show mild interest or happiness – or even a little disappointment or frustration – but underneath it all, you're still cool as a cucumber. It's not about being cold and emotionless, it's about being chill.


Let's say your crush told you to back off. Dang. That sucks. You have the urge to cry and whine and eat your feelings, but the calmer side of you knows better. And you're not just going to say, ""okay,"" and move on like it never happened, because it did. When talking about it with your friends, you say something like, ""Man, this stinks. Wish it didn't work out this way, but totally glad I didn't ask him/her out on a date!""

, You know what are opinions are like, right? Everybody has 'em. Trying to please everyone and getting everyone to like you is a lost cause, because it just won't happen. Others' opinions of you don't matter; live will go on no matter what. What's more, will you remember what Katie said about your hair in two weeks' time? Nope. So don't stress it. You're doing your own thing and that's what matters.


When only your opinion counts, you'll find it easier to stay more relaxed and stress-free. In other words, nonchalant. You control all of the opinions that matter. How awesome of a feeling is that? Everything else isn't on your radar and isn't worth stressing.

, Even if we say the calmest, coolest things, sometimes our bodies give us away. Your voice says, ""It's okay. No worries,"" when steam is rolling out of your ears and your hands are clenched in fists. No breaking news here: everyone can see through it. So when you're speaking nonchalantly, make sure your body backs it up, too.How your body is positioned will be determined by the situation you're in. The main way to come off as worried and anxious (and not nonchalant) is if your muscles are tensed. If you think your body might give you away, go through your body from head to toe, consciously checking if each part is relaxed. If it's not, let it loose. The mental nonchalance may come from there.

, When someone comes up to you with a hot piece of gossip, this is your go-to response. It doesn't have to be an actual shrug, but it's essentially the equivalent. ""Oh, that's nice. Where did you hear that from?"" is a good verbal shrug when the other person is expecting you to say, ""Ohmigod, are you serious?!"" You're essentially letting everything in one ear and out the other.


It's good to have a sort of ""mental shrug"" attitude, too. The milk spilled? Shrug. Guess you should probably clean that up, huh? You gained a few pounds? Shrug. More salad tomorrow.

, Those individuals out there who are not nonchalant (chalant, if you will), are busy with molding their lives to what others say is okay. They try so hard to make it so everything is just so in order to be accepted and feel loved. In short, they care far too much. And about things that don't matter to boot. Don't copy this lifestyle or anyone else's – pursue your own. You don't care about what anyone else says – you're gonna do what makes you happy.


This helps for a number of reasons. It keeps you busy, it makes you tons of different friends, and it keeps you happy and feeling fulfilled. The bigger your world, the littler everything gets. That one person that could upset you before, can't anymore, because you know a dozen other people just like them.

, Let's use this example: say you want to start a garden, but you only have one seed. You plant that seed so carefully, watching it day in and day out, worrying that it'll amount to nothing and maybe even smothering it in the process. Luckily, in real life, this isn't your garden. You have so many seeds you barely know what to do with them! You can scatter a few here, a few there, and see what turns up. How much do you care? Well, some. You want your garden to be successful. But are you gonna stay up all night, worrying about one little seed? No way.This is a fancy way of saying that you have plenty of going on in your life. If one thing is going wrong, oh well. You have a thousand other things going on in your life that are going just fine, thanks. No need to worry. If that ""seed"" doesn't work out, you'll plant another one.

, Another way to come off as not-so-nonchalant is to be overeager. You're always the one excited and bustling with ideas and trying to get people to do things. Slow down there, tiger. To be nonchalant, let everyone else come to you most of the time. You're a willing participant, but you're just along for the ride. You're not captain of the ship.


That is, most of the time. You don't want to be a dull dud that mooches off of everyone else's good ideas, and you want your friends to know you value them. When you are invited, let them know that you had fun and that the party can be at your house next time, for example. Friendships are two-way streets, after all.

, When Idina Menzel sang, ""Let it go, let it go"" she wasn't kidding. Whenever your mood pendulum feels the urge to swing left or right, stop for a second. Count to 10, and let it pass. Concentrate on being calm, cool, and collected. You got this. Sure, you're happy, or sure, you're sad – but you're not gonna let it get to you. What would be the point in that?


If you're struggling with something really bothering you, try telling yourself that you'll worry about it tomorrow. But it off in your mind, knowing that you'll get to it in under 24 hours. Then what happens? Tomorrow comes and either you don't remember to worry about it, or you feel much better (or at least more in control) about what happened.

By constantly getting out there and doing something, anything, you'll be making yourself much more interesting. It gives you something to talk about in conversations with other people and makes it look like you at least have some kind of life, even if it isn't the most exciting life ever.;
, Traveling is an easy way to make yourself and your life more exciting. Aside from the incredibly rewarding experiences you will have while doing this, it will also make you more confident and help teach you to cope with challenges in your life. You can travel locally or internationally, and traveling doesn't have to be as expensive as it seems. You can do it!

, Do adventurous things. Go hiking. Learn to rock climb. Try scuba diving. Maybe jump out of some planes. This is the fastest way to take your life from boring to action hero. They're also not that hard to do: all you need is some education, determination, and a certain dose of bravery.

, You can also be a bit more boring about your being exciting, by learning cool new skills. You can learn to play the piano, master those guitar skills you started in high school, take up painting, or go with really unique hobbies like leather working or falconry. The most important thing is to pursue something that makes you happy and that you can get invested in.

, Now, this isn't for everybody. Sometimes you have a family to support, or other obligations that take precedence over being more exciting. But if you have the opportunity to, get yourself into a career path that you (or maybe even other people) find exciting. It'll do you a lot of favors in the long run because you will be more invested in the ""boring"" part of your day because the boring part of your day will be awesome!


You could take a job overseas, work on something that's in that ""cutting edge technology"" category, or work with kids (who are well known for bringing the excitement 24/7).

, Use skills you already have or learn some new ones and you can get on your way to doing what humans do best: making new things. You can make things just for you or turn your craft into a whole business. Being creative lets you express who you are but it also makes you more interesting to other people. Everyone wins!

, Don't be a downer. Don't always complain or spend a bunch of time insulting or being down on other people. You can be as exciting as you want, but if you're a jerk then you're not really going to have anyone to enjoy that with. Make the most of life, even when it's handing out lemons like they're going out of style. Everyone will be better for it.

, This is an essential part of making your life more exciting and being a more exciting person. You can't be exciting if you're always doing the same thing, even if that same thing is a little exciting. You have to take risks sometimes (a piece of advice that's handy for life in general). Don't go crazy though. Look at risks in terms of potential loss vs. potential gain. If you stand to lose only a little but gain a lot, go for it. If it's the other way around, wait for something better or blaze your own path.


Don't forget, you can often make your own Option C, if neither A nor B is really going to work for you.

, And if who you are is a pointy-ear-wearing, Star-Trek-watching nerd, that's okay. No matter what your eccentricity is, run with it. It will make you stand out but it will also make you fun to be around and more interesting to talk to because you will be happy and enjoying what you do with your life.

, Constantly learn new things. Bonus points if you learn by doing! Filling your head with a world of experiences and knowledge is going to make you way more fun to talk to and you'll find that you enjoy the pursuit of knowledge along the way., Everyone is unique. Absolutely everyone. If identical twins are different from each other and are unique, you can certainly manage. Find what is unique about you, what makes you different, and embrace that. Even if it's weird. You might not have to fly pride flags everywhere, but you can certainly make it a bigger part of your life. You'll find that it generally makes you happier.

, People love people that are funny, so develop a good joke repertoire and make people laugh. Find the positive side of problems. Make life seem less serious every now and again, or at least remind people that it's okay to laugh and relax. This will make you and everyone around you a lot happier.


Your alternative is to be incredibly racist and offensive (the brand of exciting usually saved for grandparents who aren't particularly with the times), and you probably don't want to be that kind of exciting. Or maybe you do. Good luck with that.

, Don't think that constantly changing your hair or dress is going to make you seem more exciting. The same can be said of trying a thousand hobbies and professions. Constantly changing drastically from one thing to the next doesn't make you exciting, it makes people think you're frivolous and not invested in anything. You'll seem like you do it for the attention. Find what matters to you and let changes come naturally.

, Get out there and be social! Talk to your friends. Spend time with them. Go to parties. Have fun. Show your friends all of the cool stuff you've been working on (you followed the steps in the first two sections, right?). This lets you show the exciting stuff you've done if you want to but it also gives you one more way to get out there and do something more interesting than sitting on your couch.

, Now, we're not trying to say that having more exciting friends will make you more exciting. That's not healthy. But more exciting friends will invite you to do exciting things, giving you opportunities to try new things. They'll also be more willing to join you on your own adventure.

, Volunteer. Improve your community with the skills that you have. Help show other people how to turn their lives around by taking on challenges, just like you did in order to change how you were living your life. This act of giving back makes you more exciting, but it also will help others and give you a great sense of fulfillment.

, As you go around doing all of these exciting things, you will learn lots of cool or useful information. Make good use of this by educating others. You can give classes, or just have some fun facts for your friends at parties. People will enjoy living vicariously through the things you learn and tell them.

, Don't, however, boast or spend a lot of time rubbing it in people's faces. Your life is exciting, they know. If they want to know more, they'll ask, so try not to make every other sentence out of your mouth about ""This one time I...."".

, You're probably going to break or bend the rules, either real ones or just social conventions, along the way. This is natural, since being exciting usually means going against the grain a bit. Someone is going to find something ""wrong"" with what you're doing, even if they're the one who is really wrong. Learn to cope with the haters and you'll be much happier.

Be hot around people you're attracted to.",How to Be Hot," Being ""hot"" has the connotation of being an adult who people have an instant sexual attraction toward. This stands in contrast to being ""cute"". Usually when someone is considered cute, they are attractive in more of a youthful way and less of a sexual way. So if you want to be a hot woman, you can accentuate your curves. If you want to be a hot man, then you have to be more George Clooney than Justin Bieber.


There is also a misconception that ""hot"" means ""sexy"", but they are not actually the same thing. ""Sexy"" means attractive in a more grown-up, mature way (where you do not need to have an edge). Think of the difference between a Megan Fox and Angelina Jolie. Angelina Jolie is mature and classy (which is where she gets her sexiness from), while Megan Fox is edgy, daring, and seductive (which is mostly what makes her ""hot"").;
, To look hot, you need to be a little intriguing and mysterious. When people see you, you want them to think ""ooh"" rather than ""aww"". You can do this by not telling everyone everything about yourself at once, not always being available, and just taking a longer time to open up. This will keep people wondering and guessing about you.


You need to have a little edge. Think of the difference between a stereotypical rock star and a stereotypical teacher. If both are good-looking, you'd probably think of the rock star as hot, and the teacher as cute. Both are good, but if you want to be considered hot, flirting subtly or a tinge of rebelliousness helps.

, To be sexually attractive, you need to be comfortable in your own skin and know how to emphasize your best qualities. That doesn't mean you have to show skin, but being just a little seductive doesn't hurt. If you feel comfortable doing it, let people see the parts of your body that you love the most—or just enough to intrigue them. Whether you're showing your sculpted arms or just a bit of cleavage, you'll be on your way to being hot.

, Stand up straight and look proud and happy to be who you are and to look how you look. Keep your shoulders up, your head looking straight ahead, and your arms at your sides. Avoid slouching, or you won't look confident. People who are hot have good posture because they're proud to own what they've got—and they love to flaunt it. If you're a woman, walk like a diva and smile seductively from time to time.

, There are many hot people who aren't in the best shape, and there are many people in great shape who aren't hot. However, if you want to add some more attention from others, work to lose weight if you are overweight, or do muscle-building exercises if you are underweight or skinny. Make an appointment with the local gym to see which machines/workout routines are best for you.


Exercising will also make you feel more comfortable in your own skin and happier to be who you are. This will make you look and feel hot, too.

, This means brushing your teeth and flossing at least twice a day, washing your face to get rid of blackheads or acne, washing your hair on a suitable schedule, and generally taking care of your body. You should also use deodorant, trim your fingernails, and smell fresh. If you want, try a nice-smelling fragrance, or treat yourself to a spa day.


No matter how hard you work out, if you show up smelling like you haven't showered in a few days, not many people will consider you hot.

, Make sure you look sharp in your outfits by picking clothes that flatter your figure. Remember that hotness is in the eye of the beholder, but take the time to shop around for clothes that complement you in color and style. Here are some things to keep in mind as you get hotter:


Trying fashion trends can help you become more noticed.
Use jewelry. Look for earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, or bangles.
Don't wear gym clothes, running shoes, or free crew neck T-shirts. Save those for when you work out.
You can dress casually as long as you appear as though you put effort into the way.

, A few great styles include straightening, curling, crimping, a bun, beach-like waves, a fishtail braid, a ponytail, or a messy bun. Hot people are dynamic. They are always mixing things up and keeping people on their toes. Think of J-Law chopping off her locks for a short hairdo—she looks even hotter!


As for guys, if you find one cut that really works for you, you can stick to it for a while. If you're going bald, don't underestimate how hot a fully shaved head can be. And a bit of gray is definitely hot, too.

, The key is to keep it at a minimum. Eye shadow, mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss or balm is all you need, unless you have acne or a skin-related disease, in which case concealer and optionally foundation is a good choice. Makeup can tell guys that you like their attention (as unrealistic as this sounds, anything ""sexy"" can give a message that you're begging for attention, so be careful not to go overboard with makeup).


Feel free to try makeup if you're a guy and open to that style. Eyeliner in particular can be attractive on people of both genders, or you can just use concealer to cover up imperfections.

, If you're a guy, you can skip this step. For clothes, tanks, shorts, layering tops, yoga-leggings, and jeans are just some ideas. If you are young, you can get in the way with wearing anything (as long as you aren't made fun of for wearing it). Think of Beyonce or what The Saturdays wore in their music video ""What About Us"". Remember: skimpy clothes don't make you any more hot.

, You cannot be ""hot"" if you remind people of a young child by complaining constantly, picking fights with others, and acting immature. Stay classy in your attitude, present yourself with poise, and be polite to everyone you meet. Treat people with respect, avoid whining, and take responsibility for your actions. If you act mature, people will see that you're a person worth knowing, and someone who should be taken seriously.


You don't want people to be turned off because they think you're a crybaby or a complainer. Make sure to project an image of yourself that isn't childish.

, Ironically, being hot means being cool. For instance, think of Brad Pitt. He is considered by many (but not all) women to be hot because he has a cool demeanor, is handsome, and he's not always smiling or talking (this does not mean you can't smile or talk to others).


Hot people say things that are necessary, witty, or things people want to hear.
During terrifying situations, hot people impress others by simply not freaking out, telling others that it's nothing or okay, and sometimes handling it.
Someone who's hot isn't usually hyper, or nervous.

, Hot people know they're hot and have the confidence to back it up. Be proud and happy with who you are, walk with your head high, and talk about positive things and things that make you happy. If you walk around looking like you're waiting to get noticed or like you don't know who you are, then you won't come off as hot. Instead, smile big when you enter a room, be friendly to people, and give people the benefit of the doubt when you first meet them instead of being instantly suspicious of anyone outside your social circle.


If you want to be confident, then try hanging out with people who make you feel good about yourself.
Of course, it's okay to doubt yourself. You don't have to act happy with yourself all the time. When you have doubts, talk to a close friend instead of letting everyone around know that you're feeling insecure. However, if you doubt yourself too much, then people will believe that you are weak and not confident, which you must exude in order to be supposedly ""hot"".

, You can be really happy or really mad, sure, but in general, hot people keep it pretty even keeled. You don't see them crying for joy, shrieking when they see their friends, or snapping at their teachers. Instead, they pretty much know when to show that they're happy or sad, but they don't overdo it. They don't draw attention to themselves because of how they are feeling. People will notice them because they're awesome, not because they're having a hissy fit.


If you're talking to a friend and feel yourself getting angry, take a minute to take a breather and get to feeling calm again.

, It's a myth that really hot people are only nice to other hot people and ignore the people ""below"" them. If you're truly hot, then you should be able to see past the exterior and to know which people are worth knowing. Don't just hang out with people who are hot and who make you look good; instead, spend time with the people who you respect and like the most. Look around you and ask about the company you keep; are these people really the nice, kind people you want to be?


If you're nice to everyone, people will be even more impressed by you, because they'll think, ""It's so awesome that he/she is really friendly to everyone in spite of being so hot. He/She really isn't letting that get to his/her head.""
This goes for strangers or people you just meet, too. Don't go into a new conversation with suspicion; try excitement or curiosity instead.

Don't be a snob. Don't walk by that girl in your history class and look the other way just because you think it's not ""cool"" to say hi to people.

, Just because you think you're hot, it doesn't give you an excuse to go on and on about how much weight you lifted at the gym, how great you look in your new outfit, or how many phone numbers you got over the weekend. If you're really hot, then other people will notice and they will do the work for you. People won't feel like you're really hot if you're constantly trying to prove it to them. The next time you open your mouth to brag, stop yourself and praise someone else instead.



Being humble and modest can go a long way in making you look and feel hot. If you brag all the time, people won't like you because they'll think you're full of yourself.

, Hot people don't get all obsessed over one crush, or spend 100% of their time fawning over their boyfriends and girlfriends. Instead, they play the field a little bit. If they find someone they like, then yeah, they'll stick by them, but in general, hot people take things lightly and enjoy exploring their options. If you're out at a party or a club, don't just home in on the one person you like as if you're a laser: instead, talk to a variety of people, and you may end up liking someone you didn't expect to click with.


Hot people also don't get too disappointed by rejection. Sure, rejection sucks, but don't spend too long feeling sorry for yourself -- it's just not worth it.

, If you're hot, then you should know it. Don't check yourself out in windows outside, and don't take out your mirror and start adjusting your makeup in front of everyone. Your hotness should look easy and effortless. If you need to check up on your appearance, do it in the privacy of a bathroom, not out in the open. Otherwise, you may come off as insecure.

, Hot people should be gracious and happy for what they've got. They shouldn't be sore losers, mad over the little things, or rude to waiters, teachers, or strangers. Gracious people treat everyone with kindness, help people out, and recognize that they're lucky to be alive. Don't act like you deserve to be treated like a million bucks while everyone else is chopped liver; this kind of behavior is ugly and will turn people off.


Gracious people know that they have to work for what they want and don't think that they ""deserve"" to get the best of everything. If you really want to be hot, then you have to be kind and grateful about it, too.

, There's a stereotype of people who treat their friends more like accessories (think: Regina George in Mean Girls) because they're just so hot that they can do anything they want. Well, it's up to you to break that trend. Don't treat your friends like lemmings, sidekicks, or followers who are at your beck and call. Instead, treat them like equals, and let them have equal say in what you do. Ask them how they're doing, take the time to do something nice for them, and make sure your friendships are meaningful.


Don't be the person who gossips about his or her friends the second they turn around, either. You'll quickly get a reputation for being fake.

, If you want to be hot, then you have to be able to flirt a bit when you're talking to someone you like. However, this doesn't mean that you have to put it all out there and come on too strong. Find a balance between keeping your cool and giving the person a little bit to work with; that way, you'll come off as hot, but people will still want to get to know you. If people think you're an ice queen or in love with yourself, you won't be getting many dates, no matter how hot you are.


And if someone who you're not into comes up to you, be as nice as you can about it. Just because you don't think that person is hot or cool doesn't mean you shouldn't treat him or her like a human being.
Don't act like you're a queen or a king and that the person should beg for a minute of your time. Always be on equal footing with anyone you're talking to.

Be an active listener and learn everything you can about comedy.",How to Be Funny," Laughter itself is unconscious. While it's possible for us to keep ourselves from laughing (not always successfully), it is very hard for us to produce laughter on demand, and doing so will usually seem ""forced.""Fortunately, laughter is very contagious (we're about 30 times more likely to laugh in the presence of others), and in a social context, it's easy to start laughing when others are laughing.Studies have shown that three things make us laugh the most: a sense of superiority over someone else behaving ""dumber"" than us; a difference between our expectation of something and the actual result; or welcome relief from an anxiety.;
, It's good to know that the less funny a place is, the easier it becomes to add the element of humorous surprise. It might be easier to get people to laugh about an office workplace than to get people to laugh in a comedy club.This is why The Office, the NBC show, uses an office as its setting: it's about as boring as it gets. They even process paper. How boring is that?! We're not used to looking at an office as a funny place, so when it is funny, it's especially funny.

, A lot of the time, comedy comes from linguistic confusion (unintentional) or linguistic playfulness (intentional). We sometimes find things humorous when there's a gap between our words and our meanings.


Freudian slips are linguistic errors that are believed to expose what you were really thinking rather than what you ""meant"" to say, and are often of a sexual nature.
Witty wordplay is more intentional: ""A chicken crossing the road: poultry in motion."" Or this one, where the words ""hockey"" and ""fight"" are switched: ""I went to a fight the other night and a hockey game broke out.""

, There's perhaps nothing in comedy more widely cited but more thoroughly misunderstood than irony. Irony occurs when there is a gap between our expectations of a statement, situation, or image and the actual experience of it.


Comedian Jackie Mason illustrates irony with a joke: ""My grandfather always said, 'Don't watch your money; watch your health.' So one day while I was watching my health, someone stole my money. It was my grandfather.""
This joke messes with one of our fundamental expectations: that grandparents are nice, friendly people who are utterly harmless, and that the advice they offer should be sincere.The joke is funny because, in it, we are presented with a grandparent who is rascally, thievish, and double-crossing.

, Being funny doesn't come in a ""one-size-fits-all"" package. What makes you funny is unique to you and the way you observe the world. Trust that you do have a funny bone; as babies we laugh from 4 months of age, and all children express humor naturally from kindergarten age, using humor to entertain themselves and others. It's already in you – you just need to bring it out!

, Remember the most embarrassing moments in your life so far, the monumental stuff-ups, the times you refused to make changes, the breakdowns in communications that you played a major part in, and maybe even the time you tried to be funny around your friends and only crickets chirped. These things can be hilarious.


Telling other people about very embarrassing moments in your life is a great way to get them to laugh. Take a page from famous improv comic Colin Mochrie, who said: ""He had the kind of face only a mother could love, if that mother was blind in one eye and had that kind of milky film over the other... but still, he was my identical twin.""

, Tell self-depracating jokes rather than making jokes at the expense of others. More people will be more willing to laugh. Rodney Dangerfield made fun of both his sanity and his looks with this one: ""I went to the psychiatrist, and he says 'You're crazy.' I tell him I want a second opinion. He says, 'Okay, you're ugly too!'""


Redd Foxx had this to say about his silly devotion to drugs and alcohol: ""I feel sorry for people who don’t drink or do drugs. Because someday they’re going to be in a hospital bed, dying, and they won’t know why.""
A great joke from Henry Youngman: ""I was so ugly when I was born, the doctor slapped my mother.""

, Different things make different people laugh. Some people find that sensationalism causes them to laugh; others find that satire does the trick. Learn which is which, and deliver your jokes and anecdotes so that they apply to many different categories of humor and emotion at once.


Not everyone knows what it's like to ride in a helicopter or be a millionaire or have a baby. But most people know what it's like to go fast, fantasize about money, and love another person deeply. So make your jokes cover more ground by utilizing really basic, but profound, human emotions.
When you're in a group of people you don't know, listen to what subjects they're talking about and what's making them laugh. Are they the witty banter type? The slapstick, or physical comedy type? The better you know someone, the easier it will be to make them laugh.

, Misleading the mind is what we referred to earlier as surprise. This is when you create a difference between what someone expects to happen and what actually happens. Verbal jokes use this element to the greatest level possible, trying to misdirect your attention in the same that magic tricks do.For example: ""What happens to liars when they die?"" Answer - ""They lie still."" This joke works because you have to interpret the joke in two ways, and the brain is temporarily confused by its inability to draw on usual experience.
Consider Groucho Marx's clever one-liner, ""Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read,"" or Rodney Dangerfield's line, ""My wife met me at the door the other night in a sexy negligee. Unfortunately, she was just coming home.""

, Good timing is really important, because if you give the brain too much time to work out a situation or joke, the funny moment will pass by. This is probably why jokes people have heard before don't work, as recognition dulls the humor because the brain is already primed by experience. React quickly and strike while the humorous moment exists.


One liners, or comebacks, can be good fun. Someone says something that, by itself, isn't funny. And you whip back with something that makes what they said really funny. Timing is crucial here. Your humorous statement needs to come out quickly and fully-formed. For example, your friend is thinking about hair, for some reason, and he says: ""Isn't it weird that we only have hair on our heads and in our pubic areas?"" The friend is not really even expecting a response. You say: ""Speak for yourself.""
If the timing is all wrong, don't mess with the joke. The worst you can do as a funny person is try to deliver a joke after your window of opportunity has passed. Don't worry, you'll have plenty of opportunities to crack through the silence with your whip of a wit.

, Be especially careful about cracking jokes or pulling pranks during funerals and weddings, places of worship (or religious events), and whenever your humor could be mistaken for harassment or discrimination, or if your humor might physically harm somebody, as in a physical prank.

, Jerry Seinfeld and other comedians have made millions of dollars deploying a basic style of comedy known as ""observational"" humor, making observations about everyday occurrences and experiences. While knowing a lot can increase your capacity for humor, there's no substitute for seeing a lot. In fact, many very knowledgeable people fail to see the humor in things. Look for the humor in everyday situations, and see what others don't. Often, the unnoticed humor that is standing right in front of our eyes has the most impact.

, One liners can steal the show. Dorothy Parker was brilliant with one-liners; for example, when told that Calvin Coolidge had died, she replied: ""How can they tell?""


You'll need quick wit and readiness for delivering good one-liners but studying other people's can inspire your own. Or think of Calvin Coolidge himself; a woman came to him and said: ""Mr. Coolidge, I made a bet against a fellow who said it was impossible to get more than two words out of you."" Coolidge replied, ""You lose.""

, You can expand your reach a good deal by listening to other funny people. Whether they're professional comedians, your parents, your kids, or your boss, learning from the funny people in your life is a key step to being funny yourself. Keep a note of some of the funnier things these people say or do. And find what you admire most in these people. Even if all you do is cobble together your own funny plan based on one admired trait from each person, you'll be improving your sense of funny tremendously. Immersing yourself like this will help you develop a toolbox of techniques you can use to be funny.


Comedy has taken the podcast world by storm in recent years. Comedy podcasts by people like Marc Maron and Joe Rogan are available for free online and feature hilarious interviews, jokes, and stories you can upload to mobile devices. Ride the bus while listening to a comedy podcast and weird everyone out when you laugh suddenly in your headphones.

, There are many, many TV shows and movies packed with excellent comedy. The British, for example, have a very dry, witty sense of humor that concerns itself primarily with cultural matters, whereas Americans have more of a slapstick, physical humor that often involves issues of sex and race. Getting a good helping of both will help you understand different cultural attitudes towards humor.


Watch improvisational comedians. All good comedians are improvisers, but comedians choose to improvise for a living and the experience can be hilarious. Attend an improv show and take part in it as much as you can – you'll laugh a lot and observe exactly how they take vague, unknown scenarios and turn them into something instantly funny.

, It is much easier to find funny moments in material you know well – your workplace attitudes, your amazing knowledge of 17th century poetry, your familiarity with fishing trips that went wrong, etc. Whatever the material, though, it also needs to resonate with your audience, meaning that your concise ability to deconstruct a 17th century poem might not hit its mark with somebody not familiar with the piece!


Broaden your horizons so that you are tuned-in regardless of who you're speaking to. If you can find the humor in physics and Paris Hilton, for example, you're well on your way. Drawing an interesting parallel between two wildly different subjects can be very funny, if done well.
Work your smarts. In a way, being funny is simply showing that you are intelligent enough to find the humorous nuances that others miss. Comics do this routine all the time. They point out the hygienic customs of the clergy, for example, or the breeding practices of chimpanzees, relating it effortlessly back to something the average person knows and understands.

, Get your hands on anything and everything that is funny, and consume it like your mom told you not to. Chemists become chemists by reading and practicing chemistry; sports writers become sports writers by reading and writing about sports; you're going to become a funnier person by reading and practicing jokes.



Read works by people like James Thurber, P.G. Wodehouse, Stephen Fry, Kaz Cooke, Sarah Silverman, Woody Allen, Bill Bryson, Bill Watterson, Douglas Adams, etc. (Don't forget children's books by good authors; they can be a terrific source for good humor!)
Read joke books. It won't hurt to have a few good jokes memorized. Hopefully, reading good jokes might inspire you to start making up your own jokes and witticisms. When reading them, try to pick apart the elements that make them good jokes. Equally, try to work out why some jokes do not work. Just because you wrote it doesn't mean that it's good; it can be hard to stare at our own work objectively, so get feedback from someone who doesn't know you well (that way they won't sugarcoat the news, whatever it is).

, Listen carefully to others, really hear them, and understand what they're about. There's nothing more humble than admitting that you can always learn to be funnier from other people. When you're busy focused on people other than yourself, you'll get a better sense of how to help others through humor. It will also enable you to observe and relate the small joys of life too – making your funny self more believable and empathetic.

Be a classy drinker.",How to Be Classy," There is nothing wrong with enjoying fashion or buying clothing you find attractive, but, avoid clothing that does not flatter your physique, coloring, etc.


Do not become a slave to fashion, or you may be regarded as foolish, ""high maintenance"", and/or shallow. The clothing you wear should enhance your personality, not create or alter it. This advice can be applied to many aspects of life in which you may feel pressured to ""fit in."";
, Excellent presentation is half of the battle. Wear clothing and accessories that flatter your body, and never wear anything you feel uncomfortable in. You don't have to wear the most expensive clothes on the market, or even buy knock-off clothes on the cheap. It's better to go for an individualized and put-together look.


Good hygiene is key. Shower daily and always show up to a new place feeling and looking fresh.

, If you have to go to a formal or semi-formal event, then you better know what that means. It's better to overdress a little than to under dress, and it's not okay to show up to a formal event wearing jeans if you needed to wear slacks or a dress. It's not funny to wear sneakers if you needed to wear dress shoes, either.


Make sure you know the dress code and ask the host or your friends who are also attending if you're confused.

, Avoid showing up anywhere wearing wristbands from the club from the night before, stamps or X's on your hands from the bars you went to; or just smelling like sweat, bars, beer, or even vomit. Get your day-old eyeliner off your face, take a shower, and don't show up anywhere, not even brunch, without looking like you're ready to start a new day; not crawl back into your lair.


Even if you did have a rough night, don't say, I am so hungover. That is not classy.

, Don't put on makeup in public, comb your hair in public, button your shirt, finish tying your shoes, check out your outfit, or do anything that says you took zero effort to get your act together before you left the house. Tuck in your shirt, put on your mascara and lip balm, and do absolutely everything you need to do before you go out into the world.


Avoid exposed undergarments. Ladies shouldn't let their bra straps show and men shouldn't let people see their boxers.

, It's okay to flaunt what you've got, but if it's too revealing, it might give off the wrong vibe if it's not worn to its intended purpose. Know what you're wearing and make sure it's comfortable.

, Part of looking classy is having good posture. Keep a straight back, look in front of you instead of at the ground, and avoid slouching as much as you can. Don't cross your arms over your chest, but keep them at your sides to help your chest open up. If you lift your head high you will look and feel more classy. When you're sitting down, you should avoid slouching too.

, Having a foul mouth is just not classy at all. If you have the urge to curse, go into the bathroom and turn on the faucet while you let loose a row of expletives; or curse into a pillow. Never let people see you curse. This will often make you look trashy, and if you're cursing because you're angry, it appears as though you don't know how to control your temper. This is a big sign of having no class.


Cursing in general should be avoided; cursing at specific people should be avoided even more.

, That's right. Instead of talking about how someone is trashy, annoying, loud, or stupid, take some time to say something nice about a person who isn't there. Doing so will show that you've got class, and that you're confident and cool enough to realize the strengths of others instead of talking smack the second someone turns around.


If you praise people behind their backs, you'll look like a positive, self-possessed person, instead of someone who is always looking for trouble.
If you're always gossiping, people will think you have no class because you don't respect the privacy and boundaries of other people.

, Has someone ever walked into a party where you were hanging out and said, ""I knew I was in the right place when I heard your voice from across the street""? If so, then you better pump down the volume. Everyone can hear you just fine. Don't think that you have to yell or shout to prove your point. Talking evenly, even if you're around a lot of people, is a sign of class because it means you're confident enough not to have to shout to get people's attention.


If you're concerned about this, ask your friends to rate you on a loudness scale. If you come close to a 10, or a 10 on the Richter scale, then it's time to tone it down.

, For some reason, many people who think they are classy just love to talk about how much class they have, especially in comparison to one person or another who has ""no class"" or ""no class whatsoever."" If you find yourself saying, ""I've got class..."" or, ""I'm a classy girl..."" then you are not acting so classy yourself. Let other people figure out how classy you really are instead of bragging about it.


Ideally, if you're classy, you should never use the word ""classy.""

, Burping in public is not cool, funny, or a great way to amuse your friends after you've had a burger and an extra large soda. If you love burping for fun, please stop. If you accidentally burp, that's no problem. Just put a hand to your mouth and excuse yourself.

, If you have class, then don't tap away at your cell phone every five seconds, barely look up from your phone in social situations, let it vibrate or buzz, even when you're in class, or pick up your phone in the middle of a crowded coffee shop and start yapping away about your most personal problem. Talk on your phone only when you're alone and when you're not interrupting anyone, unless it's an emergency.


It is seriously rude and not cool to let your phone ring every two seconds in a public place. It's called silent for a reason.

, Even if you're in public and your significant other, best friend, or a perfect stranger has made you extremely angry, you have to take some deep breaths, close your eyes, talk slowly, and generally keep your cool. Don't let anyone catch you yelling, screaming, or throwing things in public. Do try not to do these things in private, either.


Remember that you'll often be able to get your point across more easily if you are not yelling.

, It is not classy to talk about how much money you make, how much money you have, how much money your new car/kicks/jacket/earrings cost, or that you just got another $10,000 raise. Don't talk about how much your parents, boyfriend, closest friend, or anyone else makes, either. It's just not classy.

, If you have class, live in a way of which you should be proud. If you have to be phony and deceptive, you should consider why this is. A person of honor and integrity never needs to hide behind a facade. If you can't show your true self to the world, who will people see? Just stop pretending. Though you may be tired of hearing that you should, ""be yourself,"" it's really true. If you're faking your whole image, you'll never really make it.


You don't have to be 100% yourself in ever single situation. You have to adapt depending on whether you're talking to a professor or your best friend. You should, however, always be yourself at your core.

, You must be courteous, but do not bend over backward to please others. If you do, you may find yourself being taken advantage of in the future. Limit your time and availability and draw boundaries with others so that they are aware of your limits. Do your own thing and get some ""me time"" to figure out who you really are instead of being obsessed with always having plans is very classy.


People will see you as a unique soul and will respect you even more.

, Avoid passive-aggressive thinking; it's likely to trip you up eventually. Assertiveness demonstrates maturity, thoughtfulness, and confidence. Class requires balance, and assertiveness is a prime example of this concept.

, When your group or date is speaking about a subject you don't know or understand, it is prudent to either state that you don't know much about the subject at hand; or if you want to carry the conversation, ask for more information about the subject. Not only does this show maturity, but it also shows that you are keeping an open mind.


People will respect you even more for admitting when you don't know something.

, The Golden Rule truly is a time honored guide for treating adults and children with class. Giving others advance notice before cancelling dinner invitations, speaking up for those who cannot stand up for themselves, calling your parents to update them on yourself, checking in with friends; these are all simple gestures that demonstrate your class and authenticity.


Ensure you choose friends who share your values.
Everyone should be treated as your equal until they prove to be inferior. Give people the benefit of the doubt.
Always, always respect your elders. Being rude to your elders is the ultimate sign of a lack of class.

, Do not berate yourself, but be receptive to constructive change. In our world, change is inevitable. Be a positive and flexible part of it, and show others the way as well. Face life rather than burying your head in the sand and others will know instinctively that you are someone whose opinion counts.


Take classes that teach you new skills and that help your improve yourself.
Remember that the learning process is never over. It's not classy to think you know everything.

, It is wise to become politically, culturally, and religiously aware. Even the most basic knowledge can save a person from embarrassment and awkwardness. If you know in advance that you will be spending time with someone of an unfamiliar background, it is a good idea to do more in-depth research to avoid embarrassing faux pas.



Be well read. This is an important part of being classy and being able to keep up a classy conversation.

, This is the kiss of death for the classy person. Only desperate times call for desperate measures. Take a deep breath, be strong, and move through the situation with elegance and grace. You will be the victor for it, no matter the outcome. If things get out of hand and you feel completely overwhelmed, ask for help from a close friend or family member.


It's classy to admit that you have a problem and to try to fix it. It's not classy to be in denial.

, Classy people leave their surroundings in a condition at least as good as they found them. Unless they are in a restaurant with wait staff whose job it is to do the clearing up, classy people insist on taking care of their own trash and baggage, not expecting others to pick up after them. When others do favors for them, while stuck-up or spoiled people assume it's only to be expected and ignore others' assistance, truly classy people are quick to notice and to express their gratitude and their appreciation.


If you're a house guest, clean up after yourself. If you borrowed a friend's car, fill it with gas before you return it.
If you made a mistake, take responsibility for it instead of blaming it on someone else.

, Truly classy people instinctively recoil at the thought of inconveniencing others, offending them, getting in other peoples' way, or in any way making nuisances of themselves. Classy people are all about minding their own business when among strangers and putting others at ease when in social situations. Truly classy people are gracious and affable to everyone, whether the CEO, the mail carrier, or the custodian.


Classy people know others' names and use them when greeting people they see regularly, whether the door attendant, the security guard, or the boss' wife. Classy people treat everyone the same--with courtesy and respect.

, If you want to be classy, then you shouldn't go hooking up with random people every night. If that's your thing, at least don't talk about it, brag about it, or walk around with lots of visible hickeys. Classy people don't kiss and tell, so don't divulge the details of your latest hook up session. Don't let people see you making out on the dance floor either, because guess what: that is not classy.


It's okay to experiment and have several sexual partners, but if you brag about it or treat it like a contest, you will run into trouble.

, Say, ""Yes, Ma'am,"" ""No, Sir,"" and, ""Thank you,"" as often as you can. Be polite to your elders. If you have to sneeze, sneeze into a tissue, not the air. Don't wipe your nose on your sleeve. Don't pick food out of your teeth in public. Generally, don't put your finger into your mouth or nose. Acquire at least basic table manners. Put a napkin on your lap before you eat a nice meal. Avoid scratching yourself in public. Don't brush your hair in public, apply make up in public, or pick at your clothes in public. Do these things in privacy; wait until you've found a bathroom or are alone. Don't break out in boisterous laughter.


Take an etiquette class if you need to.

, Don't get so wasted that you have no idea what happened the night before. That means no blacking out--and even no browning out. Keep your control; people should see you looking in charge of your own mind and body. If people see you stumbling around and slurring your speech at night, then there's no way people will think you're classy even if you're carrying around textbooks and looking classy during the day.


If you have gotten yourself in trouble more than a handful of times when you drink, then it may be time to stop.

Don't use bad behavior to get attention.",How to Be Cool1," It’s all very well to read books and blogs about self-improvement, but you have to actually get out there and apply the theories that resonate with you. Do it! It’s scary but so, so invigorating. Who knows that who you’ll meet and what they might be able to offer you? (Fun, intellectual stimulation, a pony ride, a job…)


Be a person of action, not a person of ideas.
Of course, thinking things through before jumping the gun is a great trait. But thinking things through and then not doing anything won't get you anywhere.;
, Remember people are not needy or desperate. Instead, try to solve problems yourself whenever you can. If you are not needy, people will want to help you or will ask for your help. This quality attracts people. Neediness is a big turn off unless you're really in a tight spot. This doesn't mean you should act invincible; just don't beg people for help, act like you can't be alone, or expect others to fix your problems.


Friendships are great, but don't act like you'll die if you have to spend a Friday night alone. Getting some alone time is great, too.
If someone hasn't called you back, lay off. There's no need to follow up with annoying text messages. Give people their space and they'll respect you a lot more.

, It will be something that other people will look up to. You are unique, and you don't need to join a clique. Make your own friendships. Being cool is being yourself in an outgoing way, even if you are quiet but not sullen and passive aggressive. Don't try to be like anyone else by copying someone else's moves or act, although trying out those acts is fine but if you do that on a regular basis, its going to come out as fake because its not a part of your personality and you are trying to be something you are not. Live life for who you are. Don't lose sight of yourself or your morals. Being cool isn't about changing who you are, its about being confident enough to let people see how awesome you really are.


If you don't let people see the real you, then what's the point? Being able to be yourself and to have people appreciate you is the coolest thing of all.
Own your personality. Your bad habits, your good things, your looks, your voice; anything which belongs to you. Own it and don't apologize for what you belong to you to anyone even if it is bad or you don't like it about your self. Remember we are all humans and we try accept each other despite all the flaws and qualities we have, why not accept yourself as you are the most important person to you in the world.
Write a list of all the goals you are aiming for. What essentially makes you cool is your identity. Try to find your talent - sports, music, art, whatever. People will notice your passion and respect you for it. You can also learn new skills and meet new people by trying new things.

, The more you disclose yourself the better you understand yourself. Self-disclosure is both the conscious and subconscious act of revealing more about oneself to others. This may include, but is not limited to: thoughts, feelings, aspirations, goals, failures, successes, fears, dreams as well as one's likes, dislikes and favorites.


Self-disclosure happens slowly. Don't tell the first person you meet at a party all about your personal life or things will quickly go south.

, Everyone loves someone who is outgoing, but nobody likes someone who is overly excited. Many people find someone who is overeager to be annoying. Try not to force yourself on people. Smile and strike up a conversation, but make sure you know the line between friendly and obsessive. When you meet a new person, take it easy, even if you think you're friend soul mates.


If you're too eager to hang out with a new person, then it might look like you don't have any other friends.
You can give someone a friendly compliment, but don't gush to the person about how amazing he or she is for half an hour.

, Everyone loves someone who knows what to say at the right moment. Don't dominate the conversation. You don't need to share a similar story at every setting. Just listen and comment briefly on the other person's story. Most of the time, it is much better to be sort of quiet and analyze the conversation, enjoying the humor of your friends and being a good listener.


Be a good listener. Try to make the other person feel important, but only if you can genuinely. False enthusiasm will just appear cruel. When you listen to people, it not only makes them feel good about themselves, but also about you. If you're stuck, remember the golden rule.
Most people want to talk about themselves. If you keep the conversation concentrated on others, then people will love to talk to you. Wait for the right moment to make a comment. If you come up into the middle of a quiet group of people, it is better to take a Tony Stark approach.
Be playful! Joke around with other people. Making fun of people is fine as long as you know your limits. Different people have different tolerance levels, so be sure that the people you're around know you're kidding.

, This may make you appear as ""fake"" or unable to grasp your respected language. Speak normally, clearly and confidently. If you feel it is necessary adopt a more formal register and use polysyllabic words, do so, but do not go overboard or you will appear pretentious. Finding the right balance in your speech is important to making you seem intelligent and somewhat sophisticated in the presence of your peers.

, Cool people know how to use humor to ease any situation. They don't get annoyed and angry, and no matter how many bad things happen to them, they can still joke about it. They are aware of others' emotions but don't let bad emotion affect them.


Learn how to laugh at yourself. Being cool doesn't mean being perfect, and being able to find humor in your moments of clumsiness and discomfort is the defining hallmark of being cool. People will not only respect you for it, but they'll like you for being human, just like them.
You can be cool and you can be too cool. People who are too cool take themselves too seriously to laugh at a goofy, obviously silly but funny joke. Don't be that person.

, Observe people who are ""cool""; they usually speak confidently and clearly, at a good pace. They don't chatter rapidly, pause, say uh, um..., or mumble. They say what they mean, and mean what they say. Be confident in your word and don't let anyone try to change it. If you state your opinion and people disagree, don't worry.


You said what you felt and people will respect you for that, unless you say it knowing it will offend someone. However, make it count. Don't shout out your opinion just to be heard. Make sure it's relevant, and be ready to back it up soundly.

, The very definition of cool is being calm, composed, under control, not excited, indifferent, and socially adept. Many times, cool people are those that don't get excited about things, that don't always have to talk, unless they have something cool to say. Learn how to deal with people. Don't get angry or frustrated. Being cool is natural. It's easy to do. Be confident.


Often times, the people who strive the hardest for coolness are sabotaging themselves by trying too hard. People like people who don't try, but are still successful. How does that work? One of the secrets of being cool is that, when one is just between trying and not trying at all, things just fall into place.

Take a deep breath. Being cool is all about being relaxed and comfortable in any circumstance. Don't lose your cool. If you feel yourself about to lose your temper, or burst into tears, or lose control in any way, take a deep breath and excuse yourself. Stay calm.


, There are many people who take up smoking, drinking, bullying, and other bad habits. Most often, this comes from negative reinforcement. After doing something bad, a person may be ""rewarded"" with attention. ""I can't believe he did that!"", people will say. It is easy to misinterpret attention as popularity, even if it's for doing something wrong. If you want to be cool, you need to know your limits.


You should never substitute negative attention for really being cool. Most of the time, the people who have bragging competitions about law-breaking and bonging beer do not fit into the category of cool. If a group of people doesn't like you for who you are and the lifestyle you've chosen, move on.
Don't do drugs. Real cool people know how to be cool without the influence of drugs and alcohol.
Don't smoke- it won't make you cool- it will make you smell bad. Other smokers won't notice the bad smell because they smell the same way. When you smoke you will most likely hang out with other smokers, and this limits your selection of boyfriends and girlfriends because most non-smokers hate the smell of smoke and won't want to be around you. Don't judge smokers- just don't take up a habit you will eventually pay someone to help you quit.
Avoid arguing. When you're cool, you realize winning an argument is pointless. When you know you're right you just know it. You don't need to waste time, effort and energy by attempting to persuade someone who hasn't seen the things you have seen.

Remember that people are your equals.,
Understand that some people won’t get it.,
Have faith in your friends.,
Don't be afraid to be different.,
Be self-aware.,
Relax.",How to Be Cool2," Even a group of people is equal to you. If you're talking to a potential employer, a group of wealthy donors, a child, a stranger, the president of the United States, or an attractive guy or girl, for example, remember they are neither better than you or worse than you are. They should be treated as you should be treated. Be respectful of other people, but expect that they will accept you as such.


When someone is disrespectful to you, ignore them until they figure it out. Not as if you didn't hear your antagonist, but casually and conversationally disregard their remarks. There is a reason that they didn't show respect towards you or the person didn't do what you asked of them.
People may be rude to you because they are unhappy, someone hurt them recently, you were disrespectful towards them, or because they were never taught the correct way to act around people. But always know it is for a reason, be willing to find out what the reason is as long as you want them to respect you.

, While it feels amazing to dazzle people with your quick wit, sometimes you will meet someone who just doesn’t get you. They’ll look at you quizzically and ask you to clarify what you thought was a cuttingly observant pop-culture reference. Doesn’t matter. What’s fascinating about humans is that they are so diverse.


Senses of humor vary wildly. If you’re getting blank looks, just be polite, excuse yourself, and chronicle any embarrassments later in a stand-up comedy routine.

, There’s a reason they hang around you. The personality traits you despise in yourself may be the very quirks they find endearing. Let them decide instead of presenting an incomplete version of yourself to the world. If you want to be cool, then you have to believe that the people around you genuinely like you and find your relationship meaningful.


Remember that it's not cool to hang out with people who you think are cool just because you think it'll make you cool by proxy. Life doesn't work that way.

, Whether that means standing up for yourself, defending someone else, or taking interest in something that no one else does, like playing an instrument, try to be different and stand out. The coolest people are the ones who occasionally break against the tide and make people question the status quo. Insecure people will, at times, become jealous of you. These people will try to get to you, in an attempt to take the attention off of you and bestow it upon themselves.


The important thing to remember is not to smile in weakness; just ignore them. Not as if you didn't hear your antagonist, but casually and conversationally disregard their remarks.

, There's a difference in letting people's judgments affect your self esteem, and being aware of how you come off to others. What you are really doing is being aware of how you look from another person's perspective. In terms of physical appearance: beware of food getting stuck in your teeth, bad breath, body odor, toilet paper stuck to your shoe, etc. In terms of composure; be smiley, stand/sit up straight (it makes you look and feel more confident), smile generously, be polite and considerate, etc.


Definitely be aware of your body language at all times; analyzing body language can be a useful tool in knowing how to present yourself.
Knowing how you come off during school, during a soccer match, or at a party can help you have a sense of what people think of you, and to adjust your actions accordingly. It doesn't mean that you have to change for you are, but if you're at a party, it's good to notice if you're completely dominating a conversation and even boring people so you can back off a bit.

, Seriously. Constantly telling yourself that you're crap at socializing creates anxieties that play on your mind the next time you converse with someone. You then focus on said anxieties, and the whole thing becomes one big cycle of self-fulfillment. If you're always nervous about what can go wrong in a social situation, you won't be able to appreciate things that are going right.


If you're nervous or anxious, other people will be able to tell, and they will feed off of your nervous energy, creating even more anxiety. Instead, be calm and make people feel like they are more calm in your presence and they will be drawn to you.
It's okay to freak out to a trusted friend if you need to once in a while. Just don't get a reputation for being a person who is always freaking out.

Present yourself in a positive way.,
Be fit!,
Practice good hygiene.,
Project confident body language.,
Find your own style.",How to Be Cool3," Walk with good posture and look people in the eye. If you slump or stare at your feet, people won't respect you. You have to look and feel confident in order to receive the respect you need. Don't walk too fast either because it looks like you are running away.


Smile. Be a habitual, unrepentant over-smiler, with every grin being a genuine one. If you smile when you meet someone, you instantly appear confident, friendly and relaxed. Confident, friendly, relaxed people are much more appealing than their uptight compadres.

, Being fit will raise your self-esteem and will make you look at the world in a more positive light. This doesn't mean that you need a six pack to be cool, but it does mean that taking care of your body is definitely cool. Try to exercise regularly, go to the gym, or play a sport and keep in good shape. Eat healthy too. Having the energy to be involved in many things is something that not everyone is born with, so try to workout. You will see results if you work hard.


Know that you will never be able to please everyone. Try hard, but don't be so concerned with judging yourself or being judged by others. People have millions of ways to get under your skin. Learn to spot them and become immune. Be happy with yourself and do what you enjoy.

, Be sure to brush your teeth every morning and every night. And whenever you can, even after lunch. Wear perfume (if you're a girl) and spray on a bit, just a bit of cologne (if you're a boy). Shower every day and wear deodorant. Also use lotion so that your skin is not ashy and put on some lip balm if your lips are dry. You should wash your face every morning to keep fresh and pimple free.


You don't have to spend hours on your looks each day to be cool. But hey, 20-30 minutes spent showering and grooming won't kill you.

, If you want to look cool, then your body has to project confidence at all times. If you're talking to someone, make eye contact, use your hands to gesture, and sit or stand with good posture. Smile, even if you're feeling a little nervous, and don't fidget with your hands or look at the floor when you're talking to someone, or you won't look like you believe what you say.

, As long as your personality shines through, you can wear whatever you like. Guys have been known to get girlfriends even though they wear sweats all the time. Some of the dorkiest, ""uncool"" guys are known to get girlfriends because everyone has a different perception of cool. That is definitely an affirmation of coolness.


You don't have to follow trends to be cool; you just have to be able to look comfortable and happy in whatever you are wearing.

Increase your motivation.",How to Be Consistent," Consistency is a fantastic trait and one that you should definitely work to cultivate. Remember, however, that it's a trait that can take time to practice. You won't be perfectly consistent right away. That's okay! Be kind to yourself when you screw up.


Don't make a generalized ""be more consistent"" plan. Trying to be more consistent in general is just going to be overwhelming. Think about what specific areas in your life require more consistency. Do you need to be consistent about your exercise habits? Do you need to be consistent about your work requirements? Your romantic relationships?
You're not going to be consistent 100% of the time. You need to be okay with making mistakes and occasionally getting lax about your consistent habits.;
, You can't have consistency without improving your willpower. Consistency requires willpower to achieve, because consistency tends to lean towards going to the gym every day, even when you don't feel like it, for example. To do that, you need to have the willpower to do it.Have tricks to boost your willpower. It's really hard to just force yourself through things and not always the best way to accomplish something. For example, if you're trying to be consistent about eating in a healthy way, make sure that you have healthy options on hand for when you're hungry, rather than just going for the unhealthy option.Avoid situations where you will be forced to exert considerable amounts of willpower in order to be consistent. To use the healthy eating example again, don't go grocery shopping after a long, difficult day at work. You'll be more likely to just go for the fastest, easiest option (rarely the healthiest) instead of being consistent about your diet.

, Being consistent means that you don't say one thing while actually doing something else. You can't be inconsistent in your behavior and expect yourself to behave consistently in other parts of your life.


For example, if you're looking to be more consistent in your relationship with your significant other, and you tell them that you're going to be better about doing your fair share of the chores, being consistent means that you actually follow through by doing your fair share of the chores.
Try to avoid making claims that you can't back up with your actions. There is no shame in admitting you don't yet know how to do something. For example, if you're tasked with something at work that you haven't done before or don't know how to do, don't pretend like you've got everything under control. Instead, ask for some assistance and show your willingness to fill in the gaps in your knowledge.

, Negative thinking is the bane of consistency and of willpower. When you think negatively you are making yourself less likely to be able to hold to your consistent actions.


Pay attention to negative thought patterns that will hinder you in the future. There are specific thoughts that have a tendency to run your life: ""I can't do this,"" ""I'm stupid (lazy, etc. etc.).""
When you do notice these negative thought patterns, turn them around or introduce a more positive or neutral thought. So for example if you find yourself thinking ""I can't do this"" instead turn it around and think ""I'm going to practice doing this, even if I'm not great at it to start with.""
Figure out what areas you need to work on to make yourself more likely to be consistent. Everyone has areas of themselves that could do with a little work. Perhaps you're really great at being consistent at work, but at home you're constantly forgetting to do all the things you need to.

, General consistency is great, but being consistent is a lot easier and more likely to succeed if you set specific goals. These goals will help you behave consistently and give you something to strive for. You can set a variety of goals in different areas of your life


Consider how you want to use consistency to achieve your specific goals. For example, if your specific goal is to lose weight, you would need to work on being consistent with exercise, with your diet (eating healthy foods), etc.
As another example: if you want to get a book published, you would need to be consistent about writing each day, about devoting time to editing, about figuring out the publishing world, and sending your manuscript off.
A list of goals might look something like this: save up money for retirement, be on time to work, remember to help your significant other at home, getting all your reading completed for your class. Being consistent will mean setting aside a part of your paycheck each month, setting your alarm clock for earlier, taking care of the baby so your significant other can have certain nights off, and carving out time to do all the reading for your class.

, If you try to do everything at once all you're going to do is overwhelm yourself. It will make it a lot harder for you to be consistent. Make gradual changes instead of jumping in head first. If you can do something for three weeks, it will become part of your routine. Pick 1 thing you'll work to be consistent in for a month. When that month is up, add another thing to be consistent in.
For example: If you have a goal to be a better team player at work, choose a few things that will help you achieve that goal. For a month, practice deferring to others in group projects, or finding ways to incorporate your ideas into theirs. Once you've gotten a handle on that, add another change to your routine.

, Boundaries will make it easier to be consistent, because then you have a specific limit in which to function, rather than a vague ""I'm going to be consistent."" Setting a boundary really just means setting constraints on exactly how and when you're going to do certain things.


For example: instead of just saying ""I'm going to be consistent about appreciating my significant other"" you might say ""I'm going to thank my significant other when they do things like wash the dishes or make dinner or help out around the house.""
Another example might be making quality markers for your work. This would mean figuring out certain standards to set. This could mean having your boss at work describe what they thought your best work has been, and trying to make your work consistently up to that standard.

, To be consistent you have to make sure that you recognize when you don't come up to the standards and goals that you've set. When you don't act consistently with your goals.On a calendar write down each day whether you succeeded or failed in following your consistency goals. If you failed, explain why you didn't follow them. This will help keep you accountable to when you don't follow your goals and your boundaries and will also serve as a marker of your progress.
Tell people you trust about your goals and your attempts to be consistent about various aspects of your life. When they see you not behaving consistently, give them permission to call you out.
Don't beat yourself up when you don't hit the mark. No one is perfect and no one is perfectly consistent. You aren't going to be, either. What matters is that you keep working towards your goals and towards consistency.

, Visualization, though it may sound silly, can actually aid you a lot if you use it properly. You want to use realistic visualization, that considers the obstacles and set-backs that you may face. Daydreaming can also be useful, as long as you limit your time doing it. Give your mind time to range freely each night before you go to bed. This can help you process and assess situations, and help you to keep your consistency and goals, because you'll come up with ways to get past the potential obstacles that might keep you from gaining this skill.
Meditation can help control your mind, and you'll need to control your mind (and all its urges) if you want to remain consistent. try to practice meditating for at least 15 minutes each day. Sit somewhere quietly and breathe deeply. As you breathe focus on your breath. If you find your mind straying, direct your attention back to your breath.

, Everyone fails. It doesn't matter how dedicated you are, how intelligent you are, how prepared you are, you aren't always going to succeed. You have to be willing to entertain that possibility and figure out what to do if you don't succeed. How are you going to handle failure?A lot of times the reason people fail to maintain their willpower and their consistency is because they haven't planned for failure. Individual failures mean little to your overall success (for example, getting rejected by the literary agent has only a marginal impact on your overall ability to be published).
Plan for your setbacks and failures. If that literary agent rejects your manuscript figure out where next to send it, or look it over to see what might be improved.
Consistency doesn't equal perfection, remember. For example, yes a good writer should try to write every day. Life sometimes gets into the way, sometimes you're sick, sometimes you simply don't write. If you start beating yourself up for not writing, you'll make yourself less rather than more likely to be consistent.

, If you don't stay motivated you won't make those changes in your life that allow you to be consistent. You'll fall back into old, less good, patterns of behavior, instead of sticking with the new patterns you're trying to create.

Don't tell yourself ""I'm not motivated"" or even ""I'm not feeling motivated today."" The more you skip days when you're trying to instill new patterns of thought in yourself, the less likely you are to succeed. Instead, tell yourself ""I'm going to practice being motivated today even if I don't feel like it."" If you're having a difficult day and you don't want to, for example, do any writing, do less than you normally do. if you write for an hour, cut that down to half an hour, or only write a paragraph instead of a page.
Don't try to do too many things at one time. This has been mentioned before, but it's worth repeating. Sort your different goals out one or two at a time. If you're trying to finish your manuscript and improve your consistency at work, and get into shape, you're going to burnout quickly. Instead, work on improving your work ethic and your writing ethic before adding in your exercise ethic.
Remind yourself why consistency is important to you. What is it you're trying to accomplish by being consistent? What happens if you fail to be consistent? Keeping these things in mind when you're trying to accomplish your goals and be consistent.

Devote a little time each day to personal hygiene and making sure you're presenting yourself well. Shower daily, brush and floss your teeth, and groom your skin and hair.
Dress for confidence. You don't have to buy a whole new wardrobe to feel better in your clothes. As long as you're clean, comfortable, and feel good, you're set up for confidence! Remember, you look more confident when you are enjoying what you wear!
After all, you wouldn't wear a three-piece suit on a pizza delivery. If you think you look good, odds are you probably do.;
, How you carry yourself communicates a lot to other people, so make sure you're telling them that you're confident and in-charge. Keep your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your chin high. Walk with purpose instead of dragging your feet, and sit up straight. When you look like a confident person on the outside, you'll be approached as one by the world around you.


You won't only fool everyone else -- you'll fool yourself too. Recent research shows that the positioning of your body cues your mind to feel a certain way -- so positioning yourself confidently will make you genuinely feel in charge. And to top it off, having confident body language has been linked to lower levels of stress, too. , Keep your grin in easy reach -- you'd be surprised how even the smallest of smiles can disarm many a social situation and make everyone feel more comfortable. In fact, research shows that smiling reduces stress hormones in the brain. Can you imagine approaching someone who's scowling? No, thank you.


If you're worried your smile is fake, keep it small. A fake smile can be spotted from a mile away. On the other hand, if you're genuinely happy to see them -- or just happy for the chance to practice your new confidence skills -- flash those pearly white teeth.

, It's a subtle change, but it can work wonders on how other people perceive you. Don't be afraid to meet the gaze of someone else; it shows not only that you are a person worthy of communicating with, but it tells them you respect them, acknowledge their presence, and are interested in the conversation. You don't want to be rude, do you?!


Our eyes are uniquely human. They are windows to the soul, if you will, and showcase our attention and feelings. By making eye contact, you will improve the quality of your interactions in addition to appearing more confident. In fact, you'll come off as more likeable and trustworthy and those who converse with you will feel more appreciated.If you can't do it for you, do it for them!

, If you see a person huddled in the corner pretending to play games on their mobile phone, are you really going to come up and say hello? Probably not. If you want others to approach you, make sure you're approachable!


Keep your body open. If you have your arms and legs crossed, you're telling the world that you're not interested in welcoming them in. Same goes for your face and hands -- if it's clear you're preoccupied with something else (be it a thought or your iPhone), people will take the hint.

, Now that you've got the eye contact thing down, it's time to put it into practice. Did you know that other people are just as shy about eye contact as you are? Try this out: make eye contact with someone and see who lasts longer. Do they avert their gaze before you? See?! They're uncomfortable too!


wikiHow isn't advocating staring someone down, you know. Staring intensely at someone until they feel your gaze and shrink accordingly due to palpable awkwardness is not the goal. The goal is, however, to recognize that other people are just as nervous about you looking at them as you are about them looking at you. If you get caught, just smile. You're off the hook.

, No matter how down you feel, try to pat yourself on the back a little and remember the things you excel at. Focusing on your better attributes will distract you from perceived flaws and boost your sense of worth. Think of your good qualities in looks, friendships, talents, and most of all, personality.


Think back on compliments from other people. What have they told you about you that you otherwise haven't noticed or acknowledged? Maybe they've remarked on your smile, or your ability to stay cool and collected in stressful situations.
Remember past accomplishments. It can be something other people recognized, like being at the top of your class, or something only you know about, like a quiet act of service to make life easier for someone else. Realize how great this was. You go!
Think about the qualities you try to cultivate. No one's perfect, but if you're actively trying to be an honorable, good person, give yourself some credit for effort. The fact that you think about bettering yourself at all says that you're humble and good-hearted, and those are positive attributes.

Now write down everything you can think of and refer back to it next time you're feeling down. Add to it as you remember more things you can take pride in doing.



, Take a piece of paper and write all the things that you think are keeping you from becoming confident, e.g., bad grades, introversion, not many friends, etc. Now ask yourself this: Is that valid or logical? Or are these just assumptions on my part? FYI, the answers are ""no"" and ""yes,"" respectively. How in the world does it make sense that one thing determines your self-worth? It doesn't!


Here's an example: You didn't get good grades on your last math test, so as a result you're not confident when it comes to your next test. But ask yourself this: If you studied really hard, worked with the teacher, and prepared for the test, would you do better?! YES. That was just one event and has nothing to do with you. You have absolutely ZERO reasons not to be confident.

, Some people are good at hiding it, but nearly every person has struggled with his or her self-confidence at one point. You're not alone! And if you can think of someone who's confident, odds are there's a situation they're not confident in. Confidence is rarely universal.


Here's a true fact for you: Most people are too preoccupied with how they appear to be constantly judging you. Ever notice how people love talking and looking in things that are even just barely reflective? 99% of people are inwardly focused. Breathe a sigh of relief and recognize that you don't have to be perfect all the time.
Stop comparing yourself with everyone else. Not everything is a competition, and viewing life that way will wear you out. You don't have to be the smartest, prettiest, most popular person in order to be happy. If you have a strong competitive streak that you can't completely ignore, try competing with yourself instead and strive to keep getting better.

, Having confidence isn't a finish line you cross once, and the process won't always move forward — there will be days when you feel like you're starting from square one. Take a deep breath, remember the self-confidence hurdles you've already cleared, and resolve to keep going. In the toughest of times, it is good to make it your duty to pat yourself on the back even if you didn't do anything.


Odds are you won't really realize you're confident until you already are. Was there a day you realized you were smart, funny, resourceful, or punctual? Probably not. So if you don't see immediate changes, know that it's just because you're too close to the painting. Can't see the forest through the trees, type of thing. You get it.

, No, it's not Maybelline. When you popped out of your mother's womb, you didn't really care who heard you crying or how soft your head was. You just were. It was society that pointed a finger at you and made you feel as if you had to measure up. It was learned. You know what they say about learned things? They can be unlearned.


Tap into that confidence that you were born with. It's there, it's just buried under years of exposure to praise, threats, and perceived judgments. Take everyone else out of the picture. They don't matter. They have nothing to do with you. ""You"" is good. ""You"" exists apart from any other judgment.

, A lack of confidence has nothing to do with the external world, so you have to get out of your head. If you catch yourself having an inner dialogue, just stop. The world is swirling around you -- swirl with it. The only moment that exists is now. Don't you want to be a part of it?


So much of the world exists outside your head (if we're going with the assumption that reality is as it seems). Constantly thinking about what you feel or look like takes you out of the moment. Practice not thinking about the past or the future. Concentrate on what's in front of you -- there's probably something exciting about it.

, If there's a sport or hobby you've always wanted to be good at, now's the time! Improving your skills will reinforce that you are talented, and subsequently boost your confidence. Learn a musical instrument or a foreign language, take up an art form like painting, start building projects—whatever it is that catches your interest.


Don't get discouraged if you're not immediately awesome. Remember that learning is a process, and you're in it for the small victories and the relaxing recreation time, not to be the best ever.
Take up a hobby you can do with a group. Finding like-minded people who share your interests can be an easy way to make friends and build confidence. Look around your community for groups you can join, or find kinship with fellow hobbyists.

, Straight up, confidence is more than just a state of mind -- it's habit. That's all humans really are. So in order to be confident, you've gotta do confident things. One of those is making conversation with strangers. It's intimidating at first, but with each time you'll be more and more unfazed.


No, that won't creep strangers out unless you're a smelly, aggressive Quasimodo-looking KKK member. If someone says, ""Hey!"", smiles at you, and asks you whether they should go to Starbucks or Coffee Bean, how are you going to feel? Probably good. Everybody likes to be the hero, talk to other people, and be spontaneous.You're just brightening up their otherwise dull day.
You don't have opportunities, huh? How about the barista at your coffee shop? The girl at the check-out counter of your grocery store? Random strangers you pass on the street?

, Being able to say you're sorry is a good trait (and something too many people struggle with). However, be careful to say it only when necessary. Apologizing when you've slighted or inconvenienced someone is polite; apologizing when you haven't done anything wrong, though, can make you feel subordinate and like you should be sorry. Before it slips out of your mouth, take a second to make sure this is a situation that actually needs an apology from you.


Use workarounds. You can express your sympathy or regret without actually apologizing. For instance, if you're worried about inconveniencing someone, you could say ""I hope this hasn't been too much trouble"" instead of automatically reverting to ""I'm sorry.""
Apologizing needlessly makes you seem unsure of yourself. That doesn't make sense because you are inferior to no one. Why apologize if you didn't do anything wrong? After all, do you really mean it? And if you apologize all the time, it loses value. Being sorry for everything means you're sorry for nothing. Think of ""I'm sorry"" like ""I love you."" It should only be said with care.

, Don't just roll your eyes and shrug it off — own it! You deserved it! Make eye contact, smile, and say ""thank you."" Being nice about it when someone else wants to compliment you doesn't compromise your humility; it shows that you're polite and have a secure sense of self-worth.


Pay a compliment in return. If you're still uncomfortable taking compliments, try giving one back after you've accepted. This can help you feel like the score is ""even"" and you haven't been too prideful.

, Take time to pay someone else a compliment, or do an unannounced good deed. You'll brighten their day, and you'll feel better about yourself. When you become a source for positivity, others will seek to be around you, bolstering the good vibes.


Lots of people aren't good at receiving compliments. Odds are if you give someone one they'll respond with one in turn. Just make sure you mean it or they might respond skeptically -- ""Hey, I really like that shirt you're wearing. Was it made in China?"" might not get the best response.

, It's hard to be confident in a group of people that you feel are constantly judging you. You could naturally be the most extroverted, loud, self-assured person, but with these people, you turn into a puppy dog that hasn't been cared for well enough. Those people need to be dropped like a bad habit. And now.


It's important that you surround yourself with others who you feel make you feel like you're the best version of you there could possibly be. It's only around these people that you'll be able to make the growth you want to (and can!) make.

, A lot of people don't do crowds. Even more people don't do public speaking. If you find yourself in one of these arenas, it's important to slow down. When we're nervous, we tend to speed up just to get everything over with. Don't do that. It's clue one that you're nervous. And you're cuing yourself that you're nervous too!


Point number one is breathe. When we take short, sharp breaths, we're cuing ourselves to fight or flight. Cut that out and you calm down a notch automatically. Humans aren't rocket science, luckily.
Point number two is to consciously slow down your actions. Think of a six-year-old on a sugar high -- that's you right now. Match your actions to your breathing. Bingo. Serenity.

, A lot of life is a self-fulfilling prophecy. When we think we'll fail, we don't really try as hard. When we think we're not good enough, we often act not good enough. If you expect success, you may just draw it out. Pessimism can actually undermine your abilities.Right now you're probably saying, ""I'm no accurate predictor of the future! Expecting success isn't logical -- weren't you just pushing logic a second ago?!"" Well, yes, but think of it this way: you often expect failure, so why not expect success? They're both possible circumstances and in most, one is not more likely than the other. BOOM. Schooled.

, Sometimes the only way out is through. In order to get good at life, you've gotta encounter experiences that force you to learn. You can't be awesome at it right off the bat. If you keep doing what you've always done, you'll never get better at...anything. You gotta take chances to grow.


Failure is inevitable. It always happens. And it doesn't matter. The only part that matters is that you get back up. Everyone experiences set backs, but not everyone gets back up. It's the getting back up that builds confidence, and you've got to fail in the first place to do so.

Bathe as part of your foreplay.",How to Wash Your Vagina," Avoid using soaps with heavy perfumes, or gels or antiseptics, which may throw off the balance of healthy bacteria and irritate the sensitive skin around your vagina.The actual vagina (the inner canal) is ""self-cleaning"" and doesn't require washing; soap is likely to irritate the vagina if you try to use it on the vagina itself. You don't need to wash the vagina, just the area around the vagina (the vulva), using a plain, unperfumed soap, using the steps that follow.;
, Use your fingers to pull your labia away from your clitoris. Gently wipe the skin on both sides of your clitoris with the washcloth.

, Also, clean around your bikini line.

, The perineum is the area between your vagina and your anus.

, Keep your washcloth from touching your vaginal area after you've washed your anus. Doing this will ensure that you don't drag rectal germs toward your vaginal area. These germs can cause you to get urinary tract infections., If you have sex, you may want to wash it a second time to feel fresh and clean, although washing after sex will not prevent pregnancy on its own., Thick pubic hair can cause you to sweat down below, which may make you have some issues with odor. However keep in mind that pubic hair removal naturally irritates and inflames the hair follicles left behind, leaving microscopic open wounds. Rather than suffering a comparison to a bristle brush, frequent hair removal is necessary to stay smooth, causing regular irritation of the shaved or waxed area. When that irritation is combined with the warm moist environment of the genitals, it becomes a happy culture medium for some of the nastiest of bacterial pathogens, namely Group A Streptococcus, Staphylococcus aureus and its recently mutated cousin methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There is an increase in staph boils and abscesses, necessitating incisions to drain the infection, resulting in scarring that can be significant. It is not at all unusual to find pustules and other hair-follicle inflammation papules on shaved genitals. Pubic hair is there for a reason, and while you should feel free to remove it if you wish, it may not be the best choice for hygiene.


For a middle ground, try simply trimming your pubic hair, but be careful with scissors around your labia.

, Change your pad or your tampon frequently, according to the directions on the package. If you're worried about how you smell when you're having your period, you can wash your vagina 2 or 3 times a day.

Your doctor will examine your genital area and likely perform a speculum exam and collect a sample of any vaginal discharge, which will be examined under a microscope. Your doctor may also look for and ask about the symptoms of thrush, which include: An abnormal vaginal discharge. The discharge may appear like cottage cheese, with whitish lumps that do not have an odor.
Swelling on and around the genital area
Soreness, itchiness, or a burning sensation in the genital area
Your doctor may also ask you if you feel any pain or discomfort during sex or when you urinate.;
, Your doctor may prescribe oral antifungal drugs, like fluconazole or itraconazole, or antifungal drugs that you apply directly to your vagina, like miconazole or clotrimazole. These antifungal drugs only work exclusively on vaginal thrush.


You may experience more intense burning and itching in your genital area during the first few days of treatment but your symptoms should clear up within seven to 14 days. These medications have a “cure rate” of around 80-90%.

, If you have experienced a vaginal fungal infection before and your doctor confirms that you have vaginal thrush, you can take OTC antifungal drugs, which have a lower concentration of the antifungal agents found in prescription antifungal medications.


Most OTC medications have a one-day to seven-day dose. Take a single dose, as it is usually the most effective for occasional vaginal thrush. If you get repeat infections, take the longer dose medications. Do not take OTC medications if you believe you have any other infection besides vaginal thrush.
Some patients experience more burning from the one-day treatment. If this is the case, you should switch to one of the longer treatments.
If you experience a lot of irritation or burning on the outside of your vagina, apply A&D ointment liberally to the area (but not inside the vagina) to help relieve symptoms.
OTC medications are also recommended if your symptoms are relatively mild, you experience no fever or pelvic pain and you are not pregnant. If you think you may be pregnant or are pregnant and develop vaginal thrush, you should speak to your doctor.

, Though you may be trying to avoid a trip to the doctor, it is important that you at least call your primary care physician before attempting any home treatments. Though there may be much anecdotal evidence behind some of these methods, they have not been proven to work, and they may in fact make matters worse, causing further irritation and/or infections., Yogurt can help to repopulate your vagina with harmless bacteria that can “crowd out” the Candida bacteria, though this is not supported by many scientific studies.Do not insert yogurt into your vagina. This is an old treatment and can be associated with doing more harm than good, as the sugars in the yogurt can lead to more problems, such as other infections.

, Probiotic capsules can be found in most grocery stores and drugstores. Look for a brand that contains Bifidobacterium longum; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Bifidobacterium infantis; Lactobacillus acidophilus; Lactobacillus reuteri HA-188. Keep in mind it is not medically known if probiotics can help to prevent vaginal thrush., You can use OTC creams and gels for vaginal yeast infections to treat vaginal thrush, as they contain antifungal agents. Look for common brands like Monistat and Gyne-Lotrimin at your local drug store. Use them according to the instructions on the label.


If you have recurring infections, use them for seven days. Use a single dose treatment if you have occasional infections.

, While douching is generally not recommended for women— and there is no evidence to support it use — it can be used as a home treatment method when you have vaginal thrush. Discuss this with your doctor before attempting. You can douche with the following substances:Pure apple cider vinegar: Apple cider vinegar can restore the acidic pH of your vagina and is also an antibacterial agent. Douche twice a day for four days and then daily until your vaginal thrush symptoms disappear.Diluted hydrogen peroxide: Combine 3% hydrogen peroxide with an equal amount of warm distilled water and douche your vagina with this mixture. Make sure you use distilled water, so it will be sterile and bacteria-free. Douche twice a day with this mixture for four days and then daily until your vaginal thrush symptoms disappear.Essential tea tree oil: Put two to three drops of tea tree oil into eight ounces of distilled water. Douche with this mixture twice a day for one week and then daily until all symptoms of your vaginal thrush disappear. Do not ingest the tea tree oil orally., It is thought by some that inserting a whole clove of peeled garlic into your vagina can treat vaginal thrush.Replace the garlic with a fresh clove every four hours for seven days or until your symptoms go away.


Again, it is important to note that there is no scientific evidence to support this and that inserting something foreign into your vagina may cause more harm than good.
You can also consume garlic orally, either on its own, or in cooking.

, As you recover from vaginal thrush, you should focus on keeping your genital area clean and dry. Wash your vagina with water and mild soap or no soap. Pat it dry or air dry it after washing.


When wiping yourself after going to the bathroom, use soft white toilet paper and always wipe from front to back.

, Breathable fabrics like cotton ensure your vagina can breathe and is not irritated due to sweating during the day.


When washing your underwear, you should use mild, fragrance-free soap. Avoid using fabric softeners or dryer sheets, as these can contain chemicals that may irritate your vagina.

, These substances can irritate your vagina and delay the treatment of vaginal thrush.


You should also avoid taking bubble baths, using bath oils, talc, or powder. Make sure to avoid powders that contain cornstarch, as cornstarch provides food for microorganisms.

, Tampons can irritate your vagina and slow down the treatment process, so it's best to avoid them while you recover.

, Though vaginal thrush cannot be spread through sexual contact, you should still use condoms when having sex to prevent the spread of other diseases or infections.

Rotate your hips.,
Land on your feet.",How to Do a Round Off in Gymnastics," You’ll step off from, and land on your dominant leg. It’s helpful to know which side of your body is your dominant side. Generally, it’s the hand you write with or kick a soccer ball with.


This is the side you’ll want to use when you step off for your round off.;
, The quarter-turn action is the beginning step of a round off before your last foot even leaves the floor. It helps to make sure you have the hip movement and hand placement right before moving into the rest of the round off.









Your hands will form a diamond shape in the space between your forefingers and thumbs. This is for stability and safety.It’s a good idea to practice hand placement before tackling the whole move.
Since your hips will be rotating, it's a good idea to practice the rotation motion.
To practice the quarter-turn:

Face forward with your legs together, arms by your sides.
Bend your dominant leg and lean forward with your weight on that leg.
Reach your other leg behind you. Your torso should be parallel to the ground.
Reach your arms out straight above your head.
Place your dominant hand down onto the ground and rotate your hips, lifting the opposite leg high into the air., With your dominant leg, start running into your round off. The momentum of starting with speed helps to get your legs into the air easier.









Just before you start the round off, make sure you have a hurdle run. That means you’ll make a short skip with both legs bent before leaping into the round off.Keep your head tucked in, rather than up or out. This avoids an unnecessary arch in your back.

, After you’ve taken a step with your dominant leg (the skip from your running start), put your arms straight up in the air and step down onto the ground with that dominant foot.Keep your leg bent while you step down.
As you’re stepping down with your dominant leg, the other leg should be coming up behind you.
Your hands should be out in front of you, palms open, waiting to catch your controlled fall.

, For this part of the move, it’s important to keep your form controlled so you don’t injure yourself or wobble. This will speed up your learning and reduce practice time.


Rotate your hips about 90 degrees.
Make sure your back is straight as you step into the round off.
Keep your eyes forward and down.
As you reach your hands out in front of you, mold them into the T position so they’re ready for landing.
Think quickly, you only have a few seconds to complete the entire move.

, As your body rolls forward, bring your back leg up over your head while reaching your non-dominant hand closer to the ground. Lift the dominant leg that’s touching the ground, straightening it.









This all happens in one swift motion.
Aim your non-dominant hand to land right next to your dominant hand. You want your forefingers and thumbs to be touching.
As you bring your back leg up, keep your leg straight and strong.

, Set your non-dominant hand down on the ground next to your dominant hand, with the diamond shape between them.


Make sure your back and hips are straight, feet pointed.

, Now that both hands are on the floor supporting your weight, pull your legs together so that they’re touching.


Pull your legs together just before they’re vertical in the air.Keep your legs high in the air as you pull them together. Don’t lower or tuck them just yet., With your legs pulled together in the air, rotate your hips about 90 degrees. As you do this, your hands will start to come up off the ground. Your feet begin to make their way toward the ground behind you.









You’re positioning yourself to land with both feet on the ground.
Stop rotating when your body is aligned and you’re facing the direction you started from.
You’re doing this as you’re in the air landing, so make your rotation as smooth as possible.

, Push off with your hands, curving your back a little bit. Land on the ground with both feet at the same time. Bring your arms up over your head, next to your ears.Push through your shoulders, not your elbows.
When you land, bend your knees a little bit to absorb some of the shock of the landing."

Get in the breakaway position.,
Look and reach for the breakaway handle.,
Pull the breakaway handle while looking at your reserve handle.,
Pull the reserve ripcord.,
Use your steering cables and get into the landing position.",How to Survive if Your Parachute Fails to Open1," If your main parachute is malfunctioning or has become tangled, it's important that you can break away from it before deploying your reserve or else the reserve parachute may become tangled. To get in the breakaway position, spread your legs to reduce your velocity and keep your head up with your back arched.Being in the wrong position could get you entangled in your main chute.
You must break away at a minimum of 1,600 feet to allow you enough time to fully deploy your reserve.;
, Make sure to take the time to look down at the lever that you're pulling. The release is typically found on the right-hand side, but you should talk to your skydiving instructor before you jump. Grab onto the handle with both hands and prepare to pull. The breakaway handle will look like a cloth loop on the strap of your parachute pack.

, Once you pull the breakaway handle, throw it away. Keep your eyes on the reserve handle. When falling at incredible speeds in a high-stress situation you are more prone to becoming nervous or confused. Keep your concentration on the thing you must do next. The breakaway handle will release your main parachute so that your reserve does not become entangled.


You do not have to pull the breakaway handle if your main parachute did not deploy. Just pull your reserve ripcord.

, With both hands, pull the reserve ripcord and deploy your secondary chute. The reserve ripcord can usually be found on your left-hand side. The reserve static line lanyard is a system that should automatically deploy your secondary shoot if you detach from your main parachute, but should not be relied on in the case of a malfunction.The reserve will be on the other side of your breakaway handle and will usually be either a red cloth loop or loop made of metal., Look up to make sure that your reserve has successfully deployed and prepare to land. You'll have less time to prepare for your landing because you're using your reserve, so execution is crucial. To assume the landing position, point your feet to the ground with your heels up, and try to absorb the shock from landing with your legs. Use the steering cables to your left and right to guide you. Find a suitable place to land, like an empty field. Avoid cliffs or other dangerous objects like power lines.To move to the left, simply pull the left cable. To move to the right, pull the right cable."

Protect your head and roll if you can.",How to Survive if Your Parachute Fails to Open2," If your main parachute malfunctions or fails to open and your reserve chute also doesn't work, it's natural to think the worst and prepare for death. However, it's imperative that you keep your wits about you so that you can plan how and where you fall to increase your chance of survival. Concentrate each incremental step that you'll have to take in order to increase your chances of survival.Regulate your breathing and clear your mind as you're falling. Inhale deeply through your nose and out of your mouth., Emulate the skydiver pose and try to get as flat as possible horizontally so that you can reduce your speed. The front of your body should be facing the ground and your arms should be raised above your head so that you achieve the most drag that you can in your situation. Arch your head and back upward.

, Tree branches or snow can help absorb your impact and slow your descent before you make contact with the hard ground. Avoid hard objects like concrete, buildings, or flat fields. Aim for hilly areas as the decline can help absorb some of the impact as you fall.Steer left or right by lowering your elbow and leaning into the direction that you want to turn. To move backward, bend your knees and push your arms forward. To move forward, straighten your legs and put your arms to your sides., As you approach the ground, you want to adjust yourself, so you land on your feet. Put your feet together with your heels up and pointed towards the ground. Flex both your knees and hips and prepare for an intense impact., If you are freefalling over a body of water and can't aim towards a marshy or wooded area, you must tighten your body and fall feet first. Fall straight with your hands to your sides and your feet close together., Make contact to the ground in the skydiver's landing stance, with your feet pointed towards the ground and your heels up. Landing on your feet can help your legs can absorb some of the impact from the fall. While you may injure your legs or hips, landing on your feet may prevent other vital organs from being damaged as well.

, Hitting your head or spinal cord could result in a life-threatening injury. Hitting the ground with your feet and rolling forward as if you were doing a somersault may help you absorb some of the impact. Protect the top and back of your head by using your hands and arms to cover your neck. Bend your neck forward and tuck in your chin to help protect the back of your head."

Practice a one-handed back walkover.,
Practice.",How to Do a One Handed Backwalkover," As in all gymnastics wikihows, the first step is always stretch This is important because it is possible to pull a muscle if you do not stretch. The most important thing to stretch is your back, so do lots of bridges and chin stands. However, it is also important to stretch your splits, wrists and neck.,;
, A backbend is different from a bridge. A backbend is when you start from a standing position and arch down into a bridge.

, Balance is an important part of complete a single hand back walkover, so work on your balance before attempting a one handed back walkover.

, It is almost impossible to do a one-handed back walkover without a great back walkover.

, The hand on the bottom will be the hand you keep on the ground. This will help you practice your balance by only having one point of balance. Repeat as necessary.

, This will help you work up to doing a back walkover with your hands at your side.

, Start with both or one hand(s) up, as suits you. Lean back, and put your hand on the ground. Lean slightly to the side to keep your balance. Bring you leg down as soon as possible. Be aware you are not likely to complete this the first time. Don't be discouraged. With practice, you can make it!.

, Practice every day, but for no more than 30 minutes. Unless you are an advanced gymnast, doing this will cause too much strain on your back, possibly pulling a muscle.

Visualize the move.,
The J-step.,
The swing.,
Takeoff.,
Landing.,
Finished.

",How to Do a J Step Gainer (Kick the Moon)," Before you attempt the J-step gainer, plan out your path and visualize yourself making the full rotation and landing the trick.;
, A J-step is so named because it involves a series of steps that make the shape of a 'J'. Speed is important; make two or more fast and powerful steps forward (jogging speed is good). After the two initial steps, plant the inside foot. This will be the anchor for the move.

, Most of the momentum for the flip itself comes from the swinging of the outside leg (hence the name 'kick the moon'). With the inside foot planted, the outside foot should be all the way back from the previous step. Swing this leg like a pendulum from the backward position all the way up so it gives you lift. The swing should be perpendicular to the initial path. This is the part of the move that creates the hook of the 'J'. This is the part of the move that requires the most power. Remember, as with any backflip, you want to be traveling up, not back.

, As your leg swings like a pendulum, swing your arms up like you would in a regular backflip, and look back. The anchor leg will jump, but will provide minimal lift. Tucking is optional. Usually this move is performed in a layout position, but when learning, tucking by bringing the swinging leg toward the chest will help make the rotation faster and thus the move easier.

, The flip will go very quickly and you will have landed before you have time to think. Many times when landing this move, you will land on one foot and spin out of the landing, which looks very smooth and is all about style.

Stand up to three feet away from the low bar.,
Bend your knees slightly and hold your arms out in front of you to prepare for the jump.,

Bring the tip of your toes to the bar.,
Swing backward from the peak of the pike-up.,
Drop your legs while your body swings back.,
Pull your body upward above the bar.,
Flick your wrists over the bar once your torso is above it.,
Allow your legs to hang straight down from the bar while holding your torso upright.",How to Do a Kip," You may stand flat on the ground, or you may use a springboard.


Standing too far away may cause you to miss the bar when you jump for it.
If you jump from the ground, you will have to jump equally up and forward to catch the bar. If you jump from a springboard, you will likely only have to focus more on moving forward in your jump.;
, Your bent knees prepare you to make the jump, while your outstretched arms will enable you to quickly and easily catch the bar.


Line your hands up with the height of the bar in order to more easily catch it.
Keep your feet flat on the floor or springboard.

, Keep your arms outstretched in front of you to grab the bar.


Your arms will likely need to be higher above your head if you are jumping from the ground. On the other hand, if you are jumping from a springboard, you will be able to keep your hands in front of you, rather than above you.
A small jump is required, just enough to give you momentum to get to the bar and start your glide swing. Too much force in your jump will cause you to rise above the low bar and may set your kip off to a messy start.

, Hang from the bar once you grab it, allowing your body to swing below it.


You may choose to keep your legs together in a pike for your glide swing. If so, keep your body slightly bent at the hips so that your feet do not hit the floor.
Another option is to spread your legs into a straddle position. If you choose this position, you can keep your body straight, as your legs will be lifted high enough from the floor.

, Maintain your pike or straddle position with your legs until you reach the other side of the bar.


Your arms should be extended straight once you swing to the other side of the bar.

, As you end the glide swing, you are preparing your body to transition into the next move, which is the pike-up.


If you completed your glide swing with straddled legs, bring them together in a pike position as you thrust your hips forward.
If you did the glide swing in a pike, then straighten out your hips so that your body flattens.

, The peak of the glide swing is the moment when your body stops moving forward and begins to swing back.


You are preparing to fold your body for the pike-up, so pulling your stomach back into a scooped position makes it easier to pull your legs up.

, As your body swings back, quickly lift your feet so that they point upward.


Your torso should be about parallel to the floor when you do your pike-up so that your hips are bent at about a 90-degree angle.
Keep your legs together in a pike position while you lift them upward.

, At the end of your pike-up, your toes should touch the bar.


This is the end of the pike-up, so from this position, you will finish the kip with a pull-up.
Remember to keep your legs and feet squeezed together in the pike position to maintain speed and safety.

, Allow your body to follow the natural swing backward, and keep your arms straight while you do so.


Keep your body tucked close to the bar while you swing, though, to easily pull yourself up later. Specifically, you need to keep your hips close to the bar.
Imagine this as rocking backward under the bar. Your head should rise higher on the other side of the bar as you swing back, while your legs come down.

, This puts your body back in a full pike position, enabling you to pull-up when you reach the other side of the bar again.


Allow the momentum of dropping your legs to push your body upward. This will help you as you start to pull up.

, You will almost rotate your hips around the bar to pull yourself up, which is why it is so essential in earlier steps to keep your hips close to the bar.


Your legs will likely swing back and away from the bar as you pull yourself up. Maintain the pike but allow them to swing, because they are simply following the momentum of the natural movement. This also prepares you for the next step.

, This allows you to hold yourself above the bar without losing your grip.


You may have to shift your hands just a bit to get them into this stronger hold, but do not let go of the bar.

, This is the end of the kip, and from this position, you can continue on with your bar routine.


Keep your abdominal muscles contracted to help hold your position.
Your hips should rest on the bar, while your arms are straight and you look forward ahead of you.

Get into position.,
Bend forward and plant your hand.,
Push off with your back leg and kick your legs up and over.,
Add some momentum.,
Practice, practice, practice.",How to Do a One Handed Cartwheel1," Make sure that you can do a regular, two-handed cartwheel really well before moving on to the one-handed cartwheel. Practice doing cartwheels from either your right and left foot, if not both. This will help improve your form, and build up the arm and shoulder strength needed for one-handed cartwheels./images/thumb/c/c9/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-1-Version-2.jpg

;
, You will probably fall a few times on your way to mastering the one-handed cartwheel, so it's a good idea to practice on a soft surface. Use a gym mat if you have one, or find a nice patch of soft grass in a park or your back yard. Make sure you have plenty of room, and won't wind up crashing into any furniture, etc.!

, Doing regular cartwheels will remind your body how a cartwheel should feel. A one-handed cartwheel is going to work exactly the same way, you're just going to remove one hand.

, Now take a moment and practice the footwork and hand placement you will use to do a one-handed cartwheel in slow motion. This will be just like a two-handed cartwheel, but place your near-arm (the same arm as your lead foot) behind your back, and practice taking the normal first step you would take, and then placing your far-arm down on the ground 12-18 inches from your lead foot and stepping through. Focus on keeping your feet and your hand in a straight line. Do this a few times to help you visualize what it's going to be like./images/thumb/4/4b/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-4-Version-2.jpg

Putting a line of tape on the floor to use as a guideline can really help you keep your cartwheels centered.How far out you place your hand depends on your height and how fast your are moving. It might take some experimentation to find just the right distance.

, Pick your lead foot up slightly off the ground and raise your hands in the air as though you are about to do a regular cartwheel. Now put your near-arm out to the side or behind your back to remind yourself not to use it (if your right foot is forward, put your right hand behind your back).

If you are afraid of falling, try just bending your arm a bit, instead of putting it behind your back. This way you're still reminding yourself not to put the hand down, but can catch yourself if you start to fall., If you are starting on your right foot, place your left hand on the ground. To keep your cartwheel straight, make sure that your hand is planted perpendicular to your direction of travel, and that your fingers are facing in, pointing towards your starting foot, not out. (If you are starting on your right foot, plant your left hand, and make sure that your fingers are pointing left, not right.)/images/thumb/7/77/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-6-Version-2.jpg

, The more momentum you have, the easier the cartwheel will be. Try to push off and land in a straight line.

/images/thumb/8/8d/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-7.jpg/v4-300px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-7.jpg








, Doing a one-handed cartwheel is a lot easier when you have some speed built up, so try it a few times slowly to get the motion down, and then add in a run-up or lunge, as you would with a normal cartwheel.
/images/thumb/c/c4/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-8.jpg

If the far-arm cartwheel seems too intimidating, try doing the near-arm one-handed cartwheel first. Some people find it a lot easier to start with.
If you are too nervous about falling to give it your all, ask someone to spot you until you build up more confidence.
If your cartwheels tend to go off to one side or the other you may not have your hand positioned correctly, or may not be lining your feet up in a straight line. Ask someone to watch you, and give you tips on your form.

Make sure you have your regular cartwheel down pat, and then try the far-arm one-handed cartwheel first before moving on to this one.

Some people find this version of the one-handed cartwheel a lot easier, it really depends. So if the far-arm cartwheel isn't working for you, go ahead and give this one a try.

, You will need plenty of room to practice this cartwheel, and preferably a soft surface to work on, like a gym mat or soft patch of grass.

, Practice some regular cartwheels to remind yourself how they should feel. Then do a few far-arm one-handed cartwheels, if you already have them down.

, This will be just like a two-handed cartwheel, but you will only place your lead hand down, about 12-18 inches from your lead foot, and then step through. Focus on keeping your feet and your hand in a straight line. Do this slowly a few times to help you visualize what it's going to be like./images/thumb/d/db/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg
/images/thumb/d/db/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg/v4-300px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-13.jpg









How far out you place your hand depends on your height and how fast your are moving. Your hand placement for this cartwheel should be a bit closer than it was for the far-hand version.
Place a line of tape on the floor, or use a line on a gym mat as a guideline to help keep your cartwheels centered., Pick your lead foot up slightly off the ground and raise your hands in the air, as though you are about to do a regular cartwheel. Now bend your knees and prepare to plant your forward hand on the ground. If you are leading with your right foot, you will plant your right hand.
/images/thumb/9/9d/Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-14.jpg/v4-550px-Do-a-One-Handed-Cartwheel-Step-14.jpg

, To keep your cartwheel straight, make sure that your hand is planted perpendicular to your direction of travel, and that your fingers are facing in, pointing towards your opposite foot. So if you are starting on your right foot, plant your right hand so that your fingers are pointing off to the left.

, The more momentum you have, the easier the cartwheel will be. Resist the temptation to put your second hand down, and try to push off and land in a straight line.

, Doing a one-handed cartwheel is a lot easier when you have some speed built up, so try it a few times slowly to get the motion down, and then add in a run-up or lunge, as you would with a normal cartwheel.

If you are very nervous about falling, ask someone to spot you until you build up more confidence.
If your cartwheels tend to go off to one side or the other you may not have your hand positioned correctly, or may not be lining your feet up in a straight line. Ask someone to watch you, and give you tips on your form.

, If you just can't shake the temptation to plant your second hand, you can first try doing a two-step regular cartwheel. Do a normal cartwheel, but instead of putting both hands down at the same time, plant your lead hand, pause for a second, then plant the second hand, so the footwork pattern is foot-hand-hand-foot.

Master other exercises first.,
Work on your flexibility overall.,
Stretch and stay safe.,
Get into the starting position.,
Kick your back leg up into the air.,
End the walkover properly.,
Make sure to stay in the proper form.",How to Do a Front Walkover," You can break the front walkover down into other exercises that you can master before you try the full skill.Think of a front walkover as being similar to a cartwheel, but more advanced. It’s more difficult and requires more balance, though.








Practice bridges, front limbers, and handstands, handstands in split positions, and a standing backbend while holding one leg up.To do a front limber, perform a handstand into a bridge. Let your legs fall over. Once your feet contact the floor, push off the floor with your hands to stand up, with your arms up. Push your shoulders back. The balls of your feet should touch the floor first. Then, put your heels down and keep in the bridge position for a few seconds. Then, stand up. The front limber is similar to a front walkover, but the difference is you keep your legs together.To do a bridge, lie on your back. Keep your hands by your ears, and your feet should remain flat on the floor. Push up into the bridge position. Try to keep the arch of your back high to help with the flexibility of the back. Push your legs until they are straight, and your shoulders are directly over your hands.Handstands can be quite difficult. If you cannot stay up at all, start by putting your hands flat on the ground about six inches away from a wall, fingers pointing to the wall, and kicking up until you are standing on your hands with your feet resting against the wall. You can try giving a tiny kick so that you are away from the wall and can practice balancing on your own. You should eventually be able to stand upright, place your hands flat on the floor, and kick into a handstand position without using a wall to correct yourself.;
, Doing a front walkover requires a lot of flexibility in your legs as well as in your back. If you improve the flexibility of your body, you will have an easier time completing the exercise








In addition to lower back flexibility, it’s important to develop flexibility in other areas of your body too, such as shoulders, core stability, and butt strength. Work on stability and strength issues throughout the body in consultation with a coach.Improving flexibility takes time. One way to gain flexibility is through partner stretching, targeting areas like the shoulders for 10-60 seconds. For example, have another person lift your upper arms.

, Don’t try to push yourself beyond your abilities. It can take time to master a basic front walkover, and that’s okay. If you do not stretch, you may hurt yourself. You need to stretch your entire body because every part of you stretches during a front walkover, but pay particular attention to your back.









Use a safe mat in case you fall, and use a spotter in the beginning until you are more comfortable with the skill.Stretch your ankles and your wrists. Try doing the splits and bend your back. Do a bridge to stretch your back. Squat down, tuck your chin, and allow your body to roll over your head. Make sure you keep your body curled in a ball so you do not hurt your tailbone., To do a front walkover, you need to stand as if you are going into a handstand. Put your legs in a split position. Start with whichever leg is easiest for you.








You should form a lunge position, putting your arms straight up by your ears and bending one knee while lunging forward with the other leg straight behind you. Start off by looking at the ground. Keep your legs apart as you stand in this position. Stand facing forward. Put one foot slightly in front of the other, and make sure to point your toes.
Breathe out, and tighten your abdominal muscles. Start to bend forward in order to place your hands on the ground with your fingers pointing forward. You will want to lock your elbows when your hands touch the ground., As your first leg is approaching a vertical position, kick your other leg up into the air. Move your weight to your arms and shoulders.









It’s important to follow through. Keep your legs extended as you pull them up, over and behind your shoulders. Keep your toes pointed, and make sure that your legs are straight and an equal amount apart.
As you pull your leading leg toward the ground behind you, slightly bend that knee. This will help you absorb your landing. At this time, your other leg will move into a vertical position.

, Shift your weight back to your leading leg as it touches down. Then, push off the ground with your hands. You should end in the same position you started in. Make sure that you plant your feet as you land. Keep your arms flexed when you land.









Use your abdominal muscles in order to come back into a standing position. It can be tempting to put your chin to your chest and pull your arms forward to help you get up, but you should actually keep your head back and just use your stomach muscles to pull you up.
Make sure that you do each step in a continuous motion. Fluidity of movement is very important. If you can get up from a bridge and still can't do a front walkover, that probably means your feet need to be closer to your head when you land.

, You should press your hips forward, and make sure that you don’t stand up too fast. That could make you fall backwards.









Your natural momentum is very important and will push you upright. Your head and arms should be the last to come into their final position.
After you master a basic front walkover, you can add other skills into the walkover to make it more complex. Be careful trying any skills on your own. You don’t want to get hurt.
You could join a gymnastics club and take classes or private lessons. For most people, it takes a lot of time and practice to achieve their first front walkover. Just be patient!

Position your cushioned mat.,
Position your body like a table top.,
Lace your fingers and place your head.,
Lift your knees to balance on your feet.,
Bring your feet up the mat.,
Lift your legs.,
Come down from the headstand.",How to Do a Headstand1," You can use either a yoga mat or a gymnastics mat, but you want a mat that is going to provide some support to your head and neck and necessary cushion for comfort. Lay your mat lengthwise in front of you.If you are a complete beginner to doing headstands, you can place your mat up against the base of a wall and practice your headstand with the support of the wall.Practicing your headstand against a wall will help you figure out the different areas in your body that you need to flex and balance to hold a headstand.;
, Kneel onto your mat. Bring your hands down in front of you onto the mat, so you are resting on your knees and hands. Your should now look like a table top.









You hands should be lined up with your shoulders, and your knees should be lined up with your hips.Bend and bring your elbows to rest down on the mat.

, With your elbows on the mat distanced shoulder-width apart, clasp your hands together and lace your fingers together.Extend your thumbs up toward the ceiling. Your hands and elbows should form a triangle shape that’s approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) away from the base of the wall.Tuck your chin downward, and bring the crown of your head down to the mat. Rest the back of your head in your palms, as your crown rests on the mat.








Change your head positioning as necessary until you find a comfortable position. You should always aim to rest on your crown, with your hands supporting the back of your head so you don’t strain your neck.

, Lift up your knees to straighten out your legs. Your buttocks should be in the air, and your body should look like an upside down ‘V’.







, You can use your core muscles to drag your feet up toward the rest of your body, or slowly walk up the mat.As you walk, your buttocks and hips will start to align with your back as you straighten out your core but stay bent at the hips.









This movement will lift your shoulders over your ears as your spine aligns straight.Keep your wrists, hands, forearms, and elbows strong and rooted into the mat.You might feel like you are going to fall over like you would in a somersault. However, if you are practicing against a wall, the wall will support you and help you gain control so you can find balance.

, Bring your knees close to your armpits. You should be on your tippy toes at this point.Tighten your core and release your toes from the mat. Bring your bent knees into your chest, and use your core muscles to slowly try and raise your knees and extend your legs straight up out of the tuck.








If you are practicing on a wall, you can flex your hips to bring your bent knees up, and place your feet on the wall., Hold the headstand for as long as you comfortably can.When you are ready to release the headstand, bend at your knees and bring both of your legs down, back to a tucked position in front of your chest.








From here, touch both of your toes back onto your mat, slide your feet back, and transition into a stretch also known as a “child’s pose.”Shift your buttocks over the heels of your feet, and extend your arms straight out in front of you while keeping your hands on the floor.Hold this stretch for at least a minute so your body can slowly adjust its blood flow.
Consider doing a few neck rolls in different directions to relieve any tension in your neck."

Come down from the headstand.",How to Do a Headstand2," You can use a yoga mat or a gymnastics mat; either way, you want a mat that is going to give your support and cushion while you attempt your headstand. Lay your yoga or gymnastic mat lengthwise in front of you.








If you are not confident enough to practice your headstand freely, you can place your mat up against the base of a wall.Anyone who has never attempted a headstand should first practice against a wall.
Practicing against a wall will help you find the initial balance and strength needed to hold a free form headstand.

, Kneel onto your mat. Bring your upper body down to the mat so your hands are out in front of you. Your body should now look like a table, with your knees lined up with your hips and your hands about shoulder-width apart.Bring your elbows down to rest on the mat.








, With your elbows already on the mat shoulder-width apart, bring your hands together and lace your fingers.Your thumbs should be extended upward, toward the ceiling. Your hands and elbows should look like a little triangle placed approximately 5 inches (12.7 cm) away from the wall.Tuck your chin and bring your head down to the mat. Rest the back of your head in your palms, while the crown of your head should be contacting the floor.








Adjust your head positioning until you find comfort and stability. You don’t want to put too much strain on your head and neck by having your forehead resting on the mat.

, Tuck your toes, so your toes and maybe even the balls of your feet are making contact with the mat. Lift your knees up from the mat in order to straighten out your legs.








Your body should look like an upside down ‘V’.

This will straighten out your spine and lift your shoulders over your ears.Keep your wrists, hands, forearms, and elbows strong and rooted into the mat.








You will start to feel less weight from your legs as you walk up toward your body. This is where tight core muscles come in. Your core muscles are going to lift your legs up and hold your body in the headstand position.

, When your body is aligned and your legs are feeling lighter, tighten your core muscles and slowly lift one of your legs.As you lift one of your legs, keep the other one near the ground to first find balance. When your one leg is in the air, gently hop your other leg off the ground, trying to straighten out both legs as much as possible. This is going to require a lot of strength from your abdominal core muscles. Use your core to lift up your legs, and use your arms to support and stabilize your body.








Check your body alignment by saying your name. If you’re aligned, you should be able to say it clearly, how you normally speak. If you can’t speak like you normally do, you may not be aligned correctly, and should come out of the headstand.If you are practicing against a wall, place your first lifted leg against the wall. As you find balance, lift your other leg up to meet your extended leg. The wall will give you support as you gain stability.

, Hold the headstand for as long as what feels comfortable to you. This could mean holding the headstand for a couple seconds or a couple minutes.When you are ready to come down, separate your feet and slowly shift your balance to bring one of your legs back down to the ground. When your foot contacts the floor (or is on the way down), bring your other leg down from the headstand pose and onto the floor.









When you completely back on the mat with your head still resting between your hands, straighten out your arms shift your buttocks back to rest on top of your heels.
Extend and stretch your upper body to relax and allow the blood in your body to circulate away from your head. In yoga, this is sometimes called a “child’s pose.”Try and hold this for about a minute so your body can readjust and relax.
Consider doing some soft neck rolls after performing a headstand.This can help prevent stiffness and tension after performing a headstand.
If you stand up too quickly after a headstand, you could experience lightheadedness, and even faint."

See a doctor.",How to Reduce Menstrual Cramps1," Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen or naproxen are the first-line medicines for painful menstrual cramping. NSAIDs work by blocking the contractions that cause cramps. Ibuprofen is the most common of the two. You can take 400-600 mg of ibuprofen every 4-6 hours or 800 mg every 8 hours with a maximum dose of 2400 mg daily.


You should start taking them as soon as you feel the onset of symptoms and continue your dose for 2-3 days as needed, depending on your symptom pattern. If you wait after they start, especially if you have had bad cramps in the past, you risk getting a cramp that is so bad, that there isn't much of anything you can do for it.
Try ibuprofen brands such as Advil and Motrin. You can also try naproxen brands such as Aleve.;
, If natural remedies, diet and nutrition, exercise, and NSAIDs do not work to relieve cramps in a satisfactory manner, hormonal birth control may be a good options for you. There are many different forms and kinds that can be effective in making menstruation lighter and less painful.


The method you chose depends on your general health, sexual practices, and personal and financial preferences. Discuss your options with your healthcare provider., Birth control pills are an oral hormonal birth control that you take daily. Because you control when they are taken, they are easily stopped. They are widely used, readily available, and relatively inexpensive. However, they can be annoying because they must be taken daily at the same time., The patches work just like the pill, expect they are in a patch form. They must be applied monthly and, like the pills, can easily be stopped.


They can also fall off accidentally, be easily seen when applied to certain areas, and are a constant monthly expense., If you don’t want a pill or patch, you can try a vaginal ring. This form of hormonal birth control is only changed monthly and can easily be stopped when you don’t need them anymore. They are considered more private than the patch or pill because you don’t have to take a pill or put on a patch where anyone can see you.


It can accidentally fall out during sexual activity and it is still a constant monthly expense., If you don’t like any other options, you might consider taking a hormonal injection. They are more convenient because they are given only every 3 months, but they must be injected every time. However, they have worse side effects than the other options. You may stop having periods and can continue to be infertile for up to one year after stopping.


This option may result in weight gain., Implants are more permanent options for menstrual cramp control. Once they are implanted, they last for 3-5 years. Despite their longevity, they are easily reversible once you remove the implant.


The insertion process can also be quite painful, though you only have to do it once every few years.The implants can cause regular bleeding.

, If an implant isn't quite right, you can try an even longer lasting option called an IUD. These devices are effective for three or five years and have very limited side-effects.


You are at increased risk of pelvic infection in the 30 days post insertion if an STD is contracted. Fertility returns immediately after removal of the IUD.

, If your cramps are more severe than usual, feel unusual for you, and if the timing or location of the cramps is different, you should contact your doctor. You should also consult your doctor if your cramps last more than 2-3 days. It is possible that you cramping may secondary dysmenorrhea, which is a more severe version of menstrual cramps that are usually caused by an underlying disease or disorder.There are certain reproductive disorders that cause secondary dysmenorrhea. These disorders include endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, stenosis of the cervix, and tumors on the wall of the uterus.If your doctor suspects any of these disorders, he or she will perform a physical exam and run tests to see which is most likely. She will perform a pelvic exam and check for any abnormalities or infection in your reproductive organs. She may also give you an ultrasound, a CT scan, or an MRI. In some cases, your doctor may perform a laparoscopy, which is an outpatient procedure where a camera is surgically inserted to examine your your abdominal cavity and reproductive organs."

Use heat.,
Try behavioral intervention.,
Distract yourself.,
Give acupuncture a try.,
Massage your abdomen gently.",How to Reduce Menstrual Cramps2," There are several natural therapies that have been studied and shown to help relieve pain from menstrual cramping. One of the most common and easiest methods to use is heat. Heat can be just as or more effective than over-the-counter pain medications, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.The heat aids in relaxing the contracting muscles that cause cramps. You should apply heat to your lower abdomen. You can also apply it to your lower back. Try a heating pad or a heat patch. Heat patches are adhesive, non-medicated pads that give off heat for up to 12 hours. You can apply them to skin or clothing, but make sure you read the directions.


Heat patches come in different shapes, sizes, and say they are for different uses, though you can use any patch for menstrual cramps. Some brands even have patches specifically for menstrual cramps, such as ThermaCare heat wraps.
Patches are more convenient than heating pads because they are portable, so you can apply it and go about your day.
If you don't have a heating pad or a heating patch, then you can try soaking in a hot bath or taking a hot shower to help relax you and relieve cramps.

, It may be helpful to develop certain kinds of behavioral intervention coping strategies, especially if you have persistently bad cramps. These strategies include relaxation training, which uses a repetitive activity, such as deep breathing, reciting a prayer, or repeating a word or sound, in combination with clearing your mind, ignoring distractions, and taking on a positive attitude. This is supposed to help you relax and let go of the pain.


You can also try imagery intervention, which uses positive thoughts and experiences to change your emotional state and distract you from and relieve the pain.
Hypnotherapy is another method that uses hypnosis to induce relaxation, decrease stress, and relieve pain.
Since cramps affect the same muscles as child birth, some women find it helpful to use Lamaze exercises to relieve menstrual cramps. Try the rhythmic breathing used in Lamaze exercises to help relieve or lessen the pain.
You can also attempt biofeedback, which is a method where you learn to control physiologic parameters such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature along with relaxation techniques to help train your body to control symptoms., Distraction is one of the most powerful and readily available painkillers. If you have intense cramps, then do something that normally absorbs you completely, such as socializing with good friends, reading a book, playing a computer game, watching a movie or TV show, or spending time on Facebook.


Make sure you pick something that will keep your mind off of the pain and convince your body to focus on other things.

, Acupuncture has been used as a pain relief method for over 2,000 years. In this method, hair-thin needles are placed into the skin on specific locations on your body. The needles do not cause pain for most people, and some women find that it reduces menstrual cramps.


Despite some word of mouth testimonies, studies of this are inconclusive., Sometimes, it helps to put gentle pressure on the affected areas. Lie down and prop your feet up. From your reclined position, gently massage your lower back and abdomen.Make sure you don’t press too hard. You don’t want to cause more pain instead of relief. This can help relax the muscles and relieve the pain.

Take supplements.,
Change your diet.,
Drink tea.,
Avoid alcohol and tobacco.",How to Reduce Menstrual Cramps3," Research has shown that certain vitamin and nutritional supplements can help lessen menstrual cramps when taken daily. The mechanisms for this are not well understood, but the many dietary supplements have been shown to reduce cramping. Take 500U of Vitamin E, 100 mg of Vitamin B1, 200 mg of Vitamin B6, and a doctor approved level of Vitamin D3 daily.


A blood test can assess if you have enough of these vitamins in your diet, and a regimen of supplementation can be take accordingly.
You can also take a supplement of fish oil or cod liver oil., One study showed that a diet low in fat and rich in vegetables helps decrease menstrual pain.You should eat green, leafy vegetables, which are rich in Vitamins A, C, E, B, K and folates. Much like with the supplements, these vitamins and minerals can help menstrual pain. These foods can also help prevent anemia from menstrual bleeding by providing nutrients necessary to create new red blood cells.


You should increase your iron as well while you are menstruating. You can eat lean red meat or take supplements to help prevent menstrual anemia.
Green vegetables and berries also contain antioxidants, which may play a role in fighting inflammation related to bloating.
Another study showed that women who ate 3-4 servings of dairy daily had lower rates of cramping. You should not eat this much dairy if you are prone to be gassy or bloated if you consume too much dairy., Different varieties of teas may help to soothe cramps. Make sure when choosing a tea variety that you choose decaffeinated versions so you don't cancel out the soothing effects of the tea by increasing cramps with the caffeine. Raspberry, chamomile, and ginger tea may have anti-inflammatory capabilities to help relieve cramping.You should avoid caffeinated teas because caffeine encourages anxiety and tension, which can make your cramps worse.
The amount of tea needed to provide relief is not documented, but as long as it is decaffeinated, you can enjoy as much as you’d like.
This can also help to keep you hydrated.

, Alcohol can cause water retention and bloating. Nicotine in tobacco can cause increased tension and cause a narrowing of vessels called vasoconstriction. This issue leads to decreased blood flow to the uterus and a worsening of your cramps."
"
Exercise.,
Do simple stretches.,
Increase your sexual activity.,
Try yoga.",How to Reduce Menstrual Cramps4," Exercise can help relieve menstrual symptoms in general, include cramping. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Endorphins also help counteract the prostaglandins in your body that cause contractions and pain. Because of this, physical activity may help relieve cramps.Try different kinds of aerobic exercise, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, kayaking, hiking, or a class at the gym.

, Stretching helps relax your muscles and alleviate cramps. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched far apart. Stretch forward to catch your toes or ankle. Breathe in while keeping your back straight. After a few breaths, lean forward towards the floor.


You can try other simple stretches as well to stretch out your back or abdomen, depending on which areas hurt the most.

, Some women experience relief from menstrual cramping with orgasm. The reason behind this is not well understood, but may have something to do with endorphins released during sexual arousal. Much like with exercise, the endorphins released during orgasm can help relieve the menstrual cramps and inflammation. , Similar to aerobic exercise and stretching, yoga helps relax the body and reduce aches and pains in the lower back, legs, and abdomen. When you begin to feel menstrual cramps, you can try various yoga poses to help you with your pain. Before you start, get in some comfortable clothes and put on soothing music.


You can do the head-to-knee forward bend. Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Pull one of your legs in and bend it 90 degrees so that the sole of your foot rests against the inside of your thigh. Inhale and grab your shin, ankle, or foot. Stretch the torso over your leg towards the foot. Exhale and bend down from the groin. Lengthen and stretch your back instead of rounding it. Breathe as you hold the pose, extending through the heel and pressing your sitting bones towards the floor. Hold for 1-3 minutes, then switch sides.
You can also try the noose pose. Get into a full squat with your feet together. Lower down until your buttocks are towards your heels. Inhale, then move your knees to the left as you turn your torso to the right. As you exhale, wrap the left arm back behind you and around your knees and legs. Inhale and reach the right arm around to clasp your hands. Exhale as you gaze over the right shoulder. Hold for 30-60 seconds as you breathe. Switch sides.
You can also attempt camel pose. Get on your knees, hip-width apart. Make sure your shins and feet are pressed firmly into the floor. Rest your palms on the top of your buttocks with the fingers pointing down. Inhale. Lift your chest and move your shoulders down towards the ribs. Exhale, then push your hips forward as you arch back. To stabilize yourself, rest your hands on your heels. Lift the chest. Breathe steadily for 30-60 seconds."

",How to Use a Tampon Painlessly," Tampon users are at risk of contracting Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which can be fatal. If you experience ANY of the following symptoms while wearing a tampon, remove the tampon and see a doctor immediately:Fever of 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.89 degrees Celsius) or more
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Muscle aches
A sunburn-like rash with peeling skin, especially on the palms and soles
Dizziness, light-headedness, or mental confusion
Pale, clammy skin (signalling a drop in blood pressure);
, Tampons and sanitary napkins absorb your flow; menstrual cups catch and hold it, like how a cup holds water. Because menstrual cups don’t absorb your flow, they boast a lower risk of TSS.


Menstrual cups are inserted similarly to how tampons without applicators are inserted (i.e. with your fingers).
You can wear a menstrual cup for 12 hours — much longer than the 4 to 8 hours common for tampons.
Downsides: it can take time to find a cup that fits you and your flow, and removal can be tricky -- particularly if you’re in public, as you may have to wash out the cup in the restroom sink before re-inserting it.

, If you have a light flow, don’t buy super-absorbent tampons. If your flow ranges between light and normal, buy one box of each and use the appropriate tampon when needed. Only use super-absorbency tampons if your flow is very heavy.


Some manufacturers offer multi-packs that contain light and normal tampons, or normal and super, or even light, normal and super.
Only use tampons once you are already bleeding. Do not insert them in anticipation of your period or to absorb anything else.
TSS is more likely to occur when super-absorbent tampons are used., It’s not their fault; it’s just not something that is commonly taught or discussed. Your vaginal opening is located between your anus and your urethra. Follow these steps to easily find your vaginal opening:


Standing upright, place one leg up on a chair (the toilet is also fine).
Holding a hand-held or compact mirror in your dominant hand, move it down between your legs so that you can see your private area.
With your non-dominant hand, gently spread your labia (the fleshy folds around your vaginal opening). Depending on the size of your labia, you may need to pull them a bit to be able to see your vagina and urethra. If you do need to pull them, be very gentle as they are made up of a sensitive membrane and could tear if pulled apart too roughly.
Continuing to hold the labia open, move the mirror so that you can clearly see the area beneath the folds.
You should now see a slit with a small hole above it. The small hole is your urethra; the slit is your vaginal opening.

, You may find it helpful to practice with your finger before you try inserting a tampon. Treat your finger like a tampon by holding it straight, but not rigid, finding your vaginal opening, and sliding it gently inside.


Don’t force your finger to stay straight; let it move with the natural curve of your vagina.
You may find it helpful to place a small drop of water-based lubricant on your finger before-hand.
Be extra-gentle if you have long nails, as they could scratch the delicate skin of your genital area.

, The tampons you buy should come with a detailed instruction slip inside the box. The slip should include illustrations of how to insert the tampons. Read over the instructions to familiarize yourself with the process.

, If you’re really struggling to find your vaginal opening and figure out how to put in a tampon, ask a female friend or relative to show you how to do it. If you don't feel comfortable doing that, your doctor should be able to either help you or put you in touch with someone who can help you.

, If, even after trying the tips and tricks in this article, you are still experiencing pain upon inserting a tampon (or anything else, for that matter) into your vagina, see a doctor. It’s possible that you may be suffering from a treatable condition; if this is the case, your doctor can get you the help you need.


One such condition that causes pain in and around the vagina is called vulvodynia.

, If you’re anxious, you’re more likely to clench your muscles, which will make it difficult to insert a tampon. Try to relax. It is unlikely that you will hurt yourself if you go slowly and gently.


Go slow and pay attention to your body.
If you simply cannot insert the tampon, don’t force it. Use a sanitary napkin instead and then try again tomorrow. Don’t beat yourself up; most women take some time to get comfortable with using tampons.

, Be sure to dry them afterward.

, After removing the tampon from its packaging, check to ensure that it’s not faulty in any way. Tug the string lightly to make sure it's secure.If you're using a tampon with an applicator, make sure the string is hanging outside the barrel.


If you must place the tampon down before inserting it, ensure that you place it on a clean surface.

, Which position you choose for insertion will depend upon your unique anatomy and personal taste. Many girls sit on the toilet with their legs apart when inserting a tampon. If that feels uncomfortable to you, stand upright and place one foot on a chair or the toilet seat/lid. Another option is to squat.


Sitting on the toilet with your legs apart during insertion may be preferable to you in public places. To place one foot up on the toilet may require you to remove your pants completely from one leg in a small stall with a potentially dirty floor.

, Your labia are the fleshy folds that surround your vaginal opening. Gently spread these with your non-dominant hand, and hold them there as you get the tampon into position at your vaginal opening.

, Hold the applicator with your thumb and middle finger at the finger grips (the narrow or ridged part of the applicator toward its center). Place your index finger at the end of the applicator — this is the narrower tube from which the tampon string should be sticking out.


If you’re using a tampon without an applicator, the insertion process is almost the same, except your finger is the applicator. Hold the tampon with your thumb and middle finger at its base (on the side with the string). You might find it useful to put a bit of water-based lubricant on the tip of the tampon; this will help it slide into your vagina more easily.

, You want to hold it parallel to your vaginal opening; don’t try to push it upwards. Stop when your fingers — which should still be holding the applicator at its center, or “finger grips” — touch the lips of your vagina.


If you have trouble getting the applicator into your vagina, try twisting it gently as you push it upwards into your vaginal opening.
If you’re using a tampon without an applicator, you’ll place the tip of the tampon into your vaginal opening while holding the base of the tampon with your thumb and middle finger.

, This will discharge the tampon into your vagina. At this point you may feel a light pressure low in your abdomen/pelvic wall that signals the tampon is in place. When it feels as though the tampon cannot go in any further, stop.


For a tampon without an applicator, you’ll use your pointer finger to push on the base of the tampon, guiding it up and through your vaginal opening. Your finger will follow the tampon into your vagina, until the tampon no longer moves forward. Once the tampon is past your vaginal opening, you might find it helpful to switch to your middle finger since it is longer and at a more advantageous angle on your hand.

, Once you’ve inserted the tampon, stand up to ensure that it’s in place. You shouldn’t feel the tampon once you’ve removed the applicator. If you can feel it, you likely need to sit back down and push it up a little farther inside of you using your finger.

, Ensure that the tampon is completely out of the applicator before pulling the applicator out of your vagina. You should feel the tampon leave the applicator, but if you don't, another sign is that you won’t be able to push the smaller applicator tube any further into the larger one.


If it feels as though the applicator is still holding the tampon, wiggle it gently as you pull it out of your vagina. This should help release the tampon from the applicator.

,, You must change your tampon at least every 8 hours.Depending on your flow, you may need to change your tampon more often — for example, every 3 to 5 hours during a heavy flow. How to tell when you need to change your tampon:If you feel a wetness in your underwear, it’s likely your tampon leaking. To prevent any stains or leaks to your outer clothing, it’s a good idea to wear a pantyliner (a small, thin pad) in combination with your tampon.
While sitting on the toilet, give the string a light tug. If the tampon moves or begins to slide out of you, it’s ready to be changed. You may find that your tampon is even sliding out slightly on its own; this is another sign that it's ready to be changed.
If there’s blood on the tampon string, this is a sign that the tampon is saturated and needs to be changed.

, If you’re stressed out you will likely clench your vaginal muscles, which will make removing the tampon more difficult.

, Sit on the toilet, or stand with one leg up on the toilet seat. If possible, take whatever position you were in when you inserted the tampon.


Sitting on the toilet while pulling out the tampon string ensures that any blood that comes out with the tampon will fall into the toilet, instead of on your clothes or on the floor., Ensure that you pull the tampon out at the same angle you put it in., If you’re having trouble removing the tampon, resist the urge to pull hard on the string. This can lead to the string breaking off from the tampon. It can also cause you pain if the reason the tampon is stuck is that it’s too dry.

, If you find that the tampon is very difficult to remove, don’t panic. It’s not lost in your abdomen! If you’re unable to remove your tampon but you can see the string, there are a few things you can do:


Gently pull the string while bearing down as if you're having a bowel movement.Wiggling the string while bearing down should help the tampon move at least slightly down the vaginal canal. Once the tampon is close enough to your vaginal opening that you can grab it with your fingers, gently and slowly wiggle the tampon from side to side with your fingers as you pull downward on it.
If you’re really struggling to get the tampon out, you might consider using a vaginal douche (also called a feminine wash). A vaginal douche will spray water up into your vagina, wetting and softening the tampon, and making it easier to pull out. If you choose this method, be sure to follow the instructions on the packaging if you purchase a douche kit from the drugstore. If you use a homemade douche, ensure that you’re using sterilized water.
If you can’t find the tampon, insert your finger into your vagina and move it around the walls in a circular motion. If you fee the tampon string, you can insert another finger and grab the string between both fingers and ease the tampon out.Don’t be embarrassed to see a doctor if you can’t find the tampon and/or can’t seem to get it out of your vagina.

, Once you’ve removed the tampon, wrap it in toilet paper and throw in the garbage bin. Do not flush the tampon. Some applicators may be flushable (it will say on the packaging), but tampons are not flushable. They can clog toilets, so it is very important to throw them in the trash.


If you’re in a public restroom, there will likely be a bin specifically labelled for the disposal of tampons and sanitary napkins. Placing your tampons and sanitary napkins into these receptacles is the safest method for disposing of them.

Confirm your tampon is properly inserted at all times.,
Move the tampon string to the side when urinating.,
Replace your tampon immediately when soiled with urine or feces.,
Avoid straining or pushing too hard during bowel movements.",How to Use the Bathroom when Wearing a Tampon," Urine comes out through the urethra, fecal matter comes out through the anus, and menstruation occurs through the vagina. Tampons do not interfere with urination and defecation, and do not need to be removed when using the bathroom.
, When inserted correctly, your tampon sits in the upper two-thirds of your vagina and shouldn’t cause discomfort. Proper insertion also prevents your tampon from being pushed out when urinating or defecating, and prevents the tampon’s fibers from becoming wet or soiled.Insert the tampon farther into your vagina if your tampon triggers feelings of pain or discomfort. If you’re worried about not being able to remove your tampon, keep in mind that your cervix prevents tampons from being “lost” or inserted too far into your body.

, This prevents urine from saturating the string, and lowers your exposure to bacteria and possible discomfort. Before urinating, use your finger to move the string to the side away from your urethra., This helps prevent bacterial infection and keeps your anatomy clean and sanitary., Constipation and straining can dislodge a tampon and cause it to fall out. Consume plenty of water and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables during menstruation to encourage regular bowel movements and avoid constipation."

Call a doctor.",How to Remove a Stuck Tampon," You need to take care of this problem right away. Don’t put it out of your mind because you’re really embarrassed. You could be risking your health. Remember this is something that has happened to many, many people.


You should never leave a tampon in for 8 hours or more as you could get Toxic Shock Syndrome. Although treatable, it can be fatal. However, if you’ve had the tampon in for a very short time (like an hour or so), you might want to wait a bit longer and try to remove it again because dry tampons get stuck more easily, and your menstrual flow may help you remove it.Try to remove it yourself first – it should be fairly easy to do this – but if that doesn’t work, you will have to call your doctor right away. It can't be said enough - leaving tampons in for too long is very, very dangerous.;
, If you’re tense, you will actually make it worse. Are you sure there is really a tampon inside you or have you just forgotten you took it out? If you're sure it's inside you, remember: It’s not really “stuck."" It’s just that the muscles of the vagina will hold it in place until you remove it. Don’t freak out. The vagina is a relatively small closed area, and it’s not going to be lost up there forever. This is something that has happened to many, many women, so there is no reason to panic.
You might want to take a warm shower or warm bath to help you relax before you try to remove it. Take some deep breaths too. If you are too tense, you will clench the muscles, making the tampon harder to remove.

, You’re going to want clean hands to remove a stuck tampon because you don’t want to introduce germs into the vaginal cavity. Proper hygiene will prevent infection, further complications, and problems.


You might also want to clip your nails because you will need to insert your fingers into your vagina to get the tampon. You want to make the process as painless as possible.
Find a private space (probably the bathroom is best for hygienic reasons). Take off your lower clothing. It will make it easier to remove the tampon.

, If you can see the string, and it’s not also stuck inside your body, lightly tug on the string while squatting close to the ground with your feet and knees spread apart, but not wide enough for you to actually be sitting on the ground.


You want to lightly tug at the string to see if the tampon comes out on its own because this would be easiest. There should generally be at least an inch of string coming out of you if the tampon is properly positioned. Try different positions if it doesn’t come out right away. Prop your feet with something and sit on the toilet. Or put one foot on the bathtub.
However, many times the string is stuck inside a woman’s vagina with the tampon. It may take a minute or two until you can pull it out. If that's the case, move on to the next step.

, It’s easier to get a stuck tampon out if you do it while sitting or squatting down. You also want to bear down to try to dislodge it. Try changing positions if you can’t find it right away.


Prop your feet on a trashcan or bathtub. Or squat over the toilet bowl for sanitary reasons. You could also try lying down in bed with your legs wide and up in the air, but squatting or sitting usually work better.
Bear down as if you’re straining to have a bowel movement or are giving birth or are doing reverse kegels. Sometimes, this can force the tampon out. Bearing down will help ease it into a more easy-to-reach position. Take a deep breath.

, You are going to have to put your finger into your vagina as far as possible. Make circular motions with your finger between the cervix and vagina. This is where most stuck tampons are. You might need to use your index finger and your thumb. Find the tampon, and insert another finger if you'd only used one at first. Catch the tampon's cotton cylinder between your fingers, and try to pull it out. You will need to pull out the actual tampon probably, not just the string. Don’t panic. If you do this too quickly, you could end up pushing it farther in. Once you feel it, just pull it out. Don’t dig around for the tampon for more than 10 minutes or so. If you can’t get it out, don’t panic. Call your doctor. If you feel a string (that somehow got bunched up inside of you), get it under your finger but against the side of your vagina, and slowly pull the tampon out.
It’s probably easier if you use your longest finger, but all women’s vaginas are different, so you might be able to use any other finger, also.

, You could also try using a lot of lubricant before reaching for the tampon with your finger. This might make it less painful and easier to do.


Don’t pour water in the vagina or use soap. It can cause infections. And don’t put scented lotions on the vagina; they can irritate the skin.
It might also be helpful to use a mirror to investigate what is going on down below. Or you could try peeing into the toilet. The natural process might dislodge the tampon.

, If that doesn't work though - and this is very important - your next step should not be to introduce a foreign object, like metal tweezers, to your vagina.


It's worth repeating: Do not EVER use another object to get the tampon! That can be very unsanitary, and it could also get stuck.
Foreign objects also could scrape the vaginal walls. You want to remove the tampon in a way that doesn't cause you more problems.

, If you can’t find the tampon or retrieve it, you need to go to the doctor right away. If a tampon is left inside of you, it could cause an infection and be very dangerous. You could also ask a second person to try to get it first (like your partner), but many women are too embarrassed to do that (if you do, the person should wear gloves).


It should be easy for a doctor to remove a stuck tampon. Don’t be embarrassed about this; you should realize that this is something that happens all the time, and the doctor has almost certainly seen it before. You never want to risk your feminine health.
Sometimes women forget they have a tampon in, and then insert another one, causing the first one to get stuck. Try to remember when you inserted a tampon because leaving one in too long can cause serious infections. If you have symptoms like foul odor, vaginal discharge, dizziness, pelvic pressure or pain, or abdominal discomfort, call your doctor immediately. "

,


Your period kit should have a few pads, about 4 tampons and backup clothes in it. You don’t need to have pants in your locker (although you might want to keep some in your gym locker).
Use a ziplock bag or other plastic bag. It will keep your items safe and together.

, If you are caught unawares, know that some schools have tampon vending machines in their bathrooms. You might also have a very-well-prepared friend that can lend you one.


Nurses' offices often have supplies. Even some female teachers may have a supply.

, Pads and tampons can come in noisy wrapping. When you’re searching for them in your bag, move the rest of your bag around to create noises that will disguise the sound of you hiding your pad or tampon.


The clatter of pens and keys are a good distraction from the sound of plastic.

, You will find that there are many places on your body that you can hide something small.


Tampons, especially applicator-free ones, are discreet when your fist is closed. They might be more difficult to keep in your sleeve, but you can usually hold them in place with a finger or two.

, Since your feet are under your desk, this is more discreet than putting it in your pocket.


Slide your bag or whatever your items are in between your legs. Reach inside and slide your pad or tampon into your shoe or sock.
It might be a good idea to bend down to put something away when doing this, or else come back up with an item, so that you have an excuse for reaching into your bag.

, If you need to come back for your items, take something else with you, like a water bottle or a wallet. That way, you can pretend that you are refilling your water bottle, or getting something from the vending machine.


Some people actually keep pads or tampons hidden in water bottles. Panty liners and applicator-free tampons will also fit easily inside of a wallet.

, If you have a phone case with a flap that closes, you can squeeze your pad into that spot.


Reach into your bag with your phone in your hand, slide the pad in, and put your phone in your pocket.

Stay hygienic.,
Always carry extras.",How to Use a Sanitary Napkin (Pad)," With nearly 3.5 billion women on this planet, there are a whole bunch of options needed to accommodate all our different needs. Here's the general rundown on your choices:



Thickness. The lighter your period, the thinner your pad can be; however, absorbency of pads has improved dramatically, even in recent years. Some thinner pads can be quite absorbent. They're often more comfortable to sit on and you can even forget they're there!

Absorbency. Look at the rating (light, average, or super) and length, and try a few different brands and styles before settling on one you like. Sometimes absorbency means different things to different companies and/or people.

Shape. There are different shapes of undies out there, so naturally there are different shapes of pads! But your three main ones will be those for regular undies, those for thongs and night-time pads. Night-time pads are pretty self-explanatory (longer, made for lying down), but the other two? Well, wearing a pad while you're wearing a thong is sort of asking for trouble. You can try it, but if you're just starting off, stick with the regular ones.

Style. Again, two things here: with wings and without. ""Wings"" are those sticky little pieces that adhere to your underwear. They keep your pad from lodging to the side and feeling like a diaper. In short, unless they irritate your skin or something, they're your friend!

In general, stay away from scented pads, especially if your skin is sensitive. They can be irritating in areas you definitely don't want irritated.
There are also panty-liners, but those are kind of a different animal. Stick to those bad boys when you think your period is starting or when it's ending -- that is, when it's really, really light.

;
, Most girls change their pads when they need to hit the girls' room, but sometimes the desire strikes you at empty-bladder times, too. Whatever it is, find the nearest bathroom, wash your hands, and drop trou. The pad won't magically transport itself through your bottoms, unfortunately. Science is still working on that one.


It'll be easiest if you're sitting down and your undies are around your knees. Standing is fine, too; you just want everything in an arm's reach.

, You could discard them, but it's a good idea to use them to dispose of the used pad you are replacing. No one wants to look at a used pad in the trash, you know? And never, ever, throw it in the toilet, it could flood!

, Expose the adhesive on the wings too, disposing these parts in the trash (you won't need them for wrapping).


In some brands of pads nowadays, the wrapper doubles as the backing. It's more eco-friendly and simpler -- if this is the case, one less step for you!

, You want the pad to be directly beneath your vagina -- not creeping up your front or climbing up your rear! If you're going to do a bit of lying down, you may want to align it a little further back, but you probably have a good idea of where it would be the most effective. You'll get better with practice at centering the pad front to back very soon!


Got wings? Make sure to fold those around the outside of your panties so that they stick. They'll keep the pad from moving around as you move, which will be way more comfortable and feel a lot more natural.

, Done! If your pad is itchy or irritating your skin at all, remove it and use a different kind. Wearing a pad should not be a problem. You can check when you go to the bathroom if the pad needs changing or if there are any issues brewing. Change the pad every few hours as needed to avoid odors.


Let's say this one more time: change your pad every few hours. Obviously, part of this depends on how heavy your flow is. But not only will changing often give you peace of mind, but odors won't start worsening either. Win win!

, Although it may feel strange at first, the pad will generally not be visible. It will follow the curve of your body and be well hidden. However, you may feel better wearing loose pants or a skirt. It's all about peace of mind! If you're worried, pick out your wardrobe carefully.


A good rule of thumb is to bust out the granny panties when you're on your period. Save your cute thongs for the other 25 days of the month.

, You'll shortly find that you know how often you'll need to take care of business, how long a pad lasts you on what days, and the second you start getting uncomfortable you'll know exactly why. But at least at the beginning, do routine checks, especially if your flow is heavy. A little time invested now could easily prevent an awkward situation from arising.


No need to run to the bathroom every half hour, by the way. But checking in on your new buddy every 1-2 hours will be just fine. If anyone asks, you drank a lot of water today!

, Some women wear pads all the time because they think it keeps them ""fresh."" Nope. Don't do it. Your vagina needs to breathe! Shoving a wad of sticky cotton in between your legs allows bacteria to breed in the heat. So if you're not on your period, stick to light, cotton panties. There's nothing fresher than that -- if they're clean, of course! Well, except maybe for the Prince of Bel Air. He was pretty fresh.

, Pads are not a girl's best friend, for the record. That being said, technology has come a long, long way, and thankfully we are not stuck in the diaper-belts that our mothers had (Seriously. Ask yours). Pads aren't pathetically terrible anymore. So if you're super uncomfortable, change it! It's possible it needs recentering, it's saturated, it smells, or that specific kind/size/shape isn't right for you.

, And process repeated! Even if your pad hasn't fulfilled its purpose, change it anyway. It won't get existential on you. But it will smell better and you'll feel fresher. So grab another one, hit up the bathroom, and get fresh.

, When you're changing your pad, wrap up your old one in the wrapper of your new one. If your period is over or a wrapper is unavailable, wrap the used pad in toilet paper. Place it discreetly in the trash, leaving barely a trace. No eyesore in your bathroom!


Never dispose anything that isn't toilet paper into the toilet. The sewer systems of the world aren't some magic pipeline where everything you put down it gets vaporized into oblivion; it all goes somewhere. So be kind to the world and don't flush your pads or tampons (or anything else for that matter).

, Periods aren't the cleanest of female habits, so it's important to stay hygienic. Always wash your hands doubly well when you're changing pads, and clean yourself up down there, too (unscented sanitary wipes can come in handy for this part). The less mess, the fewer germs, the healthier you.


While we're sort of on the topic, don't be grossed out. This is a marker of your femininity -- a perfectly normal, monthly, annoying habit. You're staying hygienic because you want to be clean, not because it (or you) is gross.

, Always. You never know when disaster could strike, your period is heavier than normal, or it comes when you don't expect it. Or when a friend will be in need! When you use your emergency pad, replace it immediately. Like a good Girl Scout, always be prepared!


If you find yourself in the bathroom up the red river without a pad(dle), never hesitate to ask another girl. Seriously. You do not need to be cute and sparkly about it. We all know what you're going through. It sucks. We all love helping a sister out!
While we're at it, you may want to carry some Midol, too!

Make sure you’re putting on your pads correctly.,
Wear pads of correct length and thickness.,
Consider using pantyliners for extra coverage.,
Wear thicker underwear.,
Consider wearing period panties.,

If you’ve run out of pads or pantyliners, don’t be afraid to ask a friend or even a teacher for some backup.,
Don’t move around quite as much as you normally would.,
Wear darker, looser clothes.,
Go to the bathroom more often.,
Sleep on a darker blanket or old towel.,
Be proud of your period.",How to Prevent Pads from Leaking While on Your Period," In order to put on your pads correctly, you have to take them out of their packaging, remove them from their wrappers, and then make sure to place them right in the middle of your underwear, so they don’t go too far up or too far down. If they have wings, then remove the wrapper from the wings and make sure you wrap them tightly around the bottom of the middle of your underwear to hold the pad in place. Once the pad is securely placed inside your underwear, you can put it on, smoothing it down to make sure everything is in place.Make sure to wash your hands before you put on the pad on and that you dispose of it in a trash bin after wrapping it up in its wrapper or in toilet paper.
Some women prefer to use cloth pads over the more common pads. Though they are not said to be more absorbent, they are more environmentally conscious.;
, If you’re having trouble with leakage and have a heavy flow, then you should aim to get pads that have super absorbency and which are as long as possible. At night, you should make sure to wear overnight pads, which are even longer; though these are quite thick, you can even wear them during the day if your flow is very heavy and you tend to leak often.


You should try to get pads with wings to make sure that they don’t move around too much and that they are tightly stuck to your underwear.

, Some people like to place pantyliners sideways above and below their pads. This can give you some extra coverage in places where you tend to leak. You can even place some lighter pads perpendicularly to your pad to really get some extra coverage. That said, this can get a bit uncomfortable, especially if the sideways pads or pantiliners get loose, so make sure you’re wearing tight underwear and that the pads are secure.


If you always tend to leak either in front or behind your pad, you can also move it up or down a bit, depending on where you tend to leak.

, Another way to minimize your leaks is to wear thicker underwear that is less prone to leaks. Though this can’t protect you from leaking all together, it can help you minimize how much you leak and will absorb more of your blood if you do have a leak. Just knowing that you’re wearing thicker, more absorbent underwear can make you feel more comfortable.


Just make sure that the underwear isn’t too loose. Looser underwear will actually make your pad move around more and will make it more likely that you’ll have an accident.

, If you really have a heavy flow and a problem with leaking, then you can consider getting special period panties. No, this doesn’t refer to those old ugly pairs of underwear that you only wear on your period because you don’t care about what happens to them; “period panties” are a special kind of underwear that are made of three distinct layers that protect your pads from leaking. The first layer is absorbent, the second is leak proof, and the third is made of cotton. These layers breathe and keep you cool and comfy while also ensuring that you have the strongest protection.


Though a pair of period panties can cost $20-30 dollars or more, if you get just a few pairs and always wear them on your period, they can be a worthwhile investment.

, Remember that every woman has had her period, and even if your friends can’t help you, they will be sympathetic. If you’re one of the first of your friends to menstruate, then you can try to ask the people who you know may be able to help.

, Though you should be able to do pretty much whatever it is you normally do when you’re wearing a pad, you should know that you will be a bit more likely to leak if you’re doing cartwheels, running around, jumping up and down, or just moving to and fro really fast. Be careful about how you move when you’re on your period, especially on really heavy days; you don’t want the movement to move your pad around or to get it to bunch the wrong way, leading you to leak.


That said, you shouldn’t feel like you have to skip gym class or spend all day sitting in a corner feeling miserable when you’re on your period. In fact, exercising can help reduce cramps!

, You will worry less about leaking if you’re wearing clothes that are less likely to display your leaks. Darker clothes won’t show any potential stains you get, and you’ll also have to worry less about staining lighter clothes and not being able to get them clean. Looser clothes will also make you feel less self-conscious about the fact that you’re wearing a pad and you’ll be able to move around more freely.


Though you don’t need to wear frumpy clothes during your period and you should feel beautiful all the time, if you wear darker clothes, then you’ll be less worried about having an accident.

, Another way to make sure that your pads don’t leak is to go to the bathroom more often than you normally would. Take a trip to the bathroom every hour or two to change your pads or just to make sure that everything is running smoothly. This is a great way to prevent any leaks before they happen. You’ll know exactly when it’s time to change your pads and will feel safe and protected.


If you have to go during class, don’t worry about your teacher getting annoyed; if you ask nicely and don’t make a habit of it thirty days a month, everything will be just fine.

, If you’re worried about leaking at night, especially if you’re having a sleepover at a friend’s house, then you can lie down on an old blanket or even an old towel that you don’t care about as much. This way, you don’t have to worry about staining the sheets and you can sleep soundly without checking the sheets too often. This can help you sleep soundly and feel less self-conscious about leaking.


Think about: the worst case scenario is that you’ve leaked on the sheets and someone else finds out about it. It’s likely that only another woman will find out, and she will completely understand what happened, so you really have nothing to worry about.
If your dad or another male sees the bloody sheets, he will understand what happened, too. Don’t worry so much about what can happen and focus on having a sound, restful sleep.

, Your period should not be something you’re embarrassed about, whether you have a little leak now and again or not. You should be proud of this aspect of your changing body and know that this is something that all women have to live with and manage; the sooner you accept it, the better. Talk to your friends or even your female family members about your period and see that you have nothing at all to be ashamed about because it’s perfectly natural.


Sure, if you leak in public, it can be embarrassing for a minute or two, but you shouldn’t go out in public feeling scared when you have your period because you’re afraid you could leak at any minute. Don’t let your period prevent you from living your life.
If you really find that you can’t feel comfortable when wearing a pad, then you can see if using a tampon or menstrual cup is more comfortable for you. Though you have to change tampons every 8 hours at most, and menstrual cups every 10 or so hours, they can help prevent leakage and may feel more comfortable than pads.

",How to Make a Period Kit," You need something to hold your kit! But make sure it is big enough to hold pads and, if you use them, tampons.;
, Usually, your first period is very light and just spotting, so pantyliners are perfect. For a heavier flow, you'll want pads or tampons. Alternatives are menstrual/soft cups or reusable, cloth pads. You'll need about 3 liners and 3 pads or tampons to last you through a work or school day. Be sure to change every 4-6 hours.

, There's a high possibility you'll get period cramps, which aren't pleasant. Ibuprofen works well to reduce the pain; if you're really hurting badly, you can take up to four at a time as long as you don't exceed the daily limit listed on the label.

It can be used to absorb daily vaginal discharge, post-intercourse discharge, or even a light period flow. Never use just a panty liner on a heavy day.;
, Liners are useful since you don't notice them as much as pads and can feel more flexible and comfortable.

, Discharge is the yellowy white sticky stuff that you can sometimes spot in your underwear. It can be hard to wash off when it dries which is why wearing a panty liner really helps. This is common during ovulation.

,


It's also good to keep a pack if you're going through puberty (developing chest, mood swings, growth spurt, hair, etc.) as spotting and irregular periods can be frequent.






Panty liners are small enough to fit into a wallet and can be a life-saver if you get an unexpected period. It won't be as absorbent as a pad but can provide some protection until you get your period supplies.







, It can be exciting to know you're maturing, but you need to know some facts. If you don't have a mature female figure in your life, you can ask a friend, friend's mother, your doctor or a female teacher. All women experience this and most will be happy to explain without embarrassment., For heavy discharge, you will need very absorbent sanitary pads. For medium discharge, regular pads, and for light discharge, you can use a pad for light flow or a panty liner.


Some women need a thicker and longer sanitary pad for nighttime. Since body shapes differ your nighttime needs may differ. You may only need a liner for sleeping.
Some top liner brands are Carefree and Lil-lets. A good idea for girls just starting their periods is to buy the Lil-lets starter pack which has several types of pads, liners and tampons plus a booklet and a handy make up bag. This is a good idea if you're unsure about your period and don't really know where to start with supplies.They are targeted to girls your age, and they have plenty of information on their websites that can provide more information.
Some offer a light fragrance or a fragrance-free to help combat associated odors. Period blood doesn't actually smell before it comes 'out', it's just when the blood mixes with air that bacteria can start to grow and form odor. Lots of girls worry about smelling but as long as you change your pad or liner every 3-4 hours or your tampon every 6-8, nobody will notice a faint smell. It's a matter of personal preference, but fragrance has been known to sometimes irritate.
Panty liners are often used as a backup for tampons to catch any leakage and prevent embarrassing situations.

, Many women keep a supply of liners, pads and tampons available in their bathrooms or storage cabinet.

, Not only will the bag keep everything organized, it will keep your supplies free of dirt and debris but you won't risk awkward situations should you spill the contents or have someone standing too close while you are looking in your bag.


You'll also have the supplies you need when you need them.
This is a good idea if you are about the age when girls start their periods but haven't yet. You don't want to be unprepared.

There are many products you can use to accomplish this. You may decide to use only one type, or mix it up depending on which activities you are doing, the flow level or day/night needs.;
, Tampons are inserted into the vagina to absorb any blood before it leaves your body. They can be applicator or non-applicator; some users prefer applicator (either plastic or cardboard) so they do not have to touch their genitals too much, but non-applicators produce less waste and give more control when inserting.


Commercial tampons are made from a mix of rayon and cotton, and may be treated with various chemicals and bleach.If this of concern to you, there are organic tampons available, made purely from cotton and do not contain chemicals or bleach.
Tampons prevent vaginal-cleaning, absorb vaginal fluids leading to vaginal damage, and encourage bacterial growth, so in certain conditions, they may affect vaginal health.Some women find that tampons cause cramps or vaginal infections.You can discuss these issues with your health care provider.
Incorrect tampon usage is linked with toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Following the product instructions properly should help to avoid this.Tampons need to be changed every 4-6 hours, you need to alternate between tampons and pads, always use lightest absorbency changing to match flow, never use tampons overnight, when not menstruating, during light flow or if you have a vaginal infection.

, These are reusable tampon alternatives made from natural sponge. These are used in the same way as other tampons, only they can be cut to a smaller size and do not contain synthetic materials, chemicals or bleach. They are reusable, so when it comes time to remove, you simply wash off with water and reinsert. After washing, they are cleaned and ready for reuse, just as sanitary as disposable tampons.These carry the same risks as any other tampons, if slightly lessened, so they require the same need to follow precautions.Some women feel uncomfortable with these because they are non-applicator and have no strings, so you need to use your fingers to remove them; while there is nothing dirty about that, a number of women don't feel comfortable having to do this.
Each sponge tampon will last about three to six months.Synthetic sponge tampons are also available. These are known as 'soft tampons' and most commonly used for mess-free sex during menstruation. Small and soft, these tampons can sit high enough in the vagina to allow for penetration without mess or damage higher up in the vagina.Some women make their own reusable tampons by using clean strips of cloth or even knitting them. With proper care, these can be just as if not more hygienic than commercial tampons., Pads or sanitary napkins are worn outside your body. They stick to your underwear and come in many different lengths and thicknesses. Pads need to be changed every 4 to 6 hours. It's best to use pads with wings to give a more secure fit. Use the lightest absorbency for your flow just to reduce bulk, then use overnight pads as you sleep to avoid leaking when in bed. Women who use tampons may also prefer to use pads overnight or during light flow, as a back-up to avoid leaking and to alternate between pads and tampons.


Commercial pads are made from cotton, synthetics, plastics, chemicals and bleach; these remain the most common option. Be aware that some of these elements may irritate your vulva, as well as causing you to feel sweaty and uncomfortable.Organic or unbleached pads are made from cotton and biodegradable plastics. As well as being better for the environment, they may be softer than other pads and allow for more air to reach the genitals, keeping women dryer and so more comfortable., These are pads made from cloth that normally fasten into your underwear with snap fasteners. They may have extra liners to use when needed, and come in all sorts of different styles, different types of materials, and with all sorts of different patterns. Cloth pads are healthier than disposable pads because they allow more air to your genitals and don't contain chemicals or bleach.This can also mean less odour and far more comfort as they are as soft as your underwear.


Cloth pads are environmentally friendly both in cutting down waste and by using environmentally friendly manufacturing; they are also more economic, as although these can be expensive in the long run saves a lot more money because they're reusable, like sea sponges; it may sound gross, but as long as they're washed, they are completely sanitary.
Washing them doesn't need to be inconvenient, just pop them in your washing machine with everything else, or if you need to soak them as you would stained underwear, and wash without fabric softener or bleach.
As well as many brands of cloth pads being available you can also make your own cloth pads with various patterns and communities available to help you. There are also similar options such as period belts which are long pads that fasten around your waist so they stay closer to the body, or period panties which are underwear with pads built-in so feel and look no different to your normal underwear.

, This is a soft, little cup that you wear inside you. To insert, you fold, insert and rotate to open; it fits over your cervix and collects the blood. Then remove, clean and reinsert. These are quite popular because there many benefits, with many different brands available in different shapes, sizes, colours and materials.


Cups are made from either medical grade silicone, natural gum rubber, or Thermoplastic Elastomer.
Although use seems complicated, many women find these easier to use than tampons or pads; for many women, these are far more convenient because they are safer and more hygienic than tampons so can be used longer and during times they'd not be able to use tampons.
Menstrual cups can be worn for up to 12 hours, including from light to heavy flow, overnight, during sports including swimming (with nothing showing outside the body), and even before your period.
There are no known health risks associated with menstrual cups, many women also report greatly improved vaginal health, lessened flow and lessened cramps.Cups are environmentally friendly in how they are manufactured, cutting down waste, and they can even be recycled at the end of their life.Being reusable they are more economical than disposables, but as menstrual cups last for up to 10 years and can be bought fairly cheap if you shop around, it means menstrual cups are the most economical product available. Soft-cups have similar benefits to menstrual cups in that they can be worn for up to 12 hours, including from light to heavy flow, overnight, during sports including swimming (with nothing showing outside the body), and even before your period.
It is also possible to use a diaphragm as a menstrual cup, which would be a cheap option for women who use diaphragms as contraception (menstrual cups cannot be used as contraception) and these allow for mess-free sex during menstruation., These are a similar idea to menstrual cups, however they are disposable. Menstrual cups are more bell-shaped, while soft-cups are shaped more like a diaphragm so sit higher up in the vagina. Soft-cups are loved by many women, but just as many women dislike them as they can be difficult to insert, can leak and may be a little messy; many women will switch to menstrual cups as a better option.Like diaphragms, these can be used for mess-free sex during menstruation, although some people can feel soft-cups during sex and again these are not a contraceptive device - many couples use these to help aid conception by keeping sperm close to the cervix. Soft-cups are disposable, but many women reuse a single cup throughout their whole period, so they do work out slightly better for the environment and economically than tampons or pads - even if disposing after use soft-cups are still better for environment and your pocket than disposable tampons or pads.

, Different activities call for a different type of product. A day at the pool or beach would obviously call for a tampon or cup, although most pads can't be used cloth pads can, but do you think you'd be comfortable with that? Are you going for a sleepover with your girlfriends? A pad would work just fine. Think about where you're going and who you'll be with, and make your decision.


Also take into account your own health needs and preferences. Consider how a particular product will affect your health, comfort and convenience. Also consider the cost and your budget. You may also prefer the organic, eco-friendly options.

, Part of being a woman is getting to know your own body, and your menstrual cycle is part of that. Sure, you'll make mistakes every once in a while, but you'll learn quickly. Eventually you'll figure out that you like to wear a tampon on a date to the movies, or a pad to sleep. Everyone is different. Most women will stick with whatever product they first used in their teens, so pick wisely in your teens, but also be open to trying new things as for all you know another product may work much better for you.

, Just place it over your lower stomach and leave it there for a while. If that doesn't work for you, then you could use Midol or aspirin. Ask someone you trust what the products with the best results are. You could take a really nice, hot bath. This helps a lot! You can also take a vitamin to relieve some of the pain, or eat a banana, which is rich in potassium!

, This can lead to even more or even worse cramps. Avoid eating a lot of food during your period, and when you do eat, eat something healthy. It's also best to avoid dairy or chocolate, for this can also give you really bad cramps. Drink plenty of water too! Also, cinnamon will help curb cramps, breast pain, and mood swings. Use it on your breakfast toast, in your tea/coffee, or just carry cinnamon sticks around and chew on them. They taste good and they help with bad breath, too!

, Don't wear your tampons for over 8 hours because this can lead to a severe medical condition known as Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). Make sure not to wear panty liners or pads for a long time. This can make them start to smell! Change panty liners and pads often.

, It's not very fun having to walk around in tight jeans with a tube top clinging to you. Sweatpants and a comfortable top is just fine. You can wear tight pants if you choose, but it may be uncomfortable. Don't be too obvious! You don't want everyone to know it's that time of the month. Keep a jacket around if you want, so if you have a leak you can wrap it around your waist. It also helps to bring a spare set of clothes in case really bad leaks happen.

, Stressing out during your period can lead to an even worse period. Stressing can affect your flow cycle. If you have to take some time out for stress-relief, take a day off and stay home.

, You can also use baby wipes or Playtex/Cottonelle/etc. wipes.

, They're often more reliable than regular pads or tampons, can help with reducing odor and irritation, and will ensure you never find yourself out of supplies in the middle of the night. Plus, the long-term savings can be spent on buying yourself a stress-reducing treat like a massage or nice dinner.

, Most girls will feel very self-conscious at this time. Wear your favorite jewelry, makeup, or perfume to boost your spirits.

, It helps a lot to have a really good, close friend, preferably female, to look after you and help you through your ""time of need."" Usually, she'll know exactly how you're feeling and will do whatever she needs to help you out. Just please don't start making her your slave, or else she may abandon you and you won't have her as a friend anymore. Ask for small things like for her to make sure you haven't leaked, or if she could help you with an energy or confidence boost. Best friends are really good at this kind of thing. Make sure it's someone you can trust completely!

, Keep in mind that this only works with sweatshirts and shirts that had tighter sleeves. It won't work on loose, flowing sleeves.

, If you like to wear boots, you can always tuck a pad or tampon inside them. Pads will fit most comfortably in fitted, lace-up boots. Tampons may fit inside bulky, slip-on boots. You may need to tuck the tampon under your sock to keep it from rattling around, however.

, If your cycle isn't set yet, know what time of the month it generally comes (beginning, middle, and end). If you think it will come, use a pantyliner during the day, but a light/medium absorbency pad, depending on how heavy/light you flow starts at.

, These are internal like tampons, but they are not associated with TSS, (Toxic Shock Syndrome), so they can be worn for up to 12 hours (even during the night), unlike tampons. These hold more flow than tampons or pads and have light suction so they prevent leaking.

, Change your tampon when you go to bed and when you get up in the morning. You can use a panty liner or a heavy pad, according to your needs.

, You can even make your own. These are not only healthier and more hygienic than commercial pads but they are also far more comfortable and stick in your underwear better, plus you can get extra liners to insert when needed.

, If necessary, use a third one in the middle.

, Use one as usual, then place one perpendicular towards your rear.

, Lay the towel on your mattress. When you go to bed, lie on the towel so that if you do leak it will go on the towel and not all over your sheets or bedding.

Wash your hands before leaving the bathroom.",How to Change a Sanitary Pad," The bathroom will provide plenty of privacy, plus a hand-washing sink and toilet paper should you need it. You can change in another private place (like your bedroom), but the bathroom is the most convenient.


Wash your hands before you change the pad. You want your hands to be clean when you handle the new pad.
You should change your pad every three to four hours unless your period is heavy. In that case, you should change your pad more frequently.Your pad can begin to smell if you don't change it promptly. A heavily saturated pad that is worn too long can also cause chaffing or a rash, and the build up of bacteria can potentially cause an infection.;
, Menstrual fluid may continue to flow out of your body while you're changing your pad, and allowing it to fall into the toilet will keep you and your clothing clean.


Make sure your underwear and pants aren't touching the outside of the toilet when you pull them down around your legs.

, If your pad has wings, you'll want to pull those off first. It's easiest to grab the front or back edge of the pad and simply pull it--it should separate from your underwear easily.

, The adhesive should cause the pad to stick to itself so that it will stay rolled up. Roll it up the way you might roll up a sleeping bag, but not tightly! You don't want to squeeze out any blood.

, This reduces waste and is a great way to wrap up your old pad. You can also wrap your old pad in toilet paper. This should keep it from unrolling and is also a courtesy to whoever empties the trash or enters the bathroom after you.

, Pads don't break down like toilet paper, and they are too thick and absorbent to flush down the toilet. If you flush a pad, chances are very high you will clog your plumbing and have a big, expensive, and embarrassing mess on your hands.If there is not a trash receptacle in the bathroom stall (there is usually a little bin on the floor or built into the side of the wall, just bring the pad out with you and throw it out as soon as possible. There's probably a trash can in the bathroom by the sink.
If you have pets at home, make sure you always throw out your pad in a garbage can with a lid. Animals can be attracted to the smell and might take your pad out of an open trash can. They may rip it up and cause a mess, or they may consume parts of the pad, which can endanger their lives.

, There are many different types of pads available for women to use. The amount of blood on your soiled pad should give you an indication of your flow--is it heavy, regular, or light? Also, consider what you are about to do. Are you about to go to bed? Are you going to be sitting in class or playing basketball? Some pads accommodate all of these things.


Use an overnight pad if you are going to sleep. They have maximum absorbency and are often extra long to prevent leaking if you sleep on your back.
Pads with wings will give you more security--they will keep your pad in place and are especially great if you plan to do something active.
If you are near the end of your period, and you have a very light flow, consider pantyliners, which are very slim and protect your underwear from spotting.

, This will expose the sticky side of the pad that will stick to your underwear. If your pad has wings, wait to remove the paper until you have placed the pad in your underwear.

, In general, you don't want your pad to be too far forward or back in your underwear. The center of the pad should be in line with your vaginal opening.The shape of the pad should give you an idea of how it should fit onto your panties.


If your pad has wings, remove the paper to expose the adhesive glue and wrap them around the fabric of your underwear.
If you are sitting or laying on your back, you may want to slide the pad backward slightly, toward your butt.
You may have a few leaks at first, but as you get more used to wearing pads and your period, you will have a better idea of the best placement.

, Make sure you feel comfortable and that the pad isn't too far forward or back. If it feels uncomfortable, you might want to refasten the pad or try again with a new one.


Before you pull up your pants, you probably want to wipe with toilet paper or a baby wipe so feel fresh and clean.

, You may have come into contact with bacteria while changing your pad or wiping, so make sure you wash your hands with soap and hot water afterwards.

Try this out the first time in the privacy of your own bathroom instead of a public one.,

Wash your hands.
,





Unwrap the Softcup from the purple packaging.
,

Stay relaxed and try not to tense your muscles down there.,
Get into a comfortable position.,
Find your cervix.,



 The cup should be in this upright position for insertion.,

Squish the pink rim so it changes from its full circular shape to a more rod-like shape.
,





Insert the Softcup.,





Tilt the Softcup downward and back while inserting it, and then nudge the front of the rim upward, so it hooks behind your cervix.,

Leave the Softcup in for 12 or fewer hours.,





Remove the Softcup.,
Crumple up some toilet paper and put it into the plastic sac to absorb the fluid.",How to Use an Instead Softcup," Also, although you may want to do a dry run while you are not on your period, it's generally more lubricated and a different environment down there while you're on your period. So it's best to try the first time while you're on your period. You may want to choose a light day if you're going to be out and about.
,,, This may make it painful or difficult to insert. (Keeping your jaw slack during insertion will really help.) Be patient; the first time inserting it is always the hardest, so don't give up if you're having trouble at first., You may try inserting the Softcup while over the toilet. You can also try squatting down in the shower or tub, putting on leg on the edge or the toilet or tub, or laying down on the floor with your knees up and legs apart., Stick a finger inside your vagina and feel for your cervix, which feels kind of like the tip of your nose. It is a small, squishy nub with an indentation in the middle. In order for the Softcup to work properly, it needs to be hooked around the back of your cervix, so you need to know approximately where it is.,

Make sure the opening of the Softcup is facing upwards.
,, Spread apart your labia and find the opening of your vagina with your other hand. Now push the cup back towards your tailbone, not straight up. Push the cup into where you think your cervix is, which is probably as far as you can push it in., If the Softcup is in the proper position it will be comfortable, and you won't feel it. The pink rim of the Softcup is made of heat-sensitive material, so it will adjust to your unique body shape.

Softcups have a higher capacity than tampons however, and if used correctly, shouldn't leak as much., Put a finger inside your vagina until you can feel the edge of the Softcup. Hook your finger under the rim and pull the Softcup out slowly. Make sure to keep the cup as upright as possible during removal to avoid spillage. You may want to practice removal in the shower the first few times while you get used to it, as it can get messy. If the cup is too large and hurts you at the entrance to your vagina, use two fingers to keep it pinched into its smaller shape., Then wrap the entire thing in toilet paper, throw it away, wash your hands, and insert a new Softcup. Or you can choose to reuse the cup. See the tips for cleaning instructions."

Take advantage of female cashiers.,
Fill your basket with other items.,
Visit the store during off-peak hours.",How to Buy Feminine Products Without Being Embarrassed1," If you feel uncomfortable having a male ring up your period purchase, wait for a female cashier. They are guaranteed to have experience buying their own feminine products, and knowing you share that bond will make the experience much more comfortable for you.If there are no female cashiers working, you may have to bite the bullet and get checked-out by a male cashier. Don’t worry – they ring up thousands of items a day and they won’t comment on what you’re buying (if they do and it makes you feel uncomfortable, seek out a store manager).
If you still feel uncomfortable dealing with a cashier, utilize self-checkout. This is an option at most grocery stores or pharmacies, and is an easy way to buy personal items privately.
If the pharmacy section of your grocery store or drug store is open, check out there. It’s usually much quieter, and pharmacists are used to selling people embarrassing things.;
, The easiest way to distract people from your feminine product purchase is to buy additional items. That way, when you’re checking out, tampons aren’t the only thing you’re looking at. Fill your shopping basket with food, shampoo, notebooks – whatever you need to feel better and distract yourself from the pad you’re also buying.Don’t go overboard on buying stuff. You’ll end up with a lot of junk you don’t need, plus the more you buy, the longer it will take for you to check out.
Don’t use coupons. Coupons take additional time for your cashier to ring up and will only slow down the process (especially if you are purchasing a lot of stuff). If you are aiming to get in and get out, bypass the coupons.

, Stores are frequently much quieter during the week and late at night. If you visit your grocery store or pharmacy when it’s slower, you’ll have a better shot of seeing fewer people, which means less opportunities to embarrass yourself.Stores often roll-out savings during off-peak hours, so you might be able to score your tampons at a greater discount.
Going to the store when it’s slower also lowers your odds of running into somebody you know, if that’s one of the things that scares you about publicly buying feminine hygiene products.

This can prevent bacteria from spreading into your vagina.;
, The tube of cream should come with an applicator that you can screw it onto. Gently squeeze the tube from the bottom so that the applicator is filled with the correct dosage.

Hold the applicator upright so that none of the cream leaks out.Avoid screwing the applicator and the tube too tight. You'll need to be able to get the tube of cream out of the applicator for future use.

, Stand with your legs and knees apart. Place one foot up on a stool, the edge of the toilet, the bathtub or a chair. Or, you could lay on your back with your knees bent and your feet about shoulder width apart.You should be somewhat comfortable and have easy access to your vaginal opening.

, Take your non-dominant hand and separate the lips of your vulva (the labia) so that your vagina is exposed. Your dominant hand should be holding the applicator filled with cream.

Know all your options.,
Learn about your body.,

Use your first tampon on a day when your flow is regular, not at the very start or end of your period.,
Remove tampons at an appropriate time.,
Don't just use tampons because your friends do.",How to Know when You're Ready to Start Using a Tampon," What could make it uncomfortable to use is a small vaginal opening, so keep this in mind when deciding whether or not to start using tampons.;
, There are options such as menstrual cups and soft cups which are safer and can be more convenient than tampons, while other girls prefer external products like pads during their periods. What you use when you are young is what you are likely to use as you grow up, so know that what you are using is best for you.

, Knowing where your vaginal opening is and how it curves within your body makes insertion easier, but also knowing how your vagina functions helps you understand how tampons effect your vagina and how this can effect vaginal health. This allows you to make an educated decision about whether tampons are best for you or not. Every package of tampons comes with an insert that explains this, so take the time to read it all the way through before using one.

, Even though your body might be ready for tampons, you might not be. You must be comfortable enough with your body that you can insert and remove tampons, and you must be mindful enough to change the tampon frequently and follow precautions (see the Warnings below). If you are squeamish or forgetful, you might want to stay away from tampons.

, As you get more comfortable with tampons, you can start using them on the first and last days of your period, but you should never use them before or after your period.

In fact, many people prefer to use pads or menstrual cups. Tampons provide more freedom in motion and are superior when playing sports, especially those involving water. However, tampons can require some effort with handling or insertion.Sanitary pads are worn within your underwear and catch the blood flow. They come in a variety of sizes from slim liners, designed for short term use, to overnight styles. Many women find pads to be bulky and cumbersome; however, they are easy to use and a safe option if you are concerned about forgetting to switch out tampons regularly.
A menstrual cup is a flexible, small rubber cup that fits inside your vaginal canal. You insert it by hand and it then collects the blood. You have to remove it at intervals in order to rinse out the collected blood before repeating the process. Women who are worried about a tampon's materials may be more comfortable with this option. However, you do have to learn how to properly remove and insert the cup.;
, After you open the plastic package of the tampon, you will see the tampon itself and the attached string. The applicator is the harder plastic cover that includes a barrel covering the absorbent interior, a grip area for your fingers to hold onto, and a plunger to help push the tampon inside of you. Go ahead and turn a tampon over in your hand and take a close look.If you are worried about the string for removal, go ahead and give it a tug or two. You will see that it is very snug and not likely to break off. If it makes you more comfortable, you can plan on testing the string of each tampon before using it.
Also, get into the habit of taking a good look at the outside packaging. Never use a tampon that comes from a ripped or torn package.

, Not all tampons are the same. Before you head to the store to buy anything, go online to the websites of the various big brands, such as Playtex, and look at the different types of tampons available. As a first time user, it is best to select a light-flow, slim brand with a built-in applicator.You can also buy a mixed box with larger tampons intended for heavier flow days as well. Only use these after you’re comfortable with the entire process.
You can also buy just tampons without the applicators. These will require that you use your finger to insert the tampon. The applicator included style tampons are generally the best ones to use at first as they are easier to handle., Go to a private place, such as the bathroom, sit on the toilet and use a hand mirror to examine your vulva, or outside genitalia. Don’t be afraid as you really can’t hurt yourself. You will notice that your vaginal opening is the middle area and a smaller hole, your urethra (for urination) is in the area as well, but is smaller. You will insert the tampon within your vaginal opening. Getting to know your body will make you feel more confident about using a tampon properly.Make sure to always wash your hands before and after touching your vagina. This will ensure that you do not pass germs along.
It may appear as if your vaginal opening is not large enough to accommodate a tampon, but this is generally not the case. With a bit of lubrication, often period blood, this opening will stretch wide enough.
If you do a bit of research online regarding female anatomy, you will see that it is also not possible to lose your virginity by using a tampon. It is unlikely that a tampon will tear your hymen (the tissue that covers your vaginal opening deep in the interior). And, the loss of virginity requires sexual intercourse., There are many reputable websites, including The Period Blog, which provide step-by-step images showing how to insert and remove a tampon. Some sites will even let you ask a question in the comments area, to be later answered by the moderator.It is also a good idea to read the instruction sheet that came with your package of tampons. This sheet often shows a usage diagram as well and lists safety information as well.
Studying your anatomy and usage charts will also show you that your vagina is essentially a canal with the cervix as its end point. This means that it is not possible to permanently “lose” a tampon within you. This is a myth., If you have an older female friend who has started her period and is familiar with using tampons, you might talk with her about how to use them. She might be able to provide you with some tips or suggestions. Your mom or another female relative might also be helpful. Just make sure that whoever you talk to will keep questions and concerns private.For example, you might say, ""I'm about to try using a tampon for the first time. Do you have a particular brand that you'd suggest I buy?"" Or, ""Do you have anything that you suggest I should do to make the first time easier?""

, Ask your parents to make an appointment for you to meet with your pediatrician or general doctor. Or, if you trust them, go to the school nurse and ask to have a private conversation with them. Explain your situation and ask any questions that you have.


You might say, ""I'm thinking about starting to use tampons. What are some of the possible risks? What are the benefits of tampons versus pads?""
This is a good time to consider whether or not you trust and are comfortable talking with your main doctor. If not, you may want to talk to your parents about switching to another one.

, When you are ready to try out a tampon, make sure that you go to a place where no one will bother you. A bathroom at home is ideal because a school bathroom could open you up to interruption. If you afraid of interruption at home, you can always pretend to take a bath or shower while you give it a shot.


Make sure to wash your hands before and after touching and using a tampon.

, Try to relax yourself. You can take a few breaths and then count down from ten. Or, you can repeat, “You can do this,” over and over again in your head. It may also be helpful to listen to some soothing music in your iPod or do a few general stretches., Visualize being somewhere else and doing something that you enjoy. Think about all of the things that you’ve accomplished that were challenging at first. Remind yourself that a few years down the road using a tampon will be second nature and not a big deal. You need to stay relaxed mentally and physically or your vaginal muscles will contract, making it more difficult to insert the tampon.It you just can’t seem to relax, it may be best to start over another time. If you feel as if your vaginal muscles are tensing up, you may be experiencing vaginismus. This is a perfectly normal physical reaction to stress and will lessen if you relax.

, Don’t feel the need to rush. Even if you just spend some time examining the tampon itself that can be considered progress. Also, it is better to go slowly and have a good experience than to rush and never consider using a tampon again.

, You can sit on a toilet and try to insert it that way, but many women find it easier to assume an alternate position. You can place one leg up on the toilet seat for wider access to your vaginal area. Or, you can try a squatting position, spreading your legs more apart. Feel free to explore various options to see what works the best for you.For the first time, some women prefer to avoid the bathroom entirely. Instead, you can lay back on your bed and open your legs. Or, stand a use a chair for balance.

, Use your finger to locate the entry to your vagina, as you saw in the mirror before. Then, guide the tip of the applicator to the opening. If you are inexperienced in tampon use, you will find that this is less scary and easier to do than moving around the applicator in search of an entry point., Position your middle finger and thumb on both side of the grip, holding firmly. Your middle finger can then go to the end of the plunger. Of course, you can experiment with this hand hold until you find a position that works the best for you. The key is to keep a good grasp of the tampon in the grip area., Gently guide the applicator tip into your vaginal canal. The entire applicator should fit inside you with the grip portion and your fingers staying outside of you. So, the barrel portion is inside and the grip is outside. The applicator should be in a position that is parallel to the floor. If you try to push the applicator vertical, you will hit the upper wall of your canal.


If the area is sufficiently lubricated, the tampon applicator should slide smoothly in. You should not have to push it hard or jab it at all.
This is the step that presents the most problems for first-time users. If you need to, take a few deep breaths and pause before moving the applicator in.

, Flex your middle finger on the end of the plunger and push down until it is flush with the applicator. Keep your hold on the grip the entire time. When the plunger is fully down, then tighten your fingers on the grip and pull the applicator out of your vagina.If your applicator was pushed enough inside of you, you should not feel the tampon at all. If you released the tampon too low, you will likely feel its presence and slight discomfort. If this is the case, simply pull on the string to remove that tampon and try the process over again with a fresh one.

, It is common to feel discomfort as you insert a tampon the first time. This is likely caused by nerves or perhaps a too-low positioned tampon. However, you should not experience any type of pain. If this happens, stop what you are doing immediately. You may want to try again or just go ahead and talk with a doctor., When your tampon is fully inserted, you will see the string still hanging out of you. This is exactly what you should see. Don’t push the string up into you, leave it out. When you are ready to remove your tampon, grab the string and pull gently downward. The tampon should slide out as you continue to hold the string.Some people prefer to remove a tampon prior to urinating, so that the urine is not soaked into the string.
Also, make sure to properly dispose of all parts of the tampon once you are finished using them. It is generally not a good idea to flush any part of a tampon down the toilet.

, Follow the usage guidelines included in your tampon package, but is generally a good idea to switch out tampons every 4-6 hours at least. If you have a heavier flow, performing more frequent switches is a good idea too. Knowing your tampon schedule will take some of the stress off your mind.Some women also prefer to alternate between using a pad and tampon. This is an especially good idea for overnight.
Making sure to regularly switch out your tampons can help to prevent Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). This is a potentially deadly illness that is generally preventable with careful tampon use., If you just can’t manage to get that tampon in the first time, it is okay. You are not alone in this situation. Many women try out tampons once only to delay until later. Or, you can always switch to pads as well. Do what works the best for you and don’t forget to reach out for help if you need it.

When you start using tampons, or if you have never looked at how they work, take the time to look at your genital area to get a better picture of what goes on when you use a tampon.Get a mirror and look at your vagina so you have a good idea of the anatomy, where the tampon goes, and how it gets inserted before you start to insert a tampon.;
, Tampons come with different kinds of applicators. You can get plastic applicators, cardboard applicators, or tampons without any applicator at all. You should try to figure out which is the best for you. For most women, a plastic applicator is easier to insert than others.A plastic applicator has a slicker surface that may be easier to slide into the vagina. A tampon with a cardboard applicator or without any applicator may not slide as easily and get stuck or stop before it is completely inserted.

, Because a woman’s flow varies greatly, tampons come in different sizes and absorbencies. When choosing a tampon, you may want to go for a smaller tampon, especially if you are experiencing pain or having trouble inserting it properly. Try light or regular size tampons.Each box explains the difference between the different tampon sizes. Light tampons are the smallest and most slender. They don’t absorb much blood, so if you are bleeding heavier, you may have to change your tampon more often. A regular tampon may also be a good option because it is still more slender but holds more menstrual blood.
Super and super plus tampons may be too large to be comfortable. They are larger around because they are designed to hold blood from heavier flows.
Make sure to use the absorbency that corresponds to your flow. Don’t use a larger tampon made for a heavier flow if you don’t need it."

Another way that may help is to stand with one foot up on a stool, the edge of the toilet, or the edge of the bathtub or a chair.If none of these makes you comfortable, you can try to lay on your back with your knees bent and your feet about shoulder width apart.

, Hold the tampon in your dominant hand. Hold the tampon at the middle, where the smaller tube inserts into the larger tube. Use your other hand to spread apart the labia, which are the flaps of tissue on either side of the vagina. Make sure to relax.The string should be pointing away from your body because it will remain outside of the body and used to remove the tampon later.
Remember, you can use a mirror to help guide you, especially the first few times.

, Place the top of the tampon applicator at the vaginal opening and gently push the tampon up to the point where you are touching your vagina. The tampon should be at an angle directed to the small of your back. Use the index finger of the hand holding the tampon to gently push on the smaller tube. Push gently until you feel a bit of resistance or the inner tube is completely in the outer tube.Use your thumb and middle finger to pull out both tubes without touching the string.

A hymen is perfectly normal and is usually a crescent piece of tissue that encircles part of the opening of the vagina. If the hymen is intact, it can interfere with the insertion of a tampon and cause pain.Sometimes, the hymen completely or nearly completely covers the vaginal opening. Other times, there is a strand or band of tissue that runs across the vaginal opening. If this strand is there, it can interfere with the insertion of a tampon, causing pain. See a doctor to get this checked out and to ask about having it removed.

, Another common problem women have with inserting tampons is that they get nervous and tense up. This is especially common if the woman has had a bad experience. The vaginal wall is lined with muscles and, just like any other muscle, can get tense. This can make the insertion of a tampon very uncomfortable and sometimes painful.


Doing Kegel exercises has helped a number of women with tense vaginal muscles. Kegel exercises are a series of exercises which contract and relax the vaginal muscles. You do them exactly as you would if you were stopping the flow of urine and then allowing it to flow again. You can do these exercises anytime and anywhere.Try for three sets of 10 contractions and releases every day.

, You should replace your tampon as needed. When you are awake, that may be every four to six hours, or more often depending on how heavy your flow is.However, don’t leave a tampon in any longer than overnight. Tampons left in too long increase the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. TSS is a rare infection that can be associated with tampon use. The symptoms of TSS include:Flu-like symptoms, such as muscle and joint aches or headache.
Sudden high fever
Dizziness, fainting, or lightheadedness
Vomiting
A sunburn-like rash
Diarrhea

, If the methods to help reduce the pain of inserting a tampon don’t work, you can make an appointment with your physician or gynecologist to see if there is a problem. For example, the hymen can easily be perforated and removed to allow free flow of menstrual blood, allow the use of a tampon, and make sexual intercourse much more comfortable. It is considered minor surgery and can usually be done in the doctor’s office.


If tense vaginal muscles are the problem, the goal is to learn to control how tense the vaginal muscles are. If you need more help with this, talk to your physician about a treatment plan.
If you have to have your doctor remove your hymen, this does not take away your virginity. Virginity is a state of experience, not a state of having an intact hymen.
If you experience any of the symptoms of TSS, remove the tampon right away and get to your physician’s office or an emergency room. TSS can progress quickly and is a serious infection that needs immediate medical attention.

Never flush tampons down the toilet.,
Wrap the tampon in a piece of toilet paper.,
Place it in the garbage.",How to Dispose of Tampons1," Once you have removed your tampon, you should dispose of it properly. This means never letting the tampon simply fall into the toilet and then flushing the tampon down the drain. This will clog the drain of the toilet and could damage the plumbing., You should take a piece of toilet paper and wrap it around the tampon. This will prevent blood from dripping everywhere and protect your hands from touching the blood on the tampon.Wrapping the tampon in toilet paper will also make it appear more discreet and hidden. You may do this to try to cover up the tampon.

, Make sure you dispose of the tampon in the garbage. Throwing it away as soon as you take it out will contain the mess and allow you to get rid of the tampon discreetly.


Sometimes tampons can start to smell if they are left out for a few days so you may start a separate garbage for your tampons next to the garbage or in the bathroom cupboard. Make sure you dispose of it after one to two days.

"
Cover the tampon in toilet paper.,
Use the disposal bin in a public washroom.,
Put the tampon in the garbage at a friend’s house.,
Place the tampon in a paper bag if there is no washroom.",How to Dispose of Tampons2," Maybe you need to dispose of your tampon in a public washroom or when you are at a friend’s house for a sleepover or a hang out. You should always start by wrapping the tampon in toilet paper. This will protect your hands from getting blood on them and prevent any blood from the tampon from getting on the floor, the toilet, or all over the garbage.You may decide to wrap the tampon several times in toilet paper to protect it, especially if you are at a friend’s house and want to dispose of it discreetly.

, If you are removing the tampon in a public washroom, there is often a small metal bin beside the toilet that you can open and place the tampon in. It may be marked “tampons only” or “sanitary napkins only.”You should close the lid of the metal bin once you have deposited the tampon. Often these disposal bins are emptied by cleaning staff once a day.

, If you are at a friend’s house for a sleepover or a hang out and have to dispose of your tampon, you should place it in their garbage. Never flush it down the toilet, as this can clog the toilet.


You should avoid putting the tampon in your bag or in your pocket, even if it is wrapped in toilet paper. Tampons can have a strong smell due to the blood and menstrual material on it so you do not want to find a smelly tampon in your bag or in your pocket later.

, If you are camping or you do not have access to a proper washroom for whatever reason, you should try to wrap the tampon in toilet paper, a paper towel or a piece of paper, in a pinch. Then, you should place the tampon in a paper or plastic bag. This will ensure the tampon does not leak blood or get blood everywhere. You should then try to throw the bag away as soon as you can in a proper garbage.

Sit down on the toilet.,
Find the string attached to the tampon.,
Gently pull the string and remove the tampon.",How to Dispose of Tampons3," It is easier to remove the tampon when you are seated on the toilet. Being seated will allow you to spread your legs apart and access the tampon. It will also help you angle your fingers so you can easily slide out the tampon.Sitting on the toilet will also ensure that any blood that drips out when you remove the tampon will go into the toilet. This will make for less mess, with no blood on your underwear or on the floor.

, Your tampon should have a white string that dangles off the end of the tampon. You should be able to look between your legs and find the string coming out of your vagina.If you do not see a string dangling out, it may have gotten stuck in your vagina throughout the day. Often, the string gets broken or tangled up when you exercise. You may need to use your fingers to probe around your vaginal opening for the string., Once you have located the string, you should grip it gently with two fingers. Then, carefully pull on the string to slide the tampon out of your vagina. It should slide out fairly easily with a gentle pull.If your tampon does not come out or appears to be stuck, you may need to seek medical attention. Sometimes tampons can get stuck if they are left in too long, if the string gets stuck in your vagina, or if you accidentally have sex while wearing a tampon. You should get the tampon removed as soon as possible by a doctor as leaving the tampon in can put you at a high risk of developing Toxic Shock Syndrome."
"
Always change your tampon every four to eight hours.,
Use a tampon that matches your flow.,
See a doctor if you display any symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome.",How to Dispose of Tampons4," You should try to always change your tampon every four to eight hours as leaving it in for longer than eight hours can increase your risk of developing Toxic Shock Syndrome. You may end up using multiple tampons in a day, depending on your flow, but this is to be expected.If you tend to forget to take out your tampon, you may set a reminder in your phone for every eight hours so you remember to change it. You should also only wear tampons to bed if you plan to wake up in eight hours. Do not wear a tampon to bed if you plan to sleep for longer than eight hours.

, You should look for tampons that have the absorbency level that you need based on your flow. This will ensure you have the necessary protection and are using a tampon that fits your needs. If you have a heavier flow, especially during the first two to three days of your period, you may go for a tampon with higher absorbency. If you have a lighter flow, especially during the last few days of your period, you may opt for a tampon with the lowest absorbency.You can also determine your required absorbency by noting how the tampon appears when you remove it. If it appears dry, you may be using a tampon with an absorbency that is too high. If it appears soaked and very wet, you may need to use a tampon with a higher absorbency.
You should never use a tampon to soak up discharge that is coming out of your vagina. They are only made for use when you have your period.

, You should see a doctor right away if you develop any symptoms of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) while wearing a tampon. TSS is a bacterial infection that is caused by a build up of bacteria in your vagina.You may experience one or two of the symptoms of TSS at one time, including:A sudden fever (102 degrees Fahrenheit or more)
Vomiting
Diarrhea
A red rash on your body
Dizziness or faintness when you stand up

Some common brands for tampons include Kotex and Playtex, and most companies that make pads also make tampons, so you can go with the company that makes your pads to feel comfortable. Basically, there are three things to keep in mind: paper or plastic, absorbency, and whether or not the tampon has an applicator. Here's what you need to know:


Paper or plastic. Some tampons have a cardboard applicator (paper), while others have a plastic applicator. The paper applicator has the benefit of mostly being flushable, but you may not want to take your chances if you have an unreliable plumbing system. Some people say that plastic is also a bit easier to use. You can try both and decide what you like best.
Applicator or no applicator. Most tampons are sold with applicators, while others are not. When you're starting off, it's much easier to use tampons with applicators so you have more control over the process. The tampons without applicators require you to push the tampon up in your vagina with your fingers, which can be a bit more of a challenge. The upside of these tampons is that they are super small, so you can even keep them in your pocket, if necessary.
Absorbency. The most common types of tampons are either ""regular"" or ""super absorbent"". It's generally recommended that you start with regular tampons to get the hang of using them before you move on to the super ones. They are a bit bigger, though they aren't necessarily harder to use. You can also use regular tampons first, when your flow isn't as heavy, and then switch to more absorbent tampons, depending on your flow, or vice versa. Many packs of tampons come with some regular, and some super absorbency tampons, so you can mix and match.;
, Though this isn't mandatory, inserting the tampon when you've just begun your period and your flow is still light will make it a bit harder for it to easily glide into your vagina. If your flow is heavier, the walls of your vagina will be more moist and will allow the tampon to glide in more easily.


Some people want to know if they can practice using tampons when they aren't on their period. While nothing horrible will happen if you do this, it'll be harder to insert the tampon into the vagina, and you may want to wait until your actual period begins.
Though asking your mom or your Aunt for help may be the last thing on earth you want to do, if you try it on your own and really have a hard time, or if you're just afraid to try it, don't be afraid to ask a trusted female for some help.

, It's important to wash your hands before you insert a tampon so that you keep the tampon and applicator sterile before you insert it inside your body. You don't want to get any bacteria in your vagina and cause an infection.

, Wait until your hands are dry and then carefully tear open the tampon wrapper on its top and throw it away. It's okay to be a little nervous, though there's no reason to be. If you accidentally drop the tampon on the ground, you should throw it away and start with a new one. You don't want to risk getting an infection just because you didn't want to waste a tampon.

, As you get more comfortable with using a tampon, you'll get a better sense of which method works for you. Some women like to sit on the toilet when they insert a tampon. Others like to stand and squat a little. You can also place one leg on the toilet or side of the tub to make your vaginal opening more accessible.


Though it's natural to be nervous, you should try to relax as much as you can. The more relaxed you are, the easier it will be to insert the tampon.

, Hold it in its middle, right at the spot where the smaller, inner tube inserts into the larger, outer tube. The string should be easily visible and should point downwards, away from your body, with the thick part of the tampon pointing up. You can also place your index finger on the base of the tampon and your middle finger and thumb on the provided grips.

, The vagina is between the urethra and the anus. There are three openings, which are the urethra, where the urine comes from, the vagina, which is in the middle, and the anus, in the back. If you can find your urethra easily, then feel an inch or two behind it to find the opening of the vagina. Don't be afraid of getting a little bit of blood on your hands — that's perfectly normal.


Some people recommend that you use your other hand to open your labia, which are the folds of skin around the vaginal opening. This can help you position the tampon in the opening. However, some people are able to insert a tampon without this additional help.

, Now that you've found your vagina, all you have to do is place the tampon just an inch or so into the top of your vagina. You should slowly push the tampon up until your fingers touch the applicator and your body and the outer tube of the tampon is inside your vagina.

, Stop when the thin and thick portions meet and your fingers touch your skin. The applicator is there to help you insert the tampon further up your vagina. You can think of this as pushing the inner tube of the tampon through the outer tube.

, Now that you've inserted the tampon into your vagina, all you have to do is to remove the applicator. To do this, simply use your thumb and your middle finger to gently pull the applicator away from your vagina. The string should be hanging from your vaginal opening.

, You should discard the applicator if it's made of plastic. If it's made of cardboard, check the instructions on the box carefully to make sure you can flush it. If you're not sure, it's better to be safe and to throw it out.

, Though this isn't necessary, many girls like to wear pantyliners along with their tampons just in case their tampons start to leak a bit after absorbing as much menstrual fluid as they can. Though if you use the bathroom regularly and change your tampon as often as need, this isn't likely to happen, wearing a pantyliner may give you an extra sense of security. Plus, you'll barely be able to feel the thinnest pantyliners.

, If you don't feel comfortable with the tampon in, then it's likely that you didn't insert it correctly. You shouldn't be able to feel the tampon in at all if you did insert it properly. If you feel uncomfortable or like it's not all the way in, then you should remove it. You will even be able to tell if you didn't insert it properly because the bottom of the tampon may be visible outside of your vagina. If this is the case, it's time to try again.


When you have the tampon in, you should be able to run, hike, bike, swim, or participate in any physical activity you want to do.

, Though you should remove a tampon every 6 to 8 hours at the longest, you may find that you will need to remove your tampon sooner if you're having a heavy flow. It's important to check on it every hour or two, especially when you're using tampons for the first time. If you find that you wipe yourself and see a lot of blood, or see blood in the toilet, then this is a sign that your tampon can't absorb any more blood and that it's time to take it out. (This can also be a sign that you didn't insert it all the way, which is also a reason to take it out.)

, Though the instructions on your box of tampons may say that you can flush the tampon, if you want to be safe and don't want to have to call the plumber because your tampon clogged up your old-fashioned toilet, then you may want to wrap it up in some toilet paper and throw it out. If you're in a public bathroom, you should see a bin either on the floor of the bathroom stall or on the side door, which you should use for discarding your used tampon.

, Once you remove your tampon, you can go ahead and insert another one. Most people don't sleep in tampons, and you may want to use a pad overnight instead, unless you plan on sleeping for less than 8 hours.


If your tampon string is wet with menstrual fluid, then it's time to change your tampon.
If the tampon still feels difficult to remove and a bit ""stuck,"" then it's because it hasn't absorbed enough menstrual fluid yet. If it's been less than eight hours, then you should try again later. Try using a tampon with a lighter absorbency next time, if there is one.
If you leave your tampon in for longer than 8 hours, you may get Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS), which is a very rare but potentially deadly consequence of leaving in your tampon for too long. If you've left a tampon in for longer than recommended and experience a fever, a rash, or vomiting, get help immediately.

, It's best to use tampons with a lower absorbency than you need. Start with a regular tampon. If you find that you have to change it more often than every four hours, then you should switch to a tampon with higher absorbency. As your period tampers off, you should use tampons with the lightest absorbency. Once your period is almost over, you may find that it's more difficult to insert the tampon. When your period is over, you should stop using tampons.


Use a pantyliner for an extra day if you feel that your period may not be completely over yet.

, The tampon has an extremely strong, durable string that runs through it, which never falls off. The string runs through the entire tampon instead of just being attached to the end, so there is literally no way for it to just detach. You can even try taking a new tampon and tugging on the string as hard as you can for a while — you'll see that it's impossible to just take it off, and therefore not possible that the tampon will get stuck inside of you. This is a common fear that people have, but it is completely unfounded.

, Some people who wear tampons go years before realizing that they can actually pee when they use them. The tampon is inserted into your vaginal opening, and you pee out of your urethral opening. The two are close together, but they are different holes, and therefore, inserting a tampon will not fill your bladder or make it harder for you to pee. Some people think that if they pee, that the tampon will come right out, but this absolutely will not happen., You do not have to be over 16 or over 18 to wear a tampon. It's perfectly safe for girls younger than this to wear tampons, as long as they know how to insert them correctly.

, Some people think that they can only wear tampons after they have had sex, and that using them before that will make them lose their virginity. Well, this is just completely untrue. While using a tampon may occasionally cause a girl to tear or stretch her hymen, nothing will make you ""lose your virginity"" other than actual sex. Tampons work just as effectively for virgins as for non-virgins., Wearing a tampon will not give you a yeast infection, contrary to what you may have heard. There has been absolutely no scientific proof that this is possible. Some people think this is the case because women tend to get yeast infections around the time of their period, which is also when they use tampons."
"
Have courage.,
Be respectful.,
Write a list of reasons and benefits.,
Try working out a deal.,
Know how to use tampons.",How to Convince Your Parent to Let You Use Tampons1," You may be a little nervous about asking your guardian permission to use tampons. Especially if they've told you right off the bat that you should wait until you're older. Bring it up when you're the only ones in the kitchen, car, living room, bathroom, etc. Try saying such things as: ""Hey mom, would you be okay with me using tampons as long as you could explain how? I will probably need help, but I think I'm ready."" That way, she feels included (like you're not keeping things from her) and you will most likely be allowed to use tampons.;
, When you have this conversation, make sure to look your parent in the eyes and pay attention to body language. If your parent looks uncomfortable or is saying she or he would prefer you to wait, explain a little more. For example, try saying something like: ""Mom, if I could make a list of facts why tampons would be easier than pads, would you be okay with it? The pads are uncomfortable. What about swimming? I need it for that, too.""

, If your guardian still won't budge after the previous steps and you find yourself writing a list, then so be it. Make sure you use good sources, such as www.beinggirl.com. Find a site that will answer some questions that you may be too embarrassed to ask yourself. After you have gotten the information and have your list ready, arrange a day to explain it to your mother. After all, she knows tampons are easier than pads. You might have to plan your words a few days before, but if you have to go that far, it's highly recommended. Your guardian should understand. If it is a male, or if the male guardian is your main guardian, he will probably let you do whatever after step 2. Guys don't do so well with this stuff. Anyway, make sure you know how you will have your list and explanation ready.

, For example, offer to only use tampons on your medium to heavy flow days, also during sports. Try to get as much out of the deal as you can. Remember, when you earn your own money, you can buy your own tampons.


Maybe you should avoid asking until you can get them for yourself and start using them alone. If your guardian asks about it just say you took it upon yourself as a responsible woman to choose your own products. Explain you are comfortable with this choice. They can't decide what you do with your own money unless it is a family thing.

, This is both important for reassuring your parent that you know how to do so, and for ensuring you get it right when you do start using them.

Sit your guardian down and have a direct talk with them about your period.,
If it doesn't work out as you planned, just be more responsible.,
Make sure to use the tampon correctly and try again if it feels uncomfortable.",How to Convince Your Parent to Let You Use Tampons2," You should probably have some facts to back up your reasoning for needing the tampons more than the pads. If your mother or guardian is understanding and direct as well, she will most definitely understand.

, That will also show you are becoming a woman and you can take care of important things. Sooner or later, they'll catch on and understand that you are ready to switch.

, That means it's not in properly. Try again.

Leave a note in your mother's purse or makeup bag before bed.,

If your parents are flexible and easy to talk to, this method should be easy.",How to Convince Your Parent to Let You Use Tampons3," Perhaps a sticky note on a sandwich you made her for lunch? Make sure she's the only one who gets it.

, She will probably talk to you about it and what she thinks you need. Then you should talk about what you would be comfortable with and what you think you should buy. If you continue with pads after that, use the first method.

, Make sure to ask for help when you need it.

Ask your parent/guardian for a private conversation.,
Write them a letter.,
Talk to someone you trust.,
Be prepared to be denied.,
Tell them what is going on.,
Explain why you want to use tampons.,
Ask with a polite manner.,
Avoid whining if they say no.,
Calm their fears.,

Offer stories of others your age.,
Explain situations where you need them.",How to Ask for Permission to Use Tampons," When you feel you are ready to use tampons instead of pads for your period, you may need to gain the permission of your parents (in many cases your mother). Gaining their permission is important because they buy your feminine products. It is also good for them to know what is going on in your life so that they can take care of you.


For example, if your mom says she is headed to the store in an hour, ask her if you can have a talk before she goes.
Perhaps send a quick text to ask your parent or guardian to meet with you so that when you see them face to face, they will be ready to listen. Say, “When I get home from school today, can we talk for a minute?”;
, If you feel embarrassed or stressed about talking to your parents about using tampons, try writing them a letter. You may also want to write a letter if it’s hard to find time to sit down with them. Writing a letter helps you organize your thoughts and make a strong appeal.Write down your thoughts in a logical order, such as opening with your desire to use tampons, describing why they are a good idea, explaining that you have the responsibility to handle them, and closing with a polite request.
Revise your letter for proper wording and punctuation.
You could open with, “Dear Mom, I know it may seem weird that I’m writing a letter, but I wanted to ask you something personal, and I feel more comfortable writing a letter than talking face to face.”
You could also consider making it electronic, either writing a text or email, if that is something your parent or guardian would read.

, If talking to a parent or guardian is too difficult, either emotionally or logistically, you may want to talk to another trusted adult first. Get advice from them on how to approach your parents. Discuss your fears with them. They may be able to offer advice that makes you feel less uncomfortable than talking to your own parents.


Another adult you might discuss this with is your doctor. Your doctor can offer medical advice about tampon application, calming the fears of both you and your parents.
Pull aside a trusted adult and ask, “Hey, can I talk to you about a personal issue real quick?”
This can also be an experienced friend.

, Part of asking for permission is being ready to have your request denied. Your parents may not feel you are emotionally prepared for such a step. They may think you need to be a little older, or that tampons aren’t safe. Be prepared to show maturity by not getting upset at their refusal.


Think about their personalities and your past experiences with them to help you anticipate what they might say.
Ask why they won’t agree to let you use a tampon in a respectful manner.
Not getting upset can be the sign of maturity your parents need to agree to let you start using tampons. For example, a mature person is thankful, meaning they express gratitude even when things don’t go their way.Understand that your parents are most likely interested in your safety and are not trying to be mean.

, Once you have your parents’ attention, tell them about your desire to use tampons. You want them to clearly understand your position. Even if you don’t think they will understand, you need to express your desire anyway.


Start by saying something like, “So I’ve been thinking about it, and I want start using tampons.”

, Explaining all the reasons why you want to do something is important for helping the other person become convinced. Use persuasion tactics like proper timing, being willing to do something in return, and being persistent. Your parents will probably be impressed by a logical argument made without whining.Choose to ask your parents for a discussion about tampons when they are relaxed, not right after they get home from work.
Be willing to do chores or another task they have been wanting you to accomplish in return for permission to use tampons.
If they say no at first, meet any conditions they offer and ask them again. Keep asking until they relent.
Try, “I am old enough for tampons and I need them because I play sports.”

, Be kind and polite when you ask for permission. Make eye contact with your mom or dad and say nice things about them. Don’t flatter them to get them to agree with you; instead, be genuine with any compliments you give. Also avoid fidgeting, whining, or accusing them if you don’t like their response.Say, “Thank you for taking time to meet with me today.”
Use words like can, could, may, might, would, and so on.These words are humble rather than demanding, and will likely help you get what you want.
For example, say, ""I would like to start wearing tampons,"" instead of, ""I have to wear tampons now.""

, If the answer is “no,” don’t throw a fit. This will only assure your parents that you are not ready for the responsibility of using tampons. Instead of whining, complaining, or being out of sorts, accept their judgement calmly.


Don’t tattle on a sibling in order to make yourself look better. If your older sister uses tampons without your parents' permission, for example, telling on her to get your way might cause family drama rather than help your case.

, When you are presenting your appeal to your parents to use tampons, you may want to start by calming their fears. For example, if they are worried you will get sick from using tampons, assure them that you know when to take out your tampon. If they are worried that you will use it improperly, assure them that you have learned how to use a tampon correctly.


For example, explain that you know you should change a tampon every four to six hours., Start by printing out web pages. You can show your parents that you have read about how to apply a tampon properly. You can also show that you have read about the risks.


Show that you have read up on Toxic Shock Syndrome and how to prevent it.Also show proof that your age doesn’t have anything to do with your ability to use tampons. Any girl with a menstrual cycle can use a tampon.Explain how tampons are perfectly safe for both virgins and non-virgins. The tampon does not interfere with the hymen (the skin covering the vagina).Make them aware that tampons can’t enter the body, so they are a safe alternative to pads., Tell your parents about your friends who are in similar situations to your own, such as the same age and playing the same sports. Explain that they wear tampons and are perfectly fine.


If you are feeling left out because you are not allowed to wear tampons, explain this to your parents.
If anyone tries to bully you for not wearing tampons, tell an adult immediately.
You can tell you are being bullied if you are being singled out on an ongoing basis; the bully is bigger than you in stature or has a stronger personality; and enjoys it when you are uncomfortable., The reason tampons are an option on the market at all is because active women need them. If you play a sport like swimming, you physically should not swim unless you can contain your menstrual cycle; otherwise you might contaminate the water. You can play any sport better with a tampon.

Reach your hand between your legs and pull the tampon string to the side.,
Lean forward a bit and begin to urinate.,
Wipe as normal.",How to Avoid Peeing on the Tampon String1," If you are using a public toilet, you may wish to squat above the toilet, without actually resting on the seat. Otherwise you can use a seat-liner or tear several strips of toilet paper, lay them on the toilet seat, and sit.


Make sure you have pulled down your pants and underwear or lifted your dress or skirt before sitting down.
Squeeze the muscles around your urethra (the opening through which urine exits your body). You only have to do this for a moment, but squeeze tight so you don't start peeing as soon as you sit down.;
, Hold the string against your thigh, and it should be out of the way when you pee.You may also want to reach behind and pull the string back, toward your anus. Only do this if you aren't also going to defecate, and be sure the string doesn't actually touch your anus., Keep your hand and the string out of the way as you urinate.

, Continue to hold the string off to the side, using your free hand to tear off some toilet paper and wipe yourself from front to back.

Don't worry if your tampon string gets wet.,
Change your tampon if the tampon itself gets wet.,
Hold your tampon string to the side or front if you are defecating.,
Don't be afraid to urinate while wearing a tampon.",How to Avoid Peeing on the Tampon String2," There shouldn't be any health repercussions if you accidentally pee on the string.You can squeeze the string with a piece of toilet paper to dry it off before pulling up your pants.It's really a matter of preference--if you are uncomfortable with the feeling of a wet string, or worry about smell, you can change your tampon if you wish.
There has never been a documented case of infection due to urinating while wearing a tampon., If the actual tampon gets wet, it means it wasn't inserted properly and should be changed. Your tampon should be inserted far enough into your vagina so no part of the tampon itself is showing (the absorbent part), only the string.It is not necessary to change your tampon every time you urinate. Change your tampon based on how long you've had it in (never over eight hours) or if your tampon is leaking or ""full.""
If your tampon isn't ready to be changed, you will meet some resistance when you pull on the string.
Always try to match your tampon to your flow--don't wear a super absorbent tampon on a day when your flow is light. This can make removing the tampon uncomfortable.

, While it's fine to get urine on your tampon string, feces contains tons of bacteria that can lead to infection.If you do get feces on your tampon string, use a wad of toilet paper to remove the tampon and throw it away.
Make sure your hands are clean before attempting to insert another tampon--if there is feces on your hands, you could spread an infection to your urinary tract or vagina.

, Before trying tampons, some girls are unsure if it's even possible to wear a tampon and urinate. This can keep some girls from using tampons, since they don't want to change it every time they pee or somehow harm themselves or disrupt their periods.A woman's body has an opening specifically for urine--the urethra. Feces comes through the anus. Your menstrual blood comes out of your vagina, which is located between your urethra and anus."

Dispose of the tampon.",How to Use a Tampon," The cervix, at the end of the vagina, only has a tiny opening to allow blood through. You can always pull it out with the string, or reach in and grab it with your fingers if the string breaks.;
, Just gently lift the string so it is out of the way.

, Some girls skip using pads and go directly to using tampons, especially if they do sports like swimming or gymnastics.

, Tampons might stretch the hymen (the thin membrane that usually stretches when you have sex), but the hymen does not tear. The hymen only partially covers the vaginal opening and is intended to stretch and bend. Even if your tampon use does stretch the membrane (which can happen during other activities, too, like frequent horse-riding), it doesn't mean you're not a virgin.

, Whether you're off to work or school or out playing sports, always have spare tampons in your bag. Especially when first starting your period, it might be helpful to pack a small makeup bag with tampons, pantyliners, wet wipes and a spare pair of panties.

, That way, you don't have to worry about hopping out of bed early to change a tampon, or even risk Toxic Shock Syndrome, a rare but serious medical condition that happens when the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus gets into your bloodstream., As you've probably already seen in the grocery store, tampons come in a variety of types and sizes. Here's what's easiest for your first time:


Buy tampons with applicators. Tampons come in two basic types: with applicators, or a plastic tube that will help you push the tampon up into the vagina. Having the help of an applicator will make life easier when you're first learning, so choose a box that includes them. (In the U.S., O.B. is the primary brand that sells without applicators––most other brands have them.)
Pick the right absorbency. Absorbency is simply a measure of how much absorbent cotton is in the tampon, ranging from light to heavy. Most women use heavy absorbency tampons during the first day or two of their periods, when bleeding is heaviest, and transition to lighter ones toward the end.If you're concerned about pain, though, hedge your bets by buying light absorbency tampons. You'll have to change them more frequently, but they'll be slimmer and more comfortable. A good beginning tampon is Tampax Pearl Lite. You can also just get ""junior"" or ""slim"" tampons. Using a smaller sized tampon at first will help you get used to inserting them and they will also be easier to take out.

, It might seem weird to wash your hands before you go to the bathroom, but it's a smart move in this case.Tampon applicators are sterile, and washing your hands keeps any infection-causing fungus or bacteria off them.


If you drop the tampon on the floor, throw it away. It's not worth saving a few cents or even a few dollars on a tampon if you have to go through an uncomfortable and painful infection.

, Spread your knees farther apart than you usually might, so that you have maximum access and visibility while you figure this out, or you can squat and sit like a frog on the toilet seat.


Alternatively, you can stand to insert a tampon, placing one foot on a higher surface such as a toilet seat. If this works better for you, give it a shot. However, most women prefer sitting on the toilet so that any stray bleeding is contained.

, This is the most common hurdle first-time tampon users run into, and it can seem really daunting. Once you figure it out, though, you're set for life! Here's how to make it a little easier:


Understand your anatomy. There are three openings: the urethra (where urine exits) at the front, the vagina in the middle, and the anus at the back.If you already know where your urethra is, feel an inch or two behind it to find the opening of the vagina.
Use the blood to guide you. This might sound weird, but it'll help if you're struggling. Wet a piece of toilet paper, and completely clean up all the menstrual blood in the area, from front to back (or hop in the shower and scrub down). Once everything is clear, dab yourself with a clean square of toilet paper until you find where the blood is coming from.

Ask for help. If you are really and truly lost, don't worry, as many girls before you have been here! Ask a trusted female relative––such as your mom, sister, grandma, aunt, or older cousin––to help you figure this out for the first time. Try not to feel embarrassed, and remember that every woman has been where you are now. You can also ask your doctor or nurse to help.

, At the midpoint of the tampon, where the smaller tube of the applicator meets the larger tube, hold it between your thumb and middle finger. Place your index finger on the end of the applicator where the string comes out.

, Aim toward the small of your back, and push it up a few inches until your fingers are touching your flesh. Don't worry about getting your hands dirty––menstrual blood is actually pretty clean, as far as bacteria goes, and you can always rinse off when you're done.

, You should feel the tampon move a few more inches up inside of you. Stop when the thin portion of the applicator meets the thick portion.

, Gently tug the applicator out of your vagina. Don't worry––you won't pull the tampon out with it if you've followed the instructions and inserted it fully. Once it's out, wrap it in the tampon wrapper or a piece of toilet paper, and throw it into the bin.



Never flush applicators — they can seriously damage plumbing.

, You shouldn't be able to feel the tampon inside of you, and it shouldn't be uncomfortable. If it's painful to sit down or walk around, something's gone wrong; usually it's that the tampon isn't far enough up the vagina. Insert your finger inside the vagina until you feel the tampon. Push slightly, then do another walking test. If it still hurts, you inserted it wrong. Pull that one out, and try again with a fresh one.

, You don't have to do this immediately as soon as four hours have passed, but try not to let it go for longer than six.


Toxic shock syndrome (TSS) is an extremely rare but potentially fatal consequence of leaving a tampon in for too long. If you've accidentally left a tampon in for more than eight hours and you're suddenly experiencing a high fever, a sudden rash, or vomiting, pull out the tampon and get medical help immediately., Removing a tampon might seem painful, but it is not. Take a few deep breaths, loosen up, and remember that it's maybe going to be uncomfortable but not painful.

, You might feel some slight friction from the cotton fibers as the tampon comes out, but it shouldn't be that painful.


If you're queasy at the thought of grabbing the string with your bare fingers, do it with a square of toilet paper.
If you do feel some catching and resistance as you pull the tampon out, it's probably because it's dry. Switch to a lighter absorbency to solve the problem. If it's too dry, use some water so that it does not stick.

, Some tampons are specifically designed to be flushable, so they spread apart and move easily through the pipes. However, if you're dealing with a low-flow toilet, a septic tank arrangement, or you know there have been problems with clogging in the past, it's safest to just wrap it in a wad of toilet paper and throw it away.

Be aware of any special precautions you might need to take.,
Take Midol Complete Caplets according to the instructions.",How to Use Midol1," This medication is a combination of different drugs. It contains 500 mg of acetaminophen, 60 mg of caffeine, and 15 mg of pyrilamine maleate (an antihistamine). It is used to alleviate various menstrual symptoms including headache, backache, abdominal cramps, and bloating.


Acetaminophen is a drug used in relieving pain.
Caffeine is used to increase alertness and boost energy. The recommended dose of Midol Complete Caplets contains the same amount of caffeine as a cup of coffee.
Antihistamine serves as an anti-inflammatory drug that relieves swelling during a woman's menstrual period.;
, If you have liver disease, you need to talk to your doctor about taking Midol. Having liver disease compromises the body's ability to absorb Midol.


Be careful taking Midol Complete Caplets if you are taking other drugs that contain acetaminophen, as you do not want to exceed the recommended daily allowance of this drug (4000 mg per day).
Avoid taking this drug with three or more alcoholic drinks. Your liver will have a difficult time metabolizing Midol if it is taken in addition to alcohol (a harmful substance to the liver).

This drug is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that suppresses pain perception., The active ingredient of Midol Extended Relief is naproxen sodium. This ingredient is closely related, but not of the same category, with aspirin.


Thus, if you are allergic to aspirin, there is a higher chance that you are allergic to Midol Extended Relief as well. If you experience signs and symptoms of allergic reactions, stop using the drug and notify your physician.
This allergic reaction may include facial swelling, difficulty breathing, hives, blisters and skin reddening.

, Take only one caplet every 8 to 12 hours. For the initial dose, you can take 2 caplets, but not more than this. Never exceed 3 caplets within a single day.

Take hormonal birth control pills.Hormonal birth control pills are often useful in the treatment of both primary and secondary dysmenorrhea.,
Try another form of birth control such as an IUD (intrauterine device).In addition to hormonal birth control pills, there are progesterone-based intrauterine devices (IUDs) that may also be used to aid in the pain of dysmenorrhea.,
If you have PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) get treatment with antibiotics.,
Use medications to diminish your pain.,
Try heat to diminish your pain.,
Do some light aerobic exercise.,
Have sex.,
Avoid caffeine, alcohol, tobacco and other triggering substances.,
Have tissue from endometriosis removed surgically.,
Opt for UAE (uterine artery embolization) if you have fibroids.,
Get your fibroids removed surgically.,
Receive a hysterectomy as a last resort.,
Ask your doctor about what could be causing your secondary dysmenorrhea.There are many different medical conditions that can be at the root cause of secondary dysmenorrhea.,
Provide details about your medical history and your sexual history.,
Have a pelvic exam.After asking questions about your medical history, your doctor will need to perform a pelvic exam.,
Receive an ultrasound.An ultrasound can sometimes help your doctor to visualize medical conditions, such as uterine fibroids.,
Opt for an ""exploratory laparoscopy.",How to Treat Secondary Dysmenorrhea," They function by replacing your body's natural production of hormones, including estrogen and progesterone (which are normally produced by the ovaries); instead, you receive these hormones in smaller quantities from the pill. Because you are no longer naturally producing hormones each month, your uterine lining does not grow to the same degree, and you produce less menstrual tissue each month.


In secondary dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis (uterine tissue that grows outside of the uterus), there will be less of this each month, and thus less pain.
Taking hormonal birth control pills can also help to reduce worsening of adenomyosis — the condition where menstrual tissue grows into the muscle of the uterus.;
, Depo-Provera injections (which are also progesterone based, and are given every three months as a form of contraception and/or as a treatment for dysmenorrhea) are another option, as is a hormonal vaginal ring (which is inserted once a week for three weeks followed by one week ""off"" for a withdrawal bleed). You can also use a birth control patch, which must be changed each week for three weeks, with one week off.


Another option in the treatment of secondary dysmenorrhea caused by endometriosis is to take Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists; however, these are only used in the short-term as they may cause side effects, and they are not recommended in teenagers.
If any of these options interest you, speak to your family doctor who can prescribe them.

, PID is another potential cause of secondary dysmenorrhea. It typically occurs as a result of other sexually transmitted infections (such as chlamydia or gonorrhoea) that remain untreated, and ascend into your pelvis and lower abdomen. This can lead to many complications, including problems with fertility, the formation of scar tissue, and ongoing pelvic pain.


Antibiotics commonly used in the treatment of PID include ofloxacin, metronidazole, ceftriaxone, and doxycycline., Although pain medications are not a ""cure"" for secondary dysmenorrhea, they can help to ease symptoms until your doctor is able to offer you a definitive cure (such as surgery). Pain medications can be purchased over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or drugstore.Try taking an NSAID such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve). Follow the dosing instructions on the bottle — typically 400 – 600mg every four to six hours as needed.

, Heat may be just as effective as over-the-counter medications when it comes to easing painful periods. You can opt for a hot bath, or for hot packs placed over your abdomen. Do this as needed to alleviate the pain, while being careful not to burn yourself.If you are on-the-go or can't sit or lie down with a heating pad, try a heating patch that you can stick to your underwear or shirt.

, Aerobic exercise (such as biking, swimming, jogging, or brisk walking — anything that elevates your heart rate for 30 minutes or longer) has been shown to decrease period pain; however, be careful not to opt for strenuous exercise as working out too hard can actually worsen period pain., It depends on personal preference whether you enjoy having sex while on your period; however, for those women who do, the great news is that having an orgasm reduces period pain. It does not matter what type of sex you have. As long as it leads to an orgasm, the pain-relieving chemicals will be released in your brain and you will reap the benefits for your painful period., Caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco are all known ""triggers"" for worse period pain. You may have others as well — for some women, eating too many carbohydrates correlates to worse pain. Know what your triggers are, and take measures to avoid (or reduce consumption of) these things during your period., The only way to definitively diagnose endometriosis is via exploratory laparoscopic surgery. Symptoms alone are not sufficient to make the diagnosis. While you are undergoing laparoscopic surgery, if endometriosis is indeed detected, the tissues can be removed during surgery.Removing the undesired menstrual tissues (that are residing outside of the uterus) can often provide significant short-term relief from the pain of endometriosis.
However, the tissues are prone to growing back, so the pain may return in the long-term.
Frequently a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists will be given to help remove any microscopic disease that couldn't be removed with surgery. You will then be placed on some type of hormonal birth control, which significantly decreases the rate at which symptoms return.
Adhesions (scar tissue) can also be removed during laparoscopic surgery, which may also help with pain relief.

, Fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) growths in the uterus. They may contribute to worsened menstrual pain each month.What happens in UAE (uterine artery embolization) is that the uterine arteries (which supply blood to the uterus) are blocked off.
This cuts off much of the blood supply to the uterus, and thus interrupts the growth of fibroids.
This can be completed as an outpatient procedure, without requiring overnight hospital stay.

, In some of the more severe cases of fibroids (where the growths are larger, and/or the pain is more severe), surgical removal may be recommended. Fibroids can often be removed through the vagina; this is also an outpatient procedure that most often does not require overnight hospital stay., If your secondary dysmenorrhea is unable to be resolved by any of the methods described in this article, the last resort for treatment is to have a complete hysterectomy. This is where your whole uterus is removed, in addition to your ovaries and fallopian tubes if desired (you may wish to remove all of them at once, if you are having the surgery anyway, as it eliminates your risk of developing ovarian cancer at a future time)., The major ones are:


Endometriosis is a painful condition in which menstrual tissue accumulates outside the uterus. Every month, the tissue becomes inflamed, and it feels like a period on the wrong side of the uterus.
Uterine fibroids are non-cancerous growths in the uterus that can cause pain and cramping.
Adenomyosis is menstrual tissue that invades the muscular layer of the uterus. This gets inflamed every month at the time of menstruation, leading to pain.
Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is a form of sexually transmitted infection. If left untreated, it can lead to problems with fertility and/or chronic pelvic pain.
Adhesions are scar tissue that forms as a result of endometriosis or PID. The scar tissue can lead to chronic pelvic pain that is worse around your period.

, As your doctor works to determine the underlying cause of your secondary dysmenorrhea, they will ask you about your medical history.Specifically, you will be asked questions such as:


When did you begin menstruation?
For how long have your periods been painful?
Has the pain been getting better or worse with time?
Can you describe the pain? Is it worse on certain days of your period?
What is your sexual history and have you been receiving regular STI testing?

, They will use a medical device called a speculum to check your vagina and cervix for any problems. They will also insert two fingers into your vagina and press on different areas of your pelvis and abdomen while doing so, to examine for any unusual lumps or bumps, or other findings.


The cause of secondary dysmenorrhea is rarely able to be diagnosed via a pelvic exam, and most often requires imaging (such as an ultrasound), or exploratory laparoscopic surgery.

, An ultrasound can therefore be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause; however, most often a laparoscopy is also needed.

,""Exploratory laparoscopy is when a surgeon makes small incisions in your abdominal/pelvic area to look with a small camera. This can help to diagnose and treat many causes of secondary dysmenorrhea, including endometriosis, adhesions, and pelvic inflammatory disease. It can usually be done as a outpatient procedure at the hospital. It is the primary way to diagnose the underlying cause of secondary dysmenorrhea.

Limiting the amount of salt you get in your diet may keep water retention and bloating at bay and help you feel better.Avoid adding extra salt when cooking. Also be sure to check for hidden sources of sodium in foods such as soy sauce as well as canned vegetables and soups.
Stay away from processed foods, which generally contain high sodium levels. Some examples of processed foods are deli meats and cheeses and dishes from fast food restaurants. Junk foods like potato chips are also often laden with bloat-causing sodium.;
, Eating three balanced, nutrient-rich meals daily can keep you regular and help control bloating. Vary your diet with choices from the five food groups, focusing on fruits, vegetables, and low-sodium or unsalted nuts. All of these can control bloating., Whole fruits and vegetables are high in water, which can help flush excess fluid from your system.Getting at least 1 ½ to 2 cups of fruit and 2 to 2 ½ cups of vegetables every day can help keep you healthy and treat any bloating you may have.Choose whole fruits and vegetables like blueberries, bananas, strawberries, carrots, broccoli, and spinach.

Keep track of your physical symptoms.,
Pay attention to your emotions.,
Repeat this process every month.",How to Track Your Menstrual Cycle1," The first day of your period is the day that you actually start to bleed. Your menstrual cycle runs from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period. The length of a menstrual cycle is different for each woman, but a typical cycle is between 21 and 35 days. Bleeding usually lasts for two to seven days.Count the number of days between your periods and the number of days that you bleed.
If you have started your period within the last two years, your cycle may be longer. Your cycle should become shorter and more regular the older you get. The length will also change when you are in perimenopause or close to menopause.
The frequency and length of your menstrual cycle may also be altered by taking some forms of contraception (e.g. extended-cycle birth control pills).
You typically ovulate between day 11 and day 21 of your cycle. This is the time of your cycle when you are most fertile and most likely to become pregnant if you have sex.;
, Record the heaviness of your flow and any pain that you experience. Try to be as detailed as possible. In addition to keeping track of your physical symptoms, note the day of your cycle that you are experiencing them. For example, do you experience cramping a few days before your period starts?How many pads or tampons did you use?
Are you experiencing cramps? Are the cramps in your lower abdomen and/or your lower back?
Are you experiencing any breast tenderness?
How does your vaginal discharge change throughout your cycle?
Do you experience diarrhea or loose stools during your period? (This is a common symptom.)

, Many women experience emotional changes as their hormones fluctuate. You may experience anxiety, a depressed mood, mood swings, irritability, appetite changes, or crying spells. These symptoms typically occur before your period starts. Write down the day in your cycle that you experience any of these symptoms.Also note any other sources of stress that may be affecting your mood. This can help you determine if you are feeling anxious because your period is on the way or if your are anxious because of a project at work or school.
If these symptoms appear around the same time each month, they are likely related to your cycle.

, Track your cycle for a few months in a row to get an idea of what is normal for your body. You should begin to notice trends and similar physical and emotional symptoms each month. Note any changes that happen from month to month.


Some variation is normal. You may bleed for five days one month and three days the next.
What is normal for you may not be normal for someone else.Do not worry if your cycle is different than other women you know. Look for consistency within your own cycle.
Keep in mind that if you are taking birth control pills, using a hormonal IUD, an implant, patch, or shots, then you will probably have a lighter period than when you did not take the birth control, but this is normal.

Download an app on your phone.,
Use an online calendar.",How to Track Your Menstrual Cycle2," If you would like to track your period the old-fashioned way, obtain a calendar and mark the days with pencil, pen, marker, or highlighter. You may use different colors, symbols, or stickers to mark the beginning and end of your cycle, the length of your period, or the days you experience physical or emotional symptoms. Create a system that is clear and works for you.


If you do not want to overload your calendar with too much information, you can keep a separate journal for your physical and emotional symptoms and only use the calendar to mark the beginning and end of your cycle and period.
If you don't use a calendar often, keep your calendar in a place you will remember it. Hanging the calendar in your bathroom or placing it next to a mirror may be helpful
If you are a very private individual and don't like your period info out for the world to see, use a very discrete mark (e.g. an ""x,"" circle, or color) signifying the event to you.

, Instead of using pen and paper, you can use an app to track your period. These apps can keep all of your information at your fingertips and predict when your period will occur. In addition to having a calendar, many of these apps allow you to record physical and emotional changes that take place throughout your cycle.Clue is a free app for iPhone and Android phones and is one of the most recommended apps. It allows you to record physical and emotional symptoms, the days you have sex, and create reminders to take your birth control pills. After entering a few months of data, the app will use algorithms to predict when your next period starts and when you are expected to ovulate.
Period Tracker Lite is another free recommended period tracking app. This app allows you to use icons to describe your moods instead of typing out your symptoms. It is available for both iPhone and Android phones.

, If paper and pen or apps do not appeal to you, you can use an online tracker. These websites allow you to enter all of your cycle information and often have tools such as calendars, history reports, and reminders.

Manage an irregular period.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Track Your Menstrual Cycle3," You can use the information you have been tracking to make your life a little easier when you experience symptoms. If you know the days that you have cramps, the days that you are more irritable, or when your period is coming, you can adjust your life so that your cycle does not interfere.


For example, if you know that you become bloated three days before your period, you can make sure that you avoid caffeine, salt and alcohol and drink plenty of water during this time period.If you know that you are irritable during a certain time of your cycle, focus on getting enough sleep and practice some relaxation techniques so your irritability does not get the best of you.

, Up to 14% of women have irregular menstrual cycles.If your period arrives early or late, if you have excessive bleeding or barely bleed, or experience severe pain, you may have an irregular period. An irregular period should be easy to identify if you have been tracking your cycle.

Lose weight.Weight management is important for women with PCOS.,
Improve your eating habits.,
Stay active.,
Quit smoking.,
Regulate your menstrual cycle.,
Improve your body's ability to ovulate.,
Check into diabetes medications.,
Attack excessive male hormone.,
Target unwanted hair directly.,
Ask your doctor about laparoscopic ovarian drilling.,
Learn about bariatric surgery.",How to Treat Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)," You do not need to lose weight if your body mass index is already considered ""normal"" or ""healthy,"" but if you are overweight, even a small decrease in your weight can help balance your hormones.


Losing as little as 5 to 7 percent of your weight over a period of six months can dramatically reduce the abnormally high androgen levels caused by PCOS. For more than 75 percent of women, the effect is great enough to restore ovulation and fertility.
Insulin resistance is another major component of PCOS, and obesity can make insulin resistance worse.
You don't need to try any fad diets or intense exercise routines if you want to lose weight. Oftentimes, watching your total calorie count is enough to produce results. Consuming no more than a daily average of 1200 to 1600 calories will usually be enough to help you lose weight.;
, Eat a more balanced diet filled with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy products. You should also consider making alterations to your diet that can help keep your blood sugar levels in check.


Since PCOS is linked to insulin resistance, maintaining stable blood sugar and insulin levels can be important.Follow a low-carbohydrate diet, eating only complex carbohydrates high in dietary fiber.

Eat moderate amounts of high-quality carbohydrates—vegetables, fruits, beans, and whole grains—and avoid low-quality carbohydrates—sugary foods, white/refined grains, fruit juice, and baked goods.
Enjoy foods high in carbohydrates alongside lean proteins—poultry, seafood, lean beef or lean pork, eggs, low-fat dairy, nuts, and whole soy foods—to help curb the rise in blood sugar that occurs after the consumption of carbohydrates.



, Regular exercise can help you maintain your weight, but in addition to that, physical activity itself can help your body lower blood sugar levels and improve your symptoms.


Even a small amount of exercise can help a great deal. If you have difficulty fitting exercise into your schedule, start by walking 30 minutes a day on four to seven days each week.
Focus on cardiovascular exercise instead of strength training exercises. Cardiovascular exercise improves the health of your heart, lungs, and overall circulatory system. It improves your body's ability to lose and maintain a healthy weight, as well. Any exercise that gets your heart pumping can be considered a cardiovascular activity. This includes both light exercises, like walking, and more vigorous exercises, like swimming and cycling.

, If you currently smoke or use other tobacco products, quit as soon as possible. Quitting ""cold turkey"" or all at once is great if you can manage it, but if that proves too difficult, opt for a Nicotine gum or patch treatment that allows you to ease off your addiction gradually.


Studies suggest that female smokers produce higher levels of androgen than female non-smokers produce. Since abnormally high androgen levels are part of PCOS, smoking only agitates the problem further., Heavy and irregular periods are a common symptom of PCOS, so many treatments are aimed at regulating your menstrual cycle. These treatments usually involve medication that can raise progesterone levels while decreasing androgen production.As long as you're not trying to get pregnant, your doctor may recommend the use of low-dose birth control pills, especially if these pills contain a combination of synthetic estrogen and progesterone. With the added dosage of these ""female"" hormones, the ""male"" hormone androgen is decreased. Your body also gets an occasional break from the production of estrogen, thereby minimizing abnormal bleeding and reducing the risk of endometrial cancer. Birth control pills can also clear up any excessive acne caused by PCOS.
If you cannot take birth control, your doctor may prescribe progesterone treatments, which you'll take for 10 to 14 days a month. This treatment can regulate your menstrual cycle and protect you against endometrial cancer, but it will not affect androgen levels in your body.

, PCOS often reduces fertility in women, making it more difficult to get pregnant. If you are trying to get pregnant as a PCOS patient, your doctor will likely prescribe some form of treatment that can improve ovulation.


Clomiphene citrate is an oral anti-estrogen medication. You can take it at the beginning of your menstrual cycle to limit the amount of estrogen produced by the body. The lower level of estrogen in your body is often enough to stimulate ovulation.
Gonadotropins are follicle-stimulating hormones and luteinizing hormones that are injected into your body. They're also effective, but since they are more expensive than clomiphene citrate, they tend to be used less frequently. Moreover, these injections raise your risk of becoming pregnant with multiples (twins, triplets, etc.).
If standard treatments do not work, your doctor may ask you to consider the use of in vitro fertilization.

, Metformin is a medication usually used to treat type 2 diabetes, but there is strong evidence suggesting that it often helps with PCOS symptoms, as well.Note that the FDA does not formally approve of metformin as a treatment for PCOS.
The medication can improve the way your body uses insulin, thereby regulating blood sugar levels in your body.
It can also lower the presence of male hormones in the body. As a result, abnormal hair and acne slows, your menstrual cycle can become more regular, and your ability to ovulate may return.
Additionally, some research suggests that metformin can assist a diet-and-exercise weight loss routine to produce better results.

, If you want to control PCOS symptoms related to the excess of androgen hormone in your body, your doctor may prescribe an anti-androgen medication. These medications are usually used to clear PCOS-triggered acne and decease excess hair growth.


Spironolactone, a diuretic originally used as a treatment for high blood pressure, can reduce androgen levels. Your doctor will likely take occasional blood tests to monitor your blood potassium levels and kidney functions if you take this medication, though.Finasteride is a medication men take for hair loss, but for women, it can be used to lower androgen levels and decrease excessive hair growth.
These medications are often used alongside contraceptives since they can cause birth defects.
Eflornithine is a topical cream that can block the effects of androgen on the skin, which can slow facial hair growth in women.

, Decreasing your androgen levels should slow down or stop excessive hair growth, but if you need to remove unwanted hair before your androgen treatment takes effect, there are a few things you can do to target it directly.Ask about laser hair removal. Hair follicles are targets and destroyed by small laser beams.
Check into electrolysis. An electric current is applied directly to the hair root, and targeted hair is permanently destroyed as a result.
Learn about depilatories. These are prescription and non-prescription chemicals that are applied to the skin beneath your unwanted hair. The chemicals burn away the hair.
At home, you can also use waxing, shaving, tweezing, and bleaching to keep unwanted hair under control.

, For women with PCOS who are trying to get pregnant but do not respond to traditional fertility treatments, your doctor may recommend this outpatient surgery, instead.


The surgeon will make a small incision in your abdomen, through which he or she will insert a laparoscope (a small tube with an even smaller camera attached to the end). The camera takes detailed images of your ovaries and pelvic organs.
Through additional small incisions, the surgeon will insert a surgical instrument that can use electric current or laser energy to burn holes in the follicles alone the surface of your ovaries. Since a small portion of the ovary will be destroyed, you may develop some scar tissue. The procedure can lower male hormone levels and induce ovulation for a few months, however.

, If you are morbidly obese and cannot lose weight through ordinary means, your doctor may recommend bariatric surgery, more commonly known as ""weight loss surgery.""


To be morbidly obese, your BMI must be more than 40, or more than 35 if you have an obesity-related disease.
After the surgery, you will need to follow through with healthy lifestyle changes to maintain or further decrease your change in weight. This includes the diet and exercise changes you would usually put into place when attempting to lose weight.

Consider how long you've been dating.,
Think about why you want to tell him.,
Avoid using indirect terms and referring to your period as ""Aunt Flo,"" ""the crimson wave,"" your ""monthly visitor,"" or any other euphemisms.,
Don't feel offended if he shies away from the conversation.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Have Your Period1," As with most personal information, it's not always appropriate to share something intimate with a person you haven't known for very long. Boys aren't always super mature at this time in their lives, and if it makes him shy, confused, or uncomfortable he might not know how to react.


If you have been dating for a while and you feel you know him pretty well, you might want to bring it up casually. You don't need to make a big deal about it, because it really isn't a big deal!
Think about how he's reacted to other potentially awkward moments in the past. Did he freak out, embarrass you, or tell all his friends? If so, you might want to hold off.;
, Is it having an impact on your relationship? Do your cramps keep you from going out with him? Do you get wicked mood swings and snap at him? If so, it might be a good idea to clue him in so he knows it's nothing personal.If it's not really affecting your relationship, then it's entirely up to you whether or not you want to tell him. If you want to keep it private, that's totally fine. If you want to be up front about it, then go for it., Chances are, he's not going to have any idea what you are talking about and the misunderstanding might make things unnecessarily awkward.If you choose to tell him, use clear language but make sure he knows it's something personal you are choosing to tell him. Say something like ""I know I've been moody this week. I've actually got my period right now and sometimes it makes me a little sensitive. I just wanted to let you know what was going on with me--I'd really appreciate it if you didn't mention it to anyone else.""

, Periods can be pretty mysterious and intimidating to boys, and he might just blush and say ""Oh. Um. Okay."" and never bring it up again. It's not cool, however, if he makes fun of you or says it's gross, but you shouldn't take that personally--it's his problem he's acting like an immature little boy. There's absolutely nothing wrong with you or gross about your period--in fact, it means you're perfectly healthy.


You can nicely offer to give him the low down on what it actually means and that almost every single woman on the planet experiences it--even that pop star he thinks is super hot and that spokeswoman you both admire.
If he's really rude, feel free to put the verbal smack-down on him. Tell him getting your period means you're a woman, and you're not sure if you can date such a little boy. Or tell him you didn't really have your period, it's just an excuse not to hook up with him.

Tell him in a straightforward way.,
Let your boyfriend know how he can help.,
Think of it as a good way to weed out immature guys.",How to Tell Your Boyfriend You Have Your Period2," You don't need to get clinical or overly descriptive--no need to get into the strength of your flow or anything.Chances are he's been through sex ed and had other girlfriends (or a sister or close friend) who has mentioned it before, so it shouldn't be a big deal.


Say something simple, like ""Hey, I just started my period. I'm not feeling so great.""
You could also say ""Oh, it's that time of the month,"" and he'll probably get it.
Sometimes couples come up with cute or funny code words for when you're on your period. So when you tell him it's ""shark week,"" he'll know what's up.

, Even if your boyfriend doesn't know much about the mechanics of your period, he probably knows it can be a rough time for some women. Your boyfriend cares about you, so he probably wants to know what he can do to make you feel better. If your period makes you feel exhausted and crampy, ask if he can hang out with you on the couch while you binge watch and eat ice cream.If you get cramps, you can ask him to rub your back or your belly to help relieve some of the pain.
Let him know if you become particularly sensitive to touch. He might try to comfort you with a hug or other contact, and it's only fair to let him know you you really prefer not to be touched while menstruating.
If you prefer to hang solo when you're on your period, you can (kindly) let him know that just letting you be on your own is a huge help.

, If he can't handle the fact that you menstruate, then he's maybe not boyfriend material just yet. And he's definitely not mature enough to be having sex, if that's something you are considering.At this point, guys should have come to terms with the fact that this is a normal part of every woman's life, and the best thing he can do is be supportive.

Sperm can survive in a woman's body for up to five days and, if you happen to ovulate (release an egg) a little early, it could be fertilized.Even if the chances of pregnancy are lower during your period, the chances of contracting an STD are higher. Because there are more bodily fluids involved (and STDs are found in bodily fluids like seamen, vaginal discharge, and menstrual blood), it makes it easier to transmit an STD., To save your sheets from stains, lay a towel on the bed and have some tissues nearby, in case you need to wipe yourself off afterward.You may also want to consider taking a shower together, since the flowing water will pretty much eliminate any mess."

Try a reusable menstrual cup.,
Consider a disposable menstrual cup.,
Consider a sea sponge.,
Ask your doctor about a diaphragm.,
Try a cervical cap.,
Refrain from full body swimming.,
Wear waterproof underwear.,
Wait until your flow lightens.",How to Swim on Your Period Without a Tampon," Silicone or rubber menstrual cups are reusable, flexible, bell-shaped devices that collect your menstrual flow. The cup should not leak if inserted properly and is one of the best alternatives to a tampon if you want to go swimming.


Menstrual cups have a variety of advantages in addition to being an alternative to tampons for swimming. As menstrual cups only have to be replaced once a year, you'll make less trips to the store and spend less money on menstrual hygiene products. Cups only need to be emptied every 10 hours. Menstrual cups may also cause less odor during your period.Some women find menstrual cups difficult and messy to insert and remove. If you have fibroids or a dropped uterus, it can be hard to find a cup that fits you.If you have an IUD, talk to your gynecologist before using a menstrual cup. Inserting a menstrual cup could potentially dislodge your IUD and you want to make sure you take proper precautions.Menstrual cups come in a variety of sizes, so you may have to experiment with several sizes before you find a cup that works for you. You can buy menstrual cups online or at a drug store.Insert the cup before swimming, and leave it in until you can change out of your swimsuit into your regular clothing and switch to another method of period protection.
Check out this helpful wikiHow page to learn the process of inserting and removing a reusable menstrual cup.;
, While they can be expensive compared to tampons or reusable cups, disposable menstrual cups are flexible, easy to insert, and work well for protection while swimming.


Like reusable cups, disposable cups can be messy to insert and remove and require a learning curve to master placing them correctly in the vagina.
Just as you would with a reusable cup, insert the cup before swimming, and leave it in until you can change out of your swimsuit into your regular clothing and switch to another method of period protection.
Check out this helpful wikiHow page to learn the process of inserting and removing a disposable menstrual cup.

, If you avoid tampons because you are concerned about the chemicals used in their production, a natural sea sponge might be a good solution for you. Sea sponge tampons are harvested from the ocean and contain no chemicals, and they are also reusable.The USFDA (United States Food and Drug Administration) does not approve the use of sea sponges for menstrual purposes due their potential connection to toxic shock syndrome. Tampons and sea sponges work the same way-- by absorbing your menstrual flow. The advantages of a sea sponge are that it is all natural, very absorbent, and conforms to the shape of your body, plus it can be washed between uses and reused for up to six months.Be sure that the sea sponge you purchase for use as menstrual protection is intended for that purpose, since sea sponges sold for arts and crafts or other purposes can be treated with chemicals. Try sponges manufactured by Sea Clouds or Jade & Pearl Sea Pearls.
To use a sea sponge for menstrual protection, begin by washing it in a mild soap and rinsing well. Then, while it is still moist, squeeze out the excess water, and insert it in the vagina while squeezing it tightly between your fingers to compress its size.

, A diaphragm is a dome-shaped rubber cup placed high in the vagina. It is a birth control device, designed to block sperm from entering the cervix. It is not meant as a menstrual device.However, if you have a light flow you can use it while swimming as an alternative to a tampon.


A diaphragm can be left in the vagina for up to 24 hours. If you have sex, you must leave your diaphragm in for at least 6 hours following intercourse to prevent pregnancy. Diaphragms do not protect against STDs.
Diaphragms can increase the risk of urinary tract infections. You should not use a diaphragm if you have a latex allergy. Cramping or pelvic pain can result from the wrong sized diaphragm, so be sure to replace your diaphragm in the event of weight loss or gain of 10 pounds or more.
To wash your diaphragm, remove it and wash it with mild soap, then rinse and dry. Do not use products like baby powder or face powder, as these can damage the diaphragm.
Once again, using a diaphragm for regular menstrual protection is not recommended. If you're having a light flow and want an alternative to a tampon to swim, you can try inserting a diaphragm. You may want to test it out beforehand, however, to see how well it blocks blood flow. If you have sex after swimming, be sure to leave the diaphragm in place for six hours before removing it.

, Much like a diaphragm, a cervical cap is primarily used as a contraceptive device. However, it does block menstrual flow so you can try using it when swimming if you want an alternative to your tampon.


A cervical cap is a silicon cup that is inserted in the vagina. Similar to a diaphragm, its purpose is to prevent pregnancy by blocking sperm from entering the cervix.If you're allergic to latex or spermicide or have a history of toxic shock syndrome, you should probably not use the cervical cap. It might also be a bad idea to use a cervical cap if you have poor vaginal muscle control, any kind of infections like UTIs or STDs, and have any cuts or tears in your vaginal tissues.Talk to your doctor before using your cervical cap during menstruation. It is not recommended for habitual use, but if you're towards the end of your period and you only intend to use it while swimming, it could be a good alternative to a tampon.

, If you're unable to find a tampon alternative that works for you, you can find a way to get involved in water activities without fully submerging.


Sunbathing, wading, relaxing under a beach umbrella, and letting your feet hang in the water are all good options, and you can wear a menstrual pad while you do these things.
Remember that menstruation is a completely normal part of your life, and while it can be embarrassing to tell your friends you are on your period and don't want to swim, you should feel confident that your friends will understand.
If you're uncomfortable telling them that you're on your period, you can simply tell them that you aren't feeling well or don't feel like swimming.

, Waterproof underwear can be a safe, comfortable alternative to your period when swimming or doing other activities.


Waterproof underwear looks much like regular underwear or bikini bottoms but has a hidden, leak-proof lining that helps absorb menstrual blood.
If you plan on swimming in waterproof underwear, know that they will not absorb a heavy or moderate flow. They will only work towards the end of your cycle or on months when you're having a light flow.

, As it can be difficult to find tampon alternatives that are effective and easy to conceal under a bathing suit; if you have a heavy period you may have to simply wait until your flow lightens to swim.


Hormonal birth control pills, when used correctly, can result in a lighter period. Hormonal IUDs may also result in less bleeding during your menstrual cycle. If you're an avid swimmer and dislike tampons, you could look into these options to shorten your cycle overall.
You might also consider Seasonale or other birth control pills that result in less frequent periods. Seasonale is designed so that you take ""active"" hormonal pills every day for three months before taking a week of ""inactive"" placebo pills, which activates your period. Although some women have light, breakthrough bleeding during their active pills, this method can help you predict when you will have your period so you can plan your swimming times around it.Try establishing a vigorous exercise routine. Regular, rigorous physical activities of any kind can reduce the length of your period and make it lighter. If you're an avid swimmer, you may find your cycle changes during warmer months when you swim frequently. However, if your period becomes abnormally light or stops altogether talk to your doctor to rule out underlying medical concerns or pregnancy."

Insert a tampon or a menstrual cup before swimming.,
Bring extra supplies.,
Ignore any myths about why you shouldn't swim on your period.,
Wear shorts if you're self-conscious about wearing a tampon.,
Wear a darker-colored swimsuit if you're nervous about leakage.,
Swim without worrying about your period.,
Protect yourself from bloating and cramps.,
Opt for sunbathing if you're not comfortable swimming on your period.",How to Swim when You Are on Your Period," Though swimming can temporarily reduce your menstrual flow, a tampon will eliminate any flow. Also, especially in a pool, it is not sanitary for you to go in the water with your friends without inserting a tampon or a menstrual cup first. If you are not yet comfortable with these items yet, you should try using them at home before you go swimming. Tampons: If you are already used to wearing tampons, they are perfect for swimming. You do not have to worry about any leakage, since they expand as necessary to fit your body. Be sure to hide the string by tucking it into your bikini bottom and you are good to swim in clear water, wearing any swimsuit bottom. Remember to change your tampon every few hours if you have a flow, and to never wear it for more than eight hours.

Cups: Though menstrual cups are not as commonly used as tampons (yet), they are inserted into the vagina and sit at its base to collect menstrual blood. They can even last up to ten hours, which is more than the eight-hour maximum wear for a tampon. Just like a tampon, the menstrual cup is functionally invisible. It suctions to your body so that no blood escapes, and when you use the cup, you don't even have to worry about hiding a tampon string.
Swimming wearing a pad or a pantyliner is not advisable. A pad will just get wet and soggy if you go in the water, and it will be unable to absorb any leakage. If you just wear it in your suit, it will swell and may be noticeable and probably uncomfortable.;
, If you are wearing a tampon, you might need to make a few changes throughout the day if you will be around the water for an extended period of time. Take a few more supplies than you think you will need, in case your group decides to enjoy the day and stay a little longer. If you want to change from a tampon to a pad once you are done swimming and change into normal clothes and underwear, you can bring those, too.


If you are wearing a tampon on a heavy day, change it every three to four hours.
If you are wearing a menstrual cup, you probably will not have to worry about dumping it out while you are there — it can stay in for up to 12 hours. Still, bringing an extra one just in case will not hurt.
Also, it is likely some other woman in your group may need a tampon.

, There are a lot of lies out there when it comes to your period. Don't listen to anyone who says that swimming with your period is unhealthy, or even that your menstrual blood will attract sharks if you swim in the ocean. Ignore anyone who tells you that your tampon will absorb too much water if you swim with it in. There's absolutely no truth to statements like this, and you are free to swim any day you want to, whether or not you have your period., Though this is not necessary, if you are really nervous about your tampon string showing or just feel a little uncomfortable down there, you can wear shorts to give yourself some extra protection and to put your mind at ease. Buy a cute style that does not look too baggy, and slip them on over the bottom of your swimsuit. For extra peace of mind, buy them in a dark color.


Mens-style ""board shorts"" often look great with bikini tops and is a style that does not draw any attention or curiosity.
You can also fib and say you could not find your swimsuit bottoms or had to borrow your brother's or something.

, Though your menstrual blood is not likely to leak through to your bikini bottom if you've inserted your tampon or menstrual cup correctly, you can also put your mind at ease by wearing a darker-colored swimsuit. Choose a cute color such as dark blue or dark purple and prepare for a fun day of swimming ahead.


You can also choose a suit that's a bit thicker in the bikini area so you don't have to worry about your tampon string showing.

, Swim with confidence! Do not constantly fuss with your suit or twist around to check your rear every 5 minutes — that is a dead giveaway. Excuse yourself from the water and run to the bathroom for a quick check if you're really nervous about something going wrong.. Try to ignore it and enjoy yourself.


Set up a buddy system. Ask a close girl friend to alert you if she notices any problems.

, Though there's no sure-fire way to feel perfectly normal during your period, there are a few things you can do to minimize any cramps or bloating you may experience during your period. Avoid fried, salty, or generally unhealthy foods, along with caffeine. If you're really in pain, take Motrin or another pain relief medication that can ease your troubles. Sometimes, the best thing you can do is just to get in the water and forget about any pain you're feeling., If swimming is too uncomfortable, if you're just not feeling well, or if you just cannot feel confident about going in the water on your period, back out gracefully. Say, ""I'm not feeling up to it right now"" and soak up some rays instead. If everyone in your group is a girl, they will probably understand immediately. If you are in mixed company, the boys won't bother you about it.


Find ways to interact with the group, even while they are in the water. You can sit at the edge of the pool and put your legs in, time races from the shore, or cheer any contests from the sidelines.
Remember that this is only a last resort if you really don't feel comfortable. You should feel confident enough to go swimming whenever you want — period or not. Menstruation is a natural process that should make you proud to be a woman instead of ashamed.

Tell a friend you trust.,
Talk to a friend who has already started their period.,
Tell more than one friend, if you want.,
Wait until you feel ready to talk about it.,
Tell your friend you want to talk about something personal.,
Pick a place where you feel comfortable talking.,
Write down what you want to talk about ahead of time.,
Tell your friend you want to keep it private.,
Break the ice with a question.,
Keep it direct and simple.,
Have a conversation.",How to Tell a Friend You Have Started Your Period," Think about the friends in your life. When talking about a very personal and sensitive topic like your first period, it is important to talk to someone you know will be supportive and who you feel comfortable talking about personal things with. Choose a friend who:Cares about you
Accepts you without being judgmental
Encourages you when you need support
Doesn’t talk about personal things you share without your permission;
, If you talk to someone who already knows what you’re going through, they will probably be sympathetic, and may be able to offer some advice or even lend you some supplies (like tampons or sanitary pads).

, If you have more than one friend that you feel comfortable enough to talk to about your period, this can be a great way to get different perspectives. No two people have the same experiences with their periods. Periods can start at different ages, last for a longer or shorter amount of time, or cause different kinds of symptoms for different people. Talking to more than one friend may give you a better idea of what sorts of things you can expect., Even if your friends are all talking about their periods, you don’t have to feel pressured into talking about yours if you aren’t ready.If your friends ask you if you’ve started your period and you don’t feel like talking about it, stand up for yourself, but keep it simple. Just calmly tell them, “I’d rather not talk about it right now.”

, Once you are ready to talk about it, pick a time when you can approach your friend privately, and tell them you have something important and personal to talk about.


If you have a hard time finding a moment to talk to your friend alone (at school, for example), you might try writing down a note on a piece of paper and handing it to them, sending them a text, emailing them, or giving them a call.
Ask your friend when would be a good time to have a talk.

, This can be any place where you feel safe and will have plenty of privacy: it could be your room at home, your friend’s place, or a quiet corner at school somewhere.

, If you’re not sure what you want to say, it can help to get your feelings down on paper before having a conversation. You don’t have to talk about everything you write down, but making a list of thoughts and questions can give you a good place to start.


In addition to helping you get ready to talk to a friend, writing down your thoughts and feelings about your period can help you feel better if you’re feeling anxious or upset about it., If you don’t want your friend sharing your news with anyone else, make that clear to them right from the start. Just say, “Please don’t tell anyone else what I’m about to tell you,” or “Let’s keep this between you and me.”

, If you don’t feel comfortable coming right out and telling your friend that you have started your period, you might start by asking them something about their experiences.Try asking something like, “How did you feel when your period first started?” or “When your period started, who did you tell first?”
If your friend isn’t comfortable answering your questions, don’t pressure them.

, When you’re ready to tell your friend that your period has started, tell them about it in a clear and simple way. That way, there will be less of a chance that your friend will misunderstand what you are trying to say.


If it helps, you can talk about your feelings first.
If you’re feeling shy or awkward about it, say something like, “I feel a little embarrassed talking about this, but . . .”
However, if you’re feeling more excited and happy, you can start with, “Guess what!” or “I have some exciting news!”
Once you’re ready, say something like, “I just got my first period!” or “My period just started.”

, Once you’ve broken the ice, you might find that you and your friend have a lot to talk about. They might have advice to offer, or they might be happy to have a sympathetic friend who is going through the same things they are. Ask questions, express your feelings, and listen to what your friend has to say. Things you might want to talk about are:Pads vs. tampons. Ask your friend what they prefer, and why.
Cramping, bloating, and pimples. Sometimes periods come with some not-so-fun symptoms. Talking about these things with a friend can help both of you feel better.
Funny stories and embarrassing moments. Everyone who has a period has had some of these. Swapping awkward period stories can help you and your friend find the humor in these situations and remind you both that you are not alone.

Use a heat wrap.",How to Survive a Long Flight when You Have Your Period," If it is possible, book a seat that is on the aisle. You will likely want to get up every hour or two to visit the restroom, and if you are sitting in the aisle, you won’t have to bother any other passengers in order to do so.


If you aren’t able to get an aisle seat, try not to worry. Yes, you will have to ask your neighbor every time you want to get up, and yes, they might get mildly annoyed. Remember, though, that you need to do what you need to do, and it’s not your responsibility to keep them happy. Politely ask them if you can please get up to use the restroom. If you are courteous and respectful, then you have nothing to worry about.;
, Make sure you pack plenty of your product of choice. If you typically only use tampons or a menstrual cup, then you might also consider packing a few panty liners, which are like pads but thinner. These will help catch any leakage that might occur. If you use a menstrual cup, you could bring along an extra one if you have it. Otherwise, bring one or two more tampons or pads than you think you will need.


You should also consider packing a small hand sanitizer. Though it is likely that the bathroom on the plane will have soap and water, it’s good to have it just in case they run out.
You might also pack a small hand lotion. The soap that is provided by the airline could be drying for your skin, and since you will need to wash your hands often, it’s good to have something to help with the dryness.

, It is possible that your feminine product will fail you, and some blood could leak through to your pants. If this is the case, you will be glad that you have an extra, clean pair of pants to put on.


If this happens, and you have a plastic bag with you that is big enough to store your pants, you can rinse them in the sink, and store them in the bag.
If you don’t have a plastic bag that is big enough, roll your used pants up so that the blood-stained part is on the inside, and then you can just store them in the bottom of your carry-on until you can get to a place where you can wash and dry them properly.

, A long flight is uncomfortable for most people, whether they are on their period or not. While you don’t need to dress like a slob, wear clothes that you feel comfortable in. Consider a pair of nice sweatpants or yoga pants in a color such as black, which will help hide any leakage that might occur.


Remember to wear layers. It can be hard to predict how warm or cold the plane will be, but most long flights tend to be on the cooler side. It is often a good idea to wear a comfortable, short-sleeve shirt in case it gets warm, and then pack a warmer sweatshirt, or light jacket that you can put on if you get cold.
Pack an extra pair of underwear in case of any leakage. If it does happen, put on the clean underwear, and rinse out the dirty ones in the sink. Place them in a plastic bag so they won’t get any of your other things wet.
Pack a pair of warm, comfortable socks to put on during the flight. You could also pack ear plugs and a cozy eye mask, if you plan to sleep.

, It is a good idea to have an extra sealable plastic bag that you can use in case there is no trash can, or if the trash can is over-full. If this is the case, you will be able to wrap your used feminine product in toilet paper, zip it up in the bag, and throw it away later.


While this may not be ideal for some, having a plastic bag will give you another option for disposing of your used products. If you get in the bathroom, and realize you won’t have any other place to get rid of used products, you’ll be glad you have them.
It may also be handy to have this plastic bag in the event that you need to rinse any blood out of your underwear. This way, you can put the damp, rinsed underwear into the bag without worrying about it getting your other stuff wet.
If the idea of putting your baggy of used products into your carry-on bag bothers you, you can stick the plastic bag in the air-sick bag, which is usually in the pocket of your airplane seat, take it to the area where the flight attendants are, and ask them if they have a trash can where you can put it.

, If you are embarrassed about people seeing your feminine products, you can pack them into a small handheld bag. Airplane bathrooms are usually very small, so taking your whole carry-on is probably not an option. Having a bag will also allow you to keep all of your supplies in one place, so you don't forget anything when you go to the restroom.


Alternatively, if you don’t have, or don’t want to, bring along another bag to take with you into the bathroom, then just carry them in your hand. A period is a normal, natural thing, and you don’t need to feel embarrassed about it. Most people on flights are too busy sleeping, reading, watching movies, or working to take any notice of what you are doing anyway.

, Having a wipe that is a bit moist to help clean up down there can help keep you feeling fresh and clean. There are many feminine hygiene wipes on the market, and many come individually wrapped so you can open one only when you need it. While you should generally stay away from these type of products, and stick to plain white toilet paper, it is OK to use one every now and then, especially if you have a particularly messy period.You could also use a baby wipe, or simply wet some toilet paper or a paper towel, but be gentle with the skin around your vagina.
If you use a wipe or a wet paper towel, do not flush them down the toilet as they may cause clogs. Instead, throw them into the trash can provided, or seal them up in your plastic bag, that you can throw away later.

, If you are experiencing cramps, back pain, or headaches because of your period, take a pain killer designed to work against menstrual symptoms. You will be even more uncomfortable during your flight if you are suffering from cramps or headaches.


Make sure to take only the recommended dosage!

, If you are wearing a pad, it is a good idea to check every 2 to 4 hours to see if it has become saturated.This is especially true if you are experiencing a heavy flow. If you are using a tampon, and have a heavy flow, you may want to check for leakage every 1 to 2 hours, but understand that tampons must be changed at least every 6 to 8 hours.Wearing a tampon for too long, or wearing an absorbency that is too high increases your chances of developing Toxic Shock Syndrome, therefore it is important that you wear an absorbency that matches your flow; for example, only wear a high absorbency on the heaviest day of flow, and change your tampon at least every 6 to 8 hours.
If you use a menstrual cup, you may be able to go without emptying it a bit longer, but depending on your flow, you should empty your cup every 4 to 8 hours. Four hours if you have a very heavy flow, and you start to notice a bit of leakage, 8 hours if you have a lighter flow, and aren’t experiencing any leakage.
If the bathroom is occupied, it is OK to wait outside of it, or you can try a different bathroom as most bigger airplanes have at least two. It’s good to get up and walk around a bit on long flights anyway, so don’t feel like you’re bothering anyone.

, When you are going to be sticking your hands near your genital area, it is important to wash your hands before doing so. The bacteria that is on your hands from touching various things, especially in a crowded public place like an airport, could cause unwanted infections.


If you have brought along hand sanitizer, you can also use that.
You should wash your hands again after you have finished using the toilet, whether or not you have gotten anything on your hands.

, If you discover that it is time for you to change your product, then do so. Wrap the tampon or used pad in plenty of toilet paper, and throw it into the trash. If you use a menstrual cup, empty the cup into the toilet, and rinse it out in the sink before re-inserting it.

, Whether you are on an airplane or not, you should not throw pads or tampons into the toilet. They will likely clog the pipes, so just wrap them in some toilet paper, and throw them in the trash provided.

, Hopefully there won’t be much clean up to do, but if you accidentally make a mess, or get blood on anything be sure to clean it up well! You don’t want other passengers to come in and find a bathroom dirty because of you.


Furthermore, due to concern regarding blood-borne illnesses, if another passenger finds a bit of blood on the toilet seat or anywhere else, there may be a big commotion about making sure it is safe to use the bathroom, and the flight attendants may be forced to close that bathroom all together.

, Bring a reusable plastic water bottle with you, and fill it up in the bathroom or at a water fountain after you get through security, but before you get on the plane. Humidity in airplanes can drop as low as 20%, which will make you feel more dehydrated.This may make you have to go to the bathroom more often, but in this case it is OK because you will want to get up regularly to check the status of your feminine product anyway.
Don't try to take a full bottle of water through security. Safety regulations will not allow it, and they will make you throw your bottle away if it is full of liquid.

, Long flights can be very, very boring. You will want to have plenty of ways to entertain yourself. Bring along a book you’ve been wanting to read, pack music to listen to (through headphones), or pack a tablet or laptop computer to watch movies on.


Many long-haul flights also offer in-flight movies, which is great, but you shouldn’t count on this as it may not always be the case. Have a back up plan.
Try to get a bit of sleep. For many, sleeping on an airplane is next to impossible, but if you can, try to get a few hours of sleep. This will pass the time, and help you get a little bit of rest before you reach your destination.

, If you are on a long-haul flight (e.g. a flight overseas) or one where you will fly through the night, recline your seat a bit. While many consider this to be rude behavior, you will find that most people do recline their seat on long flights.However, try to be courteous when doing so, only recline as far back as you need to get comfortable, and glance behind you to see who is sitting there before doing so. If someone that is very tall is already scrunched into the seat behind you, don’t recline the seat and make it even more uncomfortable for them.

, Even if you are not planning to sleep, bringing along a travel pillow can help make you a bit more comfortable on a long flight. If you don’t use it to rest your head, you can place it behind your back or even sit on it to provide a bit more support.

, While you will likely be offered food on your flight, this food is usually not very tasty or healthy. Oranges, bananas, watermelon, and whole wheat bread are all reported to be helpful for people suffering from menstrual symptoms.Cut up the watermelon and put it in a sealable plastic container, or just throw an orange or banana in your bag. Not only are these foods healthier, they will help soothe your discomfort.


Don’t forget to pack yourself a treat. Part of getting through a painful period is allowing yourself a treat. In this case, you might consider packing a bit of your favorite candy or chocolate to eat while you’re on the plane.

, Tea and coffee are also believed to be useful for menstruating women.Fortunately, many airlines will offer these complimentary, so enjoy a warm cup of tea or coffee to get some relief.

, There are several products on the market that aim to provide heat to relax muscles. These wraps work like traditional heating pads in that you apply them to the affected area, but they don’t require electricity or hot water to work. There are even wraps that are designed specifically to help with menstrual cramps.


These wraps can usually be worn underneath your clothes, so you can put one on your lower abdomen (or wherever you are experiencing muscle pain from your period) before you get to the airport. You could also apply one when you go to use the airplane bathroom.
Cramps are caused by muscle contractions, and heat works to help the muscles relax a bit."

,
Select sanitary ware that promises anti-leakage features.,
Try to be as active as humanly possible during your period.,
Distract yourself from cramps.",How to Survive Your Period when You Live With All Guys," Don't let yourself run out of sanitary towels or tampons. If you are mature enough to live away from your parents and with 'guys' you should be able to maintain a supply of appropriate products.

, Get a lot of toilet paper and fold it neatly into a similar shape to what a pad looks like, the longer and thicker, the better. Place it as you would use a regular pad and wrap the end of the big piece or even another piece around everything a few times to keep it all in place, make sure you do this before going to bed or you're definitely going to have menstrual fluid all over your panties in the morning.


Try to change these every 1-2 hours depending on what day you're on in the cycle.;
, Fold it to the size of a regular pad, then stick it in your underwear. Make sure you have extras on hand, since you may have to change once every hour or two.

, Is there someone you can go to in a hurry to beg for a pad or two from? Always give back a fresh new package of pads if you resort to this.

, This can help you cope with the potential embarrassment of having to ask one of the guys for some.

, If you can't get out to get sanitary gear for yourself, ask the most switched-on guy in the household to get out there and buy some pads or tampons for you. It's probably best to target the guy who has sisters; it won't be odd to him. It will be odd if you wince, grimace or make a song and dance about it though; talk about it as natural (after all, it is) and keep the request simple. Don't apologize for having your period, although it's okay to apologize for not being organized enough.


If you're comfortable and casual about the fact of having a period (""Hey.. would you mind getting me some pads on your run to the drugstore?""), then the guys are more likely to be comfortable too.
If asking a guy to buy you pads or tampons, be specific. He probably doesn't know which brands are best or what you like, so make sure to tell him exactly what you need- write it down for him to make it easy.
You might want to just tell the oldest guy, or the guy you're most comfortable with, about your period and tell him that you need some help.

, When you're alone at home, wash them with cold water and then put them in the washer and dryer.

,, They can't be 100 percent foolproof but you're more likely to overcome leakage problems with quality sanitary ware that tries to prevent this.

, You'll notice that the more you exercise, the less menstrual fluid and pain there is. Be sure to keep your own limit in mind, if you think you are too tired/painful, you need to stop. Sports can help a lot, but with some people, the 'damage' you cause to your muscles, takes longer to heal when you're on your period. Do not risk any injuries and stop when you need to stop. You're feeling unwell and it's not a shame to just lay in bed for three days, if you feel like you have to.

, You might be able to fake a headache and get some other painkiller, but in case you don't then try these things: doing something you enjoy a lot, watching a funny or scary movie, again with the exercising thing, you'll even find that you might be able to sit a certain way that stretches you stomach and helps with the pain.

, Lady's mantle is an herb often used for menstrual issues. Drink it as a tea to help reduce heavy menstrual flow.Lady’s mantle is also known as alchemilla vulgaris or “woman’s herb.”The leaf of this herb is used in the production of medicine and has strong contractile (muscle tightening), coagulating (blood clotting), and astringent (blood vessel tightening) effects.These characteristics can help bring menstruation to a normal level.

, Similar to cinnamon, red raspberry contains phytochemicals that may help relax the uterine muscles. Steep the leaves as a tea to help reduce heavy menstrual bleeding.Although there are no studies on humans, some research on animals has shown the relaxant power of raspberry leaf.Wash 170 g (2 cups) of raspberry leaves and bring 1/2 liter (about 2 cups) of water to a boil.Strain and enjoy one cup up to three times a day., These homeopathic remedies may help alleviate the symptoms of menorrhagia. Studies suggest that black cohosh (cimicifuga racemosa) can regulate estrogen and progesterone levels.Sabina may decrease the severity and duration of menorrhagia.Try 40 – 200 milligrams of dried black cohosh daily, divided into multiple doses. You can also try 0.4 – 2 milliliters of a (1:10) 60% ethanol tincture, or a tea one to two times daily.You can find sabina in pellet form from brands like Hylands and Boiron. Follow the dosing on the bottle.

, Placing an ice pack on your abdomen may reduce bleeding. It may also alleviate pain and swelling.The application of cold causes vasoconstriction, or the constriction of your blood vessels, which can decrease blood loss.Wrap an ice pack in a towel or t-shirt and place it over your abdomen for no more than 20 minutes.Reapply the pack after two to four hours for as long as the symptoms continue.If it is too cold or your skin gets numb, remove the pack., Take an over-the-counter NSAID (Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drug) when you experience heavy bleeding. This may not only help reduce blood loss, but also alleviate pain.Follow the instructions on the medication bottle for dosing.
You can get NSAIDS at pharmacies and some grocery stores.

Treat menorrhagia when it affects your daily life.,
Try herbal remedies when you are not pregnant or breastfeeding.,
Take herbal remedies after careful research.,
Consult your doctor before trying natural remedies.,
Use natural remedies if they remain effective.",How to Stop Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Naturally3," Heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding can disrupt your life more than normal menstruation does. If your periods make it difficult to perform standard daily tasks, remedies that help stop or slow heavy bleeding can be a good option for you.


Most women won't actually experience bleeding heavy enough to be classified as ""menorrhagia."" If you have this condition, the amount of blood loss and the severity of any associated cramping will completely prevent you from performing basic, everyday activities.If your bleeding is only moderately heavy, but not severe, consider relieving your symptoms using common, medically verified treatments instead of unverified herbal options. Relieve pain with NSAIDs and heating pads. Consume nutrients that help your body, and avoid foods or substances that may make cramping worse.

, Pregnancy concerns shouldn't be an issue if you’re currently experiencing heavy menstrual bleeding. Since many of these herbal solutions impact hormonal balances, however, they can negatively impact a pregnancy or harm a nursing infant. Taking these herbal supplements before menstruation occurs can be risky if you might be pregnant; similarly, taking these herbs while still breastfeeding may also put your baby at risk.


In particular, you should especially avoid use of black cohosh, alchemilla, chasteberry, and raspberry leaf during pregnancy or breastfeeding.Talk to your doctor before taking iron and magnesium supplements, as well.You may also wish to avoid chasteberry and other hormone-sensitive herbal remedies if you are taking birth control pills or undergoing hormone replacement therapy., ""Natural"" does not necessarily mean ""safe."" While the herbal and supplemental treatments recommended for ending heavy menstrual bleeding are typically safe for most women, it's a good idea to do your own research before ingesting any herb since some may aggravate certain medical conditions.


Keep in mind that many herbal solutions only have limited research backing them. While some women may benefit from using these remedies, there's typically little scientific evidence supporting claims of effectiveness, and little research about possible side effects and risks involved.
If you're at a high risk for certain hormone-sensitive conditions, including breast cancer, uterine cancer, or endometriosis, herbal remedies that impact your hormonal balance may further increase your risk. This includes, but is not limited to, black cohosh, chasteberry, and raspberry leaf.
Additionally, black cohosh may present a risk to those with known liver disease or seizure disorders.Alchemilla and chasteberry may also result in possible liver damage,and chasteberry may affect your levels of dopamine.It is possible to overdose on iron, so you should avoid taking iron supplements in large doses for more than six months. Consult your doctor if you intend to continue use after that time., Most natural remedies will be safe for most women who suffer with heavy menstrual bleeding, but your doctor will be able to advise you on which could work best for your specific health needs and which could result in further problems.


Additionally, your doctor should be able to help diagnose the cause of heavy menstrual bleeding. Most causes aren't too serious and will typically respond to natural remedies. In some cases, however, excessive bleeding can be caused by thyroid disease, uterine cancer, fibroids and other serious conditions that require medical intervention.A diagnosis from your doctor should be able to rule out these serious conditions and ease your concerns. In addition to a physical exam, your doctor may perform blood tests, pap tests, ultrasound scans, and other tests to rule out various disorders and conditions., Natural remedies can help many women who suffer from heavy menstrual bleeding. If taking natural remedies does not put your health at risk, and if these remedies prove effective for you, you can typically continue taking them; though, occasional consultation with your doctor is still advised.


If natural remedies are not effective for you, consider asking your doctor about medical alternatives. These options may include drug therapy (e.g., oral contraceptives and oral progesterone) or surgery for more serious cases (e.g., uterine artery embolization and hysterectomy)."

Suppress your period with extended-cycle birth control pills.,
Stop your period for one year with continuous birth control use.,
Use your regular birth control pills.,
Try the NuvaRing to skip a period.",How to Skip Your Period2," These pills are designed to lengthen the time inbetween each period with continuous hormone use. This method requires women to take pills with hormones for several months at a time followed up with seven days of hormone-free pills. The week of hormone-free pills will allow women to get a regular period.


Seasonale and Seasonique are the two most popular brands on the market that offer the extended-cycle birth control option. While they vary in hormone strength and have different pill instructions, they both offer about three months of a missed menstrual cycle., This method requires you to take hormone pills everyday with no down time for one year.

Remove your pad, tampon (optional) or menstrual cup (optional).,
When you begin your shower, thoroughly rinse your privates with water.,
Soap up, but avoid getting soap on mucous membranes or inside your vagina.,
Enjoy your shower.,
Rinse your privates again and turn off the shower.,
Reapply a feminine hygiene product.,
Wash your hands and give the shower a courtesy rinse.",How to Shower While on Your Period," Showering without any feminine hygiene products may be scary or seem gross if you’re not used to it, but there’s nothing wrong with it. Equally, it's okay to take a shower wearing a tampon or menstrual cup. The menstrual fluid will just go down the drain, and even if the bleeding seems shocking at first (the water will make it look like there’s more than there really is), it should clear up after the initial rush. Consider showering this way to give your body a blessed break from wearing tampons that can cause TSS (toxic shock syndrome) through bacterial infection or bulky pads. Dispose of the tampon or pad before stepping into the shower (you may even want to stand inside the shower while doing this if the trash can is within arm’s reach).



If you are showering during gym or in another public place, you will probably want to continue using a tampon or menstrual cup. If you prefer pads to insertable products, you will have to either make an exception while showering, allow yourself to bleed in the shower, or exempt yourself from the shower (talk to your gym teacher if necessary).;
, This will help clear residual blood, after which your bloodiness should be minimal.

, This is because the pH level of your vagina is regulated by the body to keep away vaginal infections; soaps upset the balance, making the vagina more susceptible to infection.Wash the surrounding skin, but not the inside of your vagina or labia, then wash your hands with soap to remove any residual odor.


If your skin is extra oily during your period, you may wish to use soaps formulated for oily skin. Likewise, wash your hair with a shampoo that targets oiliness if necessary. You may even wish to wash your hair more often than usual during your periods.

, That warm water will do wonders if you're feeling bloated, sticky, or moody, plus the soothing heat can help your cramps.

, This will keep messiness to a minimum. Make sure to have a paper towel because you don't want blood on your towel.

, How you do this will depend on what you’re using:



Pad: This is the hardest to gracefully reapply after a shower because it requires that you be dry and wearing underwear. To make sure you don’t bleed on your towel, it is best to wipe yourself with paper towels (toilet paper will go to pieces when it touches the water on your body), which you may even want to hold between your legs while you dry off the rest of your body. Have a pad ready in your underwear for when you get out of the shower and get it right on, so you don't have any accidents.







Tampon or menstrual cup: The easiest, least messy way to do this is to squat in the shower and insert the item. If you want to do so over a toilet, wipe yourself with paper towel (toilet paper dissolves when moistened) and hold it between your legs while drying off with a towel, then step over to the toilet.







, Be sure you don’t leave any spots or discoloration in there for the next person to find.

Use contraception.,
Continuous-use oral contraceptive.,
Other female contraceptives.,
Non-hormonal medication.",How to Shorten Your Period1," Female contraceptives can shorten the length of a period over time. Some can shorten the length of bleeding and result in a lighter flow. Others can reduce the number of periods you have in a year.


Oral contraceptives (OC, The Pill). When you take oral contraceptives, you typically take one active pill a day for 21 days. Active pills are made up of the female hormone estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone. Then you take a placebo pill for 7 days. There are no hormones in the placebo pill, and that's what allows you to get your period during this time. The most common way to reduce or suppress menstruation is to skip the placebo week and immediately start a new pack of pills. Without the placebo week, your body won't have the opportunity to start a period.
This works best if you're on an oral contraceptive that combines estrogen and progesterone and offers the same dose of hormones in each active pill each day. This is called a monophasic combined oral contraceptive (COC).
There are a number of monophasic combined oral contraceptives on the market including Ovral, Ovcon, Ogestrel, Nordette, Levora, Levlite, Apri, Alesse, Brevicon, Levlen, Loestrin, Norinyl, Ortho-Cept, Ortho-Cyclen and Ortho-Novum.
Oral contraceptives are available by prescription only, so you must see your doctor. Let him or her know how you plan to use the Pill so they can choose the right one for you.
Oral contraceptives may cause some minor side effects such as headaches, nausea, breast tenderness, slight weight gain and slight 'spotting' of blood between the periods. Their use has been linked to blood clots, heart attack and stroke, especially in women who smoke, are overweight, have high blood pressure or are over the age of 35. OC's do offer some health benefits: women who use them have a lower risk of developing endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer.;
, Some oral contraceptives are intended to reduce the number of periods a woman has in a year, typically to four. These pills work by providing an 84-day series of active pills followed by 7 days of placebos (or 7 pill-free days), during which time you will have a period.


A number of studies have demonstrated that continuous OC use is safe and eliminates menstrual periods in 53% of women by 12 months of use. One disadvantage of a continuous use OC is that you are likely to have break-through bleeding during the first few months, but this should stop one your body acclimates to the pill regimen.
Popular continuous-use OC's include Seasonale, Seasonique and Lybrel. Women who use Seasonale will have a menstrual period that is about 7 days per cycle once every three months; women who use Seasonique will have a period that is only about 4 days long every three months. Like traditional OC's, continuous-use oral contraceptives must be prescribed by a doctor.

, Like the Pill, contraceptive patches (i.e., Ortho Evra®), vaginal rings (i.e., NuvaRing®) can be used in an extended regimen to suppress menstruation and shorten bleeding duration. Similarly, the intrauterine device Mirena® and the injectable hormonal contraceptive Depo-Provera® can be used to suppress menstruation. These contraceptives require a prescription. See your doctor, talk to him or her about your period and your plans to use these contraceptives for extended use. They can provide you with complete instructions for how to do so.

, Lysteda is an FDA-approved, non-hormonal drug that treats heavy menstrual bleeding. It works by stabilizing a protein that helps blood to clot. The medication is typically taken three times a day for up to five days during monthly menstruation. "

Turn to herbs.,
Exercise.,
Consider reusable menstrual products.,
Have sex.,
Stay hydrated.,
Accept natural changes in your cycle.",How to Shorten Your Period2," Some herbs have been used to regulate periods for hundreds of years. Try them in tea and in liquid and pill form to shorten or lighten your period.



Chasteberry. This herb acts by controlling elevated levels of prolactin, a hormone released by the pituitary gland to trigger ovulation or menstruation. Take a 20 mg dose one to three times a day. It's available in liquid, capsule and tablet form.

Raspberry tea.Try drinking one to three cups of red raspberry tea a day to combat heavy menstrual bleeding and relieve painful menstrual cramps.

Maca root. Your period cycle can change due to a hormonal imbalance. The Maca root regulate hormones produced by the pituitary and hypothalamus that, in turn, regulate the function of the ovaries. It's available as a powder or in capsules.

Yarrow. Drink an herbal tincture of yarrow a week before your period. The herb acts as hemostatic, that is, it reduces bleeding by contracting tissues or blood vessels.

To make a yarrow tincture, thoroughly wash clean, white yarrow flower heads and put them in a strainer to let the water drain off completely. Lightly pack the yarrow in a clean glass jar, leaving an inch or so of room at the top. Fill the jar with plain vodka, cap it tightly and store in a cool, dark cupboard. Shake once or twice daily. The tincture will be ready in six weeks, at which point you can strain out the yarrow. , A regular exercise program can be beneficial in achieving a shorter and lighter menstruation. Exercise can strengthen the pelvic muscles and improve irregular menstruation. Exercise can also help to regulate menstrual cycles by reducing the amount of fat surrounding the ovaries and other internal organs. , Some women who have taken to reusable menstrual products have reported shorter, lighter periods. These products include washable cloth pads, sea sponges and menstrual cups (which are inserted internally to catch menstrual blood). , There are mixed reports as to whether having sex or masturbating during your period will reduce the duration of your period, but it will certainly make you feel better. Sexual activity while you are menstruating can help ease PMS. Women say that orgasms can ease their cramps and the orgasmic contractions of the uterus offer a soothing internal massage. Not only that, but natural painkillers and mood enhancers (endorphins) are released during orgasm, helping to soothe cramps, headaches, mild depression and irritability. , Drinking plenty of water is always important in maintaining good health and that includes maintaining a regular monthly cycle. Drinking water may or may not shorten your period, but it could make it more comfortable. Dehydration will cause the body to create a hormone known as vasopressin that is known to cause cramps during menstruation.

, Teens and women close to menopause have low or changing progesterone levels that may cause heavy menstrual bleeding and cycles that change in length. This will correct itself with time. "

Talk to your doctor about what will work best for you.,
Take your pills as your normally would, but skip the placebo pills.,
Discard the pack and begin a new pack of birth control pills.,
Keep in mind that some side effects of skipping your periods can occur.",How to Safely Stop Periods with Birth Control Pills1," Before you consider skipping your period, or stopping them for a long period of time, talk to your doctor about your best options given your medical history and the birth control you are using. Your doctor may prescribe you birth control pills like Seasonique or Seasonale,which will allow you to only have your period four times a year (see Method 2 for more information).


There are two main kinds of birth control: pills that contain both progesterone and estrogen, and those that contain only progesterone. Talk to your doctor about what pills you have and whether these will help you to skip your period.;
, Birth control pills packs generally have 28 pills per cycle. 21 of them are called active pills (these are the pills you take to keep yourself from getting pregnant) and seven inactive pills. The inactive pills are called placebo pills because they do not contain any progesterone, which means that they allow you to menstruate. Not all packs of the contraceptive pill contain placebo pills. Some just have 21 active tablets. With this type of pill you take 21 pills a day at a time then stop taking pills for 7 days, when you have a period, then start a new pack on the 29th day, which is also day 1 of the new 28 day cycle. To miss your period, simply don't skip taking your pill for the seven days. Go straight onto a new pack after you have taken the last one in the old pack. Check with your medical professional before doing this.When wanting to skip or stop your period, you would skip over these seven inactive pills entirely. Instead you would only take the 21 active pills.

, Once you reach the end of your 21 active pills, skip over the seven inactive pills and move on to the next pack. By skipping over the inactive pills and beginning a new pack of active pills, you will effectively convince your body that it is not time to have your period.


Continue working through these new 21 pills, and then move on to your next pack of active pills to continue keeping your period at bay.

, Your body is designed to have a period each month. During this period, the walls of your womb slough off and come out as blood. Although many women safely use birth control pills to stop their periods, there are some drawbacks that may occur. These include:


Being unable to tell if you are pregnant. When you have your period every month, you get a monthly confirmation that you are not pregnant. If you skip your period every month, you will not get this confirmation. It is important to remember that many birth control pills are 95% reliable, which means that there is still a 5% chance you could become pregnant.Some women do not react well to the continued use of birth control pills. You may develop headaches or irritability if you do not give your body a break each month.
You may experience breakthrough bleeding or ‘spotting’. This spotting can occur at any point during the month, and may cause you some discomfort.

"
"
Understand that there are pills that will allow you to only have four periods a year.,
Begin taking these pills on the first day of your period.,
Take a pill every day for 12 weeks.,
Take inactive pills during the 13th week.,
Be aware that some ‘breakthrough’ bleeding may occur.",How to Safely Stop Periods with Birth Control Pills2," To allow your body to have a break from your birth controls, you can get a prescription for pills that will allow you to only have your period four times a year.That means that you get to go 12 weeks without your period, have your period for a week, and then go back to not having your period for another 12 weeks. This sort of menstrual cycle means that you will only have your period three or four times a year.
As with any other birth control, you must get a prescription for this sort of pill. The two common brands of birth control that allow you to skip your periods are Seasonale and Seasonique., When you decide to get a prescription for this sort of pill, you will need to begin taking it either on the first day or your period, or on the Sunday following the beginning of your period.


When you first begin taking the pill, make sure to also use other forms of birth control when you have intercourse during the first couple of weeks while your body gets used to the birth control you are taking. These other forms of birth control can include spermicide and condoms.

, Consume a single pill on a daily basis for 12 weeks. Try to take the pill at the same time each day so that you take a pill every 24 hours. When you miss a pill, your chances of becoming pregnant increase, so it is very important that you take your pills every day.Plan to refill your birth control prescription at least a week before you are done with your current pack so that you can begin your next pack as soon as this current pack runs out.

, When you take this kind of birth control, you will either receive a pack that contains 84 active pills, or four packs that contain 21 active pills each. After you take these pills for 12 weeks, you will take seven inactive pills for a week. During this time you will have your period.Depending on your body, your period may begin a day after you stop taking your pills, or a few days into your ‘inactive’ week.

, One drawback of taking these types of birth control pills is that you may experience breakthrough bleeding, which is when your body releases a small amount of blood. This breakthrough bleeding occurs most often during the first three months of taking this kind of birth control pill.You should call your doctor right away if you experience very heavy breakthrough bleeding, or if the bleeding continues for a long period of time.

Ask a gynecologist.,
Plan ahead.,
Choose a birth control method.,
Arrange to fill your prescription early.,
Understand the drawbacks.",How to Skip a Period1," Taking birth control is the safest and most effective way to skip a period, and you should never begin a birth control regimen without first consulting a licensed physician. Tell your gynecologist that you want to skip your period, and ask him or her to recommend the best method for you.


Remember: using birth control does not necessarily mean that you are sexually active. There are many reasons that you might want to skip a period!;
, Be aware that if you aren't already on a hormonal birth control plan, it may take as long as two to three months for your body to adjust to the new cycle. You may not be able to skip your cycle for those first few months. Start your contraceptive regimen at least three months in advance if you want to be absolutely sure that you'll be able to skip your period., You need a hormonal form of birth control – no implants or injections. A traditional IUD does not release hormones, but one that contains hormones (like Mirena) does.The two standard methods are monophasic birth control pills and the NuvaRing.


Monophasic pills: The active pills contain the same mix of hormones each week. Monophasic pills are steady and stable, with less spotting than multiphasic pills, making them better-suited to skipping periods. To skip a period: simply start a new packet of pills as soon as you finish the last active pill, and skip the seven-day placebo phase.Multiphasic pills: The mix of hormones in the active pills changes from week to week to account for the various phases of your cycle. This variability means that you must take the pills in the right order to effectively protect yourself. Ask your gynecologist about which pills are okay to skip.
NuvaRing: This is a small, bendable ring that you insert into your vagina for three weeks at a time. Usually, you remove the ring for one week each month – but you can leave the ring in for this extra fourth week in order to skip your period. If you put in a new ring immediately at the end of the four weeks, then you can continue to offset your period., Skipping a period with birth control entails continuing to take regular dose of active birth control pills through the usual week-long placebo pill period. In order to do this, you'll need the next month's batch of pills by the end of the third week of your ""birth control cycle,"" Contact your medical insurance provider to make sure that you can refill your prescription at least a week early. If your insurance provider won't authorize an early prescription, ask your gynecologist to prescribe your contraceptives in 90-day batches to ensure that you'll always have enough.

, Birth control pills are convenient, but they must be taken at the same time every day to be truly effective. There is a small risk that the NuvaRing will fall out of your vagina, in which case you must rinse it with sanitary water before re-inserting it.Any kind of hormonal birth control may trigger related hormonal fluctuations that affect other aspects of your health. Remember: you are essentially convincing your body that it is pregnant.There are some birth control pills (continuous birth control, or CBC) that are designed for a period once every four months.Approximately 20 percent of men whose partners use a vaginal ring say that they can feel the ring during sex. This may be a low risk – but it is something to consider nonetheless.If you decide to use the Nuvaring, keep in mind that you can remove the ring to have sex and then replace it after sex. Nuvaring remains effective as long as it is not out for more than 48 hours.

Prepare your pills.,
Take the pill as prescribed for three weeks.,
Start a new pack of active pills.,
Stop taking the pills to have a period again.",How to Skip a Period2," Confirm that you're using monophasic pills and that you already have the next pack. Make sure that you can discern between the active pills (which suppress your period) and the placebo pills (which trigger a week of withdrawal bleeding). Use a calendar to chart out your birth control schedule for the weeks leading up to the period that you want to skip.


Monophasic pills cause less spotting than multiphasic pills, making them better suited to skipping periods.However, you can still skip a period using multiphasic pills. Ask your gynecologist about which pills you can skip in order to miss your period.If you aren't already on a birth control program, speak to your gynecologist about starting. Only take birth control pills that you've been prescribed by a licensed physician.

, If you are taking monophasic pills, then you just need to take the same pill every day. If you are using multiphasic pills, then you'll need to be careful to keep to the schedule. If you aren't sure, ask your gynecologist for advice on how to proceed.


If your birth control is packaged with a ""period week"" of placebo pills, feel free to discard the placebos. They are sugar pills, and you won't need them if you are going to skip your ""period.""

, Skip the placebo pills. Begin the next month's birth control packet immediately at the end of the regular three-week regimen. Make sure that you are ready with the new pills as the three-week mark approaches!Remember: if you're taking birth control, you are not actually getting your period on the fourth ""placebo"" week of the month. The bleeding that occurs is ""withdrawal bleeding"" as your body responds to stopping the hormones.Withdrawal bleeding does not pose a serious risk to your health and skipping withdrawal bleeding does not affect your health. It is safe to skip your period indefinitely using hormonal birth control.
You may experience minimal spotting. However, this should not last more than a day. Monophasic pills are more stable than multiphasic pills, and thus less likely to trigger spotting.

, If you've been taking the pills for three or more weeks, you can pause to take a period whenever it's convenient. Simply stop taking your active birth control pills for four days. Then, start taking the active pills again.Consider taking up to a week's break from your contraceptive after any skipped withdrawal period. It's good to give your body a rest.

Make sure that you have the next month's NuvaRing.,
Keep your ring in for four weeks, then immediately replace it.,
Leave the ring out to have a period again.",How to Skip a Period3," For regular use, you would leave the NuvaRing in for three weeks, then remove it for one week before inserting the new ring. If you are using your ring to skip a period, you can leave it in for up to four weeks before starting a new ring., At the end of the four weeks, remove the NuvaRing and replace it with a fresh ring. This will re-dose your body with hormones, effectively skipping your period.The regular ring cycle ends after three weeks. You may leave it in for the fourth week, or you can remove it and replace it immediately with a fresh ring.

Warn people ahead of time that you're not in a good mood.,
Try to relax- the more you relax, the more controlled you are.,
Treat yourself - spend half an hour body-brushing before a shower or applying moisturiser all over your body in a mini-massage.,
Eat properly - a diet of complex carbohydrates to maintain blood sugar levels, fibre to reduce bloating and protein will help stop mood swings and cravings.,
If you feel nervous or sick, excuse yourself from the room you happen to be in (if necessary) and try drinking some water - you might feel a bit better.,
Stop thinking about it.,

Something Nice.",How to Put Together a First Period Kit,"
You need something to carry your kit around in, so make-up bags are perfect as they have a zipper and are small enough to fit in your bag but big enough for your supplies. Pick any bag you like, it can be super discreet to look just like any other make-up bag or if you’re brave it can have ‘PERIOD KIT’ sprawled in big letters on the side, it’s up to you.;
,
Put liners and pads in your period kit. As your first period is likely to be light, you may only need liners; but it’s a good idea to have pads in a couple of different absorbencies too.
If you want to use cloth pads for your first period, or at least give them a go, take the same numbers of pads as you would disposable pads. At first you may want to try visiting communities like Etsy.com to find cheaper brands, this allows you to try different styles and save money.
Change pads every 4-6 hours so put in the kit enough pads to last the day, as a guide take 2-3 liners and 2-3 pads.

,
It’s best not to carry tampons in your kit as your first period is likely to be too light for tampons, also how heavily you bleed changes so until you know the pattern you won’t know what absorbency to use safely.
If you do use tampons remember you should change every 4-6 hours and should alternate with pads so carry 1-2 light absorbency tampons, 1-2 regular absorbency tampons and 2 regular pads.

,
Cups are internal like tampons but safe to use for menarche and with any flow. Unlike tampons cups can be worn for 12 hours so no need for spares and they don’t leak like other options, also cups can be worn before menstruation so in time there’d be no need for a period kit. Ladycup or MeLuna may be best for younger women, cups are more hands-on so not for everyone.
Softcups are similar to menstrual cups so have similar benefits in safety and convenience, however they can be trickier to use. Soft-cups come either in disposable versions or reusable versions for one cycle, as these can be worn for 12 hours you only need one but it’s a good idea to take pads too when using Softcups.

,
Just in case you didn't bring enough supplies with you, most public bathrooms have sanitary product vending machines or you can pop into a local store to pick up supplies.

,
Accidents happen, a spare pair of underwear in your period kit is a really good idea when you first start your periods, you just need some simple and comfortable clean underwear on hand but perhaps avoid white underwear in your period kit!
Just pop the old underwear into a bag and then when you get home rinse them in cold water and soak with hydrogen peroxide before washing to avoid staining.

,
Disposable pantyliners, pads, tampons, and soft-cups are not flushable - most public bathrooms have bins by the side of the toilet for used sanitary products, but sometimes there is no bin or if you’re at a friends house you may not feel comfortable using their bin for used sanitary products. Thus disposable bags are a good idea, in the sanitary product isle you’ll usually be able to find scented bags for this purpose such as Pop-ins or Sensibles. If you use reusable sanitary products like cloth pads then a small zip-lock bag or wet bag is best to carry used items.

,
Cramps are preventable, however until you learn how to cope with cramps carry non-steroidal anti-inflammatory painkillers such as Aspirin and Ibuprofen, you'll only need 2-4.
You can also use clary sage oil rubbed into your lower abdomen, and raspberry leaf tea works well so maybe pop some tea bags in your kit for when you're away from home. Small heat packs are also great to carry with you for menstrual cramps, along with a sheet with instructions on what acupressure points to stimulate to ease cramps too.

,
Periods are not dirty, but menstrual flow does have a scent and it can smell bad depending on what sanitary products you use and how often you change - until better used to managing your periods a good spirits of body spray after using the bathroom may make you feel more secure in yourself, remember don't use on genitals.

,
Do not use baby wipes, hand wipes or even so-called feminine wipes on your genitals as this can cause irritation and infection, but wipes like these are useful to have in your period kit in case you leak as blood can get on your hands.
Tissues are also good to have on hand for cleaning up after leaks, or just in case there's no toilet paper in the bathroom.

,
Your first period is a big deal, even if you don’t celebrate it you might still want to note down the date in a calendar and let your guardian know...some girls feel more comfortable doing this via a note than face-to-face. Periods come on average every 28 days, although this differs for everyone and for the first few years your periods can be irregular, therefore it’s a good idea to note on a calendar when you do get your periods so you have a better idea of when the next one may be due. You can also get apps to track your period on your phone if you prefer to save room in your bag.

,
Some girls' parents get them special gifts to celebrate menarche or books all about their periods, you might want to talk to your parents about what you might like or if you’d like a book to help you understand your menstrual cycles better.
You may want to celebrate yourself with something nice to mark the big day, or maybe you’re not looking forward to your first period and a bar of chocolate may just make it a little more bearable - either way your period kit is about helping you and it doesn't have to be all about function.

For this diagnosis, blood clots the size of a quarter or larger are considered to be connected to heavy bleeding. Check your pad, tampon, and the toilet for blood clots.Blood clots will look like regular menstrual blood, except they will be more solid, almost jelly-like.
Smaller blood clots are normal, and you don't need to worry about them.;
, If you're changing your pad or tampon more often than every 2 hours, you have what's known as heavy bleeding. Heavy bleeding can prevent you from doing things you love, if you're constantly worried about overflow.For instance, if you're changing your pad or tampon every hour (for several hours in a row) and its soaked each time, that's considered heavy bleeding., Generally, periods last 3 to 5 days, though 2 to 7 days is also fairly normal. If your period is lasting longer than 10 days at a time (that is, if you're bleeding for that long), that is a sign that you're having heavy bleeding., Cramping can also be a sign of heavy bleeding. As noted, large blood clots are a symptom of heavy bleeding. These blood clots can be difficult to pass, causing heavier cramping. Therefore, if you notice heavy cramping, that could also be a sign of heavy bleeding., Anemia is when you don't have enough iron in your blood. It often occurs in people who lose large amounts of blood. Usually, the main symptoms are tiredness and lethargy, as well as feeling weak.""Anemia"" can actually refer to any type of vitamin deficiency, but generally, low iron is the most common when it comes to menstruation problems., When you're going into a doctor, it's always best to be prepared. Make a physical list of the symptoms you've been experiencing. Try to be as specific as possible. Don't be embarrassed; your doctor has heard it all.For instance, you might write down, ""heavier flow (on heavy days, bleeding through a pad every hour for 3 or 4 hours in a row), more cramping, blood clots the size of quarters, feeling weak and tired, blood flow lasting 12 to 14 days."" It can help to count the number of pads or tampons you use while you're bleeding.
It's also important to note any major changes in your life, such as big events that have caused you stress and sudden weight gain or loss.
Ask around in your family to see if anyone else has similar problems, as menstrual problems can be genetic., If you think you may be suffering from a anemia, ask your doctor about having a blood test. A blood test can determine the level of iron in your blood. If you have low iron, your doctor will likely recommend increased iron in both your diet and the supplements you take., Usually, to help diagnose the problem, your doctor will want to conduct a physical examination, including taking a pap smear. A pap smear is when your doctor takes a small scraping of cells from your cervix to test for any problems.Your doctor may also take tissue from your uterus to biopsy.
You may also need an ultrasound or a hysteroscopy. With a hysteroscopy, a tiny camera is threaded into your uterus through your vagina, allowing the doctor to look for problems., NSAIDs are a class of pain medications that include ibuprofen and naproxen. They can help with the pain associated with heavy bleeding. However, they can also decrease the amount of blood you lose during your period, which may help with clots.However, when taking an NSAID, watch for an increase in bleeding, as it can be a side effect for some women., Doctors often prescribe oral contraceptives in cases where women are having periods with heavy bleeding. Oral contraceptives can make your periods more regular, but they can also decrease the amount you bleed overall, which in turn can decrease blood clots.Oral contraceptives can help because heavy bleeding and blood clotting is sometimes caused by hormonal imbalances. Oral contraceptives help balance out the hormones in your body.Other types of hormone pills can also be effective, such as a progesterone-only pill, as well as some intrauterine devices that release hormones., This medication can help reduce the blood flow while you are on your period. You only take it when you're bleeding, not the rest of the month like contraceptives. With less bleeding, you'll get fewer blood clots., If medications don't help your problem, surgery may be an option. In a dilation and curettage, commonly known as a D&C, your doctor takes away the top layer in your uterus, part of the lining, which can help with bleeding and clots. In an edometrial ablation or resection, more of the uterine lining is removed.Another option is an operative hysteroscopy, where your doctor will view the inside of your uterus with a small camera, then take out any small fibroids and polyps, as well as work on any other problems, which can also decrease bleeding.
Finally, you can have a hysterectomy, where your uterus is removed completely.

, Being overweight can contribute to your risk of developing conditions such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which increases your risk of ovarian cysts.If you are overweight, then do what you can to get down to a healthy weight.


For women who have PCOS, losing just 10% of their weight can resolve the problem and is usually a more realistic goal.
Start a food diary to keep track of how much you eat each day.
Limit your caloric intake so that you burn more than you eat.

, Birth control pills are often recommended as a way to prevent ovarian cysts.Birth control pills may also reduce your ovarian cancer risk.Talk to your doctor if you are interested in trying birth control to help control your ovarian cysts. Just keep in mind that birth control pills have other side effects as well.


Birth control works by suppressing ovarian function and preventing ovulation. For this reason, pills, patches, rings, injections, and implants all work.

, Some conditions increase the likelihood that you will develop ovarian cysts, so it is important to get treated for these conditions. You are at an increased risk of developing ovarian cysts if you have:Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) —This is a condition that causes your ovaries to produce cysts and you may not ovulate if you have PCOS.

Visit a restroom as soon as possible.,
Ask another female for spare supplies.,
Create a makeshift pad.,
Ease the pain naturally.,
Hide the evidence.,
Buy supplies as quickly as possible.,
Clean up stains after getting things under control.,
Understand this happens to all women.,
Stay calm.,
Keep explanations limited.,
Plan some self-care.,
Learn from the experience.,
Track your period.,
Note symptoms you experience every month before your period.,
Keep supplies in multiple locations.",How to React When Your Period Starts And You Don’t Have Supplies," This allows you to assess your period in full so you can determine what supplies are needed for the time being. For example, a heavy flow will require a pad or tampon, while a lighter flow might only require a thin pantyliner.


While everyone varies, many periods start off fairly light during the first few hours and get heavier as the first day progresses. Keep that in mind when deciding which supplies you’ll need. A thin pantyliner might be enough for now, but if your periods tend to get heavy, it might be best to plan ahead and choose something more absorbent.
Excusing yourself to the restroom may be more difficult in some situations than in others. For instance, if you’re in the middle of a classroom, asking your teacher for a restroom pass could seem embarrassing even though there is no shame in doing so. If it makes you more comfortable, you might consider asking for a pass to the clinic instead, or coming up with another situation-appropriate excuse.;
, Most women have faced an unexpected period in the past, and will offer you one or two supplies you can use in the meantime to help you through the day. Step outside of your comfort zone to ask strangers in the bathroom, female staff and co-workers, or female classmates who’ve already gone through puberty.Purchase pads or tampons from the feminine product dispenser, if available. These types of dispensers are located in most public female restrooms. If other females don’t have supplies and you lack cash, ask if they can spare some change so you can buy supplies.

, Use toilet paper, gauze, and other supplies to create a makeshift pad. If you’re unable to track down supplies for your period, create a makeshift pad you can wear until you return home. For example, weave a generous amount of paper towels or toilet paper in and around your panties several times to secure it in place, or use gauze from the nearest available first aid kit.Never wear makeshift tampons. Since tampons are inserted vaginally, makeshift tampons can increase your risk for toxic shock syndrome (TSS) if they contain bacteria, or are made from supplies that aren’t safe for your body., If you’re experiencing menstrual cramps and don’t have any pain medication on hand, there are a few natural options you could try for quick pain relief.


Heat is one of the most effective options, so if you have a heating pad readily available, try applying it to your lower abdomen until the cramps lessen in severity.
Since a heating pad may not be available, you might also consider relaxing your abdominal muscles through deep breathing or progressive muscle relaxation. Lightly massaging your abdomen with your hands can also soothe sore, cramping muscles temporarily.

, Tie a jacket or sweatshirt around your waist if you suspect your period has leaked through your clothing. This often helps mask dark stains until you can return home or change clothing.You could also change into dark-colored clothing. If you’re at home and you don’t have supplies on hand, try changing into a dark-colored skirt, pants, or shorts, if available. Dark colors can help mask stains from your period if it’s going to be awhile before you can access supplies.

, If you’re in public and won’t be able to get home for several hours, or if you know you don’t have any supplies at home, you’ll need to head to the store and purchase what you need as soon as possible. Depending on your preferences and needs, this might mean pads/tampons, pain relievers, and adhesive heat patches.


Buying your own supplies might seem daunting if you’re young and have never done so before, but keep in mind that this is an experience shared by all women. There’s nothing to be ashamed of.
If you still feel embarrassed, however, try to go to a store with multiple checkout lanes, and search for a lane operated by a female cashier since this may seem less embarrassing than approaching a male cashier. Another option would be to choose a store with self-checkout lanes so you can avoid the cashier altogether.

, Absorbing fresh blood and securing supplies should be your top priority, but once all of that is taken care of, you might want to clean blood stains from your clothes--especially if blood got on your favorite skirt or soaked through your most comfortable panties.


There are many different options you could try, but if the stain is fresh and relatively small, first try blotting it with cold water. Add a little salt or laundry detergent to the water, or try a special stain removal agent, and dab at it with your fingers until it starts to lift away. You should then be able to wash it as usual, but make sure you use cold water to avoid setting the stain.

, At some point in every woman’s life, she faces at least one unexpected period without having supplies on hand. Don’t allow yourself to feel frustrated, angry, or helpless when this happens; just acknowledge that it’s happened, and that you can prevent it from happening again in the future.


You may feel tempted to delay action due to feelings of embarrassment, but delaying will only give your period more time to soak through your clothes. The sooner you accept the situation for what it is, the sooner you’ll be able to take care of the problem and move on from it.

, The calmer you feel, the more effectively you can handle and address the situation in a timely manner. Plus, staying calm without panicking or making a scene helps you avoid alerting others to your personal dilemma.


If you need to calm down, try some deep breathing: inhale slowly over a count of four, hold your breath for another four seconds, then exhale slowly over another four seconds. Repeat as needed until you steady your nerves.
You can also try reframing negative thoughts more mindfully and more positively. For instance, instead of thinking, “Everyone will find out and tease me,” try something more forgiving and proactive, like “This is an uncomfortable situation, but it’s temporary and normal, and I’ll get through it soon enough.”

, You might worry about others finding out that your period started, especially if blood soaked through your skirt or pants. The best way to handle the situation is to tell as few people as possible, and provide as little information as possible to those people.While there’s nothing to be ashamed of, it’s fairly normal to feel embarrassed about your period around guys, especially if you’re still young. If any guys ask what the problem is--whether they’re authority figures like teachers or bosses, or casual figures like classmates or coworkers--feel free to skip the messy details and simply say you aren’t feeling well. You can then excuse yourself from the situation without it looking odd.

, Periods can be stressful enough without the drama of being caught without supplies. One way to make the experience less traumatic is to turn it into an excuse to pamper yourself. Get through the moment by planning a relaxing activity you can enjoy when you get home and have time to rest.


For instance, you could curl up on the couch with your favorite comfort food and binge-watch your favorite TV series. Sappy or funny movies can work equally well.
Light exercise is another option. Going for a walk may not seem enjoyable when you’re doubled over in pain, but light exercise can help reduce cramps and make you feel better overall. Plus, if you walk somewhere enjoyable--e.g., a beautiful park--you might find the experience rewarding emotionally, as well.

, This experience might be one you want to forget about, but it’ll be better for you if you learn from the experience before wiping it from your memory. Figure out why you were caught off-guard and brainstorm solutions to prevent the problem from happening again.

, Keep track of your period every month so you can make sure you always have supplies. The average menstrual cycle is 28 days, but can range anywhere from 21 to 45 days. The more familiar you are with your body, the better you can predict when your period is coming.


You can mark the start and end dates of your last period on the calendar, and do the same for each one that follows. Over time, you should be able to average the number of days in between periods, making it easier to know when yours is coming. You could also consider using a period tracking app to help you track your period in a similar manner.
While it’s fairly normal for teens to have irregular periods, if your periods are highly irregular, very painful, or very heavy, it might be best to consult your gynecologist. They can rule out any treatable or severe problems, and work with you to find ways to regulate your period in the future.

, This helps you predict when your period is coming so you can make sure you have supplies. Menstruation causes side effects such as breast tenderness, bloating, cramping, and acne breakouts. You may also notice increased irritability or fatigue.


While there are certainly similarities between most women, every woman’s body is a little different, so it’s best to familiarize yourself with your own pre-menstrual symptoms. Consider making a note of your symptoms in your journal, if you keep one, or creating a separate journal for this purpose.

, Store pads and tampons in several places so you always have supplies nearby. For example, store supplies in your purse, backpack, car, desk, locker, and all bathrooms in your home.Instead of waiting for the next time you’ll need supplies, restock your supplies as soon as your current period ends. That way, you’ll be prepared well in advance and won’t have to worry about it when the time comes.

Your gynecologist may also want to do an ultrasound a few weeks after you become aware of the cyst to see if it is still there., Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen can provide relief for painful ovarian cysts.Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturer’s instructions before use.

Watching a funny movie

, If cysts are large or if they are causing other symptoms, then surgery may be necessary to remove them. Surgery may also be necessary if there are concerns that a cyst may be cancerous. Surgery for ovarian cysts may be performed using:Laparoscopy — For smaller cysts, the surgeon can make a small incision and remove the cyst with the help of a laparoscopic camera.

Laparotomy — For larger cysts, it may be necessary to make a longer incision to remove the cyst.

You can expect your period about two years after your breasts start developing., Just after your breasts start to form, you'll probably start growing pubic hair. It will be soft and thin at first, but it’ll get coarser over time. Your period usually arrives around one to two years after., Once you've had discharge, you should start thinking about being prepared. It might be a good idea to create a mini kit for yourself, small enough to take anywhere you go (such as school). Get a starter kit targeted at tweens and teens; check your local pharmacy.

, Most girls' first periods are light so maybe have some normal or ""lil lets teen"" pad would be best. Everyone is different so just in case your period comes heavy, it may be a good idea to have a couple heavy pads just in case.

Eat more protein to boost your energy levels.,
Eat fewer carbohydrates and sugars.,
Prevent anemia.",How to Overcome Extreme Fatigue During Menstruation1," When you eat small meals throughout the day, rather than three large meals each day, you should be able to maintain a high energy level.

, Proteins help to create enzymes and hormones that keep you from feeling as fatigued. Eating lean proteins can also help to keep your blood sugar levels balanced so that you don’t experience a peak (and subsequent crash) that could heighten your fatigue.Foods that are considered to be good sources of protein include:


Poultry like chicken, duck, and turkey.
Lean cuts of beef, ham and pork.
Seafood like salmon, tuna, trout, and cod.
Beans, peas, and processed soy products.
Nuts and seeds like almonds or sunflower seeds.

, In your everyday diet, avoid eating carbohydrates and sugars and spiking your blood sugar.Researchers have linked the symptoms of PMS with low blood sugar or hypoglycemia. Although it would seem that you should eat more sugar and carbohydrates to raise your sugar level, it actually has the opposite effect. Within two hours your sugar level has plummeted again after insulin has metabolized all the glucose in your bloodstream.


Often times women reach for comfort foods during their periods. Things like mac 'n cheese or a slice of cake may strike you as exactly what you need to help you feel better when you have your period, but it actually works against you by making you feel more tired.

, Dehydration can cause you to feel fatigued, so you need to keep hydrated. Drink at least 64 ounces (2 liters) of water each day and eat foods that are also high in water content, such as vegetables.

Test the beverages you would like to include in your diet and chart the effects on your level of fatigue., Get between seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Research has determined that these are the hours needed to reduce fatigue, improve health, and increase productivity.


However, PMS can cause sleep disturbances which contribute to feelings of fatigue.These sleep issues are related to the fluctuating estrogen levels in the body during menstruation.

Recognize it.,
Stay calm--maybe even be celebratory!,
If you can, change into new underwear.,
Use a menstrual pad.,
Pad alternatives.,
Clean anything that got blood on it.,
Decide if you want to contact your parents and ask them if it is to come home.",How to Manage Your First Period Home Alone1," Menstrual blood is most often red or a bit brownish in color. First periods tend to be darker and lighter than it will in subsequent periods. A first period may be only a few , light spots.


Staining will be in the middle of the crotch of your underwear.
A clear, white or a bit off-white, is not menstruation. This is discharge and it can start about half a year before a first period.;
, Getting your period for the first time is typically a bit of a surprise, as it is hard to predict just when it will happen. And it is a little bit alarming to suddenly be unexpectedly bleeding. Up until now, you have seen blood as a sign that something is very wrong. But as a healthy young woman, getting your period and having a flow is a natural part of life.


This is a sign that you are healthy and reached an important new life milestone. There is no need to panic; this is not a health emergency!
If you can, feel a little happy about this! Usually girls are more private about menstruation than other coming of age moments (like being able to drive), but it is nonetheless a very important one.

, Even though nothing has to be done right away, changing soiled underwear may make you feel better. Dark colored (black, navy blue, dark red) underwear hides things well, so those colors are best. However, plain white underwear is easy to bleach, if necessary. You may also want to select an older pair, as periods can be messy.

, Hopefully, your mother or some other female in your house has shown you where the supply of menstrual pads are. If not, check common locations for these supplies: under sinks, in linen closets, and in mature women's backpacks or purses (if this will not cause a real issue.)


Most pads come with instructions, either on a separate sheet or on the packaging itself. However, it is also pretty self-explanatory. Remove the adhesive strip, adhere to underwear.
Put on a small or medium pad if this is available. It is highly unlikely that your first day will be heavy, and larger ones can be bulky or uncomfortable.
If you do not know or remember where the pads are, look around the house under bathroom sinks, and in the backpacks or purses of any older family members who get periods, if you are allowed to look through them.
Pads are best for your first period. They are the simplest method and least invasive. You may not know how to use a tampon or menstrual cup yet and there is no rush on this lesson.

, If there is no way for you to get a pad, it is time for some old-fashioned female ingenuity. Common household items can work in a pinch.



Washcloth. A washcloth, folded into thirds and set into the crotch of your underwear will suffice. Unless you are very active it should hold in place fairly well. It tends to be bulky but also unlikely to leak. Washcloths typically can be washed afterwards, and white ones bleached if necessary.

Toilet paper: Fold a strip over several times and put it in your underwear. Put it in the crotch of your underwear. This will have a tendency to bunch up, wad up, and tear.

Paper Towel. Paper towels tend to be thicker, more durable and shift less in undergarments than toilet paper.

Old scrap or clean fabric: This could be a number of items, such as old T-shirt fabric or scraps from sewing. These items should be clean but does not have to be sterile. Cut a strip about 3-4 inches wide and 8-10 inches long. Fold it so so that it is still 3-4 inches wide, but only 4-5 inches long.

, Hopefully this is just underwear and maybe pants, but it may also be sheets, chairs, or anywhere you have sat. Usually some cool (not hot) water, some mild detergent, and scrubbing will remove any spots.


Clothing: Rinse the stained area under cold running water until the water runs clear. Add some soap (dish soap works just fine) and rub the fabric together. Rinse it again under the water. If it still is not coming out, add a little spit, some more soap, and try again. Throw them in the washing machine.

, Some young women might be fine waiting, while others really need the comfort of family immediately. There is no right one size fits all solution here.


Even if you decide you are fine and do not really need them to rush home, you still might want to contact them to tell them you got your first period. Some parents may consider this grounds for a celebration, so why not see if you can get them to bring home take out or some other treat?
See if you are able to call a friend and ask them to come over.

, Whatever makes you happy and comfortable.

, Some women experience cramps during menstruation, but this is by no means universal. If so, lying on your side and using a heating pad is a common solution.

, However, this is somewhat unlikely. First periods are typically light, and pads easy to use effectively.


Mattresses and computer chairs can be stained if the pad is not placed properly. If you have rubber sheets or a mattress protect, place them on your bed. You may have these in you home (or even on your bed) already.
Any staining will not be a huge puddle. Menstrual flow is not that dramatic. At worst, you would likely be cleaning a small area.
If you are really worried, you can put down a towel where you decide to sit. However, it is unlikely you really need to. But if you need the peace of mind, go ahead.

, You do not need to drastically change what you eat. Healthy foods and dark chocolate will help soothe cramps or headaches. However, sometimes on your period, you just need a bowl of ice cream or a hamburger and there's nothing wrong with that.

, Water is good for you; it will soothe your abdomen and reduce the amount of flow you get, and tea is always comforting.

, If your cramps are bad, clutch the pad to your stomach. Use a  heating pad only if you know you can or if you have been taught. It is a good idea to start on the lowest setting, and then go higher and higher.

Ask your doctor for a prescription pain reliever if over-the-counter medications are not working.",How to Reduce Heavy Menstrual Cramps1," There are two types of cramping: primary dysmenorrhea and secondary dysmenorrhea.

When overproduced, prostaglandins can restrict blood flow to the uterus, causing pain.Primary dysmenorrhea can be experienced by any menstruating woman or girl, and usually starts a few days before a period begins and subsides when the period is over. Secondary dysmenorrhea, however, is caused by another underlying health issue, such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, a sexually transmitted infection, problems with an intrauterine device (or IUD), or fibroids.Secondary dysmenorrhea is more serious, and usually affects women who have been menstruating for several years.

Your doctor might want to perform an ultrasound or laparoscopy exam to make sure you don't have cysts, infection, or other chronic health problem., Hormonal birth control of any kind (patch, ring, pill, shot) can reduce symptoms.Low-dose birth control helps reduce the production of prostaglandins, which reduces menstrual cramping. Birth control is one of the most common and recommended methods of reducing cramping medically.Hormonal birth control can cause side effects, such as deep vein thrombosis, acne, breast tenderness, and increased blood pressure.Birth control pills are, however, much safer now than birth control pills of the past, and many of the risks are very slight.Discuss any potential risks with your doctor.
Even if you stop taking birth control pills after 6-12 months of use, you might still experience pain relief. Many women report a reduction in cramps even after discontinuing use of hormonal birth control.Intrauterine devices (IUDs) that contain hormones, such as Mirena, can also help treat severe cramping.Some hormonal forms of birth control also reduce the frequency of periods, so that women might only have 4 periods instead of 12 per year, and others may not experience periods at all. These types are known as continuous birth control pills, and many doctors assure that they are just as safe as other forms of hormonal birth control.Reducing the frequency of menstruation could reduce the frequency of painful cramping.

, While it is generally recommended that you try over-the-counter pain relievers first, it is possible that they will not be effective for you. Discuss the possibility of trying a prescription painkiller, such as mefenamic acid, with your doctor."

Ask your doctor if you can safely use NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).,
Take NSAIDS as directed during your symptoms.,
Take vitamin supplements to reduce cramping.,
Talk to your doctor about prescription medications.",How to Reduce Heavy Menstrual Cramps2," Over-the-counter Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (or NSAIDS) can be very effective at relieving cramps. NSAIDS are not only analgesics (painkillers) but also anti-inflammatories, which means they help to stimulate blood flow to the uterus, thereby reducing cramping. They may also help reduce the amount of menstrual flow.Common NSAIDS include Ibuprofen and Naproxen.


Not everyone can safely use NSAIDS, however. People who are younger than 16, or who suffer from asthma, liver, or kidney problems should not take NSAIDS. Consult your physician before beginning any painkiller regimen.NSAIDS are the most effective for cramps, but you can take alternative painkillers if you are not permitted to use NSAIDS.For example, painkillers such as acetaminophen might be helpful., In order for the NSAIDS to work effectively, you cannot delay taking them. Begin taking NSAIDS when you first detect your symptoms, and continue taking them as directed for 2-3 days or until symptoms subside. Be sure to follow all package instructions, however.Consider keeping a menstrual diary so that you know when you can begin to experience symptoms each month.
Be sure that you are not taking too many NSAIDS. Follow all instructions on the medication and from your doctor. NSAIDS do have some side effects, especially with long-term use, so be careful not to overdo your painkillers each month., While vitamins do not relieve pain if you are currently experiencing severe menstrual cramping, Vitamin D supplements might be able to prevent menstrual cramps from occurring in the first place.Other supplements that might help reduce cramping are Omega-3 fatty acids, Magnesium, Vitamin E, Vitamin B-1 and B-6.You should consult your physician before beginning a vitamin regimen to ensure that you will not experience any adverse effects. Always follow package instructions carefully when taking over-the-counter medicines and supplements.

, If your cramping is severe, talk to your doctor about prescription options to help you manage the pain. There are a few options that your doctor may recommend:


Hydrocodone and acetaminophen (Vicodin, Lortab) may be recommended for moderate to severe pain caused by cramping.Tranexamic acid (Lysteda) can help if your cramps are caused by excessive bleeding. You take this medication only during menstruation to reduce flow and cramping."
"
Exercise gently when you experience cramping.,
Have an orgasm.,
Massage your abdomen.,
Take a hot shower or bath.",How to Reduce Heavy Menstrual Cramps3," While you should not engage in high-impact, strenuous exercise regimens during severe menstrual cramps, gentle exercise can relieve symptoms by stimulating blood flow and releasing endorphins.


Effective exercises during cramping are aerobic exercises such as walking, biking, or swimming.Yoga poses that stretch the back, groin, chest, and abdominal muscles might also help stimulate blood flow to the uterus and relieve pain.Make sure that you are exercising gently, while wearing loose and non-restrictive clothing.Overdoing it or wearing constrictive clothing might aggravate symptoms.
An added benefit of exercise is potential weight loss, which can also reduce the frequency of menstrual cramps., While it might seem counterintuitive to engage in sexual activity during menstrual cramping, sexual activity can be a great way to relieve symptoms. Orgasms help to relieve cramping by stimulating blood flow, releasing endorphins, and killing pain.Plus they might serve as a welcome distraction from your pain.

, Rubbing the affected area can help stimulate blood flow to the uterus, which can ameliorate that cramping feeling. Massage your lower belly gently with your fingertips and use a circular motion.You can massage your abdomen for as long as you need to, as often as you need to, in order to reduce your symptoms.


Acupuncture and acupressure might have positive effects similar to massage. Some women have reported pain relief through these services.Acupuncture and acupressure work by stimulating the central nervous system in order to heal injuries and relieve pain. If you take this route, be sure that you talk to your doctor first and that you do your research: you only want to see a licensed professional, not an amateur. , Heat helps to increase blood flow, which helps minimize cramping pains.Run yourself a hot bath whenever you feel the worst cramps coming on. Repeat once or twice a day as needed.


If you cannot take a hot bath, you can get similar benefits by applying a hot water bottle or heating pad to your abdomen for 20 minutes at a time.
Be sure that you are not overdoing the heat: you do not want to scald or burn yourself. A comfortable warmth is just as effective and much safer than a scalding heat.
Heat can be equally as effective as pain medication for reducing menstrual cramps, and has fewer side effects."

Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and salty foods in the days prior to your period.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Drink chamomile tea.,
Eat light meals more frequently.,
Eat calcium-rich foods.",How to Reduce Heavy Menstrual Cramps4," Because cramps are often caused by the constriction of blood vessels, you do not want to consume any product that restricts your blood flow, such as diuretics or sodium-rich foods. Stay away from caffeine, alcohol, and junk food during your period to help minimize cramping.Adjust your diet several days before you expect your period to begin, and keep your diet adjusted for the duration of your period.


You should also avoid cigarettes during your period if you want to avoid cramping for the same reason: you don't want to constrict your blood vessels any further., Staying hydrated will help keep your blood vessels from constricting. It is especially important to stay hydrated if you are engaging in other physical activities to help reduce cramping, such as taking hot baths or exercising.

, Chamomile can help reduce inflammation, which will relieve your cramping symptoms.Chamomile tea can also help replace your desire for caffeinated beverages such as coffee and black tea, which are things to avoid during menstrual cramping.

, Instead of three heavy meals each day, try eating more, lighter meals., Calcium-rich foods might also help relieve symptoms.Foods rich in calcium, include dark, leafy greens like kale or spinach, tofu, almonds, soy, sardines, and low-fat dairy, and are part of a generally healthy diet."

It can also help reduce water retention.


It’s fine to do lighter workouts on days when you have cramps or feel bloated, but don’t skip your workout altogether. To reduce PMS symptoms, it’s important to keep your exercise routine consistent.;
, The food you eat plays a big role in how you feel. Eating nutritious meals throughout the day keeps your blood sugar stable, which can help regulate your mood. Aim to get plenty of protein and fiber in your diet, and avoid processed, sugary foods – they can cause cravings and make you feel worse.Salt contributes to bloating. For women who tend to retain water before their period, it’s a good idea to cut back on salty food for a few days.To keep your blood sugar stable and prevent cravings, try eating 5-6 small meals throughout the day of whole foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean sources of protein, and low-fat dairy. Health snack choices to beat PMS might include granola or protein bars, smoothies, avocados, and fresh veggies with hummus.

, If you’re struggling with PMS, being sleep-deprived can contribute to feeling irritable and overwhelmed. Get enough sleep, and you will have more energy and fight stress. It’s best to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day.For some women, PMS goes hand-in-hand with insomnia. To get a better night’s sleep, avoid drinking alcohol and make exercise or light therapy a part of your routine., Nutritional imbalances or deficiencies can cause or worsen PMS. Try taking B vitamins, vitamin D, calcium, and magnesium to keep your symptoms at bay. Omega-3 fats can also be helpful in boosting your mood and easing PMS.Be sure to talk with your doctor before starting any new supplements, however.


Some women use herbal remedies to treat their PMS symptoms. Chasteberry, dong quai, maca, and black cohosh are among the most popular choices.These herbs have not been evaluated by the FDA, so check with your doctor before you use them.

, Although caffeine might be a short-term fix for PMS symptoms like fatigue and sluggishness, it can make you feel more tired and irritable after it wears off. Caffeine can also contribute to headaches and insomnia.And while you might feel tempted to reach for a glass of wine if you have PMS, it’s better to resist the urge: alcohol can exacerbate mood swings and make cramps worse., PMS symptoms like anxiety and irritability flare up more when you’re stressed. Give yourself a break and find ways to stay calm and cool-headed during this time of the month. Deep breathing exercises, meditation, and yoga are all good ways to relax.Other ideas for stress-busting activities include writing in a journal, taking walks in nature, or calling up a friend for a chat.
It’s not just in your head: when you’re stressed out, your cortisol levels rise, which can throw your hormonal balance out of whack and make your PMS symptoms worse., Indulge in your favorite chocolates, a new book you’ve been eyeing, or a relaxing afternoon listening to your favorite music.

, Don’t feel like going out to a spa? Recreate the experience at home. Take a relaxing soak with some bath salts, treat your skin to a nourishing mask, and brighten up your nails with your favorite nail polish.

, Stressful events are never fun, but some times of the month are better than others for dealing with demanding situations and people who make you feel frazzled. If you’re struggling with PMS, see if you can put anxiety-inducing situations on hold until you’re feeling better. It’s easier to cope with stress when you feel level-headed and healthy.For example, if you know your period is approaching, try to get frustrating errands, projects, or homework done in advance. That way, you won’t feel so bogged down during your period.

, A medical professional can evaluate your symptoms and determine whether you’re dealing with PMS or something more serious. An undiagnosed anxiety condition or depression can make PMS symptoms worse. If your symptoms are debilitating, you might have a more severe variation of PMS called premenstrual dysphoric disorder, or PMDD.PMDD can cause feelings of hopelessness, depression, and anger. PMDD symptoms are PMS symptoms taken to the extreme. PMDD can make it difficult to function normally in day-to-day life, and the condition may interfere with work and relationships., If you have severe PMS or PMDD that doesn’t respond to other treatments, ask your doctor about medications that could provide relief. Antidepressants like SSRIs may help keep your mood stable and relieve physical symptoms like headaches and breast tenderness.Hormonal birth control or prescription progesterone may also be able to balance your hormones.Speak with your doctor to see if any of these medications may be right for you.

, PMS is rooted in physical causes, but often the simple act of talking with someone can be helpful in dealing with the emotional side of this condition. A therapist can help you find ways to cope with tension, anxiety, and mood swings. Many therapists practice cognitive behavioral therapy, which can be a useful aid in working through the negative emotions of PMS."

Your cramps will feel better and your period may run its course faster – and you get some much needed me-time, too.;
, Exercising during your period can help alleviate PMS symptoms like bloating, fatigue, and moodiness.Many people find that getting regular physical exercise can also help manage the heaviness and duration of their periods in the long run.


In fact, overexercising, or exercising more than your body is used to, can completely change your normal period schedule. Gymnasts and the like often don't get their periods at all because they work out so much. While you shouldn't work out so much your body gets stunted, exercising regularly does have many benefits.

, Acupuncture is among the oldest healing practices in the world, and is used to treat a wide array of physical ailments using pressure points rather than medicine. Getting acupuncture regularly can help regulate the menstrual cycle and alleviate mood swings, menstrual cramps, and other PMS symptoms.It’s great for stress, too. However, some believe that it can stop your cycle entirely, so be sure to talk to your doctor before you begin taking this route.

, New science says that orgasms can limit the duration of your period.How? Orgasms cause muscle spasms that in turn cause the blood from your uterus to flow out faster. If you can get over how it might be a little icky, it's worth a shot.


Most people have a higher sex drive during their periods, anyway. Wait till the 3rd day or so (or whenever your period is a bit lighter), lay down some towels, and stick to the missionary position. You may be surprised how much you like it.
Though it's less likely, you can get pregnant during your period.Play it safe and use protection.

, Being dehydrated during your period can contribute to bloating and other unpleasant PMS symptoms. Try to drink more water than usual during your period to combat these symptoms.


Cut down on caffeine, alcohol, and sodium while on your period, as these things dehydrate the body. If you do consume these goods, make up for it by drinking even more water.

, Trying to fight that caffeine craving and staying away from soda and coffee? Turn to tea. Not only will it keep you going, but research says it's good for cramps, too.Tea is the next best thing to water. If you can't drink water, this should be your go-to. In addition to keeping you hydrated, drinking tea has also been linked to fighting cancer, heart disease, and diabetes; encouraging weight loss; lowering cholesterol; and bringing about mental alertness., All of these can lead to a more accelerated period, making it a thing of the past sooner.Here's a short list of foods that have ample quantities of vitamin C:Cantaloupe
Citrus fruits and juices, such as orange and grapefruit
Kiwi
Mango
Papaya
Pineapple
Strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, cranberries
Watermelon

, Say goodbye to cramps and period problems through your diet. The following list is full of vitamins, minerals, omega-3s, and antioxidants that all can curb the pain and lessen your period:Dill
Celery
Sesame seeds
Salmon
Dark chocolate
Parsley
Hummus

, These foods are known to cause cramps and upset stomach, in addition to leading to stress and anxiety (at least in caffeine's case).To be on the safe side, just avoid them during your period.


If you desperately need a pick-me-up, go for a bite of dark chocolate and glass of red wine. Dark chocolate has that sugar you're craving but is more natural; red wine has heart benefits and antioxidants that fight in your favor.

, Birth control works by suppressing your body's fertility and temporarily eliminating menstruation. Some people take birth control solely for the purpose of shortening the duration and frequency of their periods.Talk to your doctor to determine whether birth control is safe for you.


The amount of periods you get each year will depend on the type of birth control you take.
For some people, birth control can cause unexpected bleeding (spotting) in between periods.

, Just about every form of birth control (hormonal IUD, the implant, the shot, the pill, the patch, and the ring) can make your period lighter. It won’t make it go away right now, but it can stop problems from arising later. Talk to your doctor about whether or not any of these options are right for you.


If for some reason you don’t wish to have your period at all, many people report their period lapsing after taking the shot for about a year., If you’re on the pill, it’s relatively safe to skip the blanks and go straight into another packet. This way, you won't experience your period at all.


With the approval of your doctor, this can be safe. Just know that you may have breakthrough bleeding if you rely on this method too long or too often. It can also give you some wonky physical symptoms and mess with accuracy in pregnancy tests.There are actually types of birth control pills on the market that have you take active pills for 12 weeks, meaning a period once every three months. If this sounds up your alley, talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for one of these varieties (Seasonale, Jolessa and Quasense, Seasonique and Camrese, Lybrel).

, In addition to fighting the pain and discomfort that often comes each month, NSAIDs like Ibuprofen or Naproxen may also reduce bleeding by 20-50%.Pop one before hitting the hay, too, to get a more restful night's sleep.


Follow the package directions when it comes to how many you should take. 200 to 400 mg orally every 4 to 6 hours as needed is the recommended adult dose of Ibuprofen and Motrin., Some medical experts believe that calcium and vitamin D deficiencies can make PMS symptoms worse.If you are worried that you are not getting enough of these nutrients, consider taking a daily multivitamin or changing up your diet to include more vitamin D and calcium-rich foods.


Milk, collard greens, yogurt, rhubarb, tofu, and sardines are all rich sources of calcium.
To get more vitamin D, incorporate more fish (especially raw fish), eggs, dairy products, oysters, mushrooms, and fortified cereals into your diet.You can also take a cod liver oil supplement, which contains both vitamin A and vitamin D., Menorrhagia is a condition involving abnormally long and/or heavy periods. Excessive bleeding caused by menorrhagia can cause anemia, shortness of breath, fatigue, and interrupted sleep.The treatment you need will depend on what is causing the abnormal bleeding in the first place. Treatment options include using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, hormone therapy, or medications that promote blood clotting.To determine if your bleeding is abnormally heavy, check for the following symptoms:

Bleeding enough to soak a tampon or pad every hourPeriods that last for longer than 7 daysPassing blood clots while menstruatingIf you do have the above symptoms, talk to your doctor. You can get started on medication right away that can bring your periods back to normal and keep you healthy.

Try birth control pills.,
Use one of the newer oral contraceptive pills that come in 24 day cycles.,
Learn about ""extended cycle"" birth control pills.,
Be aware of side effects of any form of birth control pill.Before starting oral contraceptives, it is always important to get the ""okay"" from your physician that you have no other health concerns that would prevent you from being on the pill.,
Ask your doctor about an IUD.,
Educate yourself around IUDs.Many women choose birth control pills over an IUD simply because they are not educated around IUDs, and birth control seems like a ""simpler"" (and perhaps ""less scary"") option, since you do not need to have something inserted into your uterus.,
Consult your doctor is you are worried about abnormally long and heavy periods.",How to Make Your Period Shorter1," If you want shorter, lighter periods, prescription birth control pills can help. Ask your doctor about starting birth control.


Most oral contraceptives (birth control pills) come in a 28-day pack. The first 21 pills contain a combination of estrogen and progesterone that prevent ovulation and therefore pregnancy. The last 7 pills in the pack are placebo pills without any hormones.
While you're on the last pills of the pack, you will experience a period of withdrawal bleeding similar to a period. However, the biological processes behind withdraw bleeding are different from those that happen during menstruation. Many women experience shorter, lighter periods while on birth control pills.;
, What this means is that you have 24 rather than 21 hormone pills, and only 4 placebo pills, which tends to limit the withdrawal bleeding (""period"") to being 4 days or less.This is not guaranteed to work, but if you stick with it over a number of months your body will likely adjust and begin to have shorter periods. Determination is key as many women do not get results until 3 or so months of consistent use.

, This is another very effective option for women who are troubled by their period, as it actually eliminates many of your periods! Most of these ""extended cycle"" pills give you hormone pills for 3 months, followed by one withdrawal bleed (""period""). What this means is that you are bleeding on average once every 3 months, rather than once a month.Note that this will not necessarily shorten your periods, but it will make them less frequent, so it may be a very good option for you to try.

, It is also important to be aware of side effects that could occur, particularly in the first few months of starting the birth control pill.


One of the most common side effects is breakthrough bleeding and spotting. What this means is you may have some bleeding or spotting even on the days when you are taking hormone pills, as your body adjusts to having an ""external"" (outside) source of hormones. This will likely go away after using the pill for a few months consistently.
Other possible side effects include breast tenderness, nausea, stomach cramps, bloating, diarrhea or constipation, or weight gain.
Note that, if you continue to have unwanted side effects with your current birth control pill, you can always speak to your doctor about switching to another brand. Different pills have different ratios of estrogen to progesterone, and it often takes women a few tries to find the pill that is right for them.

, IUD stands for intrauterine device. An IUD is a t-shape device made of copper or plastic that a health care professional inserts into a woman's uterus in order to prevent pregnancy. Depending on the type of IUD, it may also be helpful in shortening your menstrual cycle.The copper IUD is cheaper and lasts longer (up to 10 years), but it also is known to cause heavier periods and more cramping, so this would not be the right choice for you if you are trying to shorten (and/or lighten) your periods.
The Mirena IUD, however, is an excellent choice. It is made up of progesterone (a female hormone) and is the ""gold standard"" form of birth control. It is nearly 100% effective at preventing pregnancy, lasts for up to 5 years, and also significantly lightens periods (and, for some women, actually gets rid of periods altogether).
The downside to the Mirena IUD is cost, which is normally a few hundred dollars. However, if you are able to get one, it is by far your best bet at having shorter and lighter periods.

,


However, women who are educated around IUDs are far more likely to get them put in, as they realize that the benefits are numerous. Not only are periods lighter and shorter, it is also the most effective form of contraception, and, despite the initial cost, over the course of 5 years it actually costs less than continually purchasing birth control pills.

, In some women, it may be the sign of an underlying medical condition that needs to be diagnosed and treated, so it is always best to see a doctor to either rule these things out, or to get treatment as needed.While the duration and intensity of menstrual cycles vary between women, there are several factors that might warrant medical concern. If you need to use double sanitary protection to control flow, pass blood clots more than one day of your cycle, soak through a sanitary napkin or tampon within an hour, must change menstrual protection during the night, have periods that last longer than week, or have symptoms like tiredness and shortness of breath you should see your gynecologist.There are a number of possible causes for abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding. Causes can range from fairly benign hormone imbalances, such as an under-active thyroid, or certain medications, but they can also be quite serious. Certain cancers and ovarian diseases can cause abnormal bleeding. Your doctor should be able to figure out the cause by performing a routine pelvic exam and taking stock of your medical history. Additional blood tests, x-rays, and ultrasounds may be needed depending on what your doctor suspects is the cause.Treatment depends on the cause of the bleeding. Iron supplements, ibuprofen, oral contraceptives, or intrauterine devices (IUDs) may help reduce symptoms.Before your appointment, make sure you know about any pre-appointment instructions such as not eating the night before or tracking your cycle. You should also have a list of any medications you are on, any recent changes in your life, the symptoms you're experiencing, and any questions you might have for your doctor."

Maintain a healthy exercise routine.,
Alter your diet.,
Improve your sleep schedule.",How to Make Your Period Shorter2," Exercising on a regular basis can have a great effect on your overall health, and it can also help your periods stay short and light.


If you are overweight, you might want to consider talking to your doctor about a healthy weight loss plan. Maintaining a healthy weight can help you periods be shorter and lighter overall.Regardless of weight, women who live sedentary lifestyles tend to have longer periods. Moderate physical activity, in the form of 45 minutes to an hour of exercise a day, can result in shorter periods. Exercise can come in the form a sport you enjoy, a brisk walk, cardiovascular exercise, or jogging.Be careful about overdoing it. Sometimes, excessive exercise can cause menstruation to stop altogether. This can be dangerous, especially if you're not getting the proper nutrients while working out. You should always consult your doctor before adjusting your workout routine., While the effects of diet on menstruation are debated, some studies do indicate a low fat diet full of healthy carbohydrates might result in shorter periods.


A diet rich in complex carbohydrates, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, while low in sugar and alcohol can reduce symptoms like cramping and mood swings associated with menstruation. It may also shorten the overall length of your menstrual cycle.A few studies exist that indicate a low fat diet may also shorten menstrual periods, at least to a small degree.As weight loss can lead to shorter periods, altering your diet if you're overweight may help with weight loss and therefore reduce period length. However, you should always talk to your doctor before making any decisions about losing weight.

, Disrupted or limited sleep contributes to stress, which can lead to longer, painful periods. Getting on a regular, healthy sleep schedule can help you better regulate your emotions.


Losing even a few hours of sleep can lead to increased stress, anger, and anxiety. All of these things can manipulate hormone levels and lead to a heavier, longer period.Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time each day, including weekends. Your body will adjust to this schedule and you'll settle into a regular sleep schedule. When you wake up, set the alarm for the time you actually plan on being awake. Using the snooze button can lead to interrupted, unpleasant sleep that can leave you tired throughout the day."

Don't act disgusted.",How to Make a Woman Feel Better While She's on Her Period," Obviously men can't put themselves in the place of a woman and understand what it's like to have a menstrual cycle, but they can try to understand what symptoms they go through. Woman can get terrible stomach cramps, which are never fun, and can range from a dull pain that simply annoys, to a stabbing pain that practically paralyses a woman. Women can get mood swings, they can get headaches, restlessness, become extremely tired or sleepy, become sore in their genital regions, and their appetites can dramatically change. Symptoms will vary from woman to woman and some women may not even have symptoms at all! Women having a heavy period may want to use the appropriate facilitates as often as every couple of hours which is a drag and can curtail trips out and about. Periods are just generally uncomfortable and the symptoms that go along with it are never any fun. Hopefully this will help give you an idea of what a woman goes through during her menstrual cycle.;
, Give her compliments. Say things that will make her feel just as beautiful and intelligent when she's on her period as you find her the rest of the time. This will help boost her confidence, if she needs it, and may help a little with her mood swings.

, If she has any little chores or errands to do, help her out. Take the stress off of her by doing the dishes or taking her things down to the laundry. This will help lift some weight from her shoulders and give her time to relax. Keep in mind she may not just have little or chores. Women who work for a living and run a family of kids and pets and everything else have periods too and HAVE to cope. Be considerate.

, Have her sit down and give her a massage or give her a warm hug. Even a comforting arm rub might make her feel better and will at least show you care.

, Let her know how happy you are to have her in your life. Tell her she's a great friend, girlfriend, or wife. If she's at work or away from you, call her cellphone, work phone or email them and tell her how beautiful, sweet and all-round awesome she is. It's not even describable how nice it is for a person to do this. Don't go over the top her if she's snappy and irritable from the mood swings.

, Show her that you are not grossed out by the very thought of her menstrual cycle (even if maybe you indeed don't feel comfortable with it at first). If she tries to talk to you about it, do not make faces or say 'Go talk to one of your girlfriends"". This will just make her feel like you don't care. Another part of this step is to be willing to run errands for her. Go get her the supplies she is out of, (thinking of sanitary items as ""girl stuff"" is immature and unhelpful, tampons, etc.) and pick her up some chocolate or her favorite magazine while you are at it! It will make her feel like you really care.

Tell your mother!,
If you are young or this is your first period, sanitary napkins (pads) would be the best option.,
If you use tampons: unwrap the packaging, make sure the string are hanging down and insert the tampon about half a finger up your vagina.,
Keep the supplies next to the toilet in your bathroom, or in your bedroom.,
Your period may consist of about 2-3 heavy days, 2-3 medium days and 1-2 light days.,
Keep buying different brands of sanitary napkins/ tampons until you find the one that you like best.",How to Manage Your Period," She can buy you the supplies you need.;
, Your mother can show you how to do this, or if you are to embarrassed to ask her, simply pull your panties down to your knees, unwrap the packaging, slide off the sticker on the bottom of the pad and stick it to your underwear. The round side will go at the front.

, Remember that your vagina is not straight, it goes back towards your spine, so you might need to insert it vertically.

, You should also leave some supplies in a little make up bag that you can keep in your bag or your locker at school just in case you get your period. You may want to include Midol or Ibuprofen for cramps. Remember that to dispose of the supplies you need to: fold the sanitary napkin up (or just leave the tampon like it is) and throw it in a bin, or the box you see in public toilets or school toilets.

, On a heavy day you need to change the sanitary napkin every 2-3 hours. On a medium day, 3-4, and on a light day, 4-5. You can buy sanitary napkins in different absorbencies, but never leave a sanitary napkin there too long, as you will start smelling an unpleasant odor. Never leave a tampon in for more than 8 hours (2 on heavy days) as you will be at risk or TSS (see warnings). Also if you are going to use tampons you cannot use them all the time, as you need to give your vagina some time to air. Never use tampons at night, as might sleep through your night, therefore not changing your tampon for 8-12 hours.

, Remember that every girl is different, so try several different brands, not just the popular ones.

This kit, which fits inside your school binder, is ideal if you're looking to have supplies on hand during every class. You can find a pencil bag at most office supply or big box stores.;
, Decide if you want pads or tampons, and how many you’ll need throughout the day. Figure out how much will fit without bulging. You want enough to get you through a whole day. You can always restock when you are getting low, since you should be taking your binder home, or you could restock periodically from your locker.

, Look for individual wipe packets. Add those baby wipes or feminine wipes to the bag.Also, get an additional body mist, or something that will hide the smell.

, When you need it, you can grab the whole thing and bring it with you to the bathroom so you don't need to walk around holding a pad or tampon.

Find a zippered bag.,
Bring underwear.,
Add a plastic bag or wet bag.,
Get some small plastic bags that can be thrown away.,
Pack hand wipes or hand sanitizer.",How to Make a Period Kit for School2," Don’t use one that’s see-through — it needs to be patterned so that you have your privacy. Look for one that is medium-sized and will fit in one of the front areas of your backpack. You won’t be able to pack lots of supplies, but should have enough for a few days before you will need to restock.

, Put in an extra pair or two. If you’ve had an accident, it’s important to be able to change and get comfortable. Choose a pair that you don’t mind getting dirty., If you need to change, you’ll need a place to put your old underwear. Using a watertight bag can keep it separate from the rest of the contents of your kit and your backpack.

, Sometimes you have to throw away your products outside of the stall, and it can be messy. Pack some bags to make it cleaner and easier to get rid of your used sanitary products., Sometimes you’ll be in a place where it’s difficult to clean up, and having a way to sanitize your hands is essential. If you’re having to change your underwear, it can be really useful to have in the stall with you. Use travel size packs that fit easily into your kit."

Choose a large zippered bag, small backpack, or even a box.,
Add your supplies.,
Stash some clothing.",How to Make a Period Kit for School3," If you have the room, a box might be the best choice. If you’re really embarrassed, you could put the kit into a box advertising something else — granola bars, cereal — so that people think you’re keeping a snack in your locker. If you choose a bag, it should be one you’re willing to keep in your locker at all times and only take home to restock in between your periods.

, Put in 10+ pads or tampons. Include some extra containers of wipes or other cleaning supplies. Keep track when you’re getting low so you can restock.

, Because a locker is larger than a binder or backpack, you will have some more room. Use this to cover the big possible emergencies: Add a few pairs of underwear. Find some other clothing to leave in your locker in case your pants get dirty. Black leggings are a good choice, since they roll up small and can be stored easily. Hopefully you won't need them, but it’s better to be safe than sorry.

Try a menstrual cup.,
Keep a pad or tampon in a zippered pocket.,
Stash a pad or tampon in a tissue container.,
Keep some tampons in a pill bottle (like aspirin).",How to Make a Period Kit for School4," Made of rubber, it can stay in your body for 12 – 14 hours at a time (so you won’t have to take it out at school) and can provide you with the ultimate in privacy. With a menstrual cup, no one at school would know you’re having your period. Keep in mind that they are uncomfortable for some people — the only way you know if it will work for you is to try it out., Look for a sweatshirt or jacket with an inner zippered pocket. Place your smallest pad or tampon inside so you don’t have to take anything different with you into the bathroom. This can help you keep your privacy.

, This could work in either your backpack or your locker. Keep tissues in the container as well, but hide your supplies inside. You can wrap a tissue around the pad or tampon and take it with you from class to the bathroom.

, If you can’t see through the bottle, people won’t know that it contains your supplies, and you can easily take it with you to the bathroom. Make sure that you’re allowed to have pain relievers at your school and that your bottle wouldn’t be confiscated.

Talk about hormonal contraceptives.,
Ask about iron supplements.,
Discuss tranexamic acid with your doctor.,
Try NSAIDs like ibuprofen at home.,
Change your pad or tampon often.,
Try a bit of exercise.,
Use warmth when you have cramps.,
Get enough water.,
Check your blood sugar more often.,
Track your blood sugar levels.,
Adjust your carbohydrate intake.,
Increase your insulin under doctor supervision.",How to Manage Your Period As a Diabetic," It is believed that diabetes disrupts hormone balance. Hormonal contraceptives are helpful for many women. They can help balance your hormones, which in turn can decrease the severity of your period. Many women on hormonal contraceptives, like the birth control pill, find they have very light periods. Ask your doctor if this option is a good one for you.Most women who are diabetic and on oral contraceptives adjust just fine. However, it is possible that this treatment could raise your blood sugar levels, so keep an eye on that if you choose this method.Other options include hormonal intrauterine devices, as well as other types of oral hormones, such as progesterone.;
, If you experience heavy bleeding on your period as a diabetic, you may need to talk to your doctor about iron supplements. Your doctor can check your blood work to see if you have low iron (iron anemia). If you do, your doctor will likely recommend that you take iron supplements, as well as increase iron in your diet.However, it's important to check your blood work and talk to your doctor before starting supplements. High iron in the blood can actually be detrimental for diabetics, so you don't want to increase your iron intake without knowing whether it's low or not.Iron anemia is generally characterized by weakness and fatigue.

, Another solution that may help you is tranexamic acid. This medication can help you bleed less during menstruation, and you only need to take it when you're bleeding. However, like most medications, diabetics should be cautious about taking it, so talk to your doctor about whether this prescription is a good option for you., If you do have heavier periods from diabetes, ibuprofen and other anti-inflammatory NSAIDs may help with the cramping pain. In addition, they may also help you bleed less. In some women, NSAIDs have the opposite effect (making you bleed more), so pay attention when you're taking them.Always talk to your doctor before starting any medication. Also, you should not take something like ibuprofen if you have an allergy to it.
Be sure to discuss dosing of NSAIDs with your doctor as well. NSAIDS may cause hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in Type 2 diabetics. They may also increase blood pressure and affect the kidneys, which are both areas of concern for diabetics., If you're having heavy periods, it's important to change your sanitary supplies fairly often, usually every 4 to 5 hours. You may need to do it more often if your period is particularly heavy.The exception to this rule is you don't need to change them overnight. However, you shouldn't have a tampon in more than 8 hours.
You could also try a reusable option, such as a menstrual cup, to keep costs down.

, While you may not feel like exercising on your period, it can actually help with the cramping and pain. It likely helps because it releases endorphins in your body, which make you feel better overall. Try keeping up your normal exercise routine if you can.Exercise is also helpful for managing diabetes.If you don't feel up to going to the gym, try a short walk around the block instead. Just do what you think you can do.
You can even try taking the stairs to squeeze in a bit of exercise.

, If your heavy periods are causing more severe cramps, warmth may help alleviate your symptoms a bit. You can use a heating pad on your back or abdomen or try a warm bath. The warmth can help your muscles relax, easing pain., It's important to stay hydrated all the time, but it's especially important on your period. Be sure to drink plenty of water while you're on your period, as you're losing some liquid on your period. Plus, staying hydrated can help you fight symptoms like fatigue and tiredness.As a diabetic, you're more prone to getting dehydrated, as high blood sugar levels can increase dehydration. If you get dehydrated, your blood sugar can actually drop too low. Try to drink 8 to 10 glasses of water a day., In the week leading up to your period as well as the week of your period, your hormones can fluctuate. In turn, that can cause your blood sugar levels to change drastically. Therefore, it's important to check your blood sugar more often than you normally would during this time. That way, you can take steps to manage the fluctuations.Changes in hormones can make your body slightly more resistant to insulin, causing your blood sugar levels to rise.How often you should check depends on how often you normally check it. Ask your doctor what seems right for you, as it can vary from person to person.

, Try keeping a journal of your blood sugar readings. If you keep one throughout the month, you'll likely be able to see patterns around your period. That way, you'll have some idea of what's coming each month when your period comes around.You can also try an app that helps you track your blood sugar, including apps like Diabetes Tracker, Diabetic Connect, and Glooko. In fact, some new monitors connect to apps on your phone, making the process easier., If you find your sugars fluctuate high near your period, you may need to eat fewer carbohydrates during this time period. However, it's always best to consult with your doctor or dietician before making an adjustment to your diet.For instance, you may need to eat fewer servings of carbs during the day, or you may need to cut back on the size of your servings. You can also swap out non-starchy vegetables for starchy vegetables. Just don't cut back too much, as that can drop your blood sugar levels too low.
Try not to give into cravings. Some women find they are hungrier and have cravings for sugar around their periods. Try not to increase your intake of carbohydrates, particularly refined carbs. If you are extra hungry, trying adding a few more non-starchy vegetables to your diet., If you're on insulin, you may need to adjust it higher around your period. Of course, you should only do so under the guidance of your doctor, as adjusting too much could cause your blood sugar levels to drop.Continue to monitor your blood sugar levels closely, as your sugar could drop quickly when your hormones fluctuate.

Leave the parsley in contact with the boiling water for about 5 minutes,
Filter your mixture with the aid of a slotted spoon, tea straw, or strainer into another cup and enjoy!

Drinking parsley tea is not recommended for pregnant women, so make sure before you start the treatment to perform a pregnancy test. Otherwise excessive intake of this vitamin could result in an unintended abortion.

;
, This is another source rich in Vitamin C. Fresh cranberry juice is much better for you than the commercial ones you find in stores, as the commercial ones contain huge amounts of artificial sweeteners or fructose to overcome its tartness. Here are some simple steps to make your own 100% cranberry juice at home:


Buy fresh, bright red, hard cranberries (about 1500 gms of cranberries make one liter of juice). Avoid the soft, dull or wrinkled in shape ones.
Wash them well to make sure they're free of pesticide and bacteria
Let your juicer crush them into juice
To get rid of the tart taste, simply mix it with some apple juice

Cranberries can be kept fresh in your refrigerator for about two months; they can be kept up to one year in sealed plastic bags in your freezer.
Don't drink more than one liter a day as it may cause diarrhea and stomach upset. Over a long period of time, it could lead to kidney stones.



, Guava is very rich in Vitamin C -- it contains about 228 mg of Vitamin C per fruit. You can eat the fruit, drink the juice, or even boil the green leaves with water like parsley tea to extract the Vitamin C. They always say, “A guava a day keeps your doctor away,"" don't they?


One cup of sliced guava gives you 377mg of Vitamin C. Go for the fresh kind, not the kind drenched in high-fructose corn syrup.

, In addition to guava, orange, lime, lemon and grapefruit are good sources of this vitamin, too. Orange and lemon contain about 53 mg of Vitamin C; a cup of orange slices gives you 98mg of the stuff. Over half of a grapefruit is made up of vitamin C, so it's obviously a good choice as well.


Eating the raw fruits or drinking orange or lemon juice is very useful. The fresher, the better. Lemon juice could be drunk cold or hot; one glass of orange juice will provide you with 165% of your daily dose of vitamin C.
Be conscious of getting too much vitamin C, too. Up to 3 oranges a day is appropriate, though just a cup of grapefruit juice is enough to get you your daily need of Vitamin C.
To kill two birds with one stone, squeeze a lemon into your parsley tea before drinking it; you can also cut a slice of your lemon and add it to your water before boiling.

, Limes and mangoes are excellent sources of ascorbic acid or vitamin C. Limes also contain limonoids, an essential antioxidant that has been shown to be extremely effective in fighting many viruses such as HIV. Mangoes, on the other hand, are also rich in vitamin A promoting vision and beautiful skin. Limes and mangoes are great for your overall health in addition to inducing menses.


Adding 50ml of lime juice to a 270ml mug filled with 200ml of hot water can be a pleasure drink to start your day; it is a great boost to your metabolism, you can also add lime juice, a couple tablespoons of chopped cilantro and a teaspoon of cumin to rice, and serve with seasoned black beans.
Try sliced mango with a sparkle of chili powder spread on a sweet hot snack, or add mango to meat dishes. In the United States, mango is very commonly added to fruit salads and cocktails.

, Kiwi is very rich in Vitamin C; in fact, a cup of sliced kiwi provides you with 167 mg, which equals 1 ¾ cups of orange slices. If they're in season, they should be an obvious choice.


Papaya isn't nearly as potent, but it's still good. The raw fruit has about 60 mg of vitamin C; a sliced cup of it supplies you with about 88 mg, which is nearly as much as a sliced cup of oranges.

, Strawberries contain about 60 mg of Vitamin C. They should be eaten raw or drank as juice, mixed with milk or any liquid you like for a healthy smoothie. Avoid the frozen ones that are bathed in sugar.


Pineapple is another plant source of Vitamin C and it contains about 48 mg. Pineapples can be eaten as raw fruits or can be juiced. Both strawberries and pineapple could be added to many dessert recipes, like cake.

, Broccoli contains about 90 mg of Vitamin C; you can eat it raw or just steamed to avoid exposing it heat. Broccoli is one of the vegetables that could be eaten in many forms: raw, steamed alone or with other green vegetables, or even with white rice or fish.


Tomatoes are everywhere and could be eaten anytime in many forms and added to any recipe! As salad, paste, soup, or even fresh juice, you can easily combine it with other vitamin C sources in your diet to get more than enough.
Spinach is a very good source of Vitamin C, too, as it contains about 30 mg per 100 grams. Use raw spinach leaves on your salad instead of boiling it to avoid Vitamin C leakage into the water; adding tomatoes to your salad plate will increase your Vitamin C dosage. Spinach could be added on your pizza top or be added as a filling in your baked goods.

, They're not heaping in vitamin C, but they do have a little. Those such as calf liver contain about 36 mg per 100 grams; a braised liver that is about 3.5 ounces gives you about 1.1 mg of vitamin C, which is quite a small percent. You can easily increase your meal's vitamin C by adding vegetables to your plate -- potatoes, tomatoes, spinach, lemon or parsley all can be added.


In addition, putting slices of your liver on your salad is always a great idea.
Other animal sources such as turkey liver provide you with 12 mg of Vitamin C, chicken liver has 13mg, lamb liver has 12 mg, and pork liver has the most with 23mg.

, High doses of vitamin C leads to high concentrations of estrogen being released in your body. As a result, this causes an increase in the uterine contractions that helps start your period within 1 – 3 days.


Vitamin C also decreases progesterone levels, making the inner lining of the uterus degrade and start menses.
You have to make sure you are not pregnant as to not risk an unintended abortion.

, Vitamin C is a very important nutrient that is essential to everyone. It acts as an antioxidant and has many benefits in many cases and diseases. Vitamin C is available as a medication supplement in pharmacies in the dosage form of tablets and effervescent tablets.


3000 mg of Vitamin C for 3 days may trigger your period, or you can prepare some natural home recipes from herbs and foods listed above.

, When you cook food that contains vitamin C, be aware that you can degrade it without knowing and not reap the benefits of them. Vitamin C degrades when cooked on high temperatures that are above 60°C (140°F).


Vitamin C tends to leak from the vegetables to the surrounding water especially with heat, as with cooking your food. However, do know that broccoli was found that it retains vitamin C more than any other kind of vegetables.

, Because of this heat-causes-vitamin-loss phenomenon, take note that when making a parsley or guava herb tea, don’t boil your green leaves with the water -- you’ll degrade most of Vitamin C. Simply pour the hot water on it to only extract it into the herbal tea that you’re going to drink.

, If you’re a working woman, prepare your fruits and salads in advance without worry.


However, they are best fresh. If you can avoid freezing them, that's ideal. A few days in the fridge won't hurt, but months in the freezer and their nutrition will start deteriorating. But if it comes down to the freezer or a can off the shelves, definitely choose your freezer.

, Any nutritional deficiencies may turn a normal period into an irregular one. To achieve a body with normal functions, you must ensure that you are following a healthy diet. Paying attention to what you are eating will enhance your overall body state, including your periods.


Some minerals are important and related to menstrual cycles, like iron. Adequate amounts of iron in your body ensures good ovulation. Choose food rich in iron like eggs, beef, salmon, sunflower seeds, pumpkin, dark green vegetables like spinach, and beans.
Vitamin B is very important in maintaining hormonal balance. This is found in green vegetables, seaweed, basil and parsley.
Essential fatty acids are one of the main components forming hormones, Omega 3 fatty acids are found mainly in flax seeds, walnuts, raw nuts, salmon, sardines and cod liver oil.
Women who undergo a low fat diet may have low cholesterol levels in their circulation which contributes to hormones production. Healthy sources for cholesterol are olive/coconut oil and whole milk yogurt.

, One of the most important factors that can make your period heavy or light and alter its duration is when you’re stressed. The result of too much stress is a high release of adrenaline and cortisol which have direct effects in inhibiting hormone release related to fertility. Thus, irregular periods are the result.


Avoid stress by anger management, playing sports, meditating and doing yoga. These will help in enhancing your mood and increase your concentration.

, Being either overweight or underweight can take its toll on your menstrual cycle. Here's how:


Being overweight means that you have hyper-concentration of estrogen (too much estrogen, that is) in circulation as fat cells produce it. The more fat cells you have, the more estrogen you have, knocking your levels off kilter. One study showed that 30-47% of obese women suffer from irregular menstruation.
Being underweight means you have a low concentration of estrogen, as, yet again, it's produced by fat cells -- which underweight individuals are lacking.

This high or low estrogen concentration may lead to the hypothalamus pituitary ovarian axis not functioning properly and causing irregular periods.



, Turns out there are a number of factors that could be messing with your fertility. If any of these ring true for you, consider making efforts to change them. The possibilities include:



Wearing tight clothes. Polyester underwear in particular is a culprit as it increases the temperature of the ovules.

Smoking. Several studies have confirmed that smokers are half as fertile compared to people who do not smoke. This is due to bad capillary blood flow in smokers.
'Drinking alcohol and doing drugs. Studies have shown that alcoholism leads to impaired fertility in women.


Exposure to pesticides, air pollutants, heavy metals and petrochemicals. These all affect fertility (and overall health) negatively.

Contraception. IUDs in particular facilitate infections in the uterus and sometimes cause a blockage in the tubes resulting in infertility and abnormal menstrual cycles.

Diseases. Those such as diabetes, kidney disease and ovular infections such as urinary tract infections, gonorrhea, and syphilis can affect your period, too.

, Being pregnant is one of the normal physiological reasons your period has stopped. When an ovum is successfully fertilized, the whole uterus is already prepared to nurture it to complete the pregnancy, preventing the uterine lining to break and leak out. This may be why your period isn't happening.


Always make sure to take a pregnancy test when you have doubts on your period cycle if you're sexually active. A pregnancy test can be easily found at most pharmacies, grocery stores, or big box stores.

, In addition to pregnancy, breastfeeding also stops your menstruation cycle for at least six months and at most two years. This is called “Lactational Amenorrhea.”


When you frequently are nursing your baby, this process inhibits hormonal release that prepares your uterus for new possible pregnancy, so you don’t have any periods. The duration varies from one nursing woman to another.

, PCOS affects about 5-10% of women above the age of 12 (at reproductive age). It’s an endocrine disorder affecting the pituitary gland causing irregular periods, amenorrhea and insulin resistance. If you haven't had your period for a while, this may be the issue.


It also leads to acne production and hirsutism (excessive hair production on face and back) due to the hormonal imbalance of mainly excessive testosterone release. Consult your doctor to answer your questions and make the proper diagnosis of your condition.

, An imbalance in thyroid gland secretions can cause irregular menstruation cycles -- both hyperthyroidism (too many hormones) and hypothyroidism (not enough hormones) can affect your fertility and ovary production.

, This is the time around menopause (the natural cessation of the period) -- that is, the time before and after menopause, in which estrogen levels undergo strong variations. When estrogen is in flux, you cannot rely on a regular period.


This leads to many physical changes or signs as hot flashes, sudden sweats, vaginal dryness and insomnia, in addition to, of course, irregular menstruation cycles.

If you experience any of these symptoms with a change in your period pattern, especially if you exceeded the age of 35, talk to your doctor about your complaints and she will help you determine if you are really in this phase or not. Your doctor also will inform you about other possible situations affecting your period.

Evaluate the contraceptives you're taking.,
Go over any recent lifestyle changes.,
Get tested for hormonal imbalances.,
See a doctor to rule out structural problems.,
Understand the effect of certain psychiatric disorders.",How to Know If Menstrual Periods Have Stopped1," If you missed a period while on birth control pills, your period may be irregular or absent longterm depending on how you use the medication and your body's reaction to it.


Oral contraceptives typically come in 21 day packs with 7 days worth of inactive placebo pills. While taking these pills, you should have your period. If you skip the placebo pills and go straight into the next pack, you will probably miss your period.Some newer pills come with 24 days of active pills. This usually causes a lighter withdrawal bleed or sometimes no bleeding at all.
Some pills come in extended cycle regimens, meaning you take pills continuously for one year without having your period. If these are the pills you are on, you can assume your menstrual periods have stopped and will not resume until you cease use of the medication. However, many women experience occasional breakthrough bleeding or brown discharge even when taking birth control properly. Do not be alarmed if you occasionally bleed while on birth control as it's likely a side effect of the medication. If it's persistent, however, you may want to consult your gynecologist to rule out other causes and consider switching to a different kind of birth control.Even if you're on a 21 day pack and do not skip the placebo pills, you may occasionally miss a period while on birth control. If you do not have symptoms of pregnancy and have taken all the pills as scheduled, this is probably just an effect of the medication.There are few health risks associated with occasionally skipping the placebo pills while taking 21-day birth control and many women do so to skip their periods in anticipation of big events. However, you should not skip the placebo pills every month. If you're interested in eliminating your period through birth control, talk to your doctor about switching to a continuous cycle brand.If you get the go-ahead from your physician, you may also choose to continue taking the 21- or 24- day birth control and skip the placebo pills, as this can be less expensive than the branded pills designed for use this way.
If you're using an intrauterine device (IUD) your menstrual period may stop after a few months of use.;
, Sometimes, changes in lifestyle can cause you to miss a period. This does not usually mean menstruation has stopped longterm.


Have you upped your exercise routine lately? If you're participating in a more rigorous workout routine, this could change the hormone levels responsible for your menstrual cycle and cause a period to be delayed or missed altogether. Low body fat, stress, and high energy expenditure can all result in missed periods. Your menstrual cycle will probably return to normal the next month, but see a doctor if you continue to miss periods after adjusting to a new routine.Stress can change the functioning of your hypothalamus, which is the area of your brain that regulates the hormones behind menstruation. If you've been under undue stress lately due to big lifestyle changes like moving or changing jobs, you may miss your period. This will not be a longterm change but you should talk to a doctor or therapist about better managing stress if you frequently miss periods due to stress., A variety of hormone imbalances can cause menstruation to stop longterm. You should see a doctor if your period has stopped unexpectedly to see if you have a hormone imbalance that needs treatment with medication.


Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) causes high levels of particular hormones rather than the normal fluctuating hormonal levels of the menstrual cycle. If you have PCOS, your periods might be occasionally irregular but they will not stop longterm until you enter menopause.If your thyroid gland is overactive or underactive, menstruation can be irregular until thyroid levels are stabilized by the use of medication. If you're diagnosed with a thyroid condition, your period will not be stopped longterm.Noncancerous tumors sometimes pop up in people's pituitary glands that need removal as they can disrupt hormone levels and stop menstruation. Once the problem is corrected, your periods should resume as normal., Sometimes, problems with sexual organs result in menstruation stopping. Depending on the problem, this may or may not be longterm.


Uterine scarring, a condition where scar tissue builds up along the lining of the uterus, can prevent menstruation by preventing the normal uterine shedding associated with your period. Depending on the severity of the scarring, this may eliminate periods or simply cause them to be irregular.A lack of reproductive organs, which sometimes happens during fetal development, can result in a woman being born without certain body parts. Depending on which parts are missing, menstruation may stop longterm.Any structural abnormality of the vagina can stop menstruation by preventing visible vaginal bleeding during menstruation. However, this does not mean you are not ovulating or that menstruation itself has stopped. Talk to a doctor about your menstrual cycle if you have a vagina abnormality., Eating disorders, like anorexia and bulimia, can stop your menstrual period as hormone levels are affected by long term malnutrition.Anorexia is marked by a prolonged period of not eating or eating in very small amounts, while bulimia is usually marked by binge eating and then purging the calories via induced vomiting or the consumption of laxatives.Amenorrhea, the absence of menstruation, is a diagnostic criteria for anorexia. However, bulimic patients only about half miss their period.If you believe you may be suffering from an eating disorder, seek medical help immediately as eating disorders can be life threatening.

Understand the basics of menopause.,
Track how long it has been since your last menstrual cycle.,
Keep track of other symptoms.",How to Know If Menstrual Periods Have Stopped2," In order to figure out if you are experiencing menopause, you need to understand the basic biological processes that underlie menopause.


Menopause is the point at which your menstrual periods will stop for good. The ovaries stop producing the hormones estrogen and progesterone. The years leading up to your last period, where you may experience common symptoms like hot flashes, are often mistakenly referred to as menopause. However, this is actually a menopausal transition known as perimenopause.Usually, women experience menopause between the ages of 40 and 55, the average age being 51. You may experience premature menopause, however, especially if you've had surgeries to remove certain reproductive organs.Menopause is a natural bodily process that does not require medical treatment. However, many women benefit from hormonal replacement during the perimenopause transition. Talk to your doctor if this is something you feel would help you with the physical and emotional toll of menopause., Depending on how long it's been since your last cycle, you may not yet be experiencing menopause. If that's the case you may have another menstrual period at some point before your cycle completely stops.


Irregular periods are common during premenopause. A few missed periods in a row may not be menopause itself, so check with your doctor if you've missed only a few periods in a row. You want to rule out other potential health problems, such as cancer, before assuming you're entering menopause.It's a good idea to monitor your monthly cycle so you know when your period is late. You should get in the habit of tracking your cycle as you reach your early 40s as menopause can start during this time. A simple dot on a calendar can be a good indicator of when your period began.If your menstrual period has been absent for a year, you are in menopause. Your period will not return.If, after a year, you suddenly experience bleeding, contact your doctor immediately. This is postmenopausal bleeding and needs to be evaluated as soon as possible.

, Keep track of any symptoms you have to gauge how long you've been experiencing premenopausal symptoms. Knowing that you've gone through premenopause already can help you detect menopause itself.


Hot flashes are common during premenopause. These are sudden feelings of heat in the upper part of your body. Red blotches may appear on your skin and arms.During premenopause, your feelings about sex may change. Women become more or less interested in sex due to hormonal changes. Sex may become uncomfortable, however, due to the vaginal dryness some women experience during menopause.Vaginal infections and urinary tract infections may become more prevalent in the years leading up to menopause.Difficulty sleeping, mood swings, difficulty focusing, and weight gain around the midsection are other symptoms of menopause."
"
Take a pregnancy test.,
Consider the effects of breastfeeding.,
Understand menstruation may be irregular after pregnancy.",How to Know If Menstrual Periods Have Stopped3," During pregnancy, women do not menstruate. While you may experience some light spotting, you will not have your period during the course of pregnancy. If your period has suddenly stopped, pregnancy may be the cause.


Many home pregnancy tests are accurate on the first day of a missed period. For most tests, you immerse a small stick in urine and wait several minutes for results. A plus sign, changed colors, or the word ""pregnant"" indicate pregnancy depending on the test.Home pregnancy tests are generally very accurate. Most are about 99% accurate, but some tests are not as good as detecting pregnancy as they claim. It might be a good idea to take two different tests to assure accuracy.It's important to see a doctor as soon as possible to confirm your pregnancy with a blood test., Usually, after pregnancy menstruation returns. However, if you're breastfeeding you may not return to regular periods immediately. Breastfeeding regularly can delay the return of your periods for the first months after pregnancy. If menstruation is delayed longer, however, you should talk to your doctor to rule out other causes.

, Your period may take awhile to return to normal after a pregnancy. This does not mean menstruation has stopped longterm.


Usually, once you cease breastfeeding you'll begin spotting lightly. Your menstrual cycle should return to normal within the first few months after you start spotting.You may have unusually large blood clots during your first periods after pregnancy. This is usually not a concern, but if you have heavy bleeding and blood clots for a week or more consult a doctor.Remember, even if you don't physically notice signs of menstruation you may still be fertile even shortly after pregnancy. Make sure to use contraception if you want to prevent another pregnancy, even if you're not visibly menstruating."

Spot abnormal postpartum bleeding.",How to Know if It's Postpartum Bleeding or a Period," The timing that periods resume with breastfeeding is often completely dependent on how long you breastfeed. If you only breastfeeds for three months your periods will likely return a few weeks after stopping, or if you breastfeed for 18 months, you may not have a period for this entire time. Postpartum bleeding, on the other hand, starts almost immediately after the childbirth and can last between six to eight weeks before tapering off.Breastfeeding can delay menstruation as it triggers the body to release the prolactin hormones which keeps the progesterone and estrogen levels low.Even if a woman decides not to breastfeed, she will not start menstruating for a couple of weeks after childbirth. Approximately 70% of women have their normal menstrual period roughly six to 12 weeks after giving birth. The period should only last for three to six days.;
, The color of the blood will be slightly different with postpartum bleeding than with menstruation, so it's important take note of this.With postpartum bleeding, the color of the blood appears bright red for the first three days. Then from day four to 10, the discharge changes its color from pinkish red to reddish brownish with varying components such as old blood, white blood cells and tissue debris.After day 10, a whitish discharge may be observed. This discharge consists of leukocytes (white blood cells), mucus, and epithelial cells.
Although menstrual blood may also start as bright red, the color will change to dark red, black or brown towards the end of menstruation., The flow of blood is heavier in postpartum bleeding than in menstruation. In general, postpartum bleeding will be heavy for the first four days, then will gradually reduce in quantity over the next few days/weeks.


If you are saturating a super-pad each hour for at least three hours, or having blood clots bigger than a golf ball after the first two to three days, call you doctor right away.
With menstruation, blood flow is also heaviest in the first three to four days, however the average blood loss is only 10 ml to 80 ml.An easy way to account for the amount of blood is to know that one tampon holds about 5 ml of blood. So, you can count the number of tampons you use and multiply that number by five to determine the total blood flow in milliliters., You may experience something called postpartum hemorrhage, which occurs in about 1 in 100 to 5 in 100 women.Postpartum hemorrhage is different from postpartum bleeding and requires immediate medical attention. Postpartum hemorrhage may be caused by pieces of the placenta remaining attached, tear in the cervix or other tissues, or a blood clotting disorder. If not treated, this can lead to shock, which can be fatal.Signs of postpartum hemorrhage include:Vaginal bleeding that soaks more than one pad per hour over a period of two hours or a return of bright red bleeding with or without clots after vaginal discharge has become lighter or turned brown in color
Decreased blood pressure
Increased heart rate
Decrease in the red blood cell count

, When you lose blood, you also lose iron. To avoid iron deficiency, increase the amount of iron you get through your daily diet. There are a number of foods that are naturally high in iron. They are:Lentils and pinto or kidney beans
Chicken, liver or beef
Broccoli or asparagus
Okra, parsley and kelp
Mustard greens or beet greens
Raisins, plums, dried peaches or prune juice
Rice bran
Blackstrap molasses

, For normal or mild postpartum bleeding, there is no need for any drugs to be taken as the bleeding will stop naturally after a maximum of six weeks to two months; however, your doctor may suggest or prescribe some iron supplements for you to treat any signs of anemia as a result of the blood loss.Most over-the-counter supplements are fine, and are absorbed better with an acidic juice like pineapple or orange juice. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for recommendations if you are unsure about which brand to choose.
These supplements are usually taken once a day, but it could be more frequent depending on the severity of your anemia. They should be taken after meals to avoid constipation, which can be a common side effect. Some other gastric disturbances may be felt, such as nausea or vomiting. You may also have green-colored stool.

, If you are experiencing postpartum hemorrhage, you need to seek immediate medical treatment to prevent shock. Treatments may include:


A blood transfusion may be necessary to support vital organs such as the brain, heart, kidneys and liver and to prevent end organ damage. This blood transfusion will try to compensate for the excessive loss of blood.Oxytocin will be administered through an IV to stimulate uterine contractions and control the bleeding.Oxytocin acts mainly by stimulating strong uterine contractions by acting on specific receptors located at the lining of the smooth uterus muscles. It also increases the calcium levels in the intracellular space to induce more vasoconstriction., If everything goes according to plan, the uterus will continue to contract after childbirth in order to expel any residue left over from the placenta. It is also the process of closing off all of the blood vessels that had been supporting the baby. The residue is what constitutes postpartum bleeding.


This bleeding occurs while the uterus undergoes what's called the ""stage of involution"" — a normal physiologic response in which the uterus returns to its non-pregnant state. This bleeding is controlled and should not produce any adverse side effects.As time goes on, the outer layer of that lines the uterus slowly sloughs off and discharged. This discharge is called lochia.These processes are completely normal and expected. The uterus will normally heal on its own and the bleeding/lochia will stop within six weeks., During a woman's normal menstrual cycle; the uterus is lined with a nutrient-rich coating to prepare for the arrival of a fertilized egg.When fertilization does not occur, this lining shrinks and sloughs off before being expelled from the body, along with the unfertilized egg. Once the old lining is removed, a new lining forms and the cycle begins again.Each menstrual period lasts for two to seven days, and occurs approximately every 28 days, though this varies from woman to woman., In some instances, postpartum bleeding becomes excessive and poses serious health risks. You are bleeding too much if you soak through one or more sanitary pads per hour, have blood clots the size of a golf ball or larger, or continue to notice bright red blood after four days.This may occur for a number of different reasons, like:Uterine atony — This is the most common cause of excessive postpartum bleeding. It occurs when the uterus is unable to continue contracting — due to prolonged labor, infection, exhaustion, or the use of certain drugs (NSAIDs, nitrates) — allowing the blood to leak freely out of the body.Placental retention or incomplete detachment — Put simply, this is when the placenta fails to completely detach from the uterus. The retained placenta results in postpartum bleeding.Trauma to the uterus — Uterine trauma can happen due to several reasons, such as vigorous labor, attempting to remove the retained placenta (either manually, with special instruments, or with drugs that induce labor as Oxytocin). All of these things can cause injuries to the genital tract or uterus lining, causing excessive bleeding.Other causes — Other potential causes of postpartum hemorrhage include an over-distended uterus (possibly from birthing twins), preeclampsia, infections or obesity."

Tell your mom.",How to Know when You'll Get Your First Period," So you've probably heard the term ""period"" a lot by now, and have a good understanding of what it entails. But are you aware of exactly what goes on inside your body during menstruation? Knowing why you get your period can help you to make sense of all the strange activity going on in your body.


After a girl reaches puberty, her ovaries will release a single tiny egg once a month. This egg travels down the Fallopian tubes, towards the uterus (womb). In the meantime, the uterus produces a soft lining, made from blood and tissue, to prepare for the arrival of a fertilized egg.
If the egg is fertilized (which can only happen following intercourse, when a man's sperm joins with the egg), it will attach itself to the soft lining of the womb, which acts like a nest. This is the beginning stage of pregnancy.
If the egg remains unfertilized, it will usually break apart before it reaches the uterus. When this happens, the lining of the womb is no longer needed, so it will detach from the walls of the uterus and flow out of the body, through the cervix and vagina. This is your period.;
, When you get your period, you may feel a little alarmed by how much blood there is. But there's really no need to worry - you're losing a lot less actual blood than you'd think.


The average girl will only lose between four to six tablespoons of blood during her entire period, which really isn't a lot. It's only about half a cup or so.
However, this blood is diluted with tissue from the womb lining and other fluids, so it seems like a lot more. In total, you will probably lose between a half cup and a full cup of fluid during a single period.You probably won't see this much blood in your first period though, or even the next few. Your first periods will usually be quite light, with only some spots of blood (spotting). Your flow tends to increase as your periods become more regular.
If you experience any of these symptoms, you may wish to plan ahead and wear dark-colored pants or keep a spare pair in your bag or school locker.

, The timing and duration of every girl's period is different, but in general, you will get your period once a month and it will last for three to seven days.


Although you can more or less count on getting your period once a month, the length of your cycle may be very different from someone else's. Most girls get their periods every 25 to 30 days, however the cycle may last as few as 21 days for some people and as long as 35 for others. This is all completely normal.
It will take a little while for your body to settle into this cycle. Following your first period, you may skip a month or two before you get your next one. This is also completely normal - your periods will settle into a more regular pattern as you grow older.
However, things like stress or strict dieting and exercise may cause your period to be late, or may even prevent it altogether. This is not normal and you should seek advice from your doctor on stress management and weight issues.
In terms of duration, your period will usually last between three and seven days. Over the course of a single period, the heaviness of the flow and the color of the blood can vary greatly., Aside from the period itself, there are a number of not-so-fun side effects that you may have to deal with before and during menstruation.


First, in the week before your period you may experience mood swings - times where you feel either really happy or really sad for no particular reason. This is a normal side effect of all the hormones flying around during puberty, and will most likely reduce as you grow older. In the meantime, chocolate can be a major comfort when you're feeling low!
Second, you will probably experiencing cramping at some point either before or during your period. This is completely normal, but can be rather unpleasant depending on the severity of the cramping.
There's no need to suffer through it though, some light pain medication can really help to ease discomfort, while a hot water bottle or heating pad placed on the stomach or lower back can make you feel good as new!
You can also help to prevent cramps by taking regular exercise, drinking lots of water and getting plenty of rest., While all of this may seem a bit overwhelming, there's really no need to panic. Getting your period is a normal part of growing up.


Try to remember that it's a completely normal, natural thing and is completely manageable once you get the hang of it!
If you're still feeling anxious, try talking to a trusted older female like your mom, a big sister, or the school nurse. They've all been through it before and will have plenty of advice and information on what you can expect.

, It may be helpful to know that the average girl will get her period around the age of 8 to 15, so if you're younger than that, you may just need to wait a year or two.


The age at which a girl gets her period will vary a lot from person to person. Some girls may start their period as early as the age of 8 or 9, while others mightn't get theirs until they're 14 or 15. All of these ages are completely normal.
The age at which you get your first period (also called ""menarche"", medically speaking) depends mainly on genetics, so there's no way of speeding it up or slowing it down. When it happens, it happens! Try asking your mom or older sister when they got their first period, as there is a good chance yours will happen around the same time.However, if you get to the age of 16 and still haven't started your period, it might be a good idea to see your doctor. They can help you figure out why it hasn't started yet.

, One of the first signs that you're beginning puberty is breast growth and tenderness.


Your breasts may grow very quickly or very slowly, it varies from person to person. One breast may even grow faster than the other, but this is normal, so don't worry. They should even out as time goes on.
Breast tenderness or soreness in the nipples usually happens when the breasts grow very quickly. This will also fade over time. In the meantime, it may be a good idea to start wearing cup size bras for extra support. Go bra shopping with your mom or sister and get professionally measured to find the right size.
Your period may start soon after your breasts begin to grow, or it may be up to 2 years later - again, it will vary from person to person. But at least you'll know you're on the right track!

, Another sign that you've hit puberty and your period is on its way is the growth of hair on your pubic area and under your arms. This is known as ""pubic hair"" and is usually coarser and darker in color than the hair on your head. You may also start to grow more finer, lighter hair on your arms and legs.


With the growth of underarm hair, you may notice yourself sweating more and that the sweat smells different than before. You can deal with this by showering more frequently and using deodorant. Eventually, you may also want to start shaving under your arms, if that's your choice.

, You may start to notice a white, yellow-tinted or green-tinted discharge in your underwear in the six months leading up to your period. The discharge may become heavier or more noticeable in the week leading up to your first period, so watch out for it!


Sometimes discharge can stain your underwear, so you may want to start wearing panty liners at this time. These are small, disposable, absorbent strips that you place in your underwear - they're very thin, so you won't even feel them!
Although most discharge is completely normal, if it starts to get very heavy, if your vagina feels itchy, or the discharge smells bad, you may have an infection. If this happens, see your doctor, who can easily prescribe creams to clear things up., A good way to prepare for your first period is to have some pads or tampons on hand for when the big day comes. It's important to know the difference between the two, so you can decide in advance which you plan on using.


A pad (also called a sanitary towel) is probably the best option for your first period, as it is easier to use and will probably be more comfortable for you to wear. Pads are adhesive on one side to help them stick to your underwear and prevent them from moving around. They will feel a little strange at first, but you'll soon get used to them. For more information, see How to Use a Sanitary Pad.
Tampons are small and discreet, and can be more comfortable than a pad when inserted properly. However, you may find them a bit intimidating at first, as they must be inserting into the vagina, which can be tricky if you don't know how. Tampons are the best option for girls who are very active and play a lot of sports, and must be worn when swimming. For more information, see How to Use a Tampon.Whether you wear tampons or pads, both will need to be changed every three to four hours (depending) on your flow. Tampons, in particular, should never be worn for longer than eight hours as this leaves you at risk of developing a serious illness known as Toxic Shock Syndrome.

, The single most important way to prepare for your first period is to stock up on pads or tampons and keep them on you at all times. You should also consider keeping a spare change of clothes (or just an extra pair of jeans) in your locker or bag, in case of emergencies.


If you're lucky, you'll get your first period when you're at home, or even in bed at night. Unfortunately, there's no way to guarantee this and it's very possible that you could get your period while at school or out of the house. That's why keeping a small supply of pads on hand is a good idea - you'll be prepared no matter when your period strikes!
Consider putting the pads/tampons in a cute toilet bag which you can place in your book bag at school or your handbag when you're shopping or at friends' houses. Then you can just bring the bag to the bathroom with you when you need it - nobody will suspect a thing!, At some point in time (if not during your first period, a later one) you will probably have to deal with a leak, where blood leaks onto your clothing.


If this happens, try not to panic. Casually wrap a sweater or cardigan around your waist until you can get a change of clothes. If you were super prepared, you might already have a change of clothes in your locker.
Otherwise, go to the school nurse, tell her what happened and ask to ring home. You can ask your mom or dad to bring you a spare change of clothes, or just pick you up. Don't worry, they'll understand!
In future, avoid wearing white or light colored pants/skirts/shorts around the time you expect your period. Wear black or dark colored bottoms instead - then at least if you have a leak, the stains won't be visible., One important thing to do once you get your first period is to make a note of the date (and approximate time) in a diary or notebook. This may give you some idea of when you can expect your next period. However, as mentioned before, your first few periods can be unpredictable and may not settle into a regular pattern for several months.


You should still make a note of the date every time you get your period though, as this will make it easier to recognize patterns in your cycle. You can also make a note of how heavy the blood flow was and how long the period lasted.
These things are important for a number of reasons. They can help you to plan ahead; for example, if you're going to a party in a few weeks and you know you'll have your period at that time, you may decide not to buy that white dress!
This information can also help you to decide what kind of pads/tampons to buy, as they come in a variety of sizes and absorbency levels. For example, if you have a heavy flow, you will need a higher absorbency, whereas if you have a lighter flow, you will need a lower absorbency. Use the lowest absorbency level possible, for comfort.
Getting your first period is also a big moment in your life - the day you become a woman - so you might be glad to know the exact date in years to come. It might even help your own daughter to figure out when she'll get her first period one day.

, Don't keep your period a secret, there's no need to go through this scary yet exciting time alone! Tell your mom, both of your parents or even an older sister.


Even if you feel a little shy or embarrassed, you'll feel relieved once you share the information with someone. And that someone will probably be super proud of you.
Remember that your mom has been through all of this before and will probably give you a ton of helpful advice.

Use caution when trying herbal remedies.,
Eat vitamin C. Vitamin C is thought to be an emmenagogue.,
Add parsley to your diet.,
Eat turmeric.,
Try herbal supplements.",How to Induce a Period1," Many herbs have been as emmenagogues for centuries. People often believe herbs to be harmless, but they can have side effects that are just as significant as any other type of medication. If you want to try using herbs to bring on your period, it is best to speak with your doctor first. Conduct research and make sure you take no more than the recommended dosage, as some herbs are poisonous at high levels.Some emmenagogues are also abortifacients, meaning they could cause your body to miscarry if you are pregnant. If there is any chance that pregnancy is the reason your period hasn't come, do not attempt to terminate the pregnancy using herbs.This can be extremely dangerous.Be especially careful if you already have a medical condition. Herbs could exacerbate your condition or cause dangerous side effects.;
, This is another word for a substance that helps induce your period. Vitamin C is supposed to help increase the amount of lining in the uterus, helping to increase your chances of getting your period. Some find that taking vitamin C supplements or eating food high in vitamin C makes the uterus contract, bringing on a period.The recommended daily value of vitamin C is 60 mg. If you decide to take supplements, be sure not to exceed the recommended dosage.
Try eating plenty of papaya, bell peppers, broccoli, kiwi, citrus fruits, leafy greens, and tomatoes.

, According to folklore, parsley can be used to induce a period. Flat and curly-leaf parsley contain apiol and myristicin, substances that are thought to cause the uterus to contract slightly. No scientific research backs this claim, but some women have found drinking parsley tea to be helpful.To enjoy parsley tea,


Wash and chop 1/4 cup of fresh parsley. The fresh variety contains more nutrients than dried parsley, and it makes better-tasting tea.Boil a cup of water.
Pour the water over the parsley and let it steep for five minutes.
Strain out the parsley and drink the tea.

, Turmeric is thought to relieve menstrual pain and promote period regulation. Turmeric is a flavorful root that is often used as a cooking spice. It can also be made into a healthful drink. Scientists have not confirmed that it can help bring on a period, but it may be worth a try if your period is late.Sprinkle turmeric over rice, steamed vegetables and other dishes you cook during times when you want to induce your period.
To make it into a drink, add 1 teaspoon turmeric to a cup of water. Flavor it with lemon and honey, then pour over ice.

, Several herbal supplements are thought to stimulate menstruation. Because supplements are not regulated by the FDA, they should be taken with caution. Speak with your doctor before incorporating supplements into your lifestyle. Read the instructions on the packaging and take no more than the recommended dosage.These supplements are thought to be beneficial for inducing your period:Dong Quai. The number one herbal remedy for this issue, Dong Quai promotes blood flow to the pelvis where it will stimulate an absent or irregular period.
Black Cohosh. Used for hundreds of years to help bring on menstrual bleeding, black cohosh promotes the regulation of the entire menstrual cycle and contributes specifically to the shedding of the uterine lining.
Motherwort. Motherwort has been found to mildly stimulate the uterus and help it work efficiently thereby contributing to the onset of menstruation.
White Peony. White peony moves the blood in the pelvic area, an antidote to uterine ""stagnation"" during the absence of a period.

Rest and destress.,
Take a hot bath.,
Maintain a healthy body weight.,
See if you're exercising too much.,
Consider using hormonal contraceptives.",How to Induce a Period2," Times of extreme stress can cause your period to get delayed. Stress alters the function of your hypothalamus, the part of your brain that regulates your hormones and causes menstruation to happen.If you think stress could be the reason your period is late, take measures to decrease sources of anxiety in your life.


See if you can take a few days off of work or school. Spend the time relaxing, eating well and exercising.
Cancel social obligations that may be stressing you out. Give yourself some ""me"" time.
Try meditating or practicing yoga.
If your stress is chronic, talk to someone who can help. Consider making an appointment with a therapist who can help you find a good solution.

, There's not scientific explanation for why taking a hot bath helps bring on a period, but many people find it works. Perhaps it's helpful because the warm water relaxes your body, easing physical and emotional stress at the same time. Give yourself time for a good, long soak in the bath when you want your period to start.


Try adding relaxing essential oils to the tub. Lavender, lemongrass and rose essential oils will help you destress as you bathe.
Focus on letting your body completely relax and let go. Massage your legs, arms, face and scalp to improve your circulation.

, If you are 10 percent or lower below the normal body weight for your height, this can cause a disruption in your menstrual cycle. Many people find that allowing themselves to gain a little weight causes their cycles to become more regular.Find out what's considered a healthy body weight for you by talking with your doctor. You could also use a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, but know that experts disagree on whether this calculation is an accurate measure of a person's health.
If you have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, seek treatment right away. These disorders are very difficult to correct on your own. In addition to disrupting your menstrual cycle, they can cause other long-term health problems.

, Many athletes who train every day experience irregular or missed periods. Overtraining can lead to decreased levels of estrogen in your body, causing your period to stop. Low estrogen levels can have negative side effects, including causing your bones to become brittle. If you think overtraining might be the problem, you'll need to change your routine right away.Talk with your doctor about your training schedule to determine whether this might be the case. Long-distance runners, weight lifters and other athletes who train heavily on a daily basis are most at risk.
Although there may be pressure to keep training as hard as you are, it's important for your health that you scale back if you're overdoing it., Taking the Pill or another hormonal contraceptive can give you total control over your cycle, and even eradicate it, for months at a time. Hormonal contraceptives are often prescribed as treatment for irregular, long or very painful periods. Talk with your doctor about whether taking a hormonal contraceptive is a good choice for your situation."

Determine if you're pregnant.,
Know the other natural reasons for missing a period.,
See if your medication causes missed periods.,
Find out if you have a medical condition.",How to Induce a Period3," There are many reasons why your period may not have come. If pregnancy is at the top of your worry list, you'll need to take a pregnancy test and decide what to do next. Most pregnancy tests don't give an accurate reading until five or more days have passed since your period was supposed to begin.If no more than 120 hours (5 days) have passed since you had sex, emergency contraception is an option for you. Also called Plan B or the morning after pill, emergency contraception is a drug containing high levels of progestin.This hormone works by stopping the release of the egg from the ovary, preventing it from getting fertilized. The sooner you take it, the more effective it is. In the United States, emergency contraception is available for about $50.00 in drugstore pharmacies. No prescription is required.
If more than 120 hours have passed or you take a pregnancy test that reads positive, emergency contraception will not work. Make an appointment at your local health clinic to go over your options.Whether you choose to have an abortion or continue the pregnancy, it's important to get support right away.
Do not attempt to terminate a pregnancy on your own. This is highly dangerous and could result in permanent injury or death.Call or visit a health clinic to learn about safe options., Having an irregular cycle is completely normal for some. Everyone's body is different, and some people tend to skip a month here and there or go long periods of time without menstruating. Breast-feeding and menopause are other natural conditions that disrupt the menstrual cycle. Talk with your doctor if you're unsure whether the cause of your missed period may be connected with natural hormone changes.Pay attention to your cycle and keep track of patterns. Most women menstruate every 21 to 35 days. The length of time between your periods can change over time as your body grows and changes. Just because you miss one period doesn't mean something is wrong. However, if it happens more than once you should talk to your doctor.
Menopause naturally occurs around the age of 50, although it can happen earlier. The hormone levels in your body drop, causing periods to become irregular and eventually stop altogether.
Some have periods during breastfeeding, while others do not. It depends on how frequently the baby nurses, how much milk you're producing, and a number of other factors.

, Certain medications can lead to a disruption in the menstrual cycle. It's possible that you're on a medication causing you to miss your periods without realizing that this is a common side effect. If you are on one of the following types of medication, it could be the reason your period is late:Antipsychotics
Antidepressants
Blood pressure drugs
Allergy medications
Chemotherapy

, It's normal to miss a period every now and then, but if it has been months since you last menstruated, it's important to see your doctor to make sure you're in good health. Certain underlying conditions can cause a disruption in your cycle. The following conditions may be the culprit:Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which causes your body to produce high levels of hormones instead of the normal fluctuations that bring about your period.
Thyroid malfunction or hypothyroidism, which can affect how often you have your period.
A benign tumor in your pituitary gland can interfere with your hormones as well.
Some people experience premature menopause, which is defined as menopause that occurs before age 40.
Structural issues in your reproductive system can also cause the absence of periods. Uterine scarring, a lack of reproductive organs, or other abnormalities may be the source of the problem.

Think about when you get cramps.,
Rate your pain.,
Note other symptoms along with your cramps.",How to Identify Signs of Secondary Dysmenorrhea1," Women who have secondary dysmenorrhea may get cramps starting a few days before the start of their period. The cramps may also last longer than normal menstrual cramps, such as past the end of the period.Cramps that are caused by primary dysmenorrhea may start about one or two days before your period begins and they can last for just a few hours or up to a few days.However, they should not extend past the end of your period.;
, You may have noticed an increase in the severity of your menstrual cramps over time and this may also indicate that your cramps are due to secondary dysmenorrhea.For example, you might have had cramps that were relatively mild as a teenager, but your cramps might have become more severe as an adult.


Pain from primary dysmenorrhea may be mild to severe. The pain is often located in the abdomen, lower back, and thighs., Women who experience menstrual cramps from primary dysmenorrhea often complain of other symptoms. However, women who have secondary dysmenorrhea may not experience these other symptoms. Symptoms that may indicate that you are experiencing primary dysmenorrhea may include:nausea
vomiting
fatigue
diarrhea

Check for symptoms of endometriosis.,
Identify signs of adenomyosis.,
Watch for symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease.,
Look for symptoms of cervical stenosis.,
Check for signs of fibroids.,
Be aware that IUDs can cause secondary dysmenorrhea.",How to Identify Signs of Secondary Dysmenorrhea2," Endometriosis is when endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus. The tissue may grow around the uterus or even spread to other parts of your abdomen. Painful periods and cramps that last for several days are the main symptom of this condition, but symptoms can also include:Pain when you have sex.
Pain when you have a bowel movement or urinate, especially during your period.
Excessive bleeding during your period or between periods.
Infertility.
Other less serious symptoms, such as bloating, diarrhea or constipation, nausea, and fatigue.

, Adenomyosis is a condition that causes endometrial glands to grow too deeply within the uterine muscular wall. This can lead to an enlarged uterus, painful periods, and other symptoms as well. Some women with adenomyosis have no symptoms, but symptoms may include:Periods that are heavy or that last a long time.
Stabbing pain in your pelvis or severe cramps.
Cramps that worsen as you get older.
Pain during sex.
Blood clots that you pass during your period.
Swelling in your abdomen due to an enlarged uterus.

, Pelvic inflammatory disease often results from a sexually transmitted disease and it causes an infection of a woman’s reproductive organs. This condition can cause painful cramps. Other symptoms of pelvic inflammatory disease may include:Pelvic pain.
Fever.
Foul smelling discharge coming from your vagina.
Pain and/or bleeding during sex.
A burning sensation during urination.
Bleeding between your periods.

, Cervical stenosis is when the opening of the cervix is narrower than is normal. Some women who are past menopause may have cervical stenosis without any symptoms. However, symptoms of cervical stenosis may include:Not having a period.
Having painful periods.
Having abnormal bleeding, such as between periods.
Infertility.
A lump in the pelvic area caused by a bulge in the uterus.

, Uterine fibroids are muscular tumors that grow in the uterine walls. They are often benign and cause no symptoms. However, tumors, cysts, and malformations can also cause secondary dysmenorrhea, which is why it is important to talk to your gynecologist if you have a sudden onset of severe or ongoing menstrual cramps..If you do have symptoms of uterine fibroids, then some of the symptoms may include:Bleeding heavily during your period.
Having an enlarged abdomen and/or a feeling of fullness in your lower abdomen.
Urinating frequently.
Experiencing pain during sex.
Having pain in your lower back.

Secondary dysmenorrhea can indicate that you have a serious medical problem that requires prompt treatment.

, Your gynecologist will take a thorough health history and ask questions about your current condition as well. It is important to provide honest answers to these questions. Some of the questions your doctor may ask might include:When did you have your first period?
When did your symptoms start?
Does anything make your symptoms worse or better?
How is the pain affecting your daily life? Is it interfering with your normal daily activities?

, After taking a thorough health history, your doctor will also need to do a physical exam. As part of this exam, your doctor will examine your vagina, vulva, and cervix to check for masses and abnormalities. Your doctor will also examine your abdomen for signs of swelling.Depending on the findings of the exam, your doctor may decide to run blood tests or imaging tests. These tests can provide your doctor with additional information to help him or her make a diagnosis.

, Some symptoms may indicate a serious problem and you should share these with your doctor right away. Call or visit your doctor right away if you have had:a sudden onset of pain
pain that does has not gone away
a fever

Consider the possibility of infection or disease.,
Be prepared for the possibility of cancer.",How to Identify Abnormal Vaginal Spotting Between Periods," In order to distinguish between your normal menstrual period and abnormal spotting, you will need to be familiar with your normal cycle. This will help you to differentiate between what's normal and what's not.


A normal female menstrual cycle lasts for approximately 28 days, the first day of which is the first day of your monthly period. The bleeding usually lasts for 2 to 3 days but some women have it for as long as 6 days.
Any bleeding that occurs within the range of your regular menstrual period is usually normal and not a cause for concern. However, any spotting or bleeding that occurs outside of your normal cycle could be a cause for concern, and will require further investigation.;
, Think back to your menstrual cycles from the previous few months and compare the characteristics of each period to identify a pattern.


Think about how long each period lasted for (usually 3 to 7 days) and how much blood was present. In most women, the first two days of the period have the heaviest blood flow.
Most women will lose between 30 to 80 ml of blood on these days, and go through approximately 5 heavy flow tampons or pads. On the remaining days of the period, most women will go through approximately 2 regular flow tampons or pads.
Think back to how many days there were between your last period and the one before it. This is usually anywhere from 21 to 35 days. Keeping a diary over the course of a few months can really help you to identify patterns in your menstrual cycle.
Any spotting or bleeding that occurs outside of your normal pattern may be considered abnormal.

, After the spotting/bleeding, regularly monitor your blood pressure every hour to determine it is stable or not.


A progressive lowering of BP combined with an increasing pulse rate may indicate that a hemorrhage has occurred, which may not be visible if bleeding is occurring internally within the uterus. High blood pressure can also aggravate bleeding, so you should seek immediate medical attention.
Temperature is also significant in determining whether infection is present. When an infection is present in the body, your body raises its internal temperature, as this helps your immune system to fight off the infection.
Check your temperature every four hours following spotting. In adults, an oral temperature above 100.4 degrees F (38 degrees C) is considered a fever.

, Even if your period arrives within the normal dates, a heavier than normal flow could indicate abnormal bleeding.


In general, a blood volume that requires the use of more than 6 heavy-flow pads or tampons per day is considered abnormal. In this case, the period may actually be masking the abnormal bleeding.
Additionally, if the volume of blood seems normal, but the duration of your period is much longer than usual, this could be a cause for concern.

, Abnormal vaginal bleeding may be caused by a lack of platelets, a lack of proteins or a lack of calcium, all of which are used in the formation of blood clots.


Therefore, you should ask your doctor to take a blood sample and send it to the laboratory for testing. A deficiency in any of the above-mentioned blood components could be the cause of abnormal bleeding.

, Note any other signs and symptoms that accompany the spotting/bleeding. It's normal to experience symptoms of menstruation such as headache, abdominal cramps and fatigue.


However, other symptoms such as extremely low or high blood pressure, fever, chills, fainting spells and extreme sharp pain in the hips or abdomen could be a sign of a more serious problem.
If you experience any of the above-mentioned symptoms in addition to vaginal spotting/bleeding, you should seek immediate medical attention.

, Find out if you are pregnant or not either with the help of a doctor or with the use of a home pregnancy test kit. Most women are not aware that they are already pregnant in the first 4 weeks.


If you are pregnant, vaginal spotting could be an early sign of miscarriage and you should call your doctor or go to the emergency room immediately.

, Take a look at the blood spotting to see if it consists of real blood. Make sure it is not just discolored vaginal mucus/discharge, residue from reddish-colored urine/feces or an excreted medicinal stain.


Also ensure that you are certain about the source of the blood spotting. Anal bleeding could indicate a number of very different causes than vaginal bleeding.

, If you are currently pregnant, or have recently had a miscarriage or abortion, this could be the cause of vaginal spotting. This is because the detachment of the baby from the womb can cause bleeding.

, A hormonal imbalance, especially an imbalance between estrogen and progesterone levels, could be a cause of vaginal spotting. This is because very low levels of estrogen or progesterone can signal the luteinizing hormone to trigger bleeding.

, The use of an intrauterine device for birth control may be causing the vaginal spotting, as it may have become dislocated and scraped the inside of the cervix or vagina.

, Vaginal spotting or bleeding may occur after sexual contact due to lack of proper lubrication or the use of too much force. The thrusting motion during penetrative sex can cause friction and without lubrication, the male sex organ can damage the vaginal walls.

, Common in women who have had kids, these are growths in the womb that do not cause cancer. If you suspect that these growth might be causing vaginal spotting or bleeding, see your doctor for testing.

, Vaginal spotting or bleeding may be caused by a sexually-transmitted disease or may be due to a pelvic inflammatory disease. Other health conditions like endometriosis (when the womb's lining grows outside the uterus instead of inside it) can also be a cause of bleeding.

, In the worst case scenario, abnormal vaginal spotting can be a symptom of cancer of the cervix, uterus (womb), ovaries or the vagina.

Wear underwear and pants that are navy, black, or dark brown. These are less likely to show signs of your period leaking and they are less likely to get noticeable permanent stains., If you are caught out in public with stained pants, simply tie a sweatshirt, sweater, or large shirt around your waist. This will help you hide the stain until you are able to go home for a change of clothing.


If someone asks you about it, you can just say that you were feeling too warm to wear the sweater. Alternatively, you can tell them that you are experimenting with '90s fashion., Especially when you are first getting used to the rhythms of your period cycle, you might experience more leaks overnight when you cannot change your pad or tampon frequently. Find a dark-colored, old towel that you do not mind staining. Lay this across your bed to protect your sheets.

, If you are out with friends, you can ask if a friend has a spare tampon or pad in her purse. If you are in a public bathroom, you can ask another woman if she has spare period supplies. Many public bathrooms also have coin-operated pad and tampon dispensers you might use. If you are surprised by your period while at school, take a trip to the school nurse.The nurse will probably have an extra supply of pads and tampons. Don't be embarrassed: your school nurse will have helped dozens of young women in this exact same situation.

, If you have a period accident at school and do not have a change of clothing, get permission to call your parents. Your teachers will likely be sympathetic to your plight, and you will not be the first student they've had who needed a change of clothing.If you are stuck at work, see if a family member might be able to bring you a change of clothes over the lunch hour.

, If your period has leaked onto your clothing, all is not lost. There are techniques you can use to remove the stain. Rinse the stained item in cold water as soon as you can. Use hydrogen peroxide to treat stains on light items, and use a colorfast stain remover on darker items.Agitate the stained fabric by rubbing the fabric together with your fingers. After treating the stain, place the item in the wash on a cold cycle. Repeat if necessary.


Never use hot water to remove a blood stain. Heat simply sets the stain and makes it permanent.
Always air-dry items you think might be stained. An electric dryer might set the stain.

, If you are worried about leaks, try using two forms of period protection at the same time. If one form of protection begins to leak, you have the second form of protection as back-up, which will buy you some time.For example, you could wear a menstrual cup along with a sanitary napkin. Or you might wear a panty-liner along with a tampon.

, If you are out in public without any form of period protection and cannot borrow or purchase extras, make an emergency pad using toilet paper. Get to a restroom that has plenty of spare toilet paper. Wrap a roll of toilet paper around your hand 6-7 times. Place this wad of toilet paper in your underwear. Then secure your emergency pad to your underwear by wrapping them together using a long piece of toilet paper. Wrap them together using at least 4-5 loops.While this emergency pad won't hold up for long, it might last you until you can get home to change clothes and grab new tampons.

, There are several clothing products that are designed to absorb period leaks and stains, such as absorbent underwear. If you are worried about your tampons, pads, or period cups leaking, absorbent underwear will help keep the accident under control, and your pants won't get stained., If you have period accidents because you are bleeding heavily for long periods of time, you should discuss this matter with your physician. While most women experience some heavy days of their period, soaking through one tampon per hour for many hours in a row is not normal and might be a sign of an underlying medical condition. Experiencing very heavy bleeding for more than just a couple of hours is a signal that you should talk to your doctor. If you find yourself soaking through pads or tampons very quickly, make an appointment right away., Make sure that you have products that work for your light days and your heavy days. You want to be prepared for any stage of your period. Sanitary napkins and tampons take a long time to expire as long as they are stored in a cool, dry place, so it is okay for you to have several extra boxes in your home.

, Sanitary napkins and tampons can be ruined by moisture. Moisture can ruin the wrappers and make the products unhygienic.Look for waterproof bags where you can store your period supplies safely. An opaque bag will allow you to walk to the bathroom without showing off your period supplies to your classmates.


If you cannot find an opaque waterproof bag, consider doubling up. Place a small,clear, waterproof plastic bag inside a small opaque bag. You will get the waterproofing benefits as well as your desired privacy.

, Most schools and public bathrooms will only supply a coin-operated tampon and sanitary napkin dispenser. Hold on to extra change in case you need to use one of these dispensers in an emergency. A few schools, however, are starting to provide free menstrual products for their students., Place 3-5 tampons or sanitary napkins along with a few coins inside each waterproof bag. Make sure that you include tampons or pads for both lighter and heavier flow days. These kits will not see you through an entire period, but they will see you through a full day at work or school, and you can always restock them at home.

, Take a few minutes to think about good places where you might stash a few extra sanitary napkins or tampons. Some good places to store emergency period supplies include:


Your backpack or gym bag.
Your favorite handbags.
Your desk drawer at work.
Your locker at school.
Your locker at the gym.

, Remember to refresh your period supplies each month. Periods can sometimes be unpredictable, so you will want to be prepared and have period supplies handy. Even if you do not end up using your emergency period kits, you might have friends who will be grateful that you were so well prepared.

, Not everyone has access to a large locker or private office to store clothing. But if you are lucky enough to have a place to store clothes, have an extra pair of clean underwear and clean pants or leggings available. If your period leaks at work or school, you will be able to change discreetly.

, There are many kinds of safe and hygienic menstrual products on the market. These include sanitary napkins (aka maxi pads), tampons, and menstrual cups. Many women and girls have a strong preference for the menstrual product they use. Other women combine menstrual products and use several over the course of a period. Try different products whenever you get your period to discover what works best for you and your cycle.



Sanitary napkins are absorbent pads that adhere to your underwear. They come in many different varieties and strengths--from panty-liners for light days to extra long overnight pads for heavier days. They need to be changed every few hours and whenever they are filled. Sanitary napkins are the easiest products to use and might be the best choice for girls who have just started menstruating.

Tampons are absorbent tubes that are inserted into the vagina. They absorb menstrual fluid before it reaches your underwear. This can help you hide the signs of your period. Tampons need to be changed every few hours and whenever they begin to leak. Note that leaving in a tampon for too long--or using a tampon that is too absorbent for your rate of flow--can cause serious problems such as Toxic Shock Syndrome. Be sure that you read all package instructions and follow their recommendations on how to use tampons healthily.

Menstrual cups are small, flexible cups made of silicone, latex, or medical-grade rubber. They are inserted into the vagina just under the cervix and create a liquid-proof seal. Cups are often washable and reusable, but they must be emptied and washed every 10-12 hours. They are a very safe option, but they might be difficult for younger girls to use correctly., Several companies have developed period products that help you keep your period under wraps. For example, there are now tampons and sanitary napkins with quiet wrappers and supplies that are small enough to fit easily in a pocket.If privacy is important to you, try out a product with a quiet wrapper or an extra-small design. These supplies might help you keep your period a secret.

, Changing your period supplies every few hours will help reduce odors and reduce the likelihood of leaks.Plus, you will be more comfortable and feel fresher. Remember that this is a health issue as well as a privacy issue: changing napkins and tampons every few hours reduces the risk of infection and complications.Signs of Toxic Shock Syndrome--a possible complication of tampon use--include fever, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and rash.Discontinue tampon use and contact your doctor immediately if you experience these symptoms.

, It can be tempting to flush sanitary napkins and tampons to keep our periods private. However, this can clog systems and lead to toilet backups.Instead, wrap the used pad or tampon in several layers of toilet paper and throw it in the garbage. Some period products also have plastic wrappers that can be used to wrap used pads and tampons.


Most public bathrooms will provide a small, sanitary, covered garbage can specifically designed for menstrual product disposal.
If you are using your own bathroom at home, make sure your bathroom garbage can has a lid--especially if you have pets., One of the easiest ways to hide signs of your period is knowing when your period will arrive. Find a small wall calendar or desk calendar that you can keep at home. Make sure it is a 365-day calendar. You will use this calendar to track your cycle so that you can be prepared.


An alternative to a physical calendar is an app that you can purchase on your phone. If you have ready access to a smartphone, consider finding a period tracking app that can help remind you when your period is expected to begin., At the first sign of your period, note it on the calendar with an X or a red checkmark.Make the same mark on the calendar on the day that your period has concluded. This will help you figure out how long your cycle is and will help you estimate when your next period will arrive. Most periods last 2-7 days.Keeping a menstrual calendar is also useful to women who are interested in getting pregnant or in avoiding pregnancy since it will help you determine when you ovulate each month., These details include the rate of your flow (light or heavy), changes in the period's texture (such as clots), and whether you experience other period symptoms such as cramping or tiredness. All of these details can help you determine the supplies you need each month and when you will use them.These details might also be useful information to share with your doctor if you notice any significant changes to your cycle.

, Period calendars work best when you keep them consistently and regularly.The more exact and careful you are, the better. Remember that having knowledge about your body is the best way for you to get comfortable with your period.

, Count the number of days between the start of your last cycle's period and the start of this cycle's period. For most women and girls, their cycle will be between 21-34 days, with 28 days being the average.However, a period cycle can be quite a bit longer than that, up to 45 days.Keep in mind that many girls who have just begun their periods will take a while before developing a consistent cycle. Many girls who have just started menstruating have irregular periods for a year or two. This is normal.Note that period cycles can shift over time and in various situations, even for women who usually have regular periods. For example, some women notice changes to their cycles when they are stressed out, traveling, or in the company of other menstruating women. Often your period cycle will return to normal afterwards, but sometimes your cycle can make a lasting shift. Your calendar will be able to help you sort out the differences between a temporary change and a permanent change., If you have a consistent cycle, you will be able to predict the day that your next period will arrive. Note these days when you expect your period on your calendar. On these days, be extra sure that you have extra period supplies such as tampons and sanitary napkins ready.


Remember that it is not safe to use tampons before your period begins. You can, however, use a panty-liner or sanitary napkin on days when you expect your period to arrive any moment."

Use toilet paper.,
Use cloth.,

If you can ""borrow"" your mom's period supplies, go ahead!",How to Hide Your Period from Your Parents1,"


Wrap a LOT of toilet paper around the bottom of your underwear. To play it safe, you can actually tape the toilet paper pad to your underwear with regular Scotch tape so it stays in place.
For added protection, add paper towels, or a Kleenex, since they absorb a LOT more than the toilet paper. Though, when wet, they aren't very pleasant to sit around with.
These pads don't last very long, about 4 hours, though you should change them around 3 hours to make sure the blood doesn't leak through and onto your underwear.
These don't really work with a heavy flow, so if your flow is heavy, use cloth or a regular pad instead.
Low-grade toilet paper, like the type found in public and school toilets, can stick to your vagina.;
,


Grab a piece of cloth, and cut it to the size of an average pad. You might want to layer the cloth for more absorbency.
For added protection, add even more toilet paper and Kleenex to this.

,

Take a few at a time and hide them among the books in your rooms. This way, it'll be less likely for your parents to find out.
You can also volunteer for grocery-shopping duty and buy supplies as well. Dispose of the receipt.
Or, just save up, head to the drugstore and buy some 'for Mum'.

If it is, just wear a baggy/long shirt, or adjust your ""pad"" to where its not noticeable.

,


Wear baggy long shirts, or hoodies to cover up, this is also useful if you have a leak too!
Wear baggy pants/shorts. If the pants are too close to your skin, it makes a leak more likely.
Wear an accessory that attracts attention to your face/neck. Like a hat or a necklace. Not a bracelet or a belt though, for that sends attention to your bottom.
Wear dark clothes. A leak will be more noticed on a pair on gray pants than a pair of purple ones.

, This will be the exterior of your cloth pad, so choose something that you like. You can use patterned fabric or a solid color. You can even use a pattern for one side, and a solid color for the other.You can also use cotton fabric instead of flannel. Check out the quilting and calico section of your local fabric store for lots of colorful options!, Pin the two pieces together first, with the right sides facing in. Sew around the piece using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. You do not need to leave a gap for turning because you will be cutting a slit into it., Make sure that you are only cutting through one layer of fabric, not both. Position the slit right in the middle. It only needs to be a few inches/centimeters tall.Consider cutting notches into the curved corners of the pad. This will help reduce bulk.

, Use your fingers to push the corners of the pad through the slit that you cut. If the edges/corners didn't turn out all, push them out with a pencil or knitting needle.

Press the pad base with a hot iron using the cotton setting.

, You can use a matching thread color or a contrasting one. You can even use a zigzag stitch to make it look more interesting. Backstitch at the start and end of your sewing, then trim the excess threads of as close to the fabric as you can., Begin with a vertical rectangle that has a rounded top and bottom. Make the rectangle about 8 inches (20.32 centimeters) high, and 2½ inches (cc.35 centimeters) wide. Cut the template out when you are done., You will need 3 to 4 pieces of soft toweling. Use the template to trace to more pieces out of flannel; this time, add a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. The toweling will make the liner. The flannel will make the liner cover.Match the flannel to the base pad.

, Use a ⅛ to ¼-inch (0.32 to 0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Go around the edge of the piece using a zigzag stitch. Set the stack aside when you are done.Do not include the two flannel pieces in this stack.
The color of the thread does not matter. You will be putting this inside the liner cover.

, Pin the flannel pieces together with the right sides facing in. Sew around them using a ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) seam allowance. Do not leave a gap for turning. You will be cutting a slit into the piece instead., Use the same technique as you did for the pad base. This time, make the slit about 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) tall. This will give you enough space to tuck the towel lining instead.

Cut notches into curved edges of the pad. This will help reduce bulk.

, Simply slip the towel liner through the slit, and into the flannel cover. Smooth out any bumps or buckles., Turn the pad base so that the longer axis is vertical, and the side with the slit is facing up. Place the pad liner on top, with the slit facing down.

, Make sure that you are sewing ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) away from the topstitch and not the edge of the liner. Use the same thread color as you did before. This will help secure the liner further to the base and prevent buckling., You can use sew-on snaps or the kind that you have to set with a tool. You can also use Velcro instead. Avoid using self-adhesive Velcro, however. While it is convenient to apply, it does not last very long, and it will eventually come off.


The wings will close on the outside of your underwear, so plan accordingly.

, Place the pad base flannel-side-down onto the seat of your underwear; make sure that the liner pad is facing up. Fold the wings under the seat of your underwear, then close the snaps.

If you don't have any supplies, consider offering to go out and get some, such as by going to the nurse's station if at school or college, or popping to the store if at home or work.;
, Help her to feel better by commenting on positive things and even complimenting her work, outfit or something else appropriate at the time. This will take her mind off feeling less down in the dumps. Most of all, be understanding.

Don't make jokes about ""that time of the month"", ""rags"" or ""PMT"", etc. Joking about such things is just way off and won't help her to feel reassured.
Do commiserate if you actually know how it feels to have a period. If you don't, then don't make it up as you just don't know what it's like; be sympathetic but not invasive.
If you happen to have light periods and she has heavy ones, don't gloat about your ""luck"". This really doesn't help!

, You might offer to accompany her to the sick room or to see a doctor, or to give her a back rub. Be careful about offering medications; in some cases it isn't legal to do so, not even a painkiller and in other cases, it's just better that she makes that decision for herself.

Ask her if she has had some water recently. If not, fetch her some quickly. Staying hydrated may help to ease her queasiness and some cramps.
Offer to buy her some groceries or a a ready-made meal. Or, make her a meal.
Run errands for her for the day she feels bad. She'll be happy to do the same for you when you need it.

, The curse of the period is that at least once in a female's lifetime, the period is going to create a stain. If you see a stain, gently pull her aside and let her know what you've seen and offer to help. If you have a cleaning cloth, a spare pair of jeans or skirt, etc., you can offer those as well. After she's tidied up, you can give her the ""all clear"" if she asks you, otherwise just let it be.

If you have any portable stain remover in your bag or desk drawer, give it to her to use.

, The hormones and sometimes pain can take a toll on the emotions and energy levels during a period. This can cause some women and girls to feel blue or irritable or sad or even extremely anxious. Most of the time it is short lived and blows over with a good rest, nutritious food and some tender loving care. Everyone has down days, so roll with it and be a nice and helpful person. Avoid criticizing her for how she is, as this will only make things worse for her., This isn't about special treatment. It's about treating someone kindly in acknowledging and caring about the state you find them in. Most people will return the favor whenever a favor has been done for them.

Alternatively, if you are just out for the day or at work, most pads can be folded so the soiled part is in the middle. You may wish to rinse the pad in the sink, or simply place the pad in dry in a protective bag such as a Ziploc bag. You can also purchase reusable cloth ""wet bags"" similar to diaper bags from many cloth pad sellers. Ensure you soak the pad when you get home so as to prevent stains setting in.
Soaking or rinsing soon after use is essential to prevent stains from blood, urine or discharge setting in.;
, Hot water sets in stains. When you remove your used pad, place it in the jar and fill with cold water. If the pad is heavily soiled, rinse it in the sink before putting it in the water. Optionally, you can add one of the following to the soaking water: a dash of lemon juice, a dash of white or apple cider vinegar, or 2-3 drops of lavender, tea-tree or eucalyptus oil (use good-quality essential oils, not cheap poor-quality versions). These all prevent musty bad smells, and are gentle but effective antibacterials/ antimicrobials.


This is particularly important if you have a thrush (candida) infection. once you cure the infection, you must disinfect the pads by soaking as mentioned above. The sun is also very effective at killing germs- hang your pads out in the sunlight for the day if you're worried about germs.
It is not recommended to use hospital grade disinfectant soaps such as Dettol as these can encourage ""antibiotic resistant bacteria"" to flourish.

, Changing the water too often can be a waste of water if you are environmentally conscious. By rinsing a heavily soiled pad before you put it in the tub, you can prevent the need to change the water before wash day.

, Don't pour it on the garden as the water contains blood and body fluids as is therefore unsafe.)


Usually, the pads can be safely added to your general laundry, and don't need to be on a separate load (that can use up extra water/ energy). Try to wash with dark colours, just in case. Washing does an excellent job of washing away stains and germs, so there is no real need to be concerned over germs going onto other clothes. If you are concerned, you can a dash of white vinegar to the Rinse compartment/ cycle of your machine- it is a natural and safe disinfectant. If there are stubborn stains on your pads, you can use anything from baking soda pastes, to sunlight, to commercial stain removal products to remove them.
Dry hanging straight on the line so they'll sit nicely in your underwear and won't crinkle and be uncomfortable. If you don't want other people to see them drying, you can purchase a small clothes horse or clothes hanger and hide it in an unused corner of the house or your bedroom.
You can iron pads that are completely made of natural materials such as cotton/ flannel, but never iron pads that contain synthetic (eg microfibre) or waterproofing (eg PUL) materials as they will melt. Never iron over buttons or press studs as they will melt.

Be open to trying something new.,
Find the menstrual product that is right for you.,
Purchase whatever menstrual product you choose.",How to Make Your Period Eco Friendly," It's different than what you're probably used to, but definitely worth it. One misconception is that reusable products are unclean and gross. They actually have a lot of health benefits, like less risk of infections and Toxic Shock Syndrome. It's fairly easy to clean them. And if you're comfortable with your period, reusing shouldn't feel disgusting. Just give it a go, and you might be surprised.;
, There are plenty of good choices such as:


Organic cotton pads, pantiliners, and tampons: These produce a little less waste but cost more than regular disposables. They do not contain harmful chemicals and have not been bleached like mainstream brands.

Reusable pads and pantiliners: These are often made out of cotton or flannel, and are very soft and comfortable. You can also choose softer, more luxurious fabrics such as minky if you want maximum comfort. Most have wings that snap together securely under panties. They need to be washed in the washing machine after use, but they won't stain your clothes, surprisingly. You can also wash them separately from the regular laundry if desired. If taken care of, they can last for about ten years. The cost of reusable products seems high up front, but they will save you a ton on money in the long run. Want to save money? Know how to sew? Make your own pads. There are a lot of helpful patterns on the web. The best part is that you can make the pad that is perfect for you.
Padded panties: Similar to cloth pads, there are underwear made with extra cloth, so that they can be worn, washed, and reused all in one piece.

Menstrual cups: These can also be reused for ten or more years, if taken care of. Most are made of medical grade silicone, and collect blood flow instead of reusing. They can be worn for up to 12 hours without emptying on your lighter days, with no risk of TSS. Between cycles they can be cleaned quickly and easily with rubbing alcohol, sterilizing tablets, or boiling water. This is a great choice if you prefer internal menstrual products, because they hold more than tampons, and leak less often. Some people prefer them so they don't feel wet and ""icky"" on their period. Since they're internal and very comfortable if you get a cup that fits your body well, you may even forget you're menstruating!
Sea sponge tampons: These are natural sponges that are worn internally like a tampon. They can be washed and reused as well. They come in different sizes, much like disposable tampons, and can be trimmed as needed.

, For organic tampons and pads, look for brands like Seventh Generation and Natracare at an organic foods store, or you might be able to find them at supermarkets. Organic food stores in the US may carry the Lunette, DivaCup, or Keeper menstrual cups, but for other brands, you will have to search for online vendors. Some teens or first-time cup users prefer the MeLuna cup, as it is highly customizable, and details can be chosen specifically to fit your needs. Sea sponge tampons, padded panties, and cloth pads are primarily sold online.

Get informed and learn a little bit about cups.,
Measure your cervix to determine the length of cup you should buy.,
Take into consideration how heavy your flow is and cup capacity.,
Take aesthetics into account.,
Decide on the brand of menstrual cup you would like to buy.,
Purchase your cup online or in a store.",How to Buy a Menstrual Cup," If you are brought up in a society where cups are not widely available, they may seem strange to you. However cups are healthier, more economical, and more convenient than conventional menstrual products. See How to Decide About Using a Menstrual Cup for more information about cups.
, Your cervix is the part of your vagina where your menstrual fluid leaves. It's important to measure how far up your cervix is in your vagina before you buy a cup, because some cups are longer and some are shorter, so they work worse or better with people who have lower or higher cervixes. If you have a low cervix you will want a shorter, stouter cup so that it does not ride down or poke out of you while you're wearing it. So before deciding which cup to buy, find out how high or low your cervix is using the following process.

Wait until you are on your period, because your cervix will be in different positions at different times of your monthly cycle. Also, you may want to measure on a couple of different days of your period, because it may not be exactly the same each day.
Gently and slowly insert a clean finger back, not up, into your vagina, past your pelvic bone, some muscles, and a kind of 'empty' space. Lubricant may be helpful to use for this part.
Wander around to find the bit that feels a bit like the tip of a nose. Your cervix is a round nub, with an indentation in the middle.
Note how far your finger went before touching your cervix, and measure your finger with a ruler to find out how many centimeters or millimeters back this was. If it's so far back you can't find it at all, just estimate a bit longer than your finger.

Now what to do with this information! Some brands make cups as small as 4 centimeter (1.6 in) long or as large as almost 6 centimeter (2.4 in) long. Your cup will sit below your cervix when in use. If it is low, you will probably find a shorter cup such as Ladycup, Lunette, Fleurcup, or Yuuki more comfortable. If your flow is light, the MeLuna is also a good option -- however, if your flow is heavy and you want to use this brand, you may need to choose one of their larger sizes. If you have a low cervix, the cup without the stem should not be too much longer than the distance from your cervix to your vaginal opening (but you have a bit of slack there, because your cervix can be partially in the cup). If it is high, a longer cup such as Divacup, Naturcup, or Shecup would be better so that it will be easy to reach when you want to remove it, but in this case you can comfortably use most cup lengths.

, Some cups only hold about 11mL and others up to 29mL. Observe on a general day of your period how many tampons you use and how often you change them. Then, using the tampon capacities listed below, calculate your flow volume for twelve hours. This would be the target capacity you want in your cup. In general it's best to overestimate than underestimate so you are not changing your cup too often. Pads have capacities ranging from about 100-500 ml, but the pad would be fully saturated and leaking by this point. If you use pads, there is not a precise way to calculate the capacity you need, so just consider a light flow capacity cup (10-16ml), medium (17-22ml), or large (23-29ml). Tampon capacities:

Light/Regular: 6-9ml
Super: 9-12ml
Super plus: 12-15ml
Ultra: 15-18ml


, Cups come different colors. They have frosted or slick finishes, grips rings or no grip rings. Stems can be hollow, flat, or cylindrical; some even have grip rings or ball stems instead. All of these things depend on the brand, and this is another characteristic to consider when purchasing your cup.
, Once you have figured out the length and capacity you would like to have in your cup, check the size charts below. Cups are not one size fits all, because although you maybe able to make any cup work, a little premeditation as discussed above before buying will ensure your cup is comfortable and has the correct capacity for you., Most menstrual cups can be purchased over the Internet and delivered to your home address. Also, check the store locator on the brand's website to see if the brand is sold near you. (Look for a cup manufactured near or in your country.) For example in the USA, Lunette, DivaCup, and Keeper brand cups are sold in stores. In the UK mainly Femmecups, DivaCups, and UK Mooncups are available. South America has InCiclo and Maggacup; Africa has Luvur Body, MPower, Ruby Cup, Lunette, and Mooncup UK; Australia has JuJu, Lunette, and DivaCup. See the list of ""Major Brands"" below. You can also check the World Wide Menstrual Cup Shop Map to see if there is a store near you that sells cup."

Consider why you are shopping for reusable pads.,



 This pad has two pieces: a liner and a removable cloth.,
Guesstimate the correct size for your pads.,
Buy a few trial pads.,
Stock up on your favorite pads.",How to Buy Reusable Menstrual Pads," If you want to primarily use cloth pads, you will need a large supply and larger sizes of pads. You also may want to look into waterproof linings, which although pricey, increase the wearing time of pads. If you are considering liners as backup for your menstrual cup or for discharge, you won't need that lining or thicker, longer pads.
, Do you want one or two piece pads?

Research material. Waterproof linings are one thing to consider. Also consider whether you want a top layer of cotton or cotton flannel cloth on your pads. Cotton will tend to feel colder, while flannel feels warmer. If you associate coldness with wetness, flannel may be a better fit for you. However, cotton has a smoother texture more similar to most underwear. Take your pick., Roughly measure your underwear widthwise, where you place disposable pads normally. Pads should be a little less wide or as wide as your panties. If length is important to you, measure the size of your preferred disposables., Scope out different websites and buy a few different styles, sizes, and patterns. This is a good way to test the waters, and figure out which kind you like best., There are lots of different venues to buy pads from. They range from extremely cheap to very expensive. Generally, you get what you pay for. There are very cute, cheap pads from individual sellers on Ebay and Etsy, but you can also use a search engine to find the main online retailers for cloth pads."

Pros of cups:

Cups are inexpensive. The average woman spends about $3000 dollars in her lifetime on disposable menstrual products. The average menstrual cups costs $25-50 and can be reused for ten or more years.
Cups are safe and clean. Unlike tampons and pads, which can contain harsh chemicals and can harbor bacteria, cups do not encourage bacterial growth and are made of inert, medical-grade silicone, rubber, or TPE (thermoplastic elastomers). Additionally, cups also do not soak up extra moisture like tampons, so they keep the vaginal environment intact.
Cups are convenient. For most women, cups can be worn for twelve hours before emptying them. They show nothing outside of the body (i.e. tampon strings) and can be worn while playing sports, swimming, and sleeping without leaking. There is also no need to carry around spare supplies, as you will always have your cup with you while you're on your period. Cups can be worn before a woman's period starts, which is helpful for those with irregular periods. Menstrual cups leak 0.5 less frequently and have to be changed 2.8 less times, and they also eliminate any period odor.
Cups are environmentally friendly as well as body positive. The average woman uses over 16800 disposable, paper menstrual products in her lifetime. Compare that to just one silicone cup in terms of its environmental impact. And you will have to know more about your body and your period in order to use one.
Cups are comfortable. Most users can't feel their cups at all; it's quite possible to forget that you're wearing one. It may look big, but a cup folds up into a very small object for insertion and removal. Some women even report less cramps and bloating while using cups. The fact that they do not dry out the vagina is a comfort factor for many as well.



Cons of cups:

Cups are hands on, meaning you will get a little messier using them. They're probably not the best option for you if you are squeamish at the sight of blood.
Cups have a longer learning curve than other menstrual products. It can take about 3-4 cycles to get truly adjusted and comfortable with using your cup.
Cups may cause discomfort. Some women have discomfort from too much suction or a firm cup pushing on their bladder or rectum because of their body shape.

;
, The Menstrual Cup LiveJournal Forum is a great place to do this.

, If you feel fully comfortable with purchasing and trying out a cup see these wikiHows for more information on choosing the cup that's right for you and learning how to use one.

Clean your cup between uses while on your period.,
Choose a method to clean your cup after you finish your period.,
Remove stains from your cup.,


Store the cup in a clean, small space during the month.",How to Clean a Menstrual Cup," Silicone is not a material that harbors bacteria, so it is safe to rinse with water and reinsert. If you want to be extra careful you can use a dab of fragrance free soap that is not antibacterial, such as, Dove Fragrance Free Body Wash. You can also use Summers Eve it's a soap for the vagina specifically. So it will not give you a yeast infection. However, any type of hand or body soap can irritate the vagina, so be sure to thoroughly rinse the cup of soap. Also make sure the air holes at the top of the cup are clear of fluid. Bend the cup at these holes while rinsing to ensure this happens.
, (You can also clean your cup right before you start it again next month.)





  A menstrual cup being boiled.

Boil your menstrual cup either in a pot or in the microwave. (Consult the directions that came with your cup for how long you should boil it.) Make sure the cup stays floating at the top of the pot the whole time, because the bottom will be hot enough to burn or melt your cup. After boiling your cup, let it cool, dry with a paper towel or toilet paper, and store your cup.
# Put 1 Tbsp of baking soda into a pot of near-boiling water. Put your cup in, making sure it's covered with the water, but not completely on the bottom of the pot. Let sit for 15 minutes, then add 1/2 Tbsp more baking soda, trying to dump it in on/in the cup if you can. The baking soda will get rid of any odors. Roll the cup over, boil for 5-10 more minutes, then remove from water. Let it cool and dry on a paper towel.

, If your cup starts to look grimy there are a few ways to remove those stains. One way is to leave the cup sitting in the sun while it dries from cleaning. You can also scrub it with a little baking soda and cold water., An example is the cloth, drawstring bag it comes with."
"
Get some towels.,
Stick to the missionary position.,
Have sex in the shower.,
Don't get too handsy.,
Stick to your lighter days.,
Take a shower after.",How to Have Sex During Your Period1," You don't want your menstrual fluid (combined with everything else) to soak into your sheets and mattress, so while you're having sex place some towels beneath you and some tissues to your side. The towels will be on constant duty; the tissues will be used to wipe yourself off just before sitting up (when all is said and done).


If odor is a problem, don't let it ruin the moment -- throw on some blankets. If you keep them above your midsections, they'll help block the wafting scents.;
, Lie on your back to lessen the flow of blood while you're having intercourse.Also, be careful about deep penetration because your cervix may be lower and more sensitive during your period. If anything starts to hurt, just tell your partner and proceed with care.

, Not only is this less messy from the get-go, it's a change of pace, too. When you're under the flow of the water, that other flow becomes a lot less noticeable.  If you can fit two in comfortably, give it a shot (if you haven't already!).

, Unless your partner's into uterine lining, they probably shouldn't start feeling around down there. However, if you're the type that needs loads of foreplay, you're in luck! You already have a natural lubricant, so your partner's fingers (and whatever else) can have the night off.


That doesn't mean you should skip the foreplay entirely. No, no, no, no -- that's a travesty! Just use it as an excuse to experiment with new tricks and moves.

, This just makes sense. If you know that days 3-5 are lighter than days 1 and 2, just keep your panties on for that 48 hours. Let the anticipation build and avoid any awkward trips to the laundromat.


If it doesn't bother your partner and they're totally down for day 1 sex, evaluate your concerns. Maybe it's something you could get over -- after all, it's no less sanitary than what you've been doing. It's just a bit redder!

, There will probably be at least a little something on your skin that needs to be washed off. If you didn't do the deed in the shower, hop in after for at least a quick rinse. You'll feel better, too.


If you're using toys during this time, get those things sanitary immediately. Putting it off will only result in a, how do you say, less-than-glamorous experience. All in all, get everything hygienic as quickly as possible.

Use contraception.,
Wear a cup that will stop the menstrual flow from leaving your vagina.,
Know that sperm can stay alive for up to 72 hours.That's three days those little guys have to swim around doing whatever they dang well please.",How to Have Sex During Your Period2," When you're on your period, you're at higher risk for STDs and pelvic infections. What's more, you're less likely to get pregnant, sure, but it's not impossible.So if you thought this was your ticket to ride, sorry -- you still gotta stay safe. Here are some of your options:



Diaphragms do double-duty as birth control devices and as menstrual cups to inhibit flow. Sometimes, diaphragms can be felt during sex, and removal can be messy. However, they are generally easy to use because your gynecologist will provide a diaphragm fit exactly to your cervical measurements.Contraceptive sponges are foam devices soaked in spermicide that are inserted into your vagina during sex. They can prevent pregnancy and have the side benefit of absorbing flow, although they don't prevent STDs.Male condoms will help prevent pregnancy, block STDs, and keep blood from getting on your partner's penis. Female condoms, which will also keep your partner from coming into contact with blood while enabling more heat and sensation, are also a good form of birth control, although they will provide slightly less protection than male condoms. You can improve the effectiveness of a female condom by putting some spermicide on the closed end before you insert it into your vagina., Wear a menstrual cup for sexual play that doesn't involve intercourse. Wear a softcup for penetrative intercourse.


Avoid wearing regular menstrual cups during penetration. They are not designed to be used that way and will probably leak. However, if you just want to fool around, menstrual cups prevent leaking and allow for mess-free play including oral sex. Skip cups made of rubber because the rubbery smell and the taste of rubber in your vaginal fluid may be unpleasant for your partner. Use a silicone cup instead.

Instead softcups are specifically designed to be used during intercourse. They are shaped like a diaphragm, are very flexible, and available at most drugstores. Keep in mind that while you can have intercourse with a soft cup, it doesn't work as a contraceptive.

, So if you do take the risk of having unprotected sex and your partner ejaculating into you, that's what'll be going on inside you. If your period is over tomorrow, though the risk of getting pregnant is minimal, it's still there.

"
"
Talk it over beforehand.,
Reap the benefits.,
Be confident.,
Be inventive.",How to Have Sex During Your Period3," Not everybody enjoys period sex, so it's best not to initiate sex during your period and deliver an awkward surprise to your partner and a potentially frustrating response to you. Instead, talk it over and find out what your partner thinks about the situation before you get started. He or she probably has an opinion!


Some religions and cultures consider the act of having intercourse during your period to be wrong. While no scientific principles support this restriction, you'll have to respect your partner's feelings on the matter., Sex on your period actually makes a lot of sense, if you look at it from the right angle. A lot of women can actually be more sexually aroused during this time, so the sex can be even better. But what's more, it's good for your period.


Having sex on your period actually makes it shorter. The muscle contractions of the orgasm actually drive out everything faster (as opposed to making it magically disappear). Your period may be a bit heavier, but it'll shrink in duration.Your cramps will be lessened. An orgasm is our bodies' version of a natural painkiller. It's a rush that wipes away all those aches and floods our feel-good receptors in our brains. If you're out of Midol, take to the sheets!, Your period and your vagina are in no way dirty or gross. Having sex while menstruating isn't weird, uncommon, unhygienic or unsafe. It's all in your head, so quit psyching yourself out!


If both of you enjoy it (and you inevitably will), why the fuss? You may feel awkward when you first start, but your mind will be taken off the matter in minutes. Maybe even seconds!

, Sex is generally thought of as penetration, but there are many other forms of sexual play that can bring pleasure to both partners, even if you or your partner do not wish to have vaginal intercourse during your period. Take this opportunity to discuss and brainstorm new ideas.

And if you don't have a menstrual cup already, read wikiHow's advice on buying a menstrual cup for directions on picking out the right cup for you.;
, Most users do not get the hang of it until after a couple of tries, so this will be far better than using a public bathroom. Also, although you may be tempted to do a dry run while you're not on your period, you really shouldn't because it's generally more lubricated and your cervix may be in a different position while you're menstruating. So for the first time, make sure it is during your period as well.

, The C fold shown on instruction manuals isn't the best technique for many women. When you use the C fold, the widest part of the cup is just at the beginning. Another fold (there are many to choose from) is the punch-down fold. To make this fold, place your finger on the rim of the cup, and push it down into the cup. See the video below for more folds you can try.








, The first time you use it, it should be boiled as well. Soap should never be used on a menstrual cup. It can cause yeast infections amongst other problems., This may make it painful or difficult to insert the cup. Your pelvic muscles are the ones you use to stop and start peeing. Practice loosening and tightening these muscles (aka doing kegel exercises) so you will be able to relax them during insertion. Be patient; the first time inserting it is always the hardest, so don't give up if you're having trouble at first-- but do take a break if you become overly frustrated.

, You might like to try inserting the cup while over the toilet. You can also try squatting down in the tub or shower; standing and putting one leg on the edge of the toilet or tub; putting your back against a wall and getting into a squat position; or lying down on the floor with your knees up and legs apart.

, Stick a finger inside your vagina and feel for your cervix, which feels kind of like the tip of your nose. It is a small, squishy nub with an indentation in the middle. Aiming the cup in the direction of your cervix will help. This way you won't accidentally poke your cervix with the cup, or take up space in the cup with your cervix. If you can't find your cervix, this probably means it's very high, and in that case your cervix probably won't cause any problems.


If you would rather opt not to do this, aim the cup towards the small of your back.

, Fold the cup and then hold it with one hand (stem facing downwards). Spread apart your labia and find the opening of your vagina with your other hand. Now push the cup in at a about a 45 degree angle towards your pubic bone, not straight up. The cup should pop open. Continue to push the cup in until it is comfortable. (The cup may ride low or high depending on your body, but the base of the cup should not clear your vaginal opening.)








, You may have heard or felt a ""pop."" This is a sign that the cup has opened. Otherwise, reach up and feel around the base of the cup. It should be round or at least oval. (The cup may not ever open up all the way, depending on your body shape.) If it's not open, you can open it manually with a hand. Also try doing a few Kegel exercises, squats, jumping jacks, or rotating the cup in a full circle by twirling the base. You can also reach up with a finger and press part of the vaginal wall out of the way, so that air can travel up and fill the cup. You may feel more comfortable with the cup closer to your cervix than pictured in the instructions. When it is in place, you can also try to pull it gently down, to make sure the vacuum has been made (that's what the little holes are for) - this is part of what holds the cup securely.








, If you have a heavy flow, you will have to empty it more often, because this is the maximum recommended time. For your first cycle with a cup, you'll have to do a bit of experimenting to find out how long you can leave your cup in before leaking. (It's a good idea to wear a back up pantyliner; cloth pantyliners are a good reusable option.)

, Bear down with your muscles so the cup will travel down farther. Continue doing this until you can reach the stem. Wiggle the cup back and forth and down. Get a better grip on the actual base, not just the stem, of the cup and continue to pull it out. Pinching the base helps to break the vacuum and makes it easier to remove the cup. When you get to the opening of your vagina make sure you take it out upright to reduce spillage. If the rim of the cup is too wide to remove comfortably, use a finger to fold the cup into a C fold or a punch-down fold before you take it out of your vagina. If you're removing the cup over a toilet, you can let the contents spill out the ""back"" as you remove the cup, just keep your hand out of gravity's path.








, Rinse the cup with water. To clear the suction holes of menstrual fluid, bend the cup at the suction holes under the water. You can also fill the cup with water, cover the opening with your palm, and the squeeze the cup to squirt water out the holes-- keep clear! Dry your cup if it's too slippery (although the water and slipperiness may help you out) and reinsert.

, You can boil the cup, use sterilizing tablets, swab it down with rubbing alcohol, or choose from other methods. See wikiHow's instructions on how to clean a menstrual cup for directions and choose the method that works best for you.

, Take your time. Menstrual cups have a learning curve of about three to four cycles and if eventually you find out it's not for you, that's fine. If you still want to use a reusable menstrual product, you can try cloth pads or sea sponges.

Any light to moderate exercise will help, but walking tends to be the easiest one to do spontaneously.

Try walking or running up and down the stairs.
Stretch breaks are often socially appropriate and even a few moments can help.


Your body may benefit from some extra fuel if you are feeling especially sluggish. Try a light, healthy snack to help give yourself some energy. This will be especially helpful if you have not been eating nutritious foods throughout the day.Try giving yourself a protein boost with some nuts, nut butter, or low-fat cheese. Fruit is also a healthy choice that can give you the burst of energy you need.
Eating healthy meals throughout the day will help prevent you from feeling de-energized to start with. Try to choose foods that are high in protein and fiber, but low in sugar, salt, and fat.

, Sometimes a tea, coffee, soda, or candy bar will give you the energy short-term that you need. This will give you a burst of energy, but it will not last long and you may feel even worse when it wears off. This should be used sparingly, as healthy foods will give you longer-lasting energy and make you feel much better in the long run.Caffeine may worsens menstrual symptoms for some women, so be cautious. If you find that you have worse cramps or other symptoms when you drink caffeine, steer clear during and right before your period.Caffeine can be taken as a supplement as well (either in pill or powder form). No matter what form you take it in, you should not exceed the recommended dose of 150 – 600 mg., You should try to stick to a healthy, nutritious diet all the time, but this can be especially hard when you're feeling sluggish and unmotivated. Not only is junk food bad for your overall health, but it can also worsen many symptoms that are typically associated with menstruation and PMS, including bloating, depression, and fatigue.Avoid excessive amounts of sugar, salt, fat, caffeine, and alcohol. These foods will not provide you with long-lasting energy, and they may cause you to feel even more tired.
Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These will give you the long-lasting energy your body needs.

, Some women crave foods that are high in sugar and fat during their periods, even when they don't normally eat these foods. These can cause highs and lows in your energy level, even on a good day, so it's no wonder you're feeling lethargic if you have been giving into these cravings. Try to be mindful of them and avoid eating things that you normally wouldn't.Substitute healthy options for cravings. You may want some really unhealthy food, but you may be satisfied with a healthier alternative. For example:

Instead of a milkshake, try a strawberry yogurt smoothie.
Instead of apple pie, try a baked apple with cinnamon.
Instead of regular pizza, try a pita topped with a small amount of cheese and olive oil.
Instead of a bacon cheeseburger, try a veggie burger.
Try a frozen banana instead of ice cream. Coat it in the crumbs of a crushed chocolate wafer if you want some chocolate.
Want a chocolate bar? Try a nice hot cup of cocoa. It has far less calories and fat, and may satisfy your need for a chocolate fix.


Sometimes cravings are your body's way of telling you that it needs a specific nutrient. If you find that you are consistently craving a specific kind of food, you may want to see your doctor for a blood test. For example, soda cravings may indicate a calcium deficiency, red meat cravings may indicate an iron deficiency, and chocolate cravings may indicate a magnesium deficiency., While the best way to get the nutrients you need is to eat a healthy, balanced diet, this is not always enough. If you feel your diet is lacking in certain nutrients, it may help to take vitamin supplements. The following vitamins may help improve the symptoms that you experience before and during your period:Folic acid (400 micrograms)
Calcium with vitamin D (1000-1300 mg, depending on age)
Magnesium (400 mg)
Vitamin B-6 (50 to 100 mg)
Vitamin E (400 IU)

, Exercise may sound absolutely terrible when you are dealing with menstrual fatigue, but it will help you regain some of your energy. Although your body may feel lethargic, you likely have every capacity to work out and doing so may make you feel better. It may also help with other period-related symptoms such as cramping, bloating, and indigestion.Try the 10-minute rule. Do your workout for 10 minutes, and then decide if you are up for the workout. Very often once you get going, you will keep at it. If after 10 minutes you still feel terrible, that may be a signal to slow down or stop.
Feel free to switch up exercise according to comfort. For example, if your chest is tender from retaining water, maybe your jump rope workout would really be uncomfortable. In such cases, trying an alternate workout may make sense. If exercise is not fun because you are in pain, you will not exercise.
Each week, aim for two and a half hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (like brisk walking) or one hour and 15 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise (like running). You can also achieve your goal with a combination of moderate and vigorous activities.
Incorporate some strength training. You can try lifting weights or doing push-ups.
Take an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or naproxen if you are suffering from cramps, or try using a heating pad or stick-on heating strip. You may find that you have a lot more energy to move around once your cramps are gone.

, If you are having trouble sleeping at night because you are experiencing painful cramps, try changing your sleeping position or using a body pillow to support yourself. The right position can make all the difference when it comes to falling and staying asleep.If these changes aren't enough, take an over-the-counter pain medication. There's no point in suffering through a poor night's sleep just because you have some cramps.
A heating pad may also be beneficial if you have painful cramps. Try sleeping with one on low heat. A warm bath before bed may provide the same benefit.

, Your body temperature rises during the second half of your monthly cycle, which may make it harder for you to fall asleep. Try turning the thermostat down a few degrees to counter this effect and make yourself more comfortable. The ideal sleeping temperature for most people is between 60 and 67 °F (15.6 and 19.4°C). If you have a programmable thermostat, set it to automatically adjust to your ideal sleeping temperature right before bedtime.
You can also try taking a warm bath before bed. The contrast between the warm water and the cool room will help your body temperature drop faster.

, If you find that you have a much harder time falling asleep during your period than you normally do, it may be that your body is not producing enough melatonin due to hormonal fluctuations. Try taking melatonin, which is available over-the-counter, before bed during your period.Talk to your doctor before you start taking any new supplements. They may interact with other medications you are taking.
If you want to confirm that your body is lacking melatonin, you can ask your doctor to test for it. Make sure you get tested during your period for accurate results.

, An excess of estrogen or deficiency of progesterone may also be causing your sleep troubles. If this is the case, your doctor may be able to prescribe a hormonal supplement that will help even your levels out.In order to determine if you have a hormonal imbalance, you will need to have your levels tested at several different times throughout the month. This can be done with blood or saliva tests
It helps if you track your sleep problems and any other symptoms you may experience before seeing your doctor. This will help your doctor understand whether or not your symptoms are related to your menstrual cycle.

, If fatigue during your period is interfering with your ability to work and to enjoy your personal life, see your doctor. You may be suffering from iron deficiency anemia. Iron deficiency anemia can happen to anyone, but women who experience heavy periods are at a higher risk due to their increased blood loss. In order to diagnose anemia, your doctor will want to do a simple blood test. You may also need to undergo additional tests, such as an ultrasound to check for uterine fibroids that could be causing excessive menstrual bleeding.
There may be other medical causes for your fatigue as well, although anemia is the most common cause for fatigue that occurs during menstruation.

, For some people, it may be possible to correct iron deficiency anemia simply by making changes to their diets. Your doctor may advise that you eat more iron-rich foods, including:


Proteins such as beef, pork, chicken, and fish
Dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale
Peas and beans
Fortified grain products like cereal and pasta
Dried fruit like raisins and apricots

, If you are not able to increase your iron levels with dietary changes, your doctor may recommend that you take an iron supplement, which are available over-the-counter. In extreme cases, your doctor may recommend an IV supplement.Your doctor may also recommend that you take Vitamin C, which aids the absorption of iron. This is available in an over-the-counter pill form as well. You should take this with an acidic juice high in vitamin C such as orange juice, grapefruit juice, or lemonade. These help increase iron absorption.
Always take the recommended dose of supplements. Don't stop taking them or change your dose without talking to your doctor.

, It's a good idea to follow up with your doctor, and perhaps get another blood test, after you have changed your diet or started taking supplements. This will help you understand how effective your treatment has been and what further changes you need to make.It may take months to get your iron levels back to normal. The good news is that if supplementation is working for you, you should start to feel a difference in your energy levels after about a week.
For some some people, iron deficiency anemia is caused by a condition, such as celiac disease, that prevents the absorption of iron into the bloodstream. If this is the case for you, simply adding more iron to your diet will not solve the problem.

Do not be embarrassed by your period.",How to Have a More Bearable Period," Though you may have strong cravings for foods that are high in sugar, caffeine, and salt during your period, try to avoid eating them as much as you can. Eating foods high in sugar will cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash, leading to more mood swings and headaches. Eating foods high in salt can make you retain more water and feel more bloated. Having foods high in caffeine will increase the production of estrogen in your body, which will just lead to more intense period symptoms.Try to replace coffee and caffeinated teas with water or herbal teas. Go for foods low in salt and sugar, at least while you have your period.
If you cannot suppress your chocolate cravings, you may try eating raw chocolate. Look for raw chocolate, made with raw cacao and no additives, at your local health food store. It is packed with magnesium without any added sugars or additives.;
, Foods with calcium, including low-fat yogurt, sardines, non-fat milk, cheese, spinach, and tofu, may reduce bloating, cramps, food cravings, and mood swings.Aim to get at least 1,200 milligrams of calcium a day. If you have trouble meeting this number, try taking a supplement.

, You should also adjust your eating schedule so you eat smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. Eating more frequently will keep your metabolism up and working. It will also ensure you have enough energy throughout the day.You can still have three medium-sized meals throughout the day, but schedule in snack breaks where you eat a small amount of food between these meals. Stick to snacks that are high in vitamins, like raw nuts, fruits, and vegetables.

, Many women develop migraines before and during their periods due to a fall in their estrogen levels.If you tend to get migraines during your period, you should switch up your diet. Cut down on foods high in carbohydrates, starches, sugars, and processed ingredients. This can help to reduce your migraines.If your migraines do not improve, you may want to see your doctor about getting medication for the issue. Your doctor may prescribe anti-inflammatory painkillers, estrogen supplements, or suggest you go on hormonal contraceptives, if you aren’t already taking them them. These treatments can help to reduce the intensity and frequency of your period migraines.

, Though you get cramps and feel sore during your period, working out can help to reduce these symptoms. Try to schedule in light exercise at least once a day, even on the days when you have your period. Getting your body moving can improve your mood and regulate the symptoms of your period.You may do a 10 to twenty minute run once a day or go on a long bike ride. You could also try an aerobics class or a dance class to get your heart rate going. You may want to avoid exercises that involve the abdominal area, as this area can be sore during your period.

, Another option for exercise is to do yoga. Yoga can be beneficial for your body during your period as it allows you to de-stress and relax through movement. You may go for a more calming style of yoga or a more rigorous yoga style, depending on your mood.You may consider joining a yoga studio and sticking to a regular schedule of classes every week. This way, when you have your period, you can try to maintain the same schedule and attend your usual yoga classes.

, Meditation and biofeedback are two ways that you can learn to effectively cope with your period, and can be used in conjunction with or instead of medication. Meditation, such as mindful meditation and Transcendental meditation (TM), may help increase your pain tolerance and take your mind off your symptoms.Biofeedback is a technique that teaches you to become aware of your body's responses and signals, such as temperature, breathing, and blood pressure. It may also help you control menstrual cramps and other symptoms.Look for a healthcare professional with training in biofeedback to teach you how it is done.

, Sleeping when you have your period can be a challenge, especially if you tend to get cramps and headaches during your period. You can counteract any restlessness at night by keeping your bedroom cool and calming. Set up a fan in your room if it tends to get hot or open a window for airflow. Use light, cotton sheets on the bed and make sure your bedroom feels dark and cozy.You can also make your bedroom more calming by lighting candles or incense in the room. You may also put on relaxing music to calm down and settle into sleep.

, You can also get more comfortable in bed by sleeping with a hot water bottle over your abdominal area. This is ideal if you tend to get cramps at night or when you lay down. Wrap the hot water bottle in a blanket or a towel and place it on your abdominal area or just above your pelvic bones.

You can also take a hot bath before bed to soothe any sore or cramping areas and sip hot herbal tea, such as chamomile, peppermint, or rosehip.

, You should always be prepared during your period for a sudden spell of cramping or a migraine. Be sure to pack painkillers in your bag or purse so you have them on hand. This will ensure that if your period does become unbearable, you have the means to make it a little less so.You may pack anti-inflammatory painkillers like ibuprofen, naproxen, and mefenamic acid.

, Pack extra tampons or pads in your bag in the event of spotting. Have these on hand just in case you need to change your tampon or pad while you are away from home.You may pack a variety of sizes of tampons or pads so you are prepared. Keep tampons that have a low and high absorbency rate on hand so you can wear the right one based on your flow.

, Stay hydrated during your period by drinking lots of water every day — try to drink even more than you normally would. You should aim for eight to 10 8-oz glasses (1.9 to 2.4 liters) of water a day to ensure you are not dehydrated. Get in the habit of taking a water bottle with you wherever you go, especially when you have your period. Sip on water throughout the day so you stay hydrated and healthy.You may want to try adding lemon or lime juice to your water for taste.

, If you feel like your current menstrual hygiene method is not effective, you may consider switching to a different method. Perhaps you find tampons uncomfortable and decide to switch to pads, or you want to be more environmentally-friendly and use a menstrual cup. Switching to a different menstrual hygiene solution can make your periods more bearable and comfortable for you.You have several options for internal protection during your period, including tampons, menstrual cups, or menstrual sponges. For external protection during your period, you can try menstrual pads or panty liners or reusable cloth pads.

, Though you may find it annoying and uncomfortable to get your period every month, try to remember that it is all part of being female and completely natural. You do not need to feel embarrassment or shame about your period, as all women experience the same flow every month and deal with many of the same menstrual issues. Getting your period is part of being a healthy woman and it should not be considered taboo or shameful. Try to embrace your period as natural and essential to your health.


Think about it this way: almost 50% of the entire population of the world has gone through or will go through the same thing.

Wear a menstrual cup or tampon if you plan on going swimming.,
Pack ample supplies.,
Wear a dark colored swimsuit.,
Bring over-the-counter pain relievers to combat cramps.,
Consider trying to skip or delay your period if you're going on vacation.,
Drink lots of water and avoid salty foods to prevent bloating and cramps.,
Set up near the bathroom.,
Use an oil-free SPF designed specifically for faces.,
Go swimming or get active to help stop cramps.,
Consider getting comfortable with tampons.,
Wear a pad and spend your day reading and sunbathing.If you don’t plan on swimming, you may be able to get away with a thin pad in your suit.,
Try swimming without a pad.",How to Go to the Beach on Your Period," A pad absolutely will not work for swimming. It will quickly absorb all the water so it won’t be able to absorb your blood, it will swell up to an embarrassing and obvious size, it won’t stay snug in your swimming suit and may slip out and float to the surface.Tampons and menstrual cups collect the menstrual fluid before it even leaves your body, so the chances of leaking are pretty low.You can wear tampons for up to 8 hours and cups for up to 12, so you can go from sunning to swimming to playing beach volleyball without having to dash to the bathroom.
Look for tampons labeled “active” or that are designed to be worn while playing sports. These are less likely to leak and are designed to stay put while you’re swimming, running, or lunging to catch a frisbee.If you’re worried about your tampon string showing, just bring a pair of nail clippers and carefully shorten the string after you insert the tampon.Otherwise, just tuck it into the lining of your suit and you should be fine.
When you enter the water, your period can stop or become very light. The pressure of the water can act like a plug or little airlock and keep the menstrual fluid inside. But this is not guaranteed to happen, and you shouldn’t count on it.;
, Put some back-up tampons in a little bag and then stash them in your beach bag so you’re not caught without. Your flow could be heavier than expected and you might need to change your tampon a few times, or you might stay at the beach longer than expected and run up against the 8-hour time limit for wearing a tampon safely.Keeping extra on-hand will give you peace of mind, so you can relax and enjoy yourself instead of wondering where you’re going to find a fresh tampon.
Bringing extra tampons might end up staving the day if your friend unexpectedly gets her period or forgot to bring her own supplies., This is not the time to wear your white bathing suit. There’s always a slight chance of leakage, and since you won’t be wearing a panty-liner to protect your suit from leaks, choose a suit in a dark color, like black or blue, to camouflage any accidents.If you’re really stressing about leaks, slip on a pair of shorts or a cute sarong over your suit bottoms for an extra layer of protection., What’s worse than having menstrual cramps? Having menstrual cramps at the beach. Make sure you pack an over-the-counter (OTC) pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) or naproxen (Aleve) and be sure to follow the package instructions. Don't forget water and snacks to take with it.Pack warm or hot water in a thermos with a little lemon. This can increase circulation and may help your muscles relax, easing your cramps.

, If you know your week-long beach vacation falls on the same week as your period, and you use hormonal birth control, you can choose to skip your period that month or simply get it a week later. This is safe to do every once in a while and doesn’t impact the effectiveness of your birth control — though you should certainly check with your doctor.If you take birth control pills, don’t take the inactive week of pills that you take when you get your period (they are usually marked or a different color). Instead, immediately begin a new pack.If you use a patch or a ring, remove it after three weeks as usual. But instead of going without for a week, immediately replace it with a new one.You may still have breakthrough bleeding when you skip your period, so you should still bring some panty liners, just in case.If you are on birth control, make sure you have an extra pack of pills or ring or patch, in case your insurance won’t let you refill early (since you’ll need a new pack a week earlier than usual)., You definitely don’t want to feel bloated and uncomfortable on a day you’re supposed to be frolicking in your swimming suit. Skip fried and super salty foods and instead snack on fruits with lots of water in them, like watermelon and berries, or calcium-rich almonds, which can reduce cramping.


Avoid caffeine, which can make cramps worse.Drink water, caffeine-free tea, or lemonade instead of soda or alcoholic beverages, which can increase bloating., You don’t need to camp out right outside the bathroom, but at least have one in sight so you know you can quickly go change or check for leaking if you need to. Also, an empty bladder and bowels can ease cramping, so visiting the bathroom frequently can help you stay comfortable., Lots of women break out during their periods, and an oily sunscreen can make things worse. Find sunscreen that is formulated to use on your face that won’t cause breakouts.If you’re self-conscious about pimples or redness, use a tinted moisturizer over your SPF to even out your skin tone.A big pair of sunglasses and a cute sunhat can also camouflage period acne.Plus, you’ll look super glamorous.

, It may be the last thing you feel like doing, but exercise is sometimes the best treatment for cramps. The endorphins released by your body will lift your mood and act as a natural pain killer.If you really don’t feel like moving, elevate your feet on a stack of towels or your beach bag to help ease cramping. You can also lie on your stomach and take deep, slow breaths.

, A lot of women are intimidated by tampons before they first try them, but they’re actually very comfortable, easy to wear, and convenient. Practice before you go to the beach (but while you are on your period—trying to wear a tampon when you don’t have your period can be painful and dangerous) so you’re feeling confident by the time you hit the water.


Remember: tampons cannot get lost in your body. If something happens and the string comes off, it’s very easy to get the tampon out. Just make sure you don’t wear your tampon longer than 8 hours and you will be totally fine.
Some women do have difficulty inserting tampons because hymen is too tight or the hole is too small. If you are not able to insert tampon after several tries, see your physician., Make sure it doesn’t have wings, and check in the mirror to make sure it’s not too bulky or visible through your suit.Wear a cute pair of shorts or a sarong around your waist, just in case your pad shows through your bathing suit.

, It’s tricky, and you may end up bleeding in the water anyway, but if you can’t wear a tampon and you’re dying to get into the water, give this a try. When you’re ready to swim, go to the bathroom to remove your pad. Slip on a pair of shorts and hustle back to the water.


Slip out of your shorts and leave them on the sand, then quickly get into the water. It’s not foolproof, but the water may stop your period while you are swimming, or make the flow so light no one will notice.
When you get out, immediately slip your shorts back on, grab a fresh pad, and go to the bathroom to put it in your suit. The pad may have trouble adhering to the wet material, so you may just want to change into panties and keep your shorts on.

Try herbal remedies to reduce menstrual pain: Many herbs (known from many ages) are useful in resolving the pain associated with menstruation; known as dysmenorrhea.",How to Get Rid of Menstrual Cramps," NSAIDs, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, are very effective against pain caused by menstrual cramps. The drug ibuprofen is available over the counter (OTC) in several brand names, including Advil, Genpril, IBU-200, etc. Generic brands, simply called ""Ibuprofen,"" are much less expensive.


Take ibuprofen right away and according to label instructions for your age and/or weight range. You should not exceed 1600mg in a 24 hour period without the supervision of a physician.
If you have any preexisting medical conditions that make you sensitive to NSAIDs, you might want to avoid ibuprofen, as it can thin your blood or cause other complications.
Products like Midol, which are specifically designed for menstrual pain, contain acetaminophen. These products can cause kidney damage, but are an effective alternative for people sensitive to ibuprofen.;
, Doctors recommend using heat as a way to relieve pain associated with menstrual cramping, as well as helping the cramps subside themselves. There are a couple different courses of home treatments you can follow:


Get a hot water bottle and apply it to the stomach or lower abdomen. Wait 15 to 20 minutes to see if cramps have gotten better.
If that doesn't work, try taking a hot bath with a cup or more of Epsom salts, which are a mild muscle relaxer. Submerge your body fully underneath the Epsom salts and keep the water hot by turning the faucet on, if necessary.

, A couple days before your period is set to begin, make sure you're getting enough vitamins, as well as the right kind of vitamins. These include:


Vitamin E. Take 500 International Units (IU’s) of vitamin E per day, continuing it through the first couple days of bleeding.Some evidence (although not scientifically rigorous) suggests that vitamin B1, vitamin B6, and fish oil supplements may help people tame their punishing periods., Studies show that those who perform regular exercise have less menstrual pain.Even if it's just 30 minutes of walking fives times a week, moderate exercise is better than no exercise at all.

, While the scientific link between xenoestrogens, phytoestrogens and cramping is weak, scientists do know that xenoestrogens and phytoestrogens cause a significant health risk and should be avoided if possible.The thought about xenoestrogens and phytoestrogen and cramping is this: they cause magnesium and vitamin B deficiencies, and these kinds of deficiencies may result in cramps.

, Birth control causes your uterine lining to thin out. When your uterine lining is thinned out by the time your period rolls around, there's less chance of significant shedding, and of contractions. For painful periods, your doctor might recommend starting birth control.


Talk to your doctor about a special version of the pill that causes menstrual cycles every three months instead of every month. Although you may experience some unexpected spotting in between, this three-month alternative could be a good option if periods are putting you (literally) on your back.

, An injectable form of contraception might also be beneficial in reducing the pain associated with menstrual cramping. This injection is given every three months at the doctor's office, and — like the pill — also thins out the lining of the uterus. Many people have significantly reduced bleeding after six months of use.

, This is another form of contraception, and the hormonal IUD significantly reduces the pain associated with menstrual cramping., They may not seem like much, but they are definitely doctor-recommended:


Lie down, raise your feet, and try to rest for at least 20 minutes. Rest is a natural painkiller.
Gently stretch. Try the sphinx pose in yoga for a targeted stretch.
Stay away from cigarettes and alcohol. Aside being bad for you for different reasons, these may make your period particularly horrid.
Massage your lower back or abdomen. Or better yet, have someone else do it for you!

, If your period is making you feel like you want to roll up in a ball and forget the world, definitely see a doctor. On many occasions, patients with dysmenorrhea, or severe cramping, consult a doctor and find that they have another condition that is making the pain worse.Often, this condition is called endometriosis, where the lining of the uterus is actually found outside the uterus. If you are uncertain of why your period hurts so much, and can't seem to find an answer to persistent pain, definitely see a doctor.

, Scientific research on these herbs also supports their effectiveness in reducing the severity of menstrual pain. An Ayurvedic consultant can guide you for effective combination of these herbs and the method of preparing a formulation, to control your agonizing menstrual pain.


Saraca Ashoka: Studies suggest that this herbal remedy is useful in various gynecological disorders including dysmenorrhea. Nardostachys jatamansi: Studies suggest that this herbal remedy may relieve pain associated with menses. Zingiber officinale: Studies suggest that this herbal remedy may be beneficial in reducing the pain due to dysmenorrhea. "

Face the facts.,
Remember that a girl's blood flow during her period can range from extremely heavy to very light.,
Remember that you can't stop your period.,
Take the right medicines to help with cramps.,
Avoid getting in a crabby mood or having a bad attitude.,
Do your best no matter what.,
Exercise.",How to Handle a Period While Cheerleading," Your period is something that will come whether you want it to or not. You can't force it to stop, and you can't force it to start. No amount of medicines or injections will help you with that. What you need to do is learn how to manipulate it.;
, You need to be able to identify how your blood flow is during your period every month to know what you need to wear (pad, tampon, panty liner, etc).


If you have a heavy blood flow, a thick pad or tampon should be worn. If you are afraid of your tampon leaking (which can easily happen while you're jumping and tumbling in cheerleading), wear a panty liner with your tampon so it doesn't leak in your underwear.
If you have a medium blood flow, a thinner pad or a tampon should be used. Girls with medium blood flows usually don't have problems with this if they change their tampons every couple of hours, but if you are afraid of it leaking, you should wear a panty liner with it. #*If you have a light blood flow, you should use a panty liner. Panty liners come in different shapes, sizes, and thicknesses, so you just need to select one that makes you feel comfortable. However, tampons are recommended for all types of blood flows when playing a sport or being active.

, Your period will come when it comes and leave when it leaves. There aren't any medicines, injections, surgeries, foods, or anything else that can make your period stop. Anyone who tells you that there are certain remedies to make your period stop, is not telling the truth.

, Most girls do not want to cheer on their football team or lead their competition team to the championships when they are sulking over painful cramps. A pain-relieving pill will do the trick and make those cramps decrease in pain. Ibuprofen, Tylenol, and Advil are examples of medicines that help with cramps. However, while you may feel better, these medications increase blood flow for the duration of your period. Try to avoid this if you already have a heavy blood flow.

, Part of being a cheerleader is going out on the field and cheering on your team. Having your period should not change the passion you have for your team and the activity you love doing. If it does, you should consider whether being a cheerleader is really the right sport/physical activity for you.


If you find yourself in a swirl of mood swings and negative attitudes, do something to relax you before your competition or game. Take a nice, hot bath, read your favorite book, tan in the backyard, take a nap, go for a bike ride, or do anything else that will relax your body and mind. Then, by the time your game or competition begins, you won't be nearly as stressed out.

, Sometimes, as humans, we just need to take a break once in a while. Unfortunately, when you commit to a sports team or extracurricular activity, you are bound to stay supportive to it. You have committed yourself to your cheerleading squad; do not let your period get the best of you! Have some fun and stay positive, and soon enough, you'll forget you even have your period! Just remember to change your pad or tampon every 2-4 hours to prevent leaking and odor (pads with deodorant in them do not lessen or mask odor, they only make it worse.)

, In a recent study and survey, 97% of girls that participate in physical activities regularly say that their blood flow during their period lessens while they are exercising and participating in physical activity. So, in hindsight, it is better to be cheering and chanting on the football field and competition floor than sitting on the sidelines watching.

Additionally, the hormonal changes don’t impact your strength or endurance. So although you may feel tired, heading to the gym might make you feel better. Plus, we all know that exercise releases endorphins that cause happiness, so you’ll probably feel a bit cheerier after your workout as well.If you feel really ill or have extreme cramps, don’t force yourself to exercise. Sometimes when your body is asking for rest, it’s because all it really needs to recover is a bit of rest.
If you’re still not sure about working out, try doing some low-impact exercise for the days you’re on your cycle, and switch back to heavier work when you’re off.;
, Generally, one of the biggest concerns for working out while on your period is ""what if I leak?"" Although you will be moving your body in ways that might cause more of a flow, you can use the right tools to keep your menstrual cycle out of view. Opt for using a menstrual cup or a tampon rather than pads or panty liners; these options will trap the blood before it leaves your body, making it less likely to leak. If you’re still concerned, double up your protection by using a menstrual cup or tampon with a panty liner.


Menstrual cups are much better at preventing leaks than tampons are, but their application may not be comfortable for everyone.
Insert a new tampon just prior to exercising, so that you’ll have a better chance of being leak-free.

, One step up in arming yourself with leak-free protection is wearing the right clothes. Choose pants in a dark color (black always works best). Avoid wearing shorts or anything too tight, as if you do manage to have a leak, it will be much easier to tell in these types of clothing. Look for sweatpants and yoga pants, avoiding leggings and bike shorts. Wear boy-short type panties underneath your workout gear to add an additional layer; thongs and lacy panties won’t do well with the combination of your period and exercise.


Throw on a dark sweatshirt or jacket before you head out; if you have an accident of some sort, you can use the shirt tied around your waist.
Choose loose-fitting tops during your period; tight shirts can show bloating and add pressure on an already-tight stomach.

, It can help ease cramps. But make sure to do it after your other workouts such as strength training.Try a few yoga poses such as the restorative pose, cat pose, and knee-to-chest pose to loosen up your abdominal muscles and reduce cramps.


To accomplish the restorative pose, sit with your legs flattened to the floor and the heels/balls of your feet touching. Then, slowly lay backwards, keeping your feet together and your arms at your sides. Hold this and breathe deeply.
Cat pose is done by crouching on all fours, arching your back, and tucking your head.
Knee-to-chest pose is done exactly how it sounds; lay on your back and bring your knees to your chest, hugging your calves with your arms., Although you can indeed exercise as you normally would on your period, you may not be feeling up to the challenge. Try going for a jog or a brisk walk for thirty minutes, maintaining the same pace and difficulty level the whole time. Avoiding intervals and keeping up this consistent speed will make your exercise more comfortable on a cramped belly and make it seem like you’re doing less work (which is helpful if you’re already tired).

, Although the dress precautions don't apply, swimming is an excellent way to cure your period pains while doing some great exercise. If you’re able, head to the gym and swim some laps for thirty minutes or so. Water is gentle on stiff joints (including your lower back) and helps to massage your stomach while you work. By the end of your swim, you won’t even remember that you’re on your period because you’ll be feeling so good.

, One of the positive side effects of having your period is that you experience a few days of higher pain tolerance as a result of an influx of certain hormones. Therefore, what may normally seem difficult to you may be a bit easier to accomplish on your period. Go through your regular weightlifting routine, or do a bit of leg and arm work and take advantage of your pain-free abilities. Keep in mind that you probably shouldn’t try to do drastically more than what you’re typically capable of doing.


Avoid doing any weightlifting that puts strain on your stomach or back, as this may be more uncomfortable during your period.

, During your period it can be even more important than usual that you don’t get dehydrated, especially while exercising. Drink water throughout your workout, continuing to do so afterwards. Staying hydrated will help to prevent any headaches or exhaustion you might normally have as a side-effect of being on your period, as well."

White peppermint can relieve headaches and grapefruit and lemon are great for bloating., If you’re stressed out, your period symptoms may be even more extreme.

Indulge in something that will make you feel happy, relaxed, and refreshed.

, Many women feel bloated and unattractive during their periods. You can fight that feeling by using your period as an excuse to dress up. Resist the urge to lay around in sweatpants all day.

Whether you’re trying a new restaurant or doing some shopping, put on an outfit that you feel good in, style your hair, and see how much better you feel.

Your period may make you feel drained on some days, and physical symptoms may be worse during some parts of your cycle. Give yourself the excuse to relax on certain days of your menstrual cycle. Make some snacks (bonus points if they’re ones that reduce symptoms), find a movie, and snuggle on the couch for a while. Sometimes the best thing for your body is rest. Don’t feel guilty for vegging out for a couple of hours while you watch something good on TV.

Understand what menstrual cycle is.,
Recognize the first day of your cycle.,
Track your periods for a few months.,
Determine the first day of your next period.",How to Determine First Day of Menstrual Cycle1," Menstruation begins in women's life once they reach puberty and become fertile. The menstrual cycle is divided into separate phases (follicular, ovulation and luteal) and the first day of your cycle describes the luteal phase that involves your uterus shedding its blood-rich lining through the vagina, known as menstruation or a period.Menstrual cycles tend to occur every 21 – 35 days in adult women and 21 – 45 days in younger teenagers. The cycle is counted from the first day of your period to the first day of your next period.
Menstrual cycle is linked to fluctuations in your estrogen levels, luteinizing hormone and follicular stimulating hormone. During the first half your cycle (follicular phase), your body is estrogen-rich and the uterine lining becomes thickened in preparation for implantation of a fertilized egg.
Halfway through your cycle, your ovary releases an egg into your fallopian tube. This phase is known as ovulation. Conception can occur if intercourse happens in the couple days preceding ovulation. If it occurs at the time of ovulation, the chance of pregnancy is small, because their is not enough time for the sperm to travel to the egg.
If an egg released during the ovulation phase does not get fertilized and implant within the lining of the uterus, your progesterone and estrogen levels will drop, causing the uterus to shed its thickened lining during the luteal phase.;
, Understanding the days of your cycle empowers you to make decisions about your health and family planning. To begin determining the first day of your period and the length of your cycle, start by numbering the days of your cycle from the first day of your next period.Day one of your cycle occurs with the start of your period. Thus, mark your calendar with ""X"" on the day your period starts.Bleeding tends to last three to five days on average, but this may fluctuate on individual basis.On the seventh day of your menstrual cycle, bleeding has usually ceased and your ovaries begin to form follicles in preparation for ovulation. This is the result of an increase in estrogen between days four to seven., Tracking your period beginning with day 1 of your cycle helps you to learn general trends in your menstrual cycle and determine the first day of your next period.On average, most adult women have a 28 day menstrual cycle. This means there are 28 days between the first days of your periods.However, your menstrual cycle may be slightly shorter or longer (adult women tend to have cycles that run 21 – 35 days. Thus, it is important your track your periods for a few months to determine the length of your cycle.
As long as you get regular periods at more or less the same cycle interval, then your menstrual cycle is healthy.You can track your menstrual cycle by making a note on a calendar or, if you prefer, you can also use smartphone apps such as iMensiesand Fertility Friend., Establishing your cycle length helps you anticipate when you period will start.Once you have tracked your periods and established your cycle length, you can start marking your calendar to determine the first day of your subsequent periods.
For example, if your cycle length is 28 days, mark your calendar (starting from the first day of your next period) with an “X” for every 28 days — this will represent the first day of your subsequent periods.
If you are taking hormonal birth control pills, you will typically have the 28-day cycle due to the scheduling of the pills. Each pack of pills contains 21 hormonally active pills and seven sugar pills. On the day you run out of hormonally active pills, you typically begin your period. The period lasts the seven days (or less) during which you are eating the sugar pills.If you are taking extended or continuous use hormonal birth control pills, your periods will happen less frequently. Seasonale contains 84 active pills and seven days of inactive pills. In this case you would have a 91 day cycle."

Know that premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is normal.,
Be aware of changes in your mood.,
Notice any gastrointestinal issues.,
Notice any physical changes.,
Know when to see a doctor.",How to Determine First Day of Menstrual Cycle2," Most women experience symptoms one to two weeks before the first day of their period. The symptoms usually go away after you start bleeding.PMS is different for everyone, and it is helpful if you document your symptoms as you track your period.Most women experience at least one PMS symptom as part of their menstrual cycle.Your symptoms can be both physical and emotional.

, Many women experience crying spells, anxiety, mood swings, or depression before their period starts.You also may experience fatigue and irritability. If changes in your mood do not end after your period starts, or you feel like your daily life is being impacted, you need to see your doctor.30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise and strength training two or more days a week can help with depression and fatigue that you may experience., You may experience abdominal bloating, constipation, fluid retention, or diarrhea prior to your period. This can result in weight gain before your period starts.Again, these symptoms should end within four days of your period starting. See a doctor if they continue.


You can limit your salt intake and eat smaller, more frequent meals to alleviate some of the bloating and fluid retention.Taking a diuretic can help your body get rid of excess fluid and reduce bloating and weight gain as well. Medications like Pamprin and Midol contain diuretics.

, Breast tenderness, joint or muscle pain, and headaches are common symptoms.You can take over-the-counter pain medication such as ibuprofen, aspirin, or naproxen to relieve these symptoms.Acne is also a common physical symptom that your period is on the way., If you experience five or more of these symptoms and find that your PMS is keeping you from doing your usual activities, you may have premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Your doctor may prescribe you antidepressants, prescription pain medication, or the Yaz birth control pill to manage your symptoms.Counseling and therapy may also be helpful for dealing with the emotional aspect of PMDD.
You should also see your doctor if your symptoms do not go away after your period starts, or you begin to see a change in the frequency or volume of your symptoms.

Understand when to talk to your doctor about your periods.,
Recognize amenorrhea.,
Find out if you suffer from dysmenorrhea.,
Recognize abnormal vaginal bleeding.,
Understand what causes abnormal periods.,
See a doctor.",How to Determine First Day of Menstrual Cycle3," If you ever have any health concerns regarding your period, make sure you talk to your doctor. You should also consult your doctor if your menstrual cycle is abnormal or becomes abnormal suddenly. Some factors that should warrant a discussion with your doctor include:


If you do not start your period by age 15, you should contact your doctor, as you may have a hormonal imbalance that is affecting the rest of your body as well.If your period is extra painful and you experience very heavy bleeding or bleeding that lasts longer than a week.If your period becomes irregular, delayed, or you have bleeding between established cycles., Amenorrhea is the lack of a menstrual period. Women should start having periods by the age of 15 and if you or your daughter has not received their first period by the age of 15, consult your doctor.If you have missed your period for more than three cycles after having regular periods, you may be experiencing secondary amenorrhea. Secondary amenorrhea may be a symptom of polycystic ovary syndrome.The most common cause of secondary amenorrhea is pregnancy.
Amenorrhea may result if you are unhealthy and your body is not able to support a regular period. This may be because of excessive stress, a hormonal disorder, or an eating disorder.If your amenorrhea is hormonally linked, then your fertility may be at risk. Talk to your doctor right away, especially if you are concerned that you suffer from polycystic ovaries., Dysmenorrhea is a condition in which periods are unbearably painful. You may be able to take over-the-counter medication, such as ibuprofen, to ease very painful cramping but if this condition continues, consult your doctor.In teens and younger women, dysmenorrhea is often caused by an excessive amount of prostaglandin. You may be able to regulate the amount of this hormone in your body by eating a healthy diet and maintaining a healthy weight most of the time.In more mature women, dysmenorrhea may manifest due to a serious medical condition such as endometriosis,fibroids, or adenomyosis., You should know what a normal period feels like if you have had regular periods in the past. Keep an eye out for abnormal bleeding. Talk to a doctor immediately if you have irregular bleeding.


Discomfort and bleeding after sex are serious signs of possible medical conditions. Make sure you talk to your doctor if any sexual activity or intercourse results in bleeding.Spotting between periods and heavy bleeding during your period can result in discomfort and are also warning signs that you need to heed., Different factors can lead to abnormal periods. Maintaining a healthy weight and seeing your doctor about possible illnesses help you to have normal periods.


Dysfunctional ovaries can lead to hormonal dysfunction and cause you to have abnormal periods. Polycystic ovary syndrome and premature ovarian insufficiency are two examples.Abnormalities in your reproductive structures caused by disease or infection can also cause you to have abnormal periods. Have your doctor check you out for endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or uterine fibroids.High stress, low body weight, and eating disorders take a large toll on your body and can disturb normal menstrual cycle., You should have annual pelvic exams to ensure that any menstrual irregularities are diagnosed as soon as possible. Tracking your period and monitoring your symptoms can help your doctor diagnose you properly and create a treatment plan.Your doctor may prescribe you oral contraceptives or progesterone to treat your menstrual irregularities."

Know that there’s no medical proof that tampons cause more cramping than pads.",How to Ease Menstrual Pain," Drinking water can keep your body from retaining water, which will help you avoid bloating during your period. Drinking hot or warm water can be even better for your period than cold water, because hot liquids can increase the blood flow to your skin and can help relax your cramped muscles. Make sure to get at least 10 8-ounce glasses of water in your diet, if not more. You can also add additional water to your diet by eating foods that are water-based. Here are some foods that you can make sure to eat during your period to increase hydration:Lettuce
Celery
Strawberries
Cucumbers
Watermelon;
, It’s important to have enough calcium in your diet, regardless of whether or not it’s your time of the month. That said, it’s especially important to pay attention to your calcium intake during your period, because having enough calcium can reduce the cramps you may feel during menstruation. Try these foods, which are rich in calcium, to ease your pain:Dairy products such as cheese, yogurt, and milk
Sesame seeds
Leafy green vegetables, such as spinach, turnips, or kale
Almonds
Soy milk

, If you have poor nutrition, then you’ll be suffering from deficiencies that get worse during your time of the month. It’s important, therefore, to have plenty of foods that are packed with important vitamins so your body stays strong during your time of the month. Here are some foods that you can try:Brown rice (full of vitamin B6, which helps reduce bloating)
Almonds, walnuts, and pumpkin seeds (contain manganese, which helps with cramps)
Olive oil and broccoli (rich in vitamin E)
Leafy greens, fish, and chicken (they have iron, which can help make up for iron lost during your period).
Cinnamon is also rich in iron, and so are papayas.
Add some ginger to your diet. It has the potential to alleviate menstrual pain.
Avoid foods with fake sugar and eat foods with natural sugars, like strawberries, instead.

, You’re likely to already feel a bit extra bloated when you’re on your period, so this would be a good time to avoid foods that cause you to retain water and feel extra bloated. These include fatty foods, grains, and carbonated beverages, so you should ease up on the following foods and drinks:Soda
French fries
Burgers
Beans
Whole grains
Lentils
Apricots
Cabbage

, Cutting down on your caffeine intake can help you relieve the tension that you’re feeling and minimize your cramps. Instead of your usual coffee, have a small cup of tea, or even replace your black tea with non-caffeinated tea such as ginger tea or chamomile. Caffeine can also make you dehydrated, which can lead your body to retain more water and can make you feel more bloated.If you’re really addicted to caffeine, you shouldn’t do away with it during your time of the month all together or you may experience headaches or other pain from withdrawal.

, The foods associated with Vitamin D include the following:Fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, or mackerel
Orange juice
Soy milk
Cereal
Cheese
Egg yolk

, There is more and more research that suggests that herbal remedies may have real medicinal benefits. One of these studies, performed by the American Chemical Society, showed that women who drink chamomile tea during their periods have higher levels of hippurate, which is a natural anti-inflammatory that has the power to ease the pain associated with period pain. If you’re looking for a way to ease your menstrual pain without taking over-the-counter medication, then chamomile tea may do the trick.This tea can also be soothing at night and can make you get to sleep more peacefully.

, Applying heat to your lower abdomen or lower back can help relax the contracting muscles in your uterus, which cause much of the pain associated with your period. You can use a regular water bottle or thermos filled with hot water, or you can invest in an over-the-counter heating pad or patch that can help alleviate your menstrual pain. They may cost over $20, but the investment can be worth it if you’re in a lot of pain.Just spending 5-10 minutes applying heat to your body twice a day can make a big impact.

, Taking a warm bath may also provide some of the same relief you may feel when you apply heat to your lower abdomen and back to ease menstrual cramps. You can try taking a warm bath in addition to treating your body with heat in order to ease your menstrual pain. At worst, it will at least help you relax, which can help ease cramping throughout your body., When you’re on your period, then exercising may seem about as appealing as putting your hand in a beehive. However, making an effort to exercise, even if you’re just going for a short walk, while you’re on your period, can actually reduce the cramps and pain that you’re feeling. This is because aerobic exercise makes your body pump more blood, which lets it release endorphins to counteract the prostaglandins in your body, reducing your cramps and pain.In fact, having a steady exercise routine throughout the month can make your period less painful when that time of the month comes.

, Though any moderate exercise can help relief your menstrual pain, you may want to try some specific exercises that may help ease your pain. Here’s what you can do:Sit on the floor with your legs as far apart as they will go. Reach for your toes and ankles while keeping your back straight, while holding in your diaphragm. Take a few deep breaths and bend toward the floor when you exhale for the last time.
Sit with your knees open and bent at the sides, with the soles of your feet together. Place your hands under your toes or place your hands around your ankles. Press the soles of your feet together while breathing in with your back straight, lifting your head a bit as you breathe in and out 4-5 times. You may know this position as the butterfly.
Lie on your back with your legs straight out, and bend one knee and pull it up to your chin. Hug your knee with both hands and hold the position for 1-2 minutes; then, repeat on the other side.

, Not emptying your bladder when you feel the urge to urinate can cause pain in your bladder, and can make your cramps feel even worse. Even if you’re in a significant amount of pain and don’t want to leave your bed for the afternoon, making sure to empty your bladder regularly can help you ease your menstrual pain. Since hydrating is an important aspect of staying healthy during your period, you may even have to empty your bladder more frequently than normal., Medication can also ease the pain associated with your period. While you don’t want to get in the habit of regularly taking it unless you really need it, it can prove to be a powerful antidote to your period pain. Make sure you talk to your doctor if you plan on taking these medications regularly so you can make sure they are right for your body. You can consider taking the following over-the-counter medications to ease your pain:An acetaminophen, such as Tylenol
NSAIDs (Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs) such as Ibuprofen such as Advil or Motrin, or Naproxens, such as Aleve or Naprosyn
Aspirin, such as Bayer or Bufferin

, A study with 944 participants showed that acupuncture may potentially ease the symptoms of dysmenorrhea, which is commonly known as period pain, which include vomiting, nausea, and cramping. Though further research needs to be done with a larger number of participants, the study does suggest that acupuncture may ease the pain of period pain and has no adverse effects. If you’re looking for an original and innovative solution for your pain, this treatment may just do the trick.Even though there’s no guarantee that this will work, it’s worth giving it a shot, especially if you feel like you’ve tried everything else.

, Birth control has been proven to reduce cramps in many women. If you’re not on the birth control pill, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about taking it. You may think that they are only for sexually active women, when in fact, birth control can be taken to reduce cramps and other menstrual pain, as well as to regulate your period. If your menstrual pain is very severe, then you may want to consider this option.There are some risks associated with the birth control pill as well, such as a small increased risk of cancer, and raised cholesterol levels and blood pressure.

, Though you may have heard a rumor that tampons cause more cramping than pads, there is absolutely no proof that this is the case. If tampons are hurting you, then there may be some other reason, and you should talk to your doctor about it, but the fact that pads cause less pain than tampons is just a plain myth.


You can see for yourself. Try wearing a pad instead of a tampon for a day and you’ll find that there’s really no difference.

Choose smaller tampons and thinner pads when possible.,
Bring lots of zippered plastic storage bags and stay organized.,
Pack out your used tampons or pads.",How to Deal With Your Period While Camping1," While women's menstrual flows vary, select the most streamlined products that will work for you. You'll save space packing and generate a smaller volume of trash.Consider using non-applicator tampons. Non-applicator tampons take up far less storage space. Instead of a bulky applicator, the only extra waste involved is a small cellophane wrapper. Practice using this style of tampon prior to your trip so you feel confident using them.Recognize that if you're backpacking, you'll need to pack carefully and consider leaving an item or two of your usual gear at home to make room for sanitary supplies.Use unscented, unbleached products both to deter wildlife and to keep yourself healthy. Toxic shock syndrome and other infections can occur when chemicals used in manufacturing alter your body's natural pH.;
, Place unused tampons or pads in one storage bag. Stow used items and toilet paper in smaller bags, then consolidate into one larger ""trash"" bag. Freezer bags are especially good for this purpose as they are manufactured from thicker, more durable plastic.


Store used materials away from food when possible, but remember that these items are now ""scented."" Scientists have determined that myths about bears being especially attracted to menstrual blood are false. You need not worry that bears will be more interested in your used sanitary items than in any other scented item you might be carrying.That said, it's a good idea to hang used products with or alongside food in a bear bag or use a bear canister. Double-bagging your waste in plastic will help you maintain good hygiene.If you dislike using disposable zippered plastic bags, consider investing in a dry-bag such as those used by cloth-diapering parents. These washable lined bags function similarly to a zippered plastic bag.

, Never bury your used products or place them in composting toilets. Store your waste and carry it home with you if proper trash receptacles are not available.

"
"
Purchase a properly sized menstrual cup.,
Dispose of the blood collected in your cup in a 6-8 inch deep ""cat hole."",
Wash your menstrual cup with warm soap and water whenever possible.",How to Deal With Your Period While Camping2," Menstrual cups are made of silicone formed into a cup with holes around the rim and a small stem. Because they are reusable you won't need to pack around extra supplies or waste. Different brands are sized differently, but generally fall into the categories of small and large, or pre- and post-pregnancy. Wash your cup with unscented soap and water, then practice inserting the cup per package directions.


Note you can insert your menstrual cup before your period begins to avoid surprise bleeding.Menstrual cups are safe to use while sleeping, eliminating the need for potentially bulky pads.
Cups may be used for up to 10-12 hours at a stretch, making them a useful option on long hikes.

, Be careful to bury waste at least 200 feet from your camp, the trail, and any water sources to avoid contamination. Alternatively, if you are car camping or staying in a location with a composting toilet, the waste from your cup may simply be poured down the toilet., Bring along wet wipes to cleanse your hands, as well. Remember to wash your hands both before and after inserting the cup to avoid introducing bacteria that could cause infection."
"
Purchase a sea sponge.,
Invest in reusable pads made from thick flannel.,
Ensure your hands are clean before and after using any product.",How to Deal With Your Period While Camping3," Natural sea sponges can work like disposable tampons. Clean sponges intended for this purpose are sold through various health supply stores. Cut the sponge to size and then insert like a tampon. Rinse the sponge daily. This solution is slightly messier than using a menstrual cup but is an all-natural, reusable product. Like menstrual cups, sea sponges are safe to use while sleeping., These are typically sold as ""moon pads"" and are especially good for nighttime use. Reusable pads are easily washed, dried, and reworn, eliminating waste on the trail, although you will need to use a zippered plastic bag or other solution to store soiled pads between washes. They also take up space in a pack, so consider your weight and space requirements carefully if you're planning to use reusable pads on a backpacking excursion., This advice applies to both reusable and disposable products, but hygiene becomes especially significant when you are washing and reusing the same equipment multiple times. Washing before you use a product is just as important as cleaning your hands afterward. Doing so keeps bacteria away from this sensitive region of your body. Urinary tract infections and yeast infections are never fun, but they're especially important to avoid when you're out camping and away from medical help."
"
Pack pain relief medication.,
Drink plenty of fluids.,
Apply warmth to your lower back or abdomen.,
Wear darker colored pants or shorts.,
Remember that exertion may impact the predictability of your monthly cycle.Prepare for surprises -- pack extra supplies or bring along your reusable product so you aren't caught off-guard if your period comes early.

",How to Deal With Your Period While Camping4," Be sure to bring ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin or naproxen on your trip. You'll be prepared to treat any cramps you might experience and continue to enjoy your camping excursion. Remember that pain relief medication works most efficiently when it does not need to ""catch up"" to the pain. If you regularly experience menstrual cramping, plan a dosage schedule to ensure your cramps are continuously treated., Dehydration can increase menstrual pain. If you're taking pain relief medication, you'll need sufficient water both to ensure the medicine works properly and to dilute it so your stomach does not become upset.

, A hot water bottle is ideal, but a heated towel can provide similar pain relief if you're having cramps. Consider boiling a towel and wrapping it in another towel or a bag to soothe and warm your aching muscles.

, Darker clothing is less likely to show evidence of spotting and will help you feel more confident about camping while on your period. If spotting does occur, it is easier to rinse minor stains out of dark clothing than to eliminate spots on light fabric.


Consider packing an on-the-go stain remover. These products require little or no water and can remove minor stains.

Mark on your calendar the dates you wish to not have a period and then look ahead to see if you expect your period at this time.,
Use birth control pills to delay your period.,
Take the ""active pills"" for longer than 21 days.,
Adjust your birth control regimen earlier.,
Try extended-cycle birth control pills.,
Ask your doctor for a norethisterone prescription.,
Consider a a progestin intrauterine device (IUD).",How to Delay Your Period1," For women with regular menstrual cycles, or who are already on the pill, they should know pretty much exactly when their next period is coming.


You can then determine if your menstrual cycle will occur on the days you don't want it to. If a conflict exists, don't worry as you can avoid having your period on that day, as long as you plan for it in advance!
Note that for women with irregular menstrual cycles, it is not always possible to know in advance when your next period will occur.;
, Most birth control pills come in packs of 21 active pills (containing hormones), followed by seven inactive pills (placebo or ""sugar pills""). The pills are packaged this way to help keep you in your ""routine"" of taking one pill a day, while allowing a withdrawal bleed (a period) during the days of inactive pills. You are then instructed to repeat the cycle every month: 21 days of active pills, followed by seven days of inactive pills. However, if you have an important sporting event coming up, or a reason you want to delay your period, you can use your birth control pills to do so. Here's how:It is not required that you follow the exact routine of 21 active pills followed by seven inactive pills. The ratio of 21 to seven is quite arbitrary. It was meant to mimic a woman's natural menstrual cycle of approximately 28 days, but it by no means essential to follow this ratio all of the time.

, For the duration of time you are on the active pills, your body should not have a period. This works most of the time for most women. However, do not count on it being 100% effective as some women's bodies don't respond to such a ""sudden"" change in their birth control regimen.If it is a ""last-minute realization"" that you want to delay your period, your best bet is to keep taking the ""active pills"" all the way from day 21 through to when the event is over. Then stop the active pills and take the seven inactive pills to allow a withdrawal bleed.
If you do this, most doctors advise to throw out the partially used pack of birth control pills (the pack you took the ""extra"" pills from to get you through to the important event). This way, you will not lose count in future cycles of using the birth control pill. The way the pills are packaged (normally with 21 active pills and seven inactive ones) is key for most women to keep track of how many pills they have taken and when they are supposed to take each kind.

, A more ""certain"" way to delay your period would be to begin adjusting your birth control regimen earlier — as in, a few months before the event for which you are trying to avoid having a period. If you make the switch earlier (by taking more active pills in an earlier month and then continuing the once a month routine), you body will have plenty of time to adjust to the change.To do this, you will need to look at your calendar well in advance. If, for instance, you notice that in four months you need to delay your period by 10 days, extend the length of time you are taking your active pills by 10 days during your current cycle, instead of just during the month you need to skip your period.
Then take the seven inactive pills.
By making the change a few months in advance (for instance, competitive athletes may do this if an important event like provincials or nationals is coming up) you give your body the very best chance of adjusting and of not having any period concerns on your big day.

, If you're interested in skipping or delaying your period for longer periods rather than just a week or month, some birth control pills are designed to lengthen times between periods. Most of them give you a period once every three months rather than once a month. These methods are called continuous dosing or extended cycle.Extended cycle birth control pills are meant to be taken continuously for a period of weeks. Most brands are taken for 12 weeks at a time.Because this does alter your hormone balance (having a period once every three months rather than once a month), it is important to speak to your doctor to confirm that this is a healthy choice for you. Generally speaking, there should be no problem if you have been approved to take the birth control pill in the first place.

, If you're not comfortable taking birth control pills or are unable to do so, your doctor can prescribe a hormone tablet called norethisterone. You take norethisterone pills three times a day in the days leading up to your period.Norenthisterone is a progesterone hormone. Progesterone levels drop in the time leading up to your period, causing the lining of the uterus to shed and your period to begin. Keeping the levels high before your period can delay or stop menstruation.Side effects may include bloating, upset stomach, breast discomfort, and reduced sex drive., If you know well in advance that you want to skip your period, you may want to talk to your doctor about a progestin IUD. Your doctor will insert the IUD — a small, plastic t-shaped device —into your uterus. The IUD will release progestin and may lead to your period being lighter or may stop it completely.IUDs last five to seven years.

"
Discuss any changes to your lifestyle with a doctor.,
Make sure you're protected against pregnancy.,
Use protection for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).",How to Delay Your Period2," If you're going to be altering your existing birth control plan or workout routine, always talk to your doctor ahead of time. For instance, it's usually safe to manipulate how you take your birth control to delay your period. However, you should ask your doctor about occasionally delaying your period when you are prescribed birth control, and see if she thinks it's safe for you given your health and medical history.

, Delaying your period is not a means to guard against pregnancy. Unless you are on birth control pills or have a device like an IUD, you are not protected against pregnancy because you managed to miss or delay your menstrual period. Use protection (like condoms) and know the common signs of pregnancy. If you deliberately delay or miss a period, it may be harder to tell if you're pregnant as a missed period is usually the first sign. Pregnancy can also be marked by breast tenderness, fatigue, and nausea. Watch for signs of pregnancy and take a pregnancy test if you have any symptoms., Skipping the inactive pills if you're on a 28-day pack should not decrease the overall effectiveness of your existing birth control. However, birth control pills do not protect against STIs, so unless you and your partner have both been tested, you should still use condoms."

Reframe your mindset about your period.,
Keep track of your period.,
Keep feminine hygiene products with you at all times.,
Eat iron-rich foods.",How to Deal With Your Period1," Many women dread the arrival of their period and think of it as something they have to suffer through. During your menstrual cycle, the actual hormones in your brain change and can affect your mood, but you can also consciously change the way you think about your period.It can be empowering to think of your period as a symbol of your womanhood and as natural part of your life.


Your first period, called menarche, is often celebrated as a young girl’s entrance into womanhood.When you realize that your period can be something that is celebrated, you might stop dreading its arrival and cope with it.;
, Tracking your menstrual cycle will not only give you a heads-up when your period is due, but it can also help you know when you are fertile and can get pregnant.Getting your period unexpectedly can leave you feeling unprepared and stressed. You can keep track of the day your period starts and end with a calendar, in a journal, or with an app for your mobile devices.


There are several apps, such as Strawberry Pal or Clue, that can help you track your period and set reminders for when your next cycle is about to start.
Remember that during your first year, periods are often unpredictable and come at random. They can also skip. This is completely normal. However, after the first year, your period should begin to follow a more regular pattern and be easier to track.
Menstrual cycles vary between women. They can last anywhere from 21 to 35 days, and your period may last two to seven days. Your period may be regular and occur at the same time each month, or it may be irregular.Keeping track of your period is very important when you are sexually active. It helps you to determine when you are the most fertile, which is important to know whether you want to avoid pregnancy or when you want to become pregnant., Keep an extra tampon, panty liner, or pad in your purse, backpack, and car. This way, if you get your period and you do not have access to other feminine products you are still protected. This is especially important if your periods are irregular and you are not able to accurately predict when your next period will begin.

Balloon therapy: A balloon filled with fluid is attached to a catheter and inserted in the uterus. This water is heated, causing it to erode the endometrial tissue.

The patient will usually have to stay in the hospital for approximately four days following the procedure for observation. Once discharged, it is important that the patient takes it slow and avoids heavy lifting for a number of weeks, until they are fully recovered.

They've been through it too, so there's no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed, and you may need some extra help to understand the signs because of your visual disability.


If you have no female relative that you're close to, talk to your doctor or an older female friend for more assistance.
Consider researching more about puberty for girls in health or medical websites or books. It usually will provide diagrams and pictures about the signs of your body growing, which can be useful if you need a closer look. Find books or sites that have large diagrams to suit your visual needs, or use a magnifying glass to look more carefully., Sanitary napkins (pads) are your best choice when you're just starting your first period and have a visual disability. If you're visually impaired, pads may be the best option to control your menstrual blood since they're the easiest to use. If you're a heavy bleeder, you may want to consider picking out large, thick pads, but if you're a light bleeder, period panties might work best.Pay attention to how much blood comes out; you'll feel it when you sit down, move, or use the bathroom. You'll also want to keep a pack of wet wipes to clean yourself thoroughly after using the toilet.Consider using thick pads the first few days of your period, but then using period panties on the last few days because of your menstrual blood decreasing.
Try using pads that do not have wings on them, as these are less complex to use if you are blind or visually impaired.Once you have experience using pads, you may want consider using tampons or menstrual cups. These are more complex to use, but they last longer and can be used if you participate in sports such as swimming., If you're starting to notice the signs of your period coming, it doesn't hurt to practice, so you're prepared. Practicing will make it easier when your period comes so you'll know how to cope when it arrives, especially with your visual disability. You may want to adjust the bathroom to make the process easier, such as changing the lights so you can see more clearly, putting the trash bin near you, having wet wipes and pads nearby, etc.Practice using clean sanitary napkins by:Pulling your pants down to your knees, using your fingers to guide you by pulling them down.
Unwrap the pad by tearing open the plastic wrapper.
On the sanitary pad, pull the wrapping open by placing your index finger underneath it and pulling it up, allowing the tab to come up on its own.
Unwrap the pad completely, and tear it off the wrapping (save this part for disposal).
Take out the pad and place it in the middle part of your underwear, between the two tactile seams.
Unfold the rest of the pad and gently stick it to your underwear. Press it down firmly so that it sticks to your underwear. Pull your underwear and pants up.
Practice removing the pad as well by grabbing the top part of the pad, taking it off, folding it gently, and then placing it in the discarded wrapper from the pad. Ensure you throw it away in the trash bin that's next to you.

, When your period has arrived, the odor will smell different from normal vaginal discharge and the amount will increase. When you use the bathroom, you'll feel a draft on your wet undergarment. If you're visually impaired and can see slightly, you will notice that the menstrual blood is darker than the vaginal discharge. These are all signs of your period, and you will need to change your clothing and wear a sanitary napkin immediately once you've spot these signs., Ask questions and share concerns with other female relatives. You may be baffled about your period on how you can cope with it, especially with your visual disability. Talk to a trusted female relative about any question or concerns you may have about your body, such as your mother, aunt, grandmother, older sister, or older cousin. They've been through it too so there's no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed, and you may need some extra guidance to understand and cope because of your visual impairments, which is okay. They'll be there to help you and support you, and will be there if you're confused about your period.

, If your pad feels very wet, sticky, damp, or heavy, it's probably full. If it feels uncomfortable, and it's been a few hours, you might want to change the pad to prevent leaks. Change your pad every two to three hours for the first few days, and every six or so hours on the last few days.

, You may find your period easier to cope with if you wear comfortable clothing, such as loose, cozy pants or comfortable shirts. Comfortable clothing helps make bathroom visits easier and most people with visual impairments prefer pants that are easy to pull off and on during their period., Pain, such as headaches and stomach cramping, is common within periods. You may want to take painkillers such as ibuprofen to decrease the pain. It may also help to lay down with a heating pad or hot water bottle and placing it on the lower part of stomach, where you're feeling the cramps.Drinking tea, massaging yourself with essential oils, and eating foods with magnesium (such as dark chocolate) can also help lessen the pain in your cramps.In the UK, it is the law that all medication is labeled in Braille;however, if you can't read Braille, ask a trusted adult for help before taking medication.

, If your period is heavy or you don't change your pad often enough, you might experience a leak, when menstrual blood leaks through onto your underwear and possibly your trousers. If you feel a warm, wet feeling against your bottom, past where the pad ends, or at the front, you might have had a leak. If you aren't sure, it's best to ask a trusted adult or friend so you know what's going on, especially before you head out to public places. You can avoid leaks by changing your pad whenever it's full, and using thick, absorbent pads if necessary.If you're using tampons, it's better to avoid using very absorbent tampons to prevent leaks, even if your flow is heavy. If you use absorbent tampons, you'll often leave the tampon in longer, and leaving a tampon in for too long can result in toxic shock syndrome, which is a bacterial infection that can be fatal if left untreated.Use a less absorbent tampon and change your tampon more frequently, instead; it will still prevent leaks.

, Whenever your period comes, mark it on a calendar. This can help you estimate when your next period will start so you can be ready for it, and prevent accidental leaks from occurring. Organize and find a calendar that suits your visual needs by:


Choosing a calendar with jumbo letters and numbers.
Placing a tactile mark or small strip of Velcro on the day of your period.
Placing a pom-pom on the days of your period.
Finding a calendar in Braille, if you can read it.
Be aware that when you first start your period, it can be hard to estimate when your period will arrive, since the first few periods are often irregularly timed. However, as you grow older, your periods will become more regular, which makes tracking them a good idea. The average time between periods usually ranges from between 21 and 45 days for younger teens., Dealing with a period can be frustrating, nerve-wracking, and just plain annoying. You may find yourself being more easily irritated and pretty anxious as well. Do activities that you find calming and relaxing, such as:


Reading a good book
Engaging yourself into a hobby you enjoy
Listening to music or calming sounds such as white noise
Drawing or doodling
Exercising or participating in a sport
Doing yoga
Talking to a friend
Cuddling with your pet

, When you're having your period, you may want to shower and bathe more, since the warm water eases and relaxes cramps. Practicing good hygiene can also prevent unwanted bacteria caused by your menstrual blood, so showering more often is recommended., Periods are natural. It's your body preparing for pregnancy, even if you don't plan to have a baby. There's no shame in having your period, so if you're not feeling well, or you have no pads, don't be afraid to let someone know so they can get you what products you'll need and the support as well.

, Having your period at school can be frustrating, but it's important to deal with it calmly and normally. You may worry about changing your pad in the school bathrooms, but the same routine of removing and discarding your pad is the same at school. Keep several pads in your backpack to last the whole day. You may also want to carry wet wipes to clean yourself, as well.


Talk to your school nurse. Leaks and accidents do happen, and there may be some medical concerns. Talk to your school nurse about any concerns you may have with your period to ensure everything is okay with your body. They may also have tips to cope with your period when you have a visual disability.
Create a period kit with a female relative so you can be prepared. When you have your period, a special kit with plenty of products such as pads, wet wipes, napkins, and an extra pair of underwear or pair of clothes can be useful if a leak happens.
If you suffer from cramps or pain from your period, storing painkillers in your backpack might be a good idea. However, be sure your school allows this; if you think you might get in trouble for having medication with you, see if you can store it with your school nurse, instead.

, Your doctor and visual therapist would be glad to share some tips, techniques, and methods on how you can cope with your period, both physically and emotionally. They may also suggest certain medication to keep away pain or anxiety, depending on the way you feel. Some may also suggest different products.


Feel free to ask questions about your menstrual cycle to your doctor or visual therapist. Asking questions is normal and very important, especially if you find something medically wrong with your body. It's better to be safe than sorry and ask ahead of time to ensure there's not anything serious going on.

, Connect with the Blind and Visually Impaired community by talking to girls with visual impairments, who experience and deal with periods as well. They most likely have similar challenges when it comes to their menstrual cycle and would be glad to share some tips on they cope with their challenges. It can also be comforting to know that you're not the only one, and that there are people with a visual disability that deal with their period monthly, too.

, After your first period, you will learn what and how your menstrual cycle feels like, and you'll most likely understand the first signs when it's about to happen. Often your gut feeling is correct, so if you feel like your period is coming soon, it probably is. Accidents and leaks may occur, but that's normal and it happens to almost everybody, even to those who are sighted. You will improve and the process will most definitely get easier, too, with some more experience and practice. It does get better; hang in there!

Use a menstrual cup.,
Change pads or tampons frequently.,
Avoid using scented pads or tampons.",How to Deal With Menstrual Odour1," If you’re used to tampons or pads, it may be a bit of a switch to use menstrual cups, but they are linked to less odor than either tampons or pads. Menstrual cups are often available at local pharmacies and grocery stores. In addition to the benefit of less odor, menstrual cups will save you money and are more environmentally friendly than tampons and disposable pads.Check a doctor before using a menstrual cup if you have an IUD, as it can move the strings out of place.Change the menstrual cup every twelve hours or when you experience leakage.;
, The cause of odor during menstruation is the growth of bacteria or pathogens when the blood stagnates for too long. Make sure you change pads or tampons every four to six hours to avoid stagnation.For lighter days, you may only need 1 to 2 pads or tampons, while on heavier days, you may need 8 to 10., The fragrances used in tampons can disturb the vagina’s pH balance, which can lead to the increase of bad bacteria, which causes the odors in the first place.Scented products can also increase your risk of vaginal infection.There are plenty of non-scented products out there, and some, such as reusable cotton pads, often avoid the toxic chemicals commonly associated with the disposable pads and tampons, though there are some disposable pads and tampons that don't have the harmful chemicals, and may be available in your local health food store."
"
Carry sanitary products, if you are expecting your period.,
Use toilet paper, napkins, or tissues as sanitary protection.,
Buy sanitary products to use from a vending machine or a store.,
Make sure you don't panic, this can make things worse.,
Tell a trusted adult.,
Don't be embarrassed.",How to Deal With an Unexpected Menstruation," Have a change of underwear. Wear a thin, comfy panty liner if you are due on or think you might start, even if the super thin ones will help protect your clothes for a little while, especially if your flow is light. Have a period emergency kit. Remember, all you really have to do is stop the blood making mess of you and your clothes, it's not a huge issue.;
, This is a great way to deal with this situation. Fold a lot of it neatly to what looks like a long pad, the thicker the better and place where you would place a regular pad.

, Ask if your friends can let you have a towel or tampon. Ask for money to borrow to buy some if you have to. If you're in a school, hospital, clinic, gym, hotel, women's prison, community centre or other public building, ask a member of staff, female if you prefer, if there's somewhere you can get a sanitary towel or tampon.

, As soon as you feel liquid or blood dripping down your leg, or you spot some on your pants, don't freak-out, or draw attention to it. If you have a sweatshirt, casually tie it around your waist until you can reach a bathroom, or a private place to inspect what has been stained.

, If you are lucky, your mother should be the one to tell- not your best friend or brother. If your mother isn't there, still do not blurt it out to your friend until you can find a way to fix the problem. You may have to tell a male. Just tell the closest thing to family that is there at the moment, whether it be your uncle, or dad.

, Once you have told the adult and get help, people might end up figuring out what happened. It happens to everyone once in their lifetime. Stand tall and be proud that you handled it the right way.

Take showers daily.,
Don’t douche.,
Avoid scented products.,
Check with your doctor.",How to Deal With Menstrual Odour2," Avoid fragrances or harsh soaps, as these can irritate the vagina. Use a gentle soap and your hands to clean the vaginal area. This will also reduce the sweat in the area, which can increase the menstrual odor.You may want to shower more than once on heavier days.


Don’t wash the inside of your vagina. Wash only the vulva area, which is the outer part of your vagina.

, Douching disrupts the natural bacterial balance in the vagina. It has also been linked to numerous health problems including yeast infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and problems during pregnancy.Normal showers and changing of pads, tampons, or cups can help mitigate foul odors.

, Scented products can cause irritation in the vagina, and lead to a bacterial imbalance. This includes feminine wipes and spray deodorizers. They can also decrease the vagina’s natural protection against infections. As bacteria is typically the cause of menstrual odor, it is important to avoid these products.If you wish to wear a perfume or fragrance, try ones that go on your wrist or neck, as they do not have the same concerns as vaginal fragrances.

, If the odor is persistent or accompanied by an unusual (grey/greenish) discharge, then you should see a doctor. The presence of a persistent or unusual odor or discharge can indicate an STI or some other infection that requires medical attention.Note, there is a vaginal scent that is normal, and does not require medical attention. Typically, you should seek medical attention for vaginal odor if it is fishy or different from normal.Itching can also indicate that you may have an infection. See a doctor if your vagina itches along with having an odor.

Bring extra underwear.,
Wear cotton underwear.,
Wear loose clothing.,
Watch what you eat.",How to Deal With Menstrual Odour3," While we all hope that we’re prepared for any emergency, sometimes we forget that even the best menstrual products can leak and get blood on our underwear and clothing. During your heaviest days, it might be a good idea to bring an extra pair of underwear and pants., Wearing cotton underwear allows for more air to reach your vagina. This helps it stay dryer during your period. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, trap moisture leading to bacterial growth., Doing so allows your vagina to breathe. This also helps keep the amount of sweat low.Wearing loose clothing has the added benefit of being more comfortable if you experience menstrual cramps.


For instance wearing gauchos, skirts, or loose shorts or pants, instead of tight-fitting jeans or pants, can make your genital area more airy., Certain foods such as garlic, broccoli, or blue cheese, can increase vaginal odor. While it may not directly increase menstruation-related odor, it certainly won’t help if food is increasing your vaginal odor. Try cutting out offending foods all at once and adding them back slowly, to see what might be the culprit."

Take something for the pain.,
Try a heating pad.,
Take oral contraceptives or another type of hormonal birth control.,
Take a warm bath.,
Avoid smoking.,
Massage your lower back and abdomen.,
Exercise during your period.,
Take dietary supplements.,
Call your doctor if the pain worsens.,
Contact your doctor if you have an increase in vaginal discharge.,
Get help if you have pain at times other than during menstruation.,
Call your doctor if you have cramps that last more than two or three days.",How to Deal With Dysmenorrhea," When you start to feel the symptoms of dysmenorrhea (like cramps), you should take some over-the-counter pain medicine to help you handle the pain. You can even take some pain medicine right when you begin your period to try to keep the pain at bay.Try taking something like ibuprofen or naproxen. These are the best over-the-counter medicines for cramps.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for dosing.;
, If you are feeling a lot of pain and the pain medicine doesn't seem to be helping, try using a heating pad. Simply applying heat to your lower back or abdomen (depending on where you feel the most pain) can have amazing effects and make you feel so much better.You can also try an adhesive heating pad. This is a good option if you are on the go and can’t sit and hold a heating pad against your body.

, If you have severe cramps during your period, ask your doctor about hormonal birth control. Some people can be helped a lot by using birth control pills, hormonal IUDs, implants, injections, or patches. Regular use of oral contraceptives usually shortens the period and even lessens the pain in some women.Using a birth control pill can also help other potentially uncomfortable elements of menstruation like reducing the amount of blood released during each cycle, improving acne, and relieving premenstrual syndrome (PMS) symptoms., As with using a heating pad, applying heat to the area by taking a hot bath can help relieve the pain of menstrual cramps. The heat will soothe your cramps and help you feel better., One of the worst things you can do for your body is smoking cigarettes, especially if you are a woman. For women, smoking can cause many problems with their hormone levels and can cause irregular periods. Smoking also causes your blood vessels to restrict, which can intensify the pain of menstrual cramps.Studies have shown that compared to nonsmokers, smokers have up to a 41% increased chance of having painful menstrual cramps., Since cramps are caused by discomfort in the uterus (a muscle), sometimes a gentle massage can help remedy the problem. Use your fingers to rub in a circular motion on the affected area. If your pain is mainly in your back and you can’t reach the area yourself, consider asking a friend or loved one to do it for you. Or you could even pay a professional for a massage.

, Even though you might not feel like getting out of bed when your symptoms of dysmenorrhea are acting up, being active can actually help reduce your pain and may even help you feel relaxed afterwards.Try swimming, walking, or cycling for exercise when you are on your period.

, Some studies have shown that certain dietary supplements can help reduce the pain of menstrual cramps. These supplements work with your body to help normalize your period symptoms.Some dietary supplements to try include vitamin, E, omega-3 fatty acids, vitamin B-1, vitamin B-6, and magnesium.

, If pain is really severe and seems to get worse over time, see a doctor. They can make sure you don't have any cysts or any other major problems with your reproductive parts. Some pain is normal during your menstrual cycle, but if yours gets progressively worse, it could be a sign of something more serious.

, Vaginal discharge or a foul smelling odor can be a sign of several potentially dangerous conditions, especially when coupled with severe menstrual cramps. One such possibility is Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID), which can lead to infections and even infertility if left untreated.

, If you are feeling pain from severe cramps that are unrelated to your period, you should contact your doctor. This could be an indicator of a condition other than dysmenorrhea and you need to let your doctor know so they can examine you., Cramps are treatable, so there is no reason for you to suffer through them needlessly. If you are feeling severe pain from menstrual cramps for more than a couple days at a time, you should let your doctor know so that you can discuss further avenues for treatment."

Use a pad or sanitary napkin.,
Try tampons.,
Decide if you want to use pantyliners.",How to Deal with a Period in Elementary School1," Pads or sanitary napkins are thin, cushiony pieces of fabric that suck in and absorb the liquid that comes out of your body during your period. Pads can hold a LOT of liquid! They also have two sides - a sticky side that attaches to the inside of your underwear, and a non-stickly side that absorbs the liquid. Some pads also have “wings” that can fold around the outside of your underwear to help keep the pad from moving when you walk. These “wings” can also help stop leaks.Pads should never be flushed down the toilet. They should be wrapped in toilet paper and put in the garbage. Most bathroom stalls in a girl's washroom have special bins just for pads and tampons.
You should change your pad at least every 3-4 hours. If you’re having a “light"" flow, you can probably go a little longer, but if you’re having a “heavy"" flow, you’ll want to change your pad more often.;
, Tampons can be used instead of pads. Tampons have two parts - the actual tampon itself (which almost looks like a long, thick cotton ball), and the applicator. Applicators can be made of plastic or paper. Tampons are worn inside your vagina and capture the liquid before it leaves your body. Because it’s worn inside your vagina, it needs to be changed at least every 4-6 hours. Tampons should not be worn overnight.


Some tampons are designed to be flushed down a toilet, but some need to be disposed of in a garbage. Tampon applicators must never be flushed down a toilet.There is something called Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) that can happen if you leave a tampon inside your body for too long. It can make you feel quite sick. This is why you should not wear a tampon longer than 4-6 hours, and why you should never wear one overnight.

, Pantyliners are smaller, thinner pads. They are also sticky on one side and attach to the inside of your underwear. They are normally worn in-between your periods to help protect your underwear something called ""vaginal discharge."" Vaginal discharge is perfectly normal, and is normally white or clear in color. Every girl experiences a different amount of discharge when they don’t have their period. You can always try out pantyliners one month to see if you like them."

Look under the sink.,
Look in a linen closet.,
Ask a neighbor.,
Go to the store.,
Use the pad.",How to Deal With Getting a Period Home Alone1," Using tampons can take some practice, so for now, it is best to use a sanitary napkin (otherwise known as a pad).Do you live at home with your mom or a sister? Then chances are there are some pads stored under the bathroom sink.


Look for a box labeled “sanitary napkins” or “pads.”
If you don’t see a box like this, open any unlabeled storage containers.
Look for any loose pads. They will be fluffy squares wrapped in colorful plastic.
Call or text your mom or sister and ask where some pads might be.;
, In some homes, extra bathroom supplies (like toothpaste, toilet paper, or pads) are stored in a closet near the bathroom. Take a look in a linen closet, or any other closet where your family keeps bathroom supplies.


Once again, look for a box labeled “sanitary napkins” or “pads.”
Remember to open any unlabeled storage containers.
Call or text your mom or sister (if you haven't already) and ask where some pads might be.

, Is there a neighbor or friend living nearby that you could ask to borrow a pad from? No need to be embarrassed! Women sharing feminine hygiene products is a practice as old as time! It is part of the code of being a girl.Say, “Pardon me, but do you have any feminine hygiene products you could share?”

, If you are old enough, if you have some money, and if there is a store nearby, going out to buy some pads is a good idea. If you’ve never purchased pads before, it’s okay! Don’t be overwhelmed by the choices offered. Just pick one; they will all work fine. Don’t worry about the cashier (even if it’s a boy). They sell plenty of feminine hygiene products during every shift., Once you have located a pad to use, it is time to situate it in your underwear.


Start by wearing clean, dry underwear that fits well. If you've bled into your underwear, change into a fresh pair.
Remove the paper backing from the pad.
Stick the pad to your underwear.
If the pad has “wings,” remove the extra paper backing and fold the wings over the sides of your underwear. The wings should be attached to the underside of the underwear, as though ""hugging"" the crotch of your underpants."

The more stuff you learn, the better. All this information will help you figure out what’s happening to you, and realize that it’s all perfectly normal.


The Office of Women’s Health in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has created an awesome guide just for teenage girls. You can download a PDF copy of the guide at their website - http://www.girlshealth.gov/about/images/teen_survival_guide.pdf.
The website kidshealth.org has a large section about female puberty and periods - http://kidshealth.org/teen/sexual_health/girls/menstruation.html.

, At the very least, it’s always a good idea to keep a few pads and/or tampons with you at all times. You can carry them in a hidden pocket of your backpack or bag, or even put them in your locker (maybe inside a pencil case). You might also want to keep an extra pair of underwear or pants at school or in your bag for emergencies in case your pad or tampon leaks. It might seem weird to do this, but you’ll be SO grateful if you ever need them., Stay calm and think about what you need to do. If your period started and you don't have a pad, or if your pad or tampon leaked, you can talk to a trusted friend, female teacher, counselor or nurse to ask for supplies. Schools usually have a supply of pads and tampons they can give you. You can also ask to call your parents so you can go home if you'd rather do that.If your period started when you weren’t expecting it to, or you’ve run out of pads or tampons, you can always use toilet paper. It will work for a short time until you can get home.
If your pad or tampon leaks and leaves a spot on your pants, try pulling your shirt down over your bum. Or tie a shirt or jacket around your waist.
Don’t be embarrassed about asking for help. Adults will understand and will not make fun of you. It’s probably even happened to them before! , When you get your period for the first time, you don't need to go to your doctor.

The vaginal discharge you get between periods is yellow, grey or green and smells really bad.
Your period lasts longer than 7 days.
You get your periods less than 21 days apart, or more than 45 days apart.

Prepare for the possibility of PMS.,
Exercise regularly.,
Eat properly.,
Get enough sleep every night.,
Take pain medicine.,
Ask your parents or doctor if you should take vitamins.",How to Deal with a Period in Elementary School3," PMS, or premenstrual syndrome, is something you might get before and/or during your period. PMS can include things like cramps, pain in your back, sadness, mood changes, pimples, bloating, headaches, and even tenderness in your breasts. It isn’t fun, but it does go away. Every girl experiences PMS differently. Some girls will get all the symptoms every month, and some girls will hardly ever get symptoms., Exercising can actually help your cramps go away, or at least not be so bad. Exercise can include play sports, going for a bike ride, jumping on a trampoline, going skateboarding, taking a hike … whatever you find fun., Make sure you’re eating a lot of fruits and vegetables. Girls between the ages of 9 and 13 should eat at least 6 servings of fruit and vegetables everyday.Try not to eat a lot of salty and sweet foods, or drinks like cola.

, Girls should get around 9 hours of sleep every night. And you’ll likely find you’re more tired during your period, so go to bed earlier if you have to., “Over-the-counter” medications are pills that your parents can buy at a drug store without going to the doctor. Medicines like ibuprofen, ketoprofen, naproxen, and aspirin are a few that can help, but you should never take them without first asking your parents. Your parents will help you figure out how much to take, and when.Sometimes PMS symptoms are bad enough that the medicine you buy at the drug store simply doesn't work. If you’ve tried everything else and nothing is working, ask your parents to take you to the doctor to talk about prescription medicines., Some vitamins and minerals can help PMS symptoms - folic acid, calcium with vitamin D, magnesium, vitamin B6, and vitamin E. All of these vitamins and minerals can be found at any drug or grocery store, but the amounts you take will depend on your age. Before taking vitamin and minerals, speak to your doctor and ask them how much you should take."

Go swimming.,
Get exercise.,
Try tracking your period.,
Understand what makes up your period.",How to Deal with a Period in Elementary School4," Swimming while you have your period is perfectly okay. However, since pads absorb liquid, they will absorb water while you’re swimming and become quite useless. When swimming you may prefer to wear a tampon. If you don’t want to wear a tampon, you can try to wear a pad or pantyliner, but you should change it immediately when you get out of the water., Exercise is a great way to help your PMS symptoms like cramps and muscle aches. You can still do any activity when you have your period that you could do when you didn’t have it. You don’t have to change your day-to-day life when you get your period., Tracking your period can help you figure out when your period should start so you'll know when to have supplies on hand. You can find some period trackers online - just search for “period tracker” or “period calculator.”Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and there's no sure way to predict exactly when your period will come.

, Discharge during your period isn’t 100% blood. Periods usually start out light and the liquid looks brownish-red. After a few days your period “flow” will get heavier, and it’ll turn a darker shade of red. After that it slows down and becomes lighter again until it finally stops. While the liquid can look like pure blood, don’t worry, it isn’t. The liquid is actually the lining of your uterus (the place where a baby would grow) being removed from your body. It’s mainly tissue and fluids, with a tiny bit of blood. It’s that tiny bit of blood that stains all the liquid a red colour."

Locate materials that absorb and adhere.,
Create your makeshift pad.,
Situate the pad in your underwear.,
Fold up some toilet paper.,
Check your pad often.",How to Deal With Getting a Period Home Alone2," If you were not able to find a store-bought pad, that's okay! You probably have many things at home that can be used. You will want something thick and absorbent, something soft, and something to keep the pad in place.


Absorbent materials: Gauze, cotton, or other bandages (look in a first aid kit), clean worn-out clothes, and/or heavy-duty paper towels.
Soft fabric materials: worn-out but clean clothes, such as a t-shirt or sock.
Toilet paper or gauze can be used to keep the pad in place.

, Form the material you have chosen into a shape that will fit into your underwear (a rectangle or oval). Then, take your soft fabric and wrap it around your pad.Soft fabric will make your makeshift pad a little more comfortable.

, Take the makeshift pad and situate it just like you would with a store-bought pad. Use toilet paper or gauze to wrap around the pad and the crotch of your underwear, keeping it in place. Wrap it a few times to make sure it stays put.

, If your period is very light, or if you just want to buy some time, you can use a bit of toilet paper. Simply fold a long piece of toilet paper into a rectangle and place it in your underwear.

, You will want to check your pad regularly to be sure you are not leaking or bleeding through. A good rule of thumb is to check your pad every 45 minutes to an hour.

Discuss your period with your doctor.,
Have a blood test to check your hormone balance.,
Get checked for uterine growths if you develop heavier periods.,
Consider other medical issues as a possible cause for your heavy periods.,
Watch out for anemia.,
See your doctor if you have a missed, irregular, or extremely heavy period.,
Seek emergency medical care if you have signs of toxic shock syndrome.",How to Deal With a Heavy Period1," If your heavy period bothers you, talk to your doctor about ways to make it better. If it’s right for you, they can give you medicine (usually birth control) to make your period less heavy. When you go for your visit be ready to tell them how often you get your periods and how long they last, and about how many pads or tampons you use in a day.


Sometimes a hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) can help with heavy periods. It depends on which kind of IUD is used – non-hormonal IUDs may increase bleeding.;
, Sometimes, heavy menstrual bleeding is caused by an imbalance in your hormones. If heavy bleeding is a consistent problem for you, ask your doctor about getting your hormone levels checked. This can be done with a simple blood test. Your doctor can give you medication, usually birth control, to regulate any unbalanced hormones., Uterine polyps and uterine fibroids are benign (non-cancerous) growths that can occur in the uterus and cause heavier bleeding. These usually develop in your 20’s-30’s. If you had normal periods in the past that have become heavier, ask your doctor about the possibility of uterine growths.Another condition called adenomyosis causes heavy bleeding and painful cramps. Ask your doctor about this if you’re middle-aged and have had children – that’s when this condition most commonly occurs.

, Some women just have heavier periods than others; in some cases, however, medical conditions cause heavy menstruation. These can be diagnosed with a physical exam, ultrasound, biopsy, or other procedure. If you want to understand your heavy period, work with your doctor to rule out the following possible causes:A bleeding disorder that you inherited from your parents; you will probably have other signs of easy bleeding other than your heavy period
Endometriosis
Pelvic inflammatory disease
Thyroid disfunction
Kidney or liver problems
Cancers of the uterus, cervix, or ovaries (rarely)

, Iron deficiency anemia can occur if you have really heavy periods. This is when you lose so much blood that it depletes how much iron you have in your body. You will likely feel tired or fatigued. You might also have pale skin, a sore tongue, headaches or dizziness, or a fast heartbeat. If you think you’re anemic, go to your doctor to get your iron level checked.Preempt your blood loss by taking a multivitamin that has iron in it, or ask your doctor whether you should take an iron supplement.
It can also help to eat iron-rich foods like red meat, seafood, spinach, and fortified cereals and breads.Get enough vitamin C to enhance how your body absorbs iron. Eat foods like oranges, broccoli, leafy greens, and tomatoes.

, Periods come in all shapes and sizes, but some issues suggest you should talk to your doctor about what’s going on. Make an appointment to see your regular doctor or your gynecologist if you have any of the following problems:You miss your period, if you’ve been having them regularly.
Your period lasts longer than 7 days.
You bleed so heavily you need to change pads or tampons more than every 1-2 hours.
You have debilitating cramps.
Your period goes from being regular to being irregular.
You have bleeding in between your periods.

, Be sure to change tampons at least every 8 hours – leaving one in for longer can increase your chances of infection or toxic shock syndrome (TSS). TSS can be a serious medical problem, so go to the hospital or see your doctor right away if you’re using a tampon and have symptoms of TSS, such as:Headache
Sudden fever
Vomiting or diarrhea
A rash like a sunburn on your hands or feet
Muscle aches
Confusion
Seizures

Keep track of your period.,
Carry a day’s worth of products with you.,
Stash extra products in several secret places.,
Manage your cramps with over-the-counter medicine.,
Treat your cramps with natural remedies.",How to Deal With a Heavy Period2," Write down what day it starts, how heavy it is each day, when it stops, and how you feel each day. This record can help you predict your next period so you’ll be prepared for it. The average cycle is 28 days long, though this varies from girl to girl. Look back over three months of your notes and count how many days it is between when your period started one month to the next – taking the average of three months will give you a good idea of when to expect your next period.


It takes some time for your period to get regular – the first few months or even year of your period might not be very consistent.
It can be helpful to show this record to your doctor or gynecologist if you ever want to discuss your heavy period with them.

, Keep enough pads or tampons in your purse or backpack to last you an entire day. You probably have to carry more products than others because your heavy period requires extra protection for your clothes. When you need to change your product, excuse yourself and go to the bathroom – you’ll already have what you need with you.


If people ask you why you keep going to the bathroom, just say that you drank a lot of water earlier. You can also say, “I am not feeling too well today,” or something else vague.

, Keep extra tampons, pads, and panty liners in your car, your locker at school, your purse, or that spare pocket of your backpack. If you have extra products in several different places it’s unlikely that you’ll be caught without one, even if you have overflow.You can make a small period travel-kit with a couple of pads and tampons, some ibuprofen for cramps, and even a spare set of underwear – just in case.
If you have limited space, just put 1-2 pads or tampons in your secret spots. They don’t take up much space and can at least get you through a few hours.
If you happen to run out, many school and office bathrooms have machines that sell tampons cheaply. The school nurse might have supplies, too.

, Often, girls with a heavy period get painful cramps. It’s appropriate to take pain medicine for uncomfortable cramps. Ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), acetaminophen (Tylenol), and naproxen (Aleve) can minimize cramp pain. Start taking medicine when you first start noticing symptoms, and take it regularly for 2-3 days or until your cramps subside. If you regularly get painful cramps, you can preemptively start taking medicine as soon as you get your period.
For severe cramps, your doctor can prescribe stronger pain medicine, like Ponstel.
Only take medicine as directed by your doctor or the bottle. Talk to your doctor before using any medicine if you have health problems.

, If you don’t want to take medicine for your cramps, try natural solutions for pain relief. Take a hot shower or put a hot water bottle on your abdomen. Distract yourself with a good book or puzzle to take your mind off your discomfort. Elevate your legs and get some rest. Other ideas for minimizing cramps naturally include:Take a walk or do some light exercise, like yoga.
Meditate to lower your stress.
Avoid caffeine.

Change your feminine hygiene products often.,
Learn to use a variety of feminine hygiene products.,
Use the right absorbency for your flow.",How to Deal With a Heavy Period3," A normal flow requires 3-6 pads or tampons per day on average, but for a heavy flow you may need to change your hygiene product every 3-4 hours – or more. You’ll learn your flow and be better able to gauge how regularly you need to change your hygiene product.

, Sometimes with heavy periods using a pad can make you feel nervous or dirty. Nobody else will know if you’re using a pad or not, but if you feel uncomfortable with them then try to learn to use other methods. Tampons and menstrual cups can help keep you dry throughout the day and are probably more comfortable if you’re being active. If you change your tampon regularly enough, you can even swim during heavy flow days.


Consider using a menstrual cup. Some of them have a greater capacity than pads or tampons and you don't need to carry any supplies throughout the day.
A lot of girls have trouble with tampons and cups at first, so don’t be embarrassed if you find it difficult. Ask your mom, other female relative, friend, or doctor to give you advice on using them.

, Tampons and pads come in different shapes and absorbency. Make sure you’re using the right ones for your heavy flow. “Super” tampons and “overnight pads” offer more protection to your clothes and linens. If you don’t have overnight pads – which are generally longer and thicker – try using two pads when you go to bed, one in the front and one in the back of your underwear.

Stay calm if you overflow.,
Wear dark clothes and underwear while on your period.,
Double up on your hygiene products.,
Be vigilant.,
Protect your bedding with towels.",How to Deal With a Heavy Period4," Sometimes, overflow happens. In fact, it’s happened to most women at one time or another. If you bleed through onto your sheets at night, rinse the sheets in cold water and then immediately put them into the wash. If you bleed into your underwear, you can try washing them (separately or with dark colors), or just throw them away at the end of the day. Worst case scenario is that you bleed into your pants or skirt – do what you can to get through the day by tying a sweater around your waist or, if you must, going home early.Shower, change, and move on with your day stress-free.


Talk about your accident with someone you trust. Remember that 50% of the world has dealt with periods – it’s likely that a lady you know has had an overflow accident, too. Don’t be ashamed or embarrassed to talk about it and how you feel.

, If you’ve experienced overflow bleeding, be prepared for next time. When you’re on your period, wear black underwear and pants. If you do have some spotting, it won’t be noticeable. You can even set aside a set of dark undies to wear only when you’re on your period., Using more than one type of feminine hygiene product can be really effective in minimizing overflow bleeding. If you sometimes bleed through your tampons, use a panty liner or pad, too. That way you have some backup in case you don’t get to change your tampon in time.


THINX period panties can also be a good backup method to a cup or tampon. THINX are made so that you can bleed right into them, then wash them out and reuse them. They hold anywhere from ½ to 2 or 3 tampons worth of blood depending on the style, and are available to purchase online.

, Get used to “checking on things” every hour or two. Make a quick bathroom stop in between classes or as a short work break. Check your underwear and pad, and do a wipe test if you’re using a tampon – if there’s blood on the toilet tissue after you urinate, you may be about to bleed through your tampon.

, Put a dark towel down on your sheets while you sleep to protect your bedding and mattress from accidental leaking. You can also try using overnight pads that have wings; these offer more protection from spillage.

Sunbathe.",How to Cope With Your Period on Vacation," Whether you use tampons, pads, or a menstrual cup, be sure to pack plenty of supplies prior to your vacation. Overestimate the amount of products you will need as you do not want to run out. For example, if at home, you usually use four tampons a day, bring six per day. If you unexpectedly get your period on vacation, visit a drug store to purchase your supplies. Alternatively, you could ask a friend to give you some items.


Some countries will not have the same supplies available that you normally use. For example, in Central Europe, it is more difficult to find tampons with applicators and in Asia, it would be hard to find tampons at all.;
, If you expect that your period will start prior to or during your trip, bring painkillers. Ibuprofen or aspirin can reduce cramps.Naproxen sodium (e.g. Aleve) and Midol are also good options. Midol particularly works to reduce bloating in addition to relieving pain.Keep in mind that in some countries (for example, Germany) you cannot buy painkillers over-the-counter. You are, however, allowed to bring medication with you in your checked luggage. If traveling to countries that limit access to painkillers, be sure to pack enough for the duration of your period.


Follow the instructions on the medication packaging. Do not overdose. Also, talk to your doctor if you are using any other prescription medication.
Although it is not medication, a disposable heat pad can be useful to have. These pads often include adhesive tape and stick to your abdominal area.

, If you know your period will arrive on vacation, take care to pack correct clothing. For example, add a few extra pairs of underwear to your list. Also, think about what clothing options are the most comfortable during your time of month. Flowing skirts might be preferable to tight skinny jeans. Having extra shorts to wear under your skirts might make you feel more secure as well.


Packing for comfort does not mean packing to be sloppy. Keep in mind your destination and any applicable dress codes.
Waterproof underwear can help you prevent leaks on long days out.

, If at all possible, plan your trip to maximize your comfort. This will depend on how you normally feel on your period. For example, if you know the first day of menstruation tends to be very rough, do not plan any adventurous activities on that day. Avoid strenuous hikes or excessively long walks. Going to a sauna where you must remove your swimsuit is also not a great option. Instead, use your first period days to do short walks around your area, go to movies, or do other less active things.


Not all vacations offer this flexibility. There are other things you usually can control, however, like how much sleep you get. If you feel extra tired on your period, try to sleep earlier and/or later if possible.

, If you will be on your honeymoon, for example, and your period arrives, you can still enjoy intimacy with your partner. Pack old dark towels to use, as you might feel uncomfortable having fun on a hotel's white sheets. Look at Have Sex During Your Period for additional tips.

, When taking day trips on vacation, it is important to have your period supplies with you in your purse or backpack. Create a daily pack with your tampons, pads, or other menstrual hygiene products. Add the amount of painkillers you might use plus an extra pair of underwear. Adding a small pack of wet wipes can help you feel clean and refreshed too.


If traveling by plane, put these items in your carry-on baggage. If traveling by car, keep your kit in the main cabin rather than in the trunk.
If you are hiking or camping and there will not be trash cans, add a resealable plastic bag to your kit. You can use the bag to hold your used products and then dispose of them later.

, When you are out and about especially in the heat, it is important to drink plenty of clear liquids like filtered water. 2.2 Liters (9 cups) of fluids is the daily recommendation for women.If you are outside in heat, you might need to increase your water intake.


Bring a reusable water bottle for plane rides, day trips, or car rides.
Be sure to drink plenty of water while flying. The humidity in the cabin can drop to 20%, which can make you feel dehydrated., Try to eat nutritious, healthy foods during your period. Although this can be difficult on vacation, opt for salads, fresh fruits, and whole grains instead of fried and salty foods. Make sure you are getting enough protein. Iron deficiency is also possible for women who have very heavy periods.To make sure you are getting enough iron, try eating more:


Red meat (beef for example)
Poultry
Fish
Nuts
Leafy green vegetables, If possible, plan when you will take restroom breaks to check the status of your feminine hygiene products. For example, you might plan to have a morning coffee, lunch break, and afternoon snack. Cafes and restaurants normally have restrooms to use. If you are visiting a location where one must pay to use the toilet, be sure to have suitable change with you.


When taking long-haul flights or driving for a long time, be sure to go to the bathroom every few hours as well. This will help your circulation and muscles as well!
If you are on a long flight or drive, it's very important to change your pad or tampon regularly to avoid unpleasant odors and Toxic Shock Syndrome.

, When you have your period, it is best to wear a swimsuit with bottoms that provide a bit more coverage. In other words, string bikinis might not be a good choice! Choose a swimsuit that is also not super tight, as you might be bloated.


If you are concerned about leakage, choose a dark-colored bathing suit or wear waterproof shorts over your bottoms. Athletic shorts can work well for this purpose.

, To avoid bleeding into the water or having leaks when you exit the pool, try using a tampon or menstrual cup. They will help keep your flow contained. If you prefer to not use a tampon, see the article Swim on Your Period Without a Tampon.

, If you are not feeling well and don't want to go in the water, consider sunbathing. Be sure to wear sunscreen! Relaxing in a chair might be the best thing for any menstrual cramps. For more tips see: Swim when You Are on Your Period

Keep record of your menses.,
Use birth control consistently.,
Be prepared.",How to Cope With an Irregular Menstruation Cycle1," No matter how long, short, or bizarrely timed your periods are, keep track of when they come and go. Use a notebook, an online calendar, or one of the many apps for your phone made for this reason. Periods that seem entirely random might, if you can look back, show some pattern you can use to predict the next one.;
, Since you’re not getting your period every month informing you a baby isn’t on the way, ensure your pregnancy status with other methods. Always practice safe sex, but when in doubt take a pregnancy test four weeks after your last period started. Talk to your gynecologist about the birth control pill or other contraception.


Definitely do NOT use the “timing method” of birth control. This can be a difficult practice to get right for those with regular periods, and with an irregular period your ovulation can be very hard to predict.

, If you don’t know when your period is coming, it’s best always to be ready for it. Make a small survival kit for yourself to keep in your car, your office desk, or your purse. Include panty liners, pads, tampons ranging from light to heavy or your own preferred product, and Ibuprofen or Midol for cramps. Now you’ll be ready for anything!

Look into different kinds of birth control.,
Consider skipping your period entirely.,
Be prepared for surprises.,
Consider more travel-friendly supplies.",How to Cope With a Heavy Period While on Holiday1," If your period tends to be very heavy and you're not yet on birth control, talk to your doctor about your options.

, Several kinds of birth control — including birth control pills, the patch, and Depo-Provera — allow you to skip your period. If you’re able to plan ahead, consider eliminating the problem entirely.You may also have to deal with breakthrough bleeding, which — because it can come at any time — can be almost as annoying as your actual period.
There is another possibility, though it is important to note it is not a contraceptive — tranexamic acid is a pill that can be prescribed to lighten menses. Discuss this option with your doctor, and how to use the pills if heavy bleeding should occur while you are on vacation. Be certain to use a form of birth control in addition to this pill if you are sexually active; again, it will not prevent pregnancy or STDs.

, Even if you’re not scheduled to get your period, consider bringing some supplies. Travel can disrupt your cycle, even if your period is usually super regular, and you don’t want to be caught off guard.By that same token, don’t necessarily start to panic if you are late or even miss a period while traveling. This can be caused by stress, changes in eating or exercising, jet lag, or some combination thereof., Menstrual cups take up less room in your bag, are environmentally friendly, and can be left in for up to twelve hours. Try them out the month before you go to make sure you are comfortable with the process.Conserving space is especially important if you tend to bleed heavily.

Even then, what's regular varies — girls' cycles can range from 21 to 35 days.Don’t stress if your first few years of periods aren’t very regular; they might even out with time.

, If you’re sexually active and miss a period, you might be pregnant. Pregnancy is the most common cause of a missed period. You can get a test at the drug store that’s very accurate, or see your family doctor.

, If you’re breastfeeding, you won’t have your period. You’ll also miss several cycles if you recently gave birth or had a miscarriage.

The more stressed you feel on a daily basis, the more likely you are to throw off your cycle.Practice relaxation and stress coping techniques like yoga, meditation, exercise, or a nice bubble bath. Periods usually regulate once stress decreases.


If you’re going through a major life change like switching jobs, getting married or divorced, or moving, the increased stress might mess with your cycle. Make a mental note of the stress and change, and work on calming techniques."

Get checked for PCOS.,
Have a pelvic exam to check for problems with your uterus.,
Measure your hormone levels.,
Get a blood test.,
Ask your doctor about your medications.",How to Cope With an Irregular Menstruation Cycle4," Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) causes relatively high and constant levels of hormones, rather than the fluctuating levels seen in the normal menstrual cycle.PCOS can cause missed or irregular periods, and can lead to infertility. Other symptoms of PCOS include too much hair on the face, chin, or parts of the body where men usually have hair (“hirsutism”); thinning hair or hair loss on the scalp (male-pattern baldness); weight gain or difficulty losing weight; inability to get pregnant; and darkening of the skin along creases like the groin and underneath breasts.This is a medical issue that requires treatment.

, A number of uterine issues can cause missed, heavy, or irregular periods. These include fibroids, cysts, polyps, scarring, infection, and endometriosis.Have a pelvic exam and uterine ultrasound to rule out these causes, or identify them and help you get treatment.


If infection is a concern, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics., Estrogen, progesterone and testosterone are hormones that all affect the menstrual cycle, and checking their levels can show whether they’re out of balance for some reason.Hormone replacement is the most common treatment for hormone deficiencies or imbalance.Your doctor might prescribe birth control pills to normalize your cycle or stop it all together if you have very heavy periods or periods that last longer than average.An intrauterine device (IUD) called Mirena can also help control excessive or unpredictable bleeding.You can also talk to your doctor about a non-contraceptive option, such as progesterone. This may be a good option if you are trying to conceive or just don’t need contraceptive. You can use progesterone for 10 days per month to induce a menstrual cycle and this won't prevent you from becoming pregnant.

, An overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is another common cause of menstrual irregularities.Thyroid levels can be checked with a simple blood test. Your doctor can also do a “complete blood count” to check for anemia.Thyroid hormone can also be taken as a medicine, and iron supplements will help with anemia.

, Some medications can stop periods, including some types of antipsychotics, antidepressants, blood pressure drugs, allergy medications, and cancer chemotherapy.Your healthcare provider can answer your questions about any side effects of your medications.

Deal with cramps.,
Choose tampons or menstrual cups for swimming and other vigorous activities.,
Avoid the water while wearing a pad.,
Choose sunscreen wisely.",How to Cope With a Heavy Period While on Holiday2," You probably already know to take a pain reliever, but you’ll enjoy your time at the beach or pool more if you take extra precautions to avoid cramps.Sit near a bathroom, and use it regularly. This is not just because staying hydrated is so important both in the sun and on your period, but also because not going to the bathroom frequently can exacerbate cramps.
Sit with your legs elevated or lie on your stomach — both positions that can alleviate cramps.
Limit your intake of caffeine, which can make cramps worse.

, Don’t think you have to avoid the water. Your tampon or menstrual cup will not fall out, and you will be perfectly safe. There is virtually no way anyone could know that you are getting your period. Moreover, getting in some activity can mitigate your period symptoms, especially if you are experiencing a heavier-than-normal flow.


The same goes for volleyball, badminton, or whatever other activities are happening. Feel confident joining in!

, If you absolutely cannot stand tampons or menstrual cups, you can wear a pad to the beach or pool — as long as you’re willing to stay out of the water. Look for a very thin one without wings, and be extra safe by wearing shorts or a sarong over your swimsuit.

, You already know that it is imperative to wear sunscreen every day, and to up your coverage when you are at the beach or pool. But being on your period brings other considerations into play.


Since many women break out during their periods, make sure you are using a sunscreen that will not make this worse.
Look for products with labels like “oil-free,” “non-comedogenic,” “won’t clog pores,” or “breakout-free.”
Remember that even skin-friendly products can lead to breakouts if you are not washing your face regularly, which is especially important when you are both on your period and exposed to lots of different elements.

Choose your materials wisely.,
Leave space in your backpack for supplies.,
Stay clean and fresh.,
Dispose of used pads and tampons safely.,
Stay hydrated.",How to Cope With a Heavy Period While on Holiday3," Consider tampons or a menstrual cup while hiking or camping. They’ll take up less space in your backpack, and they’re a better bet than pads if you’re worried about attracting bears. Since bears are attracted to scents, make sure you choose unscented products!, In addition to pads, tampons, or other materials, you’ll need some or all of the following: painkillers, extra bottled water, tissues or toilet paper, and tons of Ziploc bags. All of this will take up space in your backpack, so you might have to get rid of something you normally bring., Since you often won’t have access to bathroom facilities, bring unscented hand and/or body wipes, and keep antibacterial gel handy. These items can be helpful for all hikers and campers, but you’ll find them especially useful when you have your period., Wrap them in tissues or toilet paper, put them inside of a Ziploc bag, and then put the bag into a Bear Canister (obviously a different one than you are using for your food.)If you are using a menstrual cup, you will need to bring extra bottled water so that you can rinse it out safely. Never rinse it out in rivers, streams, or other bodies of water.

Go sightseeing.,
Use your period as an excuse to experience local cuisine.",How to Cope With a Heavy Period While on Holiday4," Don’t assume that you will be able to find extra supplies on your trip, especially if you are heading off the beaten track. You will almost certainly not be able to find the specific brands and products that you like to use. Even if you do, you do not want to interrupt sightseeing just to find them., Of course, you should never flush pads or tampons, but you may find yourself in an area where you cannot flush anything. Since waste disposal practices vary among cultures, there also may not be trashcans in bathrooms. You will need to be prepared to hold on to your materials until you get back to where you are staying. Wrap your used pads or tampons in tissues or toilet paper, store them in a Ziploc bag, store the bag in your purse or backpack, and clean your hands.When you do have access to toilets, take advantage of them, but depending on where you are going, don’t necessarily expect to find them regularly.If you are using a menstrual cup, make sure you have an adequate supply of clean (bottled) water with you to rinse it out.

, Getting your period while on vacation is not only inconvenient — between cramps, bloating, and other issues — it can also be uncomfortable. But you don’t want to miss out on the fun, and being active can actually alleviate some of these symptoms. So ditch the tight jeans, and revel in the comfort of yoga pants, soft t-shirts, and knit dresses., As much as you might want to stay in your hotel room, physical activity can alleviate the symptoms of a heavy period. Go for a long walk that takes you past as many landmarks as possible., Healthy snacks can also alleviate some of your period symptoms. Seek out local produce and other healthy foods that you wouldn’t be able to get at home.While there is no evidence that food can reduce bleeding, many women find that following a healthy diet can make heavy bleeding easier to deal with.Since very heavy bleeding can lead to anemia, seek out iron-rich foods like meat, legumes, leafy greens, and whole grains."

Minimal traces of isoflavones can also be found grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables.

Check with your doctor first.,
Ask for a prescription for Norethisterone (progestogen).,
Try natural progesterone cream.,
Use a feminine hygiene cup for a non-hormonal method.",How to Avoid Menstruation1," Make sure you are healthy enough to manipulate your cycle without serious or uncomfortable side effects. Discuss your reasons for wanting to delay menstruation and how long you wish to do so. S/he will help you decide which method is most appropriate.;
, This synthetic hormone replaces the body’s natural production of the hormone that causes menstruation when levels fall and the uterus shed its lining. It is meant for short-term, occasional usage.Start taking this pill 3-4 days before your period is due. Take 3 pills (5 mg each) a day for up to two weeks. This gives you the option of delaying menstruation for up to 10 days. Your period should start 2 or 3 days after you stop taking it.Do not take this medicine if you have history of blood clots. It raises your risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT).Also check with your doctor for known drug interactions with medicines you may already take.Side effects can include bloating, upset stomach, breast tenderness, nausea, constipation, fatigue, and reduced sex drive., It works similarly to norethisterone, but is a topical hormone cream you start applying twice a day at ovulation. This can help you delay menstruation for a few days.This may not be as effective as the prescription progesterone so only try this if it is ok to not delay your period.

Talk to your doctor about possible side effects first.,
Determine if you are taking monophasic or multiphasic pills.,
Skip the fourth week of pills and start a new pack.",How to Avoid Menstruation2," Before you decide to go on the pill or go off label with dosage, get your doctor's advice. The pill does not produce natural periods; “menstruation” occurs during the scheduled rest period from active pills and is actually the result of withdrawal.


Since this schedule is controlled and repeats every month, it is easy to alter when you menstruate by skipping ahead a week.
Even if you are already on the pill, your doctor may not advise you to modify your usage schedule for personal reasons alone. Take initiative and be ready to speak to your doctor openly.

, Monophasic brands are more common and contain 2 types of pills: active and inactive (placebo). Triphasic or biphasic pills have different hormone levels each week, and in some brands the fourth week is a low-level estrogen pill rather than a placebo. Your doctor can tell you if you aren’t sure., Take the 21 active pills as usual, and skip the fourth week of inactive pills (monophasic type). Move on to a new pack and continue taking active pills to postpone menstruation up to nine weeks.You can also prepone your period by taking only 7 of the 21 active pills, then skipping ahead to the placebos.This might allow you to get through menstruation well before your event or travel.
With multiphasic pills, take the first 3 weeks worth, then throw out the rest and skip ahead in a new pack to the third phase.You may experience breakthrough bleeding with this method, especially the longer you take your active pills continuously. When you do finally take the inactive pills, menstruation will commence and probably be heavier than normal."

Get an extended cycle birth control pill.,
Switch to Nuvaring or the birth control patch for convenience.,
Ask your doctor about Depo-Provera, a birth control shot.,
Consider getting an intrauterine device (IUD) with progestin.",How to Avoid Menstruation3," If you can take the pill, then you can most likely take one of these as well. Several brands allow most women to have only 4 periods a year, having 84 active and 7 inactive pills in each pack. There is also one pill that can be taken for an entire year with a continuous level of hormones, offering the possibility of having no periods at all during that time.They appear to have similar health risks as the regular pill, but there have been no long term studies to support this yet.Side effects can include breakthrough bleeding for up to a year. Essentially, this is your body experiencing an unpredictable and irregular period while adjusting to hormones. Typically, bleeding subsides after a year of usage.To shorten symptoms from hormone withdrawal, your doctor may suggest taking only 3 or 4 days of inactive pills, instead of all 7., Both work similarly to the pill, but are easier to use since they only have to be changed every three weeks.


These are good choices for women who can’t remember to take a daily medicine because less user error is involved.
Wear up to three in a row for a total of 9 weeks. You should never go more than 9 weeks without taking at least a few days off., Depo-Provera is injectable synthetic progesterone administered by your health care professional every twelve weeks. It prevents menstruation during that time and can even stop it if the first dose is given within 5 days of your menstrual cycle. However, this method is less reliable for stopping your period so it may not be a good first choice.


Some women experience spotting in the beginning, but this usually subsides with time. At least half of users report having no period after the first year.Side effects can also include headaches, depression, acne, weight gain, hair loss and decreased sex drive. Long-term use may lead to osteoporosis. Talk with your doctor to determine if the shot is a good option for you., An IUD is a small plastic device shaped like a T that is inserted into the cervix and releases synthetic hormone. It prevents pregnancy and makes periods lighter or stops them altogether. Hormonal IUDs can be used continuously for 3 to 5 years.They must be inserted and removed by a health care professional, which causes mild to moderate pain in most women.
You may experience spotting or irregular periods for up to 6 months after insertion. IUDs have similar health risks to other hormone-based birth control.
Be sure to get the IUD with hormonal therapy. There are two types of IUDs: Mirena, and ParaGard. ParaGard does not contain any hormones, and prevents fertilization by using copper to irritate the uterus. It can be worn for up to ten years, but in many women causes menstruation to be heavier and last longer rather than limiting its frequency."

Drink herbal tea.,
Massage your abdomen.,
Lie in the fetal position.,
Use a heating pad or hot water bottle.,
Add cinnamon to your food and drinks.,
Cut out the junk food.",How to Alleviate Menstruation Pain With Natural Remedies1," Go for a cup of chamomile tea to boost your glycine levels. This amino acid relieves uterine cramps.Sip a cup of raspberry leaf tea to relieve bloating. You can also look for special menstrual blends in your local health food store.Make sure your tea is caffeine-free. Caffeine has an overstimulating effect on the body that could increase your cramping and make you bleed more heavily.;
, Massage helps to increase the flow of healing lactic acid to cramping muscles. Using your fingertips, move in slow circular motions. Start at the outer edges of your abdomen and gradually work your way inward and downward. To reduce the risk of chafing, use warmed coconut oil or aromatic essential oil., Lie on your side and bring your knees to your chest. Lean slightly forward to stretch your lower back muscles. This position will relieve cramping in your lower abdomen and in your lower back.If lying on your side doesn't do the trick, you can modify the fetal position by sitting up with your knees to your chest. Wrap your arms around your shins as if you're hugging them.

, Heat speeds blood flow to cramping muscles and also helps to relax them. Lie on your back or side and place the pad or bottle on your lower abdomen. Always put the heat source on top of your clothing and keep its protective cover on. If you place an uncovered heat source on your bare skin, you'll run the risk of severe burns., Cinnamon contains manganese, fights inflammation, and warms your body. All of these factors help to fight cramping.Buy cinnamon in bulk or in the spice aisle at your local grocery store. Add it to your oatmeal, decaf coffee, or warm almond milk for added flavor and pain relief.

, Sugar, salt, and saturated fat worsen cramps, bloating, and irritability. Because sugar and fat raise your estrogen level, start passing on the junk food the week you expect premenstrual symptoms. Wait until after your period is over before you indulge again.If you must have chocolate, reach for dark chocolate that's over 70 percent cocoa. The isoflavones in the cocoa will help to relieve your cramps. Milk chocolate, on the other hand, is loaded with saturated fat and sugar that will only trigger bloating and pain."

One medium banana contains as much as 451 mg., They'll not only ease your pain, they'll also lower your risk of certain cancers. You can find antioxidants in delicious guilt-free snacks like blueberries, red raspberries, and strawberries. If you're craving something more savory, reach for some tomato, bell pepper, or summer squash., Include kale, spinach, collards and/or mustard greens in your regular diet. Add them to your salad, sandwich, or favorite cooked dish. Dark leafy greens are rich in calcium, magnesium, and Vitamin K. These nutrients help to reduce pain and bleeding. Greens are also diuretics, which reduce bloating., Almonds, walnuts, and pumpkin seeds are rich in pain-reducing manganese and omega-3 fatty acids. They're also rich in fiber and protein, which will keep you full and stave off junk food cravings. Aim for about a handful between meals."

Do some cardio.,
Do yoga.,
Maintain your exercise regimen.",How to Alleviate Menstruation Pain With Natural Remedies3," Aerobic activity releases endorphins, which can reduce or even eliminate pain. Hit the treadmill for a power walk or brisk jog. Use the elliptical for a more varied workout that's easy on your knees. If machines aren't for you, do jumping jacks, jump rope, or run in place.


Don't limit yourself to the gym. Walk or run outside, especially if it's sunny. This way, you'll release endorphins and get some pain-reducing Vitamin D from the sunshine., You'll release endorphins while improving your balance and flexibility. For cramp relief, try the wind-relieving posture, ab-strengthening posture, or any other pose that involves forward bends. Child's pose is another great cramp reducer., Exercise at least 30 minutes a day, five days a week to stay in shape and reduce your pain for the long term. Pick a regimen that you enjoy. Stick to just cardio or throw in some yoga and resistance training. When you make your workout fun, you'll be less likely to slack off."

Talk to your doctor if your period is extremely heavy.",How to Make Your Period Lighter," These foods apparently exacerbate the symptoms of PMS and cause difficult periods.While it's not proven that avoiding sugar and carbs actually shortens your periods, it can help reduce bloating and cramps, and many people report having lighter periods when they pay more attention to their diet.Ice cream and potato chips might be exactly what you're craving when your period comes, but you'll really feel a difference if you can avoid them!


White bread, pasta, crackers, pretzels, chips, cookies, cake, and other pastries and sugary confections are on the list of foods to avoid. Swap them out for fruit and natural sweeteners like agave or honey.
Avoiding these foods all month long is your best bet for managing your period. If you feel like you can't live without a few scoops of chocolate ice cream to conquer your PMS, you'll still get the benefits of eating healthy in the weeks before your period.;
, Some people have found that basing their diet on fruits and vegetables, whole grains, fish and lean meat has a big effect on their monthly flow. The Mediterranean diet is low in sodium, saturated fat, and processed carbs, all of which cause the body to retain water and bloat up, so eating this way should help with other PMS issues as well.


Eat mostly fruits and vegetables, beans and other legumes, olive oil, and whole grains like quinoa and farrow.,


Eat dairy products, eggs and meat in moderation.

, Having low levels of potassium in your body can lead to irregular, heavy periods, in addition to more painful cramping and other symptoms.During your entire cycle, and especially in the weeks (all three of them if you wish) leading up to your period, choose foods packed with potassium to help regulate your flow.Bananas, sweet potatoes, lentils, yogurt, salmon, and raisins are all high in potassium.Boiling foods may deplete the potassium in some foods. Steam or bake potassium-rich foods to get the full benefits, or, if possible, eat them raw. You could, if you really feel that potassium is helpful, try a dietary supplement., Foods rich in essential fatty acids, calcium, magnesium, zinc, and vitamins B, C, and E are ideal for menstrual health. In particular, focus on strengthening the blood vessel walls, with vitamin C, flavonoids, and iron being top of your list of must-haves. Iron is also important for restoring iron lost from excessive blood loss.

, Getting regular moderate exercise can help keep your periods regular and lighten them up, apparently. Regular exercise keeps your body healthy and your weight steady, so you're less likely to experience the body fat fluctuations that lead to irregular and heavy periods.


Some people report that light exercises like swimming, jogging, and power walking make their periods lighter and shorter. Aim to exercise for about 30 minutes 5 - 6 times per week.
The type of intense exercise you'd get when training for a marathon or another sporting event can actually cause your periods to stop altogether.It causes your estrogen levels to drop, since you lose so much fat that your body wouldn't be able to maintain a pregnancy.

, Birth control pills contain progesterone and estrogen, two hormones that regulate the menstrual cycle and determine how heavy your period is each month. Taking birth control pills causes many people to experience lighter, shorter periods. If your period is particularly heavy and you're ready to manage it with medication, this might be the right option for you.Talk to your doctor about getting a birth control pill prescription.Everyone's body is different, and there are a lot of different types of pills designed to cater to different needs. Make an appointment with your doctor or go to your local health clinic to get the prescription that's right for you.
Take the pill according to instructions. If you skip a few days, you might end up experiencing a heavy or irregular period - not to mention, the pill will no longer be effective as a birth control measure. Be sure to take the pill every single day, at the same time every day, to experience the benefits you're looking for.

, The Pill isn't the only type of birth control that can work to regulate your period. If you don't want to take a pill every day, consider these other options that will have the same benefits as the standard birth control pill:


The birth control patch. This is usually placed on the arm, back or thigh. It distributes the same hormones as the Pill, only they're absorbed through your skin. The patch has to be changed every few weeks.The birth control ring. This is a small ring inserted into the vagina and changed out once a month. It releases hormones into the bloodstream.A hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). This is a small metal device that is implanted in the uterus by a health care provider. It releases hormones into the uterus and works for up to 12 years. The IUD causes some people to miss periods or have lighter periods, but for others it can make periods irregular., If you would prefer not to have your period at all, there are now options that will let you eliminate it altogether. Several drug companies make pills that create either very light or nonexistent periods, depending on your preference. The pills are similar to regular birth control pills, but they contain a type of hormone that can regulate the period to an even greater degree., Certain life stages cause periods to get heavier, and in some cases having a heavy period is genetic. Changes to your body or your lifestyle may be the cause of heavy periods. Be sure to check the following as possible reasons for the heavier-than-usual period:


If you're going through puberty, your periods may be heavy while your hormonal levels adjust; an imbalance in estrogen and progesterone can cause heavy periods.
If you've just stopped taking the Pill, you might have a heavier period, since the Pill tends to make periods lighter.
If you've just had an IUD placed, chances are you're experiencing a heavier period for the first few months. The body initially treats the IUD as a foreign object and this results in heavier periods.You might consider speaking to your gynecologist and possibly changing contraception methods if this lasts more than the first three to six months.
If you've just given birth, and you're experiencing heavy periods, you may need to wait. Periods following birth can be heavy, particularly if you don't breastfeed. However, your usual level of period should be restored within two to three cycles.

, If you trust in using aromatherapy as a treatment method, then this might assist, and probably in conjunction with other methods. Try a blend of two drops each of rose attar, Roman chamomile, and clary sage essential oils with four drops of sweet marjoram oil and two tablespoons of sweet almond or olive oil as the carrier oil. Rub this mixture over your stomach every night during menstruation, or have your partner do it for you.

, If you're also experiencing pain along with the heaviness, you can at least deal with the pain and remove one source of distress. If you don't have menstrual pain medication, you can also use regular pain killers, such as ibuprofen, to alleviate pain from cramping. Don't suffer in silence; get rid of the pain side of the period. Speak with your doctor if you're not sure what's safe to take to alleviate your period pain.

, Don't skimp: get your favorite brand and make sure you never have the chance of running out while you're on your period. Buy plenty of supplies in super size, including both tampons and pads. Have overnight pads on hand, too, since you should not sleep with a tampon.


Don't be dismayed that you need the super super size that absorbs the most; so what? It says nothing about you as a person or your physique.
If you're worried that a sanitary item might be showing through your clothes, try to check in a large mirror or ask a friend to prove to you that it's not. Often it's more a feeling than a reality, although you may need to avoid some body hugging styles if they do show.
For some people, tampons may not ever be adequate with a heavy flow, so be prepared to trial different types of sanitary coverage, including pads, menstrual cups, and other forms of menstruation protection.

, Those with heavy periods may experience occasional leakage onto clothing. If you're worried about leakage, try doubling up on pads to get maximum coverage. It is a good idea to have a second lower set of clothing in a locker, in a bag, or in another convenient place, just in case. Good friends, teachers, coworkers, and caring strangers will be kind enough to warn you when it happens if you can't tell. Ignore anyone who is unkind. It is not something to be embarrassed about; anyone who laughs is inconsiderate and lacks compassion.

, Cover beds, couches, sheets, etc., where you'll be sitting or lying for a while with a towel or other cover that is easily washable and will dry fast. It's far easier than getting blood off the mattress or couch cover and nobody is any the wiser when you whip it away.

, In some cases a heavy period is an indication that you may be experiencing a medical problem affecting your flow. A certain amount of blood loss is normal, but it's possible to lose too much blood and become anemic and weak. If your period lasts longer than a week, you're passing large blood clots, you soak through your pad or tampon every hour, and you feel weak or short of breath, you should see a doctor right away to find out what's causing the problem.Write a description of your typical period and other symptoms you tend to experience around the time of your flow.
Have your doctor check into issues that commonly cause heavy periods. A hormonal imbalance, fibroids, polyps, and more severe illnesses might be causing excessive blood loss.Your doctor will give you a pelvic examination and may also do a vaginal biopsy, ultrasound, blood tests, pap smear, or cervix biopsy.

Mother
Older sister
Older female cousin
Grandmother
Aunt
Female teacher
Female guidance counselor
Doctor or medical professional;
, If your mother is not present in your life, and you have no other women with whom you feel comfortable talking, be prepared to try to have the conversation with a male figure.


You could ask your father, an uncle, your grandfather, a male teacher, or a male guidance counselor.
Instead of having the conversation with this male figure, you could ask him to connect you with a female he knows who would be willing to talk with you about this, like a female coworker or neighbor.

, You likely have many questions, and you want to be sure to get all of them answered. Compile them into a list to ask during the conversation.


“How old were you when you got your first period?”
“What happens during a period?”
“What is a menstrual cycle?”
“Does having your period hurt?”
“How long does a period last?”
“What do I need to do to get ready for my period?”
“How will I know if I might be getting my first period?”
“Why do girls and women get periods?”
“Do you know of any books or websites that I can read to get even more information?”
“What does it mean when you haven't gotten your period by the 'normal age?'”
“What are the differences between different feminine hygiene products?”

, This is a sensitive topic for many girls and women, and it can be embarrassing and awkward to talk about getting your period. Plan out when and where you will have this conversation with your chosen trusted person.


It might be best to do it at a time when no one else is around or will be interrupting. Perhaps you could arrange it for an evening when you know other family members will be busy out of the house.
Have the conversation in a place where you feel comfortable, like at home, in your guidance counselor's office, or in a doctor's office.

, It is perfectly acceptable to bring up the conversation on-the-spot, but it could be helpful to pre-arrange when it will happen.

“I'm hoping to talk with you about getting my period. Do you feel comfortable having that conversation with me?”
“I think I might be getting close to having my first period. I feel comfortable talking to you about this, but if you don't feel comfortable, I can talk to someone else about it.”

, Once you have confirmed that your chosen trusted person is agreeable to having the conversation with you, start working your way through your list of questions.


Give him/her time to answer each question.
If other questions pop into your mind as he/she is talking, do not be afraid to ask them.
Be confident in asking your questions. It is completely normal and natural to have a period, and your chosen trusted adult almost certainly expects you to get yours soon, if you are within the average normal age range (10-15 years old)., Some people learn best by hearing, but other people learn by copying information onto paper. If you think you will want to be able to come back to this information someday, have a notepad with you during the talk to take notes on what you learn.

, Although the conversation might feel a little awkward, it is important to show your appreciation that he/she took the time to talk with you.


“Thank you for talking about this with me. I feel a lot more comfortable and ready for it to happen.”
“Having this talk with you really helped me. I know so much more now. Thank you!”
“You really helped me learn a lot about getting my period. Thanks for being willing to talk with me.”

Eat food that is rich in potassium.,
Cut down on salt.,
Be active.,
Achieve a healthy weight.,
Drink plenty of water.,
Cut down on caffeine and alcohol.",How to Avoid Water Retention1," Ensuring you have a healthy, balanced diet is a good first step to avoid water retention. Water retention can occur due to imbalances in your diet, deficiencies of some vitamins and minerals, and having too much salt. Eating a balanced diet will help to reduce the chances of water retention occurring due to these issues., As part of your healthy diet you should try to make sure you eat plenty of food that is rich in potassium. Eating plenty of potassium-rich food can help reduce the amount of salt in your body and relieve your water retention. Fruits and vegetables are generally good sources of potassium, so be sure you have at least five portions of fruit and vegetables a day.Some examples of potassium-rich foods include bananas, tomatoes, potatoes and avocados.
Leafy vegetables that are dark green also have lots of potassium.
Processed foods often have less potassium than non-processed foods.
White bread and white rice have less potassium than wholemeal bread and brown rice.Do not take potassium supplements, unless advised to do so by your doctor., If you have a lot of salt in your system, this may prompt your body to retain fluid. To help you avoid water retention, try to cut down on the amount of salt you consume each day. You can do this by eating fewer processed foods, which are typically high in salt, and not adding extra salt to meals you have cooked.


Think about other sources of sodium, such as soy sauce, soup, and canned vegetables and try to limit your intake.Get into the habit of looking at the ingredients labels and examining the amount of your daily allowance of salt each serving contains.
When buying processed food, look for the “low salt” or “low sodium” option.

, Having an active lifestyle that involves regular exercise is a crucial element is keeping your body functioning well. People who exercise regularly also report less instances of water retention.Adults should do both aerobic exercise and strength training each week in order to stay healthy.


Try to do at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity a week, such as cycling or fast walking. Or do at least 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, such as running or playing tennis.
Couple this with strength training two or more days a week.
Make sure the strength training works all your major muscle groups, such as your legs, back, arms, shoulders, and abdomen., People who suffer from fluid retention are sometimes overweight or obese. Achieving a healthy weight can help to you reduce and avoid water retention generally.Assess your weight and think about if it could be contributing to your fluid retention. You can check your BMI online here: http://www.nhs.uk/Tools/Pages/Healthyweightcalculator.aspx?Tag=Lose+weight


To lose weight you need to eat healthily and get plenty of exercise.
Aim to lose weight in a steady and controlled way.
Plan out your diet, and swap high fat and high sugar foods for healthier alternatives., You might think that drinking lots of water could lead to more water retention, but in fact, having a low intake of water causes your body to retain liquid. Keep well-hydrated to promote good kidney function and avoid water retention.Try to make it a habit to drink plenty of water throughout the day.


Men are advised to drink up to 3 litres (13 cups) of fluid a day, and women 2.2 litres (9 cups).Drink a glass of water before each meal.
Drink water before, during and after you exercise., Drinking more water isn’t the only way to try to tackle dehydration and the resulting water retention. Try to drink less caffeine and alcohol, as these substances increase your dehydration levels. Consider drinking decaffeinated teas and coffees during the day."

Consult your doctor.,
Ask about diuretics.,
Investigate birth control pills.,
Ask about dietary supplements.,
Consider herbal diuretics.",How to Avoid Water Retention2," If you are troubled by water retention, and the lifestyle changes have not improved the situation, make an appointment to talk to your doctor. There are a number of potential causes for water retention, and there may be an underlying issue that a doctor will need to diagnose and treat.


Your doctor may advise you on some additional minor things you can do to tackle fluid retention and swelling in the limbs.
They may recommend you avoid standing for long periods of time.
Or that you raise your legs regularly during the day to improve circulation., Chemical diuretics are one of the most common treatments your doctor will prescribe for fluid retention. These medications do have side-effects, however, and your doctor is unlikely to prescribe them if they think lifestyle changes can do the job.In some instances diuretics may even worsen the condition, as they change the balance of salt and water in the body.
Be sure to follow your doctor’s advice and only use prescribed medication according to the instructions you are given., It is common for women to suffer from premenstrual water retention, and there is some evidence that suggests the use of oral contraceptives can have a positive effect. Birth control pills that prevent ovulation can limit the physical symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, including water retention.Ask your doctor about this. They will be able to advise and talk you through the different options depending on your circumstances and symptoms.

, There are some supplements that may help you, but you should always consult with your doctor before taking anything. If you have premenstrual water retention, this is some evidence to support the use of calcium, magnesium, B vitamins, and vitamin E.


Lifestyle changes will always be preferable, so don’t try to take a shortcut by consuming lots of supplements.
Remember that taking too many supplements can cause you to develop other health problems., There are some people who claim that herbal diuretics can have a positive effect, and help you to avoid water retention. In theory certain natural substances make you urinate more, but there is little actual evidence to support this in practice. Talk to your doctor about potential herbal treatments, which may be combined with lifestyle changes. Some natural diuretics include:Ginger
Dandelion
Hawthorn
Parsley
Juniper

Recognise the connection to binging and dieting.,
Think about physical inactivity.,
Consider medications.,
Evaluate diseases and conditions that can lead to fluid retention.",How to Avoid Water Retention3," For women who suffer from water retention, there is often a connection to hormonal issues. Water retention is one of the most common symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. If you generally experience water retention every month, check it against your menstrual cycle on a calendar.Most women who experience this, will feel the unpleasant bloated feeling of water retention a week or two before their period begins.
Hormonal changes during pregnancy and menopause can also prompt water retention., Although there is still a lot of uncertainty about the various potential causes of water retention, there is some evidence to show that strict dieting and binge eating may be a causative factor. This is difficult to diagnose, but these sudden shifts may prompt your body to retain water., If you are standing for a long period of time, or are sitting still throughout a long journey, you may experience some water retention and swelling of your legs and ankles.If the blood ceases to flow at a good rate through your body, your lymphatic system may become congested, which in turn can cause swelling.


If you are on a long-haul flight, be sure to stand up and walk around every now and again.
Keep the blood flowing by moving your body to help prevent fluid retention and swelling., There are some medications that can cause water retention. If you are on any medication you should discuss this with your doctor and ask for her advice. Some of the medications that cause fluid retention include:Drugs that contain estrogen, such as oral contraceptives and hormone replacement therapies
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen
Beta-blockers, which are typically used to treat abnormal heart rhythms

, There are number of more serious medical conditions that may cause fluid retention and swelling. If you experience swelling, it is important that you take it seriously and investigate whether it is connected to another medical condition. Fluid retention can occur as a result of:Congestive heart failure. Heart failure can cause swelling in your abdomen and cause fluid to be stored in your lungs, resulting in shortness of breath.
Cirrhosis. Damage to your liver may cause fluid to gather in your legs and abdominal cavity.
Kidney disease or kidney damage. The extra fluid and sodium caused by kidney disease can lead to swelling in your legs and around your eyes.
Weakness or damage to the veins in your legs. If you experience acute swelling in one leg, together with pain and/or redness in the calf, there may be a blood clot and you should seek medical help immediately.
Problems with your lymphatic system. If your body is not draining excess fluid from tissue, this can lead to swelling.

Practice your handstand every day until you've perfected your form and you feel confident about moving on. If you are having trouble with this, you might not be ready just quite yet. If you need a refresher, here's how to do a handstand:









Stand on a flat surface with your legs spaced comfortably apart. Make sure your arms are up ready to go.
Take a big step forward with your dominant leg. In the same motion, tip your body forward over your lunged leg and place your hands on the ground, with your shoulders pulled close to your head.
Kick your legs up into the air, keeping them straight with your toes pointed toward the sky.
Keep your head between your arms and look at your hands as you balance.;
, You should also be able to perform a back bend from a standing position. Perfect your backbend by practicing for many hours before doing a limber. Here's how to do a backbend from a standing position:









Stand up straight with your feet shoulder width apart.
Raise your arms over your head and flatten your palms so they face the ceiling.
Slowly bend backwards toward the floor, keeping your arms locked.
Plant your hands on the ground, keeping your feet in place. Your body should be in an arc shape.

, If you're confident that you've mastered all the fundamentals, it's time to get ready to do a front limber. Get ready by stretching for several minutes to warm up your muscles.









Stretch your back by touching your toes, twisting from side to side, and doing some simple yoga techniques.
Stretch your wrists by rolling them in circles, then using one hand to pull back the fingers of the other hand (and vice versa).
Get your whole body warmed up by jogging around the block a few times.
Practice your handstand and backbend a couple of times to get the motion down. Now you're ready.

, The first few times you do a front limber, you should have a spotter nearby to support you. You might also want to use a barrel mat so that you'll won't have far to fall if you lose your balance. In any case, you should practice any new gymnastic move on supportive mats that will protect your wrists, feet and other pointy body parts.








, Hold it at the top for a few moments. If you're feeling nice and steady, proceed to the next step. If you're wobbly, drop down and start over. You need to have a good, solid handstand before you attempt a front limber.







, While you'd usually want to keep your back perfectly straight for a handstand, this time you want to arch it backward while pushing your shoulders out away from your head a bit. Your legs will naturally begin to arc toward the floor.









Keep your toes pointed until they reach the floor.

, You should land in a bridge position, as though you'd just completed a backbend.









Keep your head back. It helps to keep your eyes on your hands.

, In one fluid motion, you should plant your feet and move your weight forward so that you can stand up straight. You'll press your hips forward to lift your torso and head upright.









Land with your feet about a foot apart. This will help you keep your balance and lift yourself up.
From the moment your hands leave the floor, keep your arms straight on either side of your head. They should be upright for your landing.

, It's very similar to a front limber, except you drop one foot before dropping the other. Once you've got the limber down, this should be easy.








, This flashy move takes a lot of practice, so make sure you've perfected the preliminary moves before attempting it.








, The approach is quite different; you do a backbend, then lift your legs over your body.








, It's a wildly impressive move that cheerleaders often do. You'll need a lot of upper body strength to accomplish this one!

Stretch well.,
Practice on the floor, and along a line.,
Get comfortable with the four inch high/low beam.,
Try it with a spot.,
Ask your gymnastics coach, or someone who can do it perfectly, in a coach's opinion, if you're ready to try it on your own.

,
Stand in a lunge with your non-dominant leg forward.,
Kick your good leg forwards, and lean forwards, with good balance.

,
Unlike a front walkover, push off your foot instead of your hands, to flip into the air.

,
Avoid over circling, by landing on your bad leg, with just a slight touch on your good leg.

,
Finish in a lunge, gracefully.

",How to Do a Front Aerial on the Beam," It's safer if you stretch for at least 10 to 15 minutes, before attempting difficult skills.;
, A couple of prerequisites, (things you need to be able to do first) are a front walkover on the beam/line. Also, you'll need to be comfortable doing a front aerial, on the floor and line first. This will make it less likely to hurt yourself seriously.

, Most gymnasts at this level are already comfortable with the beam, but others may still have some fear doing harder tricks, and flips. Here are some tips to get comfortable with the beam:


Practice walking on it forwards, backwards, sideways, and in releve.
Practice jumps and turns, like half and full turns, and split jumps/leaps.
Practice easier skills like cartwheels, handstands, and back walkovers.

, The first time you do a front aerial on the beam, wide or thin, it must be with a spot. This is not a cartwheel, or a forward roll––it's an aerial, which is no-handed, requiring extra precaution.

,, This means placing your bad leg forwards.

Master the prerequisites.,
Ask your coach if you're ready.,
Prepare to simulate the motion.,
Perform the motion by splitting your legs and tumbling forward.,
Remove a mat and practice into the foam pit again.,

Protect yourself from injury while learning.,
Get a spot.,
Assume your start position and begin your forward motion.,
Drive back with your lower body.,
Lift your upper body.,
Land on your leading leg.,
Return to the neutral position and step forward.",How to Do a Front Aerial," Gymnastics skills build off of each other, and before you attempt the front aerial, you'll want to have mastered similar, more basic skills. This includes the front walk-over, the front handspring step-out, and the side-aerial.These skills involve attributes and motions comparable to the front aerial, and mastery will result in better execution.;
, Unless you have learned the right prerequisites, doing a front aerial without the proper equipment and supervision could result in serious neck or back injury. Your coach is the person who knows your skill level best, so ask them their opinion and advice.

, To help your body become accustomed to the uncanny sensation of doing an entire frontward revolution without the use of your hands, you're going to practice the motion into a foam pit. Stack two panel mats at the edge of the floor, near the foam pit.If your gym doesn't have a foam pit, talk with your coach and see if there's one nearby you can use for practice..

, Stand on one foot, push off by bending at the knee and driving with your leg, flip forward by leaning in and splitting your legs, and finally allow yourself to fall into the foam pit. This will help your body acclimate to the sensation of being upside down while unsupported and in motion.


Your distance from the foam pit will depend on your height. Be sure you are close enough to the foam pit that you clear its lip and the intervening space in the course of your tumble. Generally, about six inches (15¼ cm) should be sufficient.
Repeat this process several times until you are comfortable with the sensation.

, The less vertical assistance you have from the mats, the more you will have to engage your legs and core to launch your body through the air. The fewer mats you use, the more like the real thing your practice will become.

, Your flip differs from a front aerial in that the an aerial requires you to keep your legs extended, which will slow your rotational velocity. Approach your flip at a run and then execute. Once you feel comfortable, try to step into a front aerial., If you are comfortable with the previous drills and mastered the prerequisite skills, as your coach if you're ready to try a front aerial on the floor with height assistance. Take an eight inch mat and put it on a soft, padded gymnastics floor or carpet. Then stack three panel mats on top of each other, and another three behind those.Stand on the panel mats. Push off, flip, and land on the eight inch mat. Try to stick your landing!
Lower height by removing mats once you perfect this motion. Then do it with two panel mats, one panel mat, then no panel mats!

, Before trying to do a front aerial on plain floor, get a really thin mat, or a ""pit pillow,"" and place it on bouncy floor or regular floor. Start off from the floor, and aim to land on the thin mat.

, Your coach should be there for your first few attempts at an unaided front aerial for two reasons. Firstly, you'll want him to spot you while you master the move to prevent you from injuring yourself while learning. Secondly, he'll be able to give you pointers to improve your front aerial and make executing it easier., You should raise your arms up to your ears and lift your leading leg to step forward.Step into a lunge, bending your front leg to prepare to jump. Lower your shoulders to about the height of the knee of your forward leg and ready your arms to drive backward.

, You should drive the heel of your back leg toward the ceiling. As you begin to push through the motion, straighten your base leg and swing back with your arms., While your back heel and arms are reaching the highest/farthest point possible of your drive, you should also lift with your hips and chest. Finish the motion by pushing and jumping off your base leg, all the way through your foot., You'll need to stay tight and maintain eye contract with the floor while you drive your leading heel and arms through the motion. Keep your head back as your leading leg begins to reach the floor.As your leading foot finds the floor, your trailing leg will follow.
Keep your form tight and use your following leg as a counter-weight to pull your torso upright.
Keep your head back throughout.

, As you approach the upright position you will again find your balance. Your arms should finish circling by your ears as your trailing leg descends. Then, step forward onto your trailing leg in a controlled fashion to complete the skill."

Finish in a lunge.",How to Do a Dive Cartwheel," Pick a place to do your cartwheels that is open and level. You need a flat surface to work on so that you can practice getting your landing right. A cluttered area will be too dangerous and awkward to move around doing cartwheels, so choose a nice, open space.






;
, Doing cartwheels requires a large amount of open space. Make sure that your area is free of any objects that you might run into while doing your cartwheels. If there is something in your way that you can't move (like a tree if you are practicing outside), you might need to change locations. It can be difficult to see objects in your path as you are running and flipping in the air.








, To avoid hurting yourself, it might be a good idea to set up some kind of mat on the ground to lessen the hardness of your cartwheel surface, especially if you are a gymnastics beginner.The cushioned surface will provide more give when you bounce on it and this will help lessen the chance of injury in your wrists and ankles.








, Keeping your arms low (with your hand just a few inches from your side), make beach ball sized circles with your arms moving up and outward away from your body with each arm.You should end with your arms spread out behind you.








, With your prominent leg forward, take a large step and make a deep lunge. The lunge position will allow you to give yourself the extra spring up required for the dive cartwheel, so make sure the lunge is quite deep.








, If you lean your chest too far forward, you won't be able to push yourself up as high to achieve the dive cartwheel lift. Keep your chest upright so that you have the right range of motion with your legs. Lean forward slightly, but not too much.








, If you arch your back, it will mess up your cartwheel arc.So make sure you tuck your ribs in and keep your abdomen lined up with your shoulders.








, Keep your body lined up throughout the movement of the entire cartwheel. If you break the straight line, it can cause you to land awkwardly which could make you hurt your hips or wrists.









If you have trouble keeping your body in a straight line, try breaking the dive cartwheel sequence up into smaller bits and practicing your form for one section at a time. This will help you with muscle memory. And once you've practiced all of the parts, try combining them into the entire cartwheel again, making sure to keep your body in a straight line.

, You need to have some momentum going to give you the extra spring you'll need to perform a successful dive cartwheel. Give yourself a running start to get some speed and power in your movements.









Note: You might want to start slower in the beginning and speed up as you get more proficient.
Note: If you have trouble with the running start, try practicing the dive cartwheel from a standing position. It will be harder to get the lift you need, but this will help you work on the form without the hazard of speed to get in your way initially. Once you have perfected your body form for the cartwheel, try giving it a running start.

, While running, start making the outward arm circles as you simultaneously go into the lunge position. You should end up in the deep lunge at the same moment that your arms end up spread behind you.








, From the lunge position, push up with your forward leg that is bent in the lunge and spring up and bring your legs over your body. Keep your shoulders straight over your abdomen as you go into the air.









Note: If your shoulders go out of whack and don't remain centered over your abdomen, it can cause you to land on your hands in an awkward or dangerous position. If you are having problems getting your hands to hit the ground properly, you should probably focus on this aspect of your dive cartwheel. Try doing regular cartwheels over and over, focusing exclusively on your body form and keeping your abdomen squared under your shoulders. Once you master this, transition back to the dive cartwheel.

, Rather than hitting the ground with both hands at the same time (which could be more jarring and dangerous), you should land with your prominent hand first and immediately follow with your other hand. There will not be much of a time gap between the two hands landing, but just make sure they don't hit at the same time.








, As you bring your legs down, keep your arms up by your ears to help your body remain in a straight line.








Note: You should also try to squeeze your butt during this step so that it will help keep your legs up in a straight line as you come back down.

, You should finish in a lunge with your stomach tucked in, your shoulders squared forward, your arms still up by your ears, and facing in the opposite direction from when you started.

, The way you make your approach and execute the punch (your departure from the floor) will determine the height and distance of your jump.Practice your approach by taking a five rapid steps toward your jump.Put your feet together and launch yourself as high into the air as you can with your feet together and toes pointed.
Keep your arms up with your elbows straight through your practice jumps., The forward roll makes up the second half of the dive roll, after the approach and punch. Start by squatting down on the balls of your feet.


Place your hands flat on the floor, then tuck your head and lean forward the back of your head is aligned with your hands.
Push forward with your legs until you begin to roll, then tuck your body and keep your back rounded.
Complete the technique on your rear end or roll up onto your feet., Take five strong running steps before jumping off the floor and make sure your body is tight as you jump off of the floor or mat.Ensure your arms are above your head and your feet are together.
Tighten your stomach and rear end in the air to prepare to tuck.Imagine there is an invisible bar in front of you that you need to dive over and past in order to land safely., Think of yourself as jumping out of a window to help yourself put your body into position.


Keep your chin tucked to your chest to protect yourself as you jump.Move your body so your hands, while still above your head, are the first part of you to make contact with the floor.
Try to avoid bending your body at a ninety degree angle, instead try to keep relatively straight., Your hands should come into contact with the floor first. Keep the pressure on your hands from the moment they touch the floor until you roll through and complete the movement.Let your arms bend slightly to slow your descent as your roll forward.
Be careful not to land on your head or neck, as either can cause serious injury. Instead try to roll onto your shoulders, then to your back.

, As you land, allow your body to continue to roll until you are back on your rear end.


Keep your chin tucked until you are done rolling forward.
Bend your legs as you come down to better allow your body to roll.

Keep your hands extended outward to help you gain your balance as you roll onto your feet.

, Once your feet are on the ground, you need to stand up to complete the technique.As you stand, shift your hands from reaching out in front of you to straight above your head.
Straighten your elbows and hug your biceps to your ears for proper competition form.
Keep your heels together as you stand."

Get into your starting posture.,
Touch the floor.,
Lean forward.,
Kick up.,
Modify the donkey kick.",How to Do a Donkey Kick," Begin with both of your feet flat on the floor and your arms raised above your head, near your ears.Your feet should be positioned evenly right next to each other.


For children and beginners, you can adjust the starting position by beginning in a squatting position, resting your body weight on the balls of your feet. Your arms should be on the outside of your legs, flat on the floor.;
, If you are starting in a standing position, bend at your waist and knees to reach down and touch the floor. Your hands should be evenly positioned, about shoulder width apart.If you are starting in a squatting position, your hands are already on the floor, but should still be evenly positioned across from each other, about shoulder width apart on the outside of your knees.

, With your hands flat on the floor, lean forward (almost like you’re rocking), to shift your weight from your feet, and balance your body weight on your hands.Be sure to keep your arms and elbows straight as you shift your body weight to your hands. At this point, most of your body weight should be resting on your hands, and only your toes should be touching the floor.


Avoid turning or tucking your neck. You should try to keep your neck as neutral as possible.You can practice this movement a couple times until you get the positioning and rhythm of shifting your weight to you hands.

, When your weight is shifted to your arms and hands, use both of your feet to kick off from the floor and try to align your hips with your shoulders.Keep your knees bent as you kick off from the ground. Try to hold the position of your feet in the air, and then allow your feet to softly come back down to the floor. Both of your feet should land on the floor at the same time.This might take a few tries, but every time your kick off from your feet, try and lift the core of your body more and more upright.
As you’re able to align your hips above your shoulders, try to hold your body position (now in a half handstand), and slowly try to extend your legs into a full handstand.

, If kicking off the ground with both of your feet is too challenging, you can modify the donkey kick to kick off with one foot.From the squatting position with your hands on the ground, shift your body weight to your hands, and kick off from the ground with your dominant foot. For example, if you write with your right hand, your dominant foot is your right foot. Once your dominant foot is off the ground, bring your other foot up to meet your dominant foot in the air. Try to hold your body weight above you before coming back down and landing.


Your dominant foot kicking off the ground first is what gets your feet off the ground. Your other foot meeting your dominant foot is what helps lift your body up to align your hips over your shoulders, and position your core vertically.
You can also modify the landing to land on one foot rather than landing on both. Simply bring one foot down to the floor, and bring your other foot down to meet it.
Try to land as softly as you can. This will increase your stability and control as you learn how to perform a handstand."

, Before either trimming or shaving, wash your pubic area with soap or bodywash. The presence of bacteria can aggravate infection in case of a cut, nick or razor burn.

, The tools you use to trim your pubic hair can make or break the experience. Avoid regular-sized scissors, and try these options instead. Remember, whatever you choose, try to set that tool aside for only pubic hair maintenance to cut down on potential infections.


Nail scissors, which are small and ideal for sensitive maneuvering. If you can, buy a set with blunted ends. These can be found in the nail care section of most drug stores.
A small goatee, ear or nose hair trimmer, which should have a guard you can place over the blades to achieve uniform length. You can find these at most drugstores. Don't use an electric razor with rotating heads, which can cause painful razor burns.
Embroidery scissors will work in a pinch. They are like nail scissors, but be wary of the sharp points at the end.

, A new, disposable razor is best. A dull razor will encourage itchy red bumps. If the hair is long, trim beforehand. Consider shaving with the direction of the hair instead of against it; though it takes longer, it also causes less irritation. Use a gentle, unscented shaving cream or gel.

, Stand in the shower, or sit over the toilet. That way, clean-up simply consists of running the faucet or flushing.

, It's hard to gauge progress you can't see, so take a small mirror with you to check up on how things are going.

, You can do some minimal maintenance on the area without making it look too manicured. Simply trim the hair evenly, leaving it in its current shape. The length is somewhat up to you, but you will be limited by how close to the skin you can get.


Trim with scissors or an electric trimmer. To produce an even trim with scissors, consider running a comb through the hair and cutting against it (the way hairdressers do).

Remove all hair using wax (traditional) or by shaving (which will require more upkeep).

, Use a natural moisturiser like aloe vera, egg oil, coconut oil, cocoa butter, kokum butter etc. Good skin care is a must and will reduce discomfort later on. Make sure to choose a product that is perfume-free; the last thing you want is to scorch your most intimate areas with harsh chemicals. Something containing vitamin E and/or aloe will go a long way to making you more comfortable and may improve healing time and appearance.


Note that shaving and depilation leave your skin vulnerable to infection. Though applying rubbing alcohol will help prevent these infections, it will also burn, especially for women. Use at your own discretion.

, Getting started is the hardest part — after you wrangle your hair into the style you want, though, upkeep is fairly easy.


Re-do shaved areas every two or three days.
Re-trim hairy areas every one or two weeks.
Re-wax every four to six weeks.

Put one hand inside each end of the looped thread, with your palms up, before you rotate your hands several times. It might be enough to rotate them twice, although some experts suggest as much as 15 times.
Roll your right hand in a clockwise direction to twist the thread six or seven times times, or until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of intertwined thread between your hands.
Twist one hand clockwise and one counter clockwise. The end result is that this motion should end up twisting the thread in the middle. When you open up your palm and fingers with the thread around it at each end of the thread, you will create a circle of thread at each end with twisted thread in the middle.;
, Hold the string with your thumbs and index fingers inside the loops on each side, then pull your right thumb and index finger apart.










The twists of thread should move toward your left hand. Now, close the space between your right thumb and index finger and open the space between the left thumb and index finger.
This is the threading motion that traps hairs in the twisted thread and pulls them out.
In order to thread your eyebrows, you’re going to open and close your hands, and the thread. Your hand should be inside the thread loop when you open it so that part of the thread is on top and the other part of the thread is on the bottom of your hand., Make sure to thread the eyebrows in the opposite direction from which direction your hair grows. Notice the direction of hair growth first.










Place the thread under the eyebrow hair that needs removing. You could apply dry loose power on your eyebrows. That will make it easier for the thread to pull it out.
Open up the loop and hand in the opposite direction that you want to thread (left hand to thread to the right; right hand to thread to the left). You want to place the twisted section of the thread under the hair that needs removing. When you open and close the loops, the twisted portion of the thread will tug out the hair., As you twist the center of the loop, the twisted threads will pluck out the hair. Some experienced practitioners will hold the thread in their mouth, while manipulating the other ends of it with both hands. Others hold each end of the thread in a different hand.









You can do this fast or slow. It’s the process of opening and closing your fingers that is pulling out the hairs. Very experienced practitioners are able to do this process very quickly. When you are starting out, though, go slow.
Starting at the highest hairs you want removed, align the twists of thread to that hair. Open your right fingers in a smooth motion, moving the coil down, and then, open your left fingers to move the coil back. Continue these motions, working from the top to the bottom, aligning the coil of thread carefully before moving it up and down the removal area until all unwanted hair has been removed.
Threading can be used for lip and chin hair also. Clean your forehead with the same thread. The process lasts about 2 to 3 weeks.

, Although it sounds complicated, it’s really not. Threading your eyebrows has several advantages over other methods.Threading the eyebrows is faster than plucking. It will also remove tiny hairs that you are likely to miss with tweezers. Some people also consider threading a less-painful method than waxing and tweezing.Waxing can irritate the skin, but threading is unlikely to do so. Threading your eyebrows is also faster and cheaper than using at-home wax kits. If you learn how to do it yourself, you can save a lot of money. The thread might cost you under $1.Many cities have salons that offer eyebrow threading services. If you’re not confident with your ability to do it yourself, see a professional! Threading improperly could result in eyebrows that don't look good. Professional threaders are often required to have licenses or permits.However, some studies have found dermatological complications from threading., You will need a few key tools in order to thread your eyebrows. Luckily, none of these things costs very much, and they are widely available in drug stores. You may already have most or all of them at home.



Buy a spoolie or clean lash comb or, if you don’t have those, find a fine-toothed comb. Consider purchasing loose face powder. Although not essential, it’s a trick that can make threading eyebrows easier.
You will need very small scissors such as grooming scissors or those small scissors you can find in sewing kits.

, This is the most important tool that you will need to thread eyebrows. And here’s the key: Make sure that you buy 100 percent cotton sewing thread.You need a piece of thread that is the length of your forearm plus about three extra inches. Other experts say the thread should be about 15-24 inches long, and longer if you have big hands. The less string you use, the more control you will have. Choose thread that won't snap easily.Choose thread that doesn’t have a large amount of synthetic fiber in it, especially if your eyebrow hair is very coarse. If you can’t find 100-percent cotton thread, choose thread that has a high percentage of cotton in it. You can use regular thread you find at sewing or other stores.

, You shouldn't just thread your eyebrows randomly. Take some time first to figure out the shape you want.



Use a pencil to take the following 3 measurements in order to thread brows into a natural shape: to find the inside limit of the brow, measure a straight line from the corner of the nose to the inside corner of your eye, to find the outside limit of the brow, measure the edge of the nose to the outside edge of the eye, and to find the highest arch of the brow, measure the outside edge of the nose through the pupil.
Thread outside those lines. Use an eyebrow pencil to outline and fill in your eyebrows exactly how you want them. This will help you to ‘stay in the lines’ when you’re threading and prevent you from removing too much hair.

, Take your spoolie or other lash comb, and sweep your eyebrow hair upward. You should work on your eyebrows one section at a time.










Take the small scissors, and trim a tiny amount of the hair (not much at all, just the finest hairs that you see.) Next, sweep your eyebrows downward, and snip any hairs that are particularly long and that stand out.
Comb your eyebrow hair back into the place it normally is. It’s very important in this process that you don’t snip too much hair. Do this extremely lightly. Trim the extra hair at the beginning of the eyebrows with the scissors.

, Take the high-cotton sewing thread into your hand. The cotton thread is what you are going to use to pull out the hairs. First, though, you need to prepare the thread for the threading process.



Fold the thread over onto itself. That’s why it needs to be so long. You’re essentially turning the thread into a long loop.
To create the loop, tie the ends of the thread together. To do this, just make a knot at the end of the thread. The thread should not be open at either end. It should now form a large and continuous loop.

Have a beautiful body.,
Though beauty isn't only skin deep, your skin is worth protecting.,
Proper hygiene is a must.,
Keep your feet and hands looking great.,
Protect your teeth.,
Pick a great hairstyle.,
Choose a great wardrobe.,
Know that you're timeless.,
Seek wisdom.,
Be generous.,
Look for spiritual truth.,
Let go of bad feelings.,
Be authentic.,
Express gratitude.,
Develop beautiful surroundings.,
Maintain healthy relationships.,
Get involved in your community.",How to Be Beautiful," You don't have to subsist on kale smoothies or run ten miles a day to have a beautiful body. Having a beautiful body means taking care of what you put into your body and paying attention to what your body does.


Get some exercise. Working out for just thirty minutes three times a week can work wonders on your body. You'd be surprised what doing some yoga, taking a daily walk, or going for a swim will do for your sense of well-being.

You can meet new friends in exercise classes, or have some much-needed reflection time during your walks or swims.
Also, your skin will have a healthy glow, and you'll exude a sense of vitality.
If you exercise the right amount, you will also feel happier and will have more energy.


Be a healthy eater. It's okay to splurge on your favorite foods once in a while, but it's important to maintain a healthy diet so your body can feel good on the inside as well as look great on the outside.

Eat three balanced meals a day. Many people skip meals because they think it'll help them lose weight, but this will actually make you cranky and tired.
Have a healthy serving of fruits and vegetables every day. Make sure to dip your hand into your fruit bowl a few times a day, and to eat your veggies with as many meals as possible.
Avoid foods that are overly-processed or fatty because they will make you feel tired and may hurt your digestive system.


Listen to your body. Part of having a beautiful body is not overdoing it when it comes to working out or eating right.

If you're feeling extra tired or thinking you're coming down with a cold, it's okay to skip the workout you had planned. You're better off taking a break than making yourself feel worse, which can prevent you from exercising for even longer.
If you're really craving an ice cream sundae, eat it. It's better for you than eating everything else in your fridge except the thing you really want. You should give in to your cravings--with moderation.

;
, You will feel your best if your skin looks healthy and clean. Washing your face and using the right lotions and moisturizer can help you put your best face forward.


No matter what your skin tone, don't spend too much time in the sun. If you do get a lot of sun, then make sure that you wear a sunscreen with SPF 15 or higher protection.

Even if you're out during a cloudy day, the sun may still be affecting your skin, so make sure to touch your face or look in a mirror to avoid unexpected sunburn.


Drink lots of water. Water hydrates your skin from within and will help to combat peeling and dryness. At least eight cups of water a day is recommended.
Wash your face in the morning and at night. If your skin is oily, then use a cleanser to keep your face acne-free. If your skin is dry, then use a gentler cleanser and be sure to moisturize.
Care for your lips. Wear lip balm, particularly in the winter. If you want a little color along with protection, buy tinted lip balm.
Wear makeup if you have the time and if it makes you feel good. But if you do wear makeup, remember to remove it fully at the end of every day.

, Maintaining daily hygiene is a part of having a beautiful body. If you smell fresh and clean, you will be much more likely to make a good first impression.


Shower daily. This will keep your body smelling and looking fresh.
Wash your hair as often as you need to to keep it from looking greasy.
Wear deodorant to avoid giving off an undesired smell.

, These parts of your body take a lot of abuse from simple daily living. Make sure that your skin stays moist and your nails stay groomed., Not only do they give you a great smile, but they also keep you eating all of the foods that you love at any age. Brush your teeth every morning, every evening, and after every meal, if you can.


In addition to regular brushing and flossing, get a check-up at the dentist every 6 months. This will prevent any major issues that many arise with your pearly whites.
If you want to, try some teeth whitening solutions.

, Hair is your crowning glory. If you've got it, then style it in a way that flatters your face and choose a great color if you don't like your own.


If you don't have much, either clip it short or get a great hat (or several hats) to communicate a message about your personal style.
Maintain healthy hair by brushing it every day, and getting a haircut at least every two months. This will go a long way in helping your hair look its best.

, Your wardrobe does not have to be expensive to be beautiful. It just has to showcase your style and flatter your body. Remember to choose quality over quantity.


Choose good fabrics and flattering colors that you can wash without dry cleaning. Instead of buying 2 cheap shirts that won't last very long, save your money to purchase a well-made shirt that can last for multiple seasons.
You can always find great brands and really unique pieces for less at consignment shops or thrift shops.

, Your beauty regimen will change over time as your body changes, but you're still you. You don't have to look the way you did when you were 25 to be beautiful. You just need to take good care of yourself and put your best foot forward every day.

, People who cultivate inner wisdom and live their lives abiding by wise principles will radiate beauty and blessing to everyone around them. Wisdom can never fully be attained--it's a growing process, and there's always something more to learn.


Meditate or reflect on your actions. You can learn a lot if you take the time to do nothing but think, whether you're meditating, writing in a journal, or just admiring a beautiful view in a park.
Read the works of wise people. You can learn a lot from novelists, poets, or historians. Reading can help you gain knowledge and put your ideas into perspective.
Listen carefully to the ideas of people you genuinely respect.People who are working in a similar field as you, who are involved in healthy relationships, or simply have a lot of life experience can help inform your every day life.
Be more cultured. Watching foreign films, learning a new language, or going to a museum once a month can help you gain an appreciation for how big the world is, and can make you more wise.

, You don't have to be wealthy to develop a generous spirit. Give something to charity on a regular basis, even if you can't give a lot.


If you can't give money or possessions, then give generously of your time. Open your home and share a meal, some tea, or a bottle of wine with friends.
The holidays are a great time to tap into the spirit of generosity. Visit an elderly neighbor or family member, buy gifts for someone who is less fortunate, or help prepare a holiday meal for someone who could use the company.

, Maybe you are a devout follower of a religion. Or perhaps you don't believe in a specific deity, but you find great spiritual satisfaction in creating art or spending time in nature. You will starve your spiritual side if you focus too much on rules and dogma or if you only want scientific truth instead of spiritual truth.


Find a way to see yourself as part of something larger so that you can be more compassionate toward your fellow humans.
Traveling to new locations, or taking in remarkable views, can help you do this.

, Your feelings are important because they tell you what you like and what you don't. However, if you hold on to bad feelings for a long time, they will poison your soul.


Control your emotions. If you're angry with someone, don't let it turn into bitterness or resentment. Go out into your backyard and scream, call a friend and vent, or take a kickboxing class to work it out. Then forgive, be the bigger person, and make smarter choices next time.
Get closure--if you really need it. If you want to share your feelings with someone who hurt you because you think it will resolve your conflict, then it's the right thing to do. However, if you just want to yell at someone, or to get a litany of complaints off your chest, you may be better off writing down your feelings. An unproductive or even a one-sided argument will only make you feel worse and will remind you of your negative feelings.

, Say what you mean. Live life according to your values. State your opinion in a courteous way. Don't pretend to be someone else for someone else's imagined benefit. The world needs you, just as you are.


Be authentic--with caution. Part of being a beautiful person is knowing when you should hold your tongue. Here are some situations where it's better to not say what you mean:

If a loved one is having a particularly bad day, that is not the time to tell them about their flaws. Timing is everything if you want to share your opinions.
If someone is rude to you in public, there's no reason to fight back. Instead, be the bigger person and realize that that person is probably having a bad day.


Leave room for improvement. Though it's important to be yourself, it's equally important to recognize that we are all flawed beings and that you can always improve your character. Be aware of your flaws and accept constructive criticism.

, Whether you're grateful to a Higher Power, to your family and friends or to someone who's courteous to you at the market, take the time to say ""thanks."" Many people find that keeping a gratitude journal helps them to focus on what they have rather than on what they don't. Here are some other ways to express gratitude:


Send your close friends cards that tell them how much they mean to you. You can do this on a birthday or holiday, but your words may mean the most if you do it just because.
Give small and meaningful gifts. Even if you don't have a big budget, giving your friend the book of poetry she's been talking about, or even painting her a picture of your favorite place, can show how grateful you are.
Tell your loved ones how you feel. Tell your significant other, best friend, and family members that you love and appreciate them as often as you can.

, You don't need a mansion or an elaborate country garden. However, your surroundings often reflect your inner state of being.


Less is more. Go through your clutter and throw away unwanted items. Give a room a fresh coat of paint, or buy a nice plant for your living space.
Fix up your place. Tackle that maintenance problem that you've been neglecting. Wherever you are, you can make your space your own.
Add a few plants to your life. If you have a balcony, a few plants can be a great addition, and may even help spice up your meals.
Remind yourself of what you love most. Hang up pictures of your loved ones, or your favorite places. You will always feel at home even if you're far away from some of your favorite people.

, Even if you don't have a million friends, having a strong support system is a key to being a beautiful person. It's important to maintain the relationships that will help you grow as a person.


Make time for old friends. Old friends have known you the longest, and can help remind you of where you came from, and how far you've traveled.
Develop new friendships. It's never too late to make a new friend, even if you're busy with work and family. You can learn something new, grow as a person, and have fun getting to know a new individual.
Stay in touch with your family. Make time to see your family as often as you can. If they are far away, make type for a phone call, or even write a letter.
Drop your unhealthy friendships. It's important to maintain your relationships, but if you find yourself in a friendship that is one-sided and just makes you feel bad about yourself, you should recognize that not every relationship is worth saving.

, Do you feel passionately about helping the world to become a better place? Then find your own small corner and start doing something to participate. Here are some great ways to get involved:


Raise money for a local animal shelter.
Buy from local businesses. This will help your community thrive.
Go to a town or county festival. You will meet your fellow residents and will learn more about your surroundings.
Throw a block party for your neighbors.
Start a book club for your community.
Volunteer as a reading tutor at your local library or community center. Teaching adults and children how to read will change their lives forever.
Remember that you have what the world needs. People with inner beauty don't hide it; they share it with others.

Surround yourself with mystical people.",How to Be a Mystic," Whether you think of yourself as a deeply spiritual person or not, a mystic is one who seeks to find order in the chaos and collect evidence of that order. If you're the kind of person who sees every strange coincidence, every elegant metaphor, or every pretty rainbow as a sign of something greater, you might begin to feel the presence of a guiding hand in which you place your trust.Religious mystics place their trust in a higher power, a powerful being that creates and controls the world and the people in it. Sometimes, as in the case of Zen Buddhism, religious mystics will also place their trust in a practice, that asceticism and meditation are the truest way to understand the world.
Mystics aren't always religious, though they often are. The writing of quantum physicists and Jungian psychologists often borders on the mystical, the deeper it gets. Whatever system, being, or practice you've found in which to place your trust, place it there.;
, Seek to find order and balance in the world, rather than emphasizing differences and disparities. Look for things you have in common with your enemies.Regardless of your spiritual or religious leanings, it's good to read and study a wide variety of mystical writings, across disciplines and dogmas. Christian writer Thomas Merton spent considerable time studying Zen Buddhism,

, What is a mystic? What differentiates a Christian mystic from a regular Christian, or a Buddhist mystic from a regular Buddhist? Across practices, disciplines, and cultures, mystics have one thing in common: a deep personal and spiritual connection to their belief system. To the mystic, a personal experience of spirituality is always more powerful and more important than book-learning or hearsay. Simply going to church isn't enough for the mystic.


Avoid the showy materialist trappings of some religions. You don't need an expensive rock garden, koi pond, and meditation pad to be a Buddhist mystic. You don't need a 13th century crucifix to be a Christian.

, Mystics need to center themselves and be fully present at all times. A mystic isn't distracted by electronic devices, stresses, or complex schedules for the day. Instead, the mystic should be focused completely on doing one thing and one thing only. When you're eating lunch, just eat lunch. Focus entirely on nourishing your body, slowing down, enjoying what you eat. When you're reading the newspaper, just focus on learning, reading the words, and understanding the concepts. Put yourself completely into each task.


This can be surprisingly difficult, and it won't happen right away. Buzzing text alerts and constant 21st century noise can make it hard to slow down and focus. Try to simplify your life as much as possible. Start small. Put your phone away, except when you actively need it to make a call or send a message.

, Mystics want personal connections to the spiritual world and the self, not hearsay. Received wisdom and platitudes are made to be questioned by mystics. If you want to develop your mystical connections to the world, both seen and unseen, start asking the big questions.Whatever you religious or spiritual leanings, learn to embrace the big questions:


Why are we here?
What does it mean to live a good life?
Who am I?
What happens when we die? What does death mean to me?

, Not only is it important to ask the big questions, but to trust that your instincts will lead you to the answers that you seek. Trust in yourself. Develop your intuition and your self-reliance. Eliminate your doubts and trust that you'll have the faith to discover what you're looking for., Studying mystical writings and tomes is an essential way to learn about the lives of the mystics. Each tradition will have a wide variety of different mystics and different dogmas, and it's important to get some sense of the scope of different writings. Everything starts to seem interconnected and becomes more alike than different:


Thomas Merton's No Man is an Island

St. Augustine's Confessions of St. Augustine

The Cloud of Unknowing, written anonymously
Julian of Norwich's Revelation of Divine Love

DT Suzuki's An Introduction to Zen Buddhism

The Nasruddin Stories from the Sufic tradition

, Mystical practice is a combination of self-imposed meditation and contemplation and the specific guidelines of your religion or other practice. Each religious life will be different, because each religious person is different. Deciding what's most important to you and your practice is a decision that only one person can make. You.For some mystical Christians, living life as close to the way Christ lived is the most important aspect of practicing. For others, spreading the gospel is essential. Both ways of thinking can lead to mysticism and deep appreciations of the spiritual world.

, Mystics aren't part-time. Whatever your deep connection to religion and the big questions, it needs to be your biggest priority in life. Not your job, your family, or your hobbies. Your connection with the cosmos needs to be your biggest commitment.For many people, being a mystic is an entirely solitary life. Most mystics are monastic for a reason. If you want to be a mystic, it's hard to go out on Saturday night and have fun. Are you up to the challenge to commit?

, Part of Zen meditation revolves around letting go of these big concerns and embracing the void. For the mystic, that void should be your living room. Trusting in your instincts and diving into the biggest questions has a tendency to lead to even more questions than answers. It could either be frustrating or liberating to realize that you might never know what will happen after you die, or whether or not you're really ""right"" about your way of interpreting the world.

, Whatever religion or belief system that you align you with, or even if you don't align yourself with any organized religion at all, you need to carve out time in your schedule for deep contemplation and meditative training. Pray, meditate, and contemplate constantly.



To start praying, focus less on asking specific yes-no types of questions and more on focusing on feeling. How does it feel to get in touch with the higher power in which you believe? How does talking with your god affect your soul?
For some monastics, time needs to be divided evenly between reading the great texts, meditating, and experiencing the world. As a general rule of thumb, don't spend more time praying than you spend studying the religious texts you study, and vice versa.

, There's no specific goal or outcome of a meditative practice. You don't come out the other side of a meditation sitting feeling as if you've learned something, necessarily, or as if you've solved the big problems that you seek. Instead, focus on stilling yourself and increasing your awareness, then taking that into the world.



To start meditating, learn to still your thoughts and watch them float through your mind without identifying them actively. Just sit, focus on your breathing, and fix your gaze on the void.
Try to hold onto your meditation-mind for as long as possible throughout the day. Notice the little things. Slow down.

, A popular Zen saying compares Zen to a boat. You use when you need to cross the river, but you don't take it with you. Learn to leave your Zen on the shore when it becomes unnecessary. Religion, meditative practices, and other aspects of your mystical experience should serve your understanding of the world, not burden it.

, It's important to spend time with like-minded believers who take their mystical practice seriously. Learn by observing and having complicated conversations with people from your church, organization, or other religious groups. Bounce ideas and interpretations off each other. Learn as much as you can.


In some traditions, finding a teacher, mentor, or guru is an essential part of practicing your own brand of mysticism and developing as a mystical thinker. If you're ready to pledge yourself to a serious practice, consider finding a personal teacher.

Develop a talent.,
Show off your talent.,
Get feedback.,
Have a mentor.,
Learn from your failures.",How to Be Awesome1," Whatever your talent is, pursue it. People who become ""awesome"" at what they do invest a lot of time into getting there. Who ever said that being awesome was easy?


Some theories say that it takes about 10,000 hours of practice before you can truly master something.Now, that's a lot of hours, and it's totally possible to have an awesome talent before even 1,000 hours of practice. But the people who really have amazing, awe-inspiring talent — Bill Gates, Mozart, Feliks Zemdegs — spent a lot of time preparing to be awesome.
While you're practicing your talent, find ways to motivate yourself. Break your goal down into small chunks. Reward yourself with free time, a snack, or that new video game after you've achieved what you wanted to achieve.;
, You could be the most amazing dancer or writer in the world, but you won't inspire awe in people if they never see your talent. Being awesome, by definition, means putting yourself out there, no matter how scary that is. However remember not to show off too much, like bragging for instance, for people might think you're being a show-off.


Start small. Once in a blue moon, people will start developing a talent and have instant success. For us mortals, it usually takes a while for that talent to develop. So start small. Work yourself up to greatness.
At the same time, think of the ""biggest stage"" your talent can be showcased in. Magicians want to pack auditoriums in Vegas. Singers want to have a #1 Billboard single. Soccer players want to win a World Cup. Don't be afraid to dream big when practicing your talent. That's part of what keeps you going.

, Whether it's from a coach, a parent, or a panel, getting advice on what you can do to get better at your talent is absolutely essential. A famous poet once said, ""No man is an island."" What John Donne meant by that is that you need to rely on other people to help you out. You can't do everything by yourself.


Always ask other experts in related fields how you can get better. Your desire to be awesome is directly related to your willingness to develop your talent into the best it can be. Ask other magicians for help; reach out to actors for techniques; attend basketball camps to develop your skills.

, A mentor is someone who is experienced in your field and willing to give you advice and help with the direction you want to take your talent. Having a mentor is huge for people who want to be awesome because of a talent; a mentor will help them process feedback, get new opportunities to show off talent, and network with other people who might continue to help them out.


Reach out to other people who might act as a mentor. You can say something as simple as ""I was hoping I could get some advice from the world's best flutist about the flute solo in Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 2. Any help would be greatly appreciated!""
Understand what other people get out of being a mentor. A mentor isn't a one-sided relationship, the master just showing the pupil how to get things done. The mentor gets value and happiness out of knowing that they helped you succeed, that they helped mold you into a more dedicated, awesome individual. That's huge!
Show your mentor respect. You might think that your mentor's advice is a little off the mark, but try it before you dismiss it. There's a reason s/he's an expert and you aren't. Respect them by taking their advice very seriously.

, It's a given that when developing a talent, you're going to fail every so often. If you didn't fail, you wouldn't be human. Many people give up when they fail. If you want to be awesome, what you'll have to do is get right back up, shake it off, and learn from your mistakes, not let them keep you down.


Get your ego out of the picture. Not only will this help you shake off your mistakes more easily, it will help you develop a more selfless, humble attitude. If you didn't already know it, most people think people who exhibit greatness but still manage to be humble are ""especially awesome"".

Be funny.,
Be adventurous.,
Unlock your inner awesome.,
Express your awesome traits through style.,
Have a fun personality.",How to Be Awesome2," All but the most hardened cynics like someone who can make them smile and laugh. That's why being funny is a huge part of using your personality to be awesome. The good and the bad part about comedy is that there's no one way to do it. That means that you can develop your own sense of what's funny by being totally original, but it also means that there's not really a ""how-to"" manual for being funny.


Be funny with words. Puns and wordplay are a great way to be awesomely funny because we use words all the time. Consider these examples of great wordplay:

""Some cause happiness wherever they go; others whenever they go."" - Oscar Wilde.

""Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses."" - Dorothy Parker.


Use physical comedy to get laughter. Physical comedy can include impressions of other people, learning how to mime, or slapstick comedy. Pick one, experiment with it, and try incorporating it into your funny routine.
Tell great stories. We think people who tell great, comedic stories are funny because we live for stories. Stories make us feel human, and so someone who can tell a great yarn delights us. Learn the basics of storytelling to feel even more awesome than you already are.

, Being adventurous means turning everyday opportunities into excuses to find adventure. Remember, you don't need to be Indiana Jones to be adventurous; you just need to be willing to take the road less traveled every once in a while.


Travel to new, interesting places. Traveling doesn't need to mean dropping lots of money or taking lots of time. Try going someplace close you've never been. You'll learn about new places, have a new notch under your belt, and will get a chance to convince the locals there how awesome you can be.
Learn about unexpected things. Being adventurous can also mean taking a journey of the mind. Now, that sounds cheesy, but it's absolutely true. The most awesome people in the world travel to novel, exciting, distant places in their minds as well as on their feet.
Don't be afraid to break away from the pack if it's what you want to do. Sometimes, an awesome person will be adventurous by following his/her heart and set out on their own, against the advice of other people. Be adventurous by doing what you want to do, not what other people want you to do.

, The most awesome people aren't even aware of their awesomeness. They just are, without thinking about it too much. The awesomeness must come from a place within you. You can never force it out.


Try not to focus on ""being awesome."" Instead, focus on the things that will make you awesome, like developing a way to convert certain recyclables into bio-diesel, or learning how to play pool with hockey pucks on ice. That way, people will be overwhelmed by your awesomeness before they have time to question it.

, Develop a style that is entirely your own. Don't mimic a style that you think is hip; make your own style hip by believing completely in it and never questioning what other people say about it.


Perhaps have a trade-mark accessory by which everyone will recognize you as soon as they see it. Use it, but don't abuse it. Shake off any criticism you may get from other people (they're probably jealous or insecure) and wear it with confidence.
Sometimes, having no style is as much of a statement. Some people genuinely don't care about fashion, clothes, or accessories. Lots of people celebrate that because those people are usually absorbed in other things. If you're this kind of person, be comfortable with your lack of style. Don't judge others for spending more time on clothing.

, Realize that your personality says more about you as a person that your looks or appearance, although those can be important. Be nice, understanding, friendly, giving, and charming (both inside and out). People don't like a mean, selfish, unfriendly, boring person.


Some traits that people generally think of as ""awesome"":
Dedication/faithfulness. You are supremely dedicated to whatever you start, and are faithful to a fault.
Reliability. You are someone who can always be depended on when people need you, for whatever reason.
Kindness/generosity. You are willing to literally give the shirt off your back if you can afford to, and if it means that it will make someone else happy.
Ambition. Although your goals are lofty, you would never step over someone to achieve them.
Perspective. You can tell the forest from the trees; you know that the simple things in life — friends, family, love, health — are too often the most overlooked.
Principle. You know what you believe in, and you have good reasons for holding those beliefs.

Be a role model to younger kids.,
Get involved in politics.,
Help people less privileged than you.,
Get involved in a cause that you believe in.",How to Be Awesome3," You can be a role model in so many different ways. Consider this, however: if you do decide to help out kids, be sure you're doing it for the right reasons. Helping kids just because you want to be viewed as awesome is a little bit like going on a diet because you want people to like you, not because you want to be healthy.


Volunteer as a teacher. Teach kids how to read, how to perform basic math, or how to value exercise. Hold onto your patience and remember that not every kid learns material the same way!
Be a mentor to a kid. In the same way that you might have needed a mentor, kids need mentors, too. They want reliable information about relationships, drugs, careers, and life. You can be that source of guidance for a child you take a liking to.
Carve out time just to hang out. If you're happy, positive, responsible, and mature, kids will be happy just to hang out with you. You won't have to do much to be awesome in their eyes. Lend them a bit of your time and you may find that simply hanging out can be lots of fun.

, How often do we complain about about politics? All the time. How often do we do anything about it? Not very much. Running for office is a great way to make a difference in your community by testing your political chops. Plus, who can say that they actually ran for office? That's pretty awesome!


If you're younger, think about getting involved in student government. It may not have the reach that municipal, state, or federal government has, but it's just as important to the people around you. You'll learn a whole lot more about yourself the more you participate.

, There's no legal responsibility to be charitable, but there might be a moral responsibility. If you were helped out by someone on your life journey, or if you just believe in the principle, think about paying it forward. Help the less advantaged find their way.


Get connected through your local church group. If you're part of a community of believers, ask members of your church if they know how you might get involved in charity work. Often, your church will have programs or information about how normal people can best help.
Consider making a microloan. A microloan is a small amount of money ($20, for example) that you lend out to other people through a lending institution. The people who get the loan are usually from very poor countries; they use the money to build hospitals, schools, generators, or simply to farm. After they have used the loan, you get the money back. It's a great way to make a difference around the world.
Do random acts of kindness. Hold the door open for a person struggling to make the bus; give a homeless person the rest of your take-out lunch; tell your colleague how much you value their hard work. These small acts of kindness take almost no energy or resources to complete, and can have a huge impact.

, What do you believe in? Do you believe in animal rights? Get involved in PETA or a similar organization. Do you believe in fighting global warming? Get involved in green energy solutions. Do you believe in basic financial literacy? Get involved in guerrilla economics. Whatever it is you believe in, being awesome is all about showing the world what makes you tick.

Try tweezing.,
Try an epilator.,
Try dyeing the hair.,
Try a chemical depilatory.,
Try waxing.,
Try threading.,
Try trimming.,
Shave sparingly.",How to Get Rid of Female Facial Hair1," Tweezing, or pulling the hair out with tweezers, is a cheap and effective way to remove hair from any area on the face. The major downsides are only that it is time-consuming and somewhat painful, especially in sensitive areas.;
, An Epilator is a device, usually priced between $30-100, which works by pulling out multiple hairs at once. While effective, fast, and relatively inexpensive, it can be painful the first few times it’s used. Like with waxing, however, the pain lessens over time as you become used to the sensation.

, Often referred to as “bleaching”, this is the practice of dyeing the hair to be the same or a similar color to the skin tone. This makes it less noticeable. What color you choose will be based on your skin tone and special kits can often be purchased for the face.

, This is any one of a number of creams, lotions, and similar products which use a chemical process to ""melt"" the hair. These are cheap, easy to use, and generally pain-free. However, they can cause chemical burns if used incorrectly and the effects generally last only a week.

, Waxing is one of the more common ways to remove facial hair. The cost of the procedure will depend upon what part of your face you have waxed, but it is generally not too expensive. The effects will usually last a few weeks but the procedure is painful. It can also result in ingrown hairs., The pain of waxing and the expense of an epilator not for you? Threading is an easy way to remove hair from your brows, lip, or face in general. This method is simple to learn, easy to do, relatively painless, and doesn't require any tools. All you need is some string! You can also go in to a salon for professional threading, but only if you really want to.

, If you are worried about your eyebrows more than other facial hair, consider trimming the hair rather than removing it. Trimming the eyebrows can make them appear less thick and dark and is easy and cheap to do yourself at home.

, You can, of course, also shave any facial hair which bothers you. While it is not true that shaving will make hair grow back thicker or darker, shaving will often cause shaving bumps and is most likely to cause ingrown hairs so use shaving sparingly or with appropriate precautions."

Consider laser hair removal.,
Consider electrolysis.,
Try prescription creams.,
Try hormone treatments or oral contraceptives.",How to Get Rid of Female Facial Hair2," This process uses light pulses to destroy the root of the hair. It doesn’t automatically remove the hair but does cause it to fall out over time. It works best for those with dark hair and light skin and getting it otherwise is very difficult or impossible. It costs several hundred dollars and touch-ups will be needed once a year. It does significantly reduce the appearance of hair, however.

, This is the only hair removal method currently certified by the FDA as being permanent. It is done by inserting a very small needle into the skin and destroying the cell which cause hair growth. It is very effective and is similar to the cost of laser hair removal. There are 2 types of electrolysis that can cause scarring (Thermolysis and The Blend) and are not recommended for those with darker skin tones (as they are at greater risk of scarring). However, there is one type of electrolysis that is not associated with scarring (as there is no heat in the process) called Galvanic which is suitable for all skin types. , There is a prescription cream which will work very similarly to the depilatories above. While it is not usually able permanently remove hair on its own, there is some evidence that it can occasionally produce this effect. However, since it is usually considered an elective treatment, the cream may not be covered under your medical insurance.

, If your hair thickness and color are hormone-based (only your doctor can determine this), you may be able to return the hair to normal by using hormone treatments or oral contraceptives (which also regulate the hormones). Consult with your doctor about your options and condition.

Ask your doctor about recommended treatments.,
Consult about associated risks.,
Consider underlying health conditions.",How to Get Rid of Female Facial Hair3," When you determine that you would like to remove or reduce your facial hair, consider consulting with your physician. They should be able to recommend and discuss various options, as well as provide warnings regarding the risks.

, Each of the above procedures has associated risks. Before undergoing any, it is a good idea to consult with your doctor about those associated health risks. For example, electrolysis cannot be used if you have a pacemaker.

, You and your doctor will also need to consider underlying health conditions. There are a number of conditions, some benign and easy to treat while others can be more worrying, which can cause more hair growth or hair growth in unusual areas.


Hormone fluxes, which can cause changes like these, are associated with age (making young teen girls and older women more prone to this problem).
Hair changes can also be caused by tumors in the glands which control hormones or in response to pregnancy or certain medications.
Look out for other symptoms associated with hormone disorders (like irregular periods, weight gain, acne, or hair loss). Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common hormone condition that affects up to 10% of women and is a cause of unwanted hair (also known as hirsutism). Medicines used in the treatment of PCOS can significantly improve excess hair problems.

Notice your thoughts.,
Write a journal.,
Become aware of your perceptions.,
Recognize your feelings.",How to Analyze Yourself1," Your thoughts are an integral part of who you are. They often guide how you feel as well as your attitude and perceptions of situations. Monitor your thoughts and recognize the content. Are your thoughts negative? Do you put yourself down, or always think something will go wrong? Which areas of your life are you most hard on yourself?


Do this in every aspect of your life. You want to make sure you think about your thoughts every day and during all different kinds of activities.;
, To help you keep track of your thoughts everyday, start a journal and write about your day, your struggles, your goals, and your dreams. Analyze your journal entries and take note of their quality. Are the hopeful or bleak? Do you feel stuck or powerful? Continue to analyze your thoughts to become more aware of who you are.

, Sometimes our perceptions of situations lead us to make faulty conclusions about what happened or what we saw. For example, if you perceived that your friend was mad at you after lunch, you may be confused and automatically think that because her mood was low, you did something wrong. Becoming aware of your perception of her mood can help you to analyze why you jumped to the conclusion she was mad at you.


When you have a situation like this, take time to analyze your actions and beliefs about what occurred. Write down what you saw, heard, or felt that made you interpret the situation in the way that you did. Ask yourself if there could be other causes for your friends mood or if there are outside factors that you are unaware of.

, Your feelings can also give you clues into who you are and why you react to certain situations or people in the way that you do. Analyze your feelings by becoming aware of your reactions to topics of conversations, tones of voices, facial expressions, and body language. Identify what you are feeling and ask yourself why you had this type of emotional response. What were you responding to? What about it made you feel the way you do?


You can also use physical cues to tune you into how you are feeling. For example, if you notice you are breathing heavier or faster, so may be stressed, mad, or afraid.If you can't figure out exactly how you feel at first, keep writing down your reactions and thoughts about certain situations. You may need time and distance from a situation to recognize how you feel.
You also can ask a trusted friend or family member to help go over your thoughts and reactions to help you figure out exactly what you feel. It may be hard for you to distance yourself enough from the ideas to truly know how you feel or what these things mean about you.

Understand values.,
Identify your values.,
Group your core values.",How to Analyze Yourself2," Knowing what you value can give you insight into who you are at your core. Many values are based on your personal experiences, and some change as you learn more about yourself.


Sometimes values are hard to identify because the term and concept is abstract and often vague. Your values are your beliefs and ideals that you base your choices on throughout life., Identifying and defining your values will bring you closer to realizing who you are and what is important to you. In order to seek out your values, you will need to spend some time in reflection, analyzing what is important to you and which values make you who you are. Begin identifying your values by writing your answers to the following questions:


Identify two people you most admire. What are the qualities they have that you admire? What is it about this person that makes them admirable to you?
If you could only have three of your possessions for the rest of you life, which would they be? Why?
What topics, events, or hobbies are you passionate about? Why are these things important to you? What is it about these things that make you passionate?
What event made you feel the most complete and fulfilled? What about that time made you feel this way? Why?, You should start to have an idea about what is important to you and what you value. Try to group these ideas, moments, or things into core values to help you have a better idea of your core beliefs and ideals. Some examples of core values include courtesy, honesty, optimism, confidence, friendship, achievement, faith, friendship, kindness, justice, trust, and peace.


Use these core values to understand and know yourself better. These values should help you make choices and identify what is important to you. Through analyzing yourself in this way, you are that much closer to unlocking your true self.Your may have multiple groups of values. This is normal because humans are complex and feel many different things. For example, you may value honesty, faith, competence, and confidence, values that don't necessarily group together. But these traits show you the kinds of situations and people you value around you as well as traits you likely strive for in yourself.

Write your story.,
Analyze your story.,
Decide what your analysis means.,
Remember that it takes time.",How to Analyze Yourself3," Writing your life’s story can tell you a lot about who you are as well as how you view your life’s challenges, joys, opportunities, and struggles. Writing out your personal story can give you insight into what you have learned through your experiences and how those experiences have affected you.In this way, you can analyze how your experiences helped shape who you are, which encompasses your values, attitudes, beliefs, biases, reactions, and the way you interact with your world.

, Once you’ve written the story of your life, analyze yourself by asking the following questions:


What are the themes that are present in your story? Are you always being saved or are you the person who saves others? Does your story have a theme of helplessness or ability? Is your story a love story, a comedy, a drama, or something else?
If you titled your story, what would the title be?
Divide your story into chapters. Why are the chapters divided where they are? What changed? What did you learn? What are the titles of your chapters?
Did you label yourself in your story? Did you label others? What do those labels mean to you and what do they say about how you see yourself, others, and the world?
What kinds of words do you use to describe yourself, others, and the world? What do these descriptive words tell you about your story and how you lived it?, Once you write your story, you need to decide what it means. The interesting thing about writing your own story for analysis, which is called narrative therapy, is that is shows you what you think is important or crucial to your existence. It showcases those moments in your life that you feel are important or worth note. It also shows you how you view yourself and the trajectory of your life so far.


For example, if you write your life as a drama, you may feel that your life is more dramatic and intense. If you wrote it as a comedy, you may think your life has been fun and upbeat to this point. If you wrote your life as a love story, maybe you are a hopeless romantic who either has great love or is hoping for one in the future., Even when you have followed all of these steps, you need to realize that it can take time. It is important to understand that becoming more aware of who you are, or analyzing yourself, is also an ongoing, lifelong pursuit. Who you are today or what you believe today may change in the future."

Understand that equality doesn't mean throwing your manners and good taste out of the window.,
Be on time.,
Compliment your date.,
Open doors for your date.,
Help your date to her chair before you sit down.,
Ask questions about your date.,
Be prepared to pay for you and your date’s meals.,
Offer your arm when walking with your date.,
Let your date know how much fun you had and offer a possible second date.",How to Be a Modern Gentleman," The dating game is still about captivating one another, impressing one another, and being on your best behavior. Behaving in an ungentlemanly manner might get some laughs in the retelling and it might even temporarily attract a woman who is into the date for a lark but it won't get you a long-term commitment and it definitely won't win you respect. Boldly stating that women are equal so they can jolly well pay and put up with you as you are is a blinkered approach to dating. The importance of indulging in a little etiquette when dating will be repaid by a dating experience that is considerate, caring, and most of all, more fun because your date will definitely be impressed by your manners and what used to be referred to as ""good breeding"". So, it's time to dress well, plan a decent date, and polish up your gentlemanly ways.;
, A gentleman never keeps his date waiting but is punctual and ready to go at the appointed hour. Set your alarm if needed, and plan how long it will take to arrive at your destination ahead of time.


Don't be late without a very good excuse and be sure to phone her to explain what has happened to hold you up. She may not wait long, especially if she's had previous experiences with non-gentleman types standing her up.

, Women like reassurance when it comes to their appearance. A great way to make a positive first impression is by offering a compliment on your date’s appearance. Be cautious though. Using cliched pick-up lines and corny compliments would make most women sprint back to their apartments. Be careful not to come across as creepy. No girl likes to feel objectified. Keep the compliments light and innocent.


Never insult your date. One quick way to guarantee you don’t get a second date is to insult your date. If you recognize that you are a person prone to criticizing, try to hold back on even the slightest criticism. Making any criticism, no matter how constructive you feel it to be, will probably come across as an insult which will start the downhill spiral of your date. If you recognize that you are a sarcastic or humorous person, be careful not to take a joke too far. Even if you’re joking, a woman may take your joke the wrong way. It’s best to avoid anything resembling an insult or a sarcastic tone altogether, and if it's politically incorrect, volatile, or gossip, don't say it.

, Men, this is chivalry 101. When walking out of any door, make sure you hold the door open for your date and let her walk out first.This will make your date feel special and respected. There's no need to do this with flamboyant gestures though; just do it subtly and thoughtfully.


Don't let the door slam on your date. This should be a given. When walking out of doors, it’s rude to walk out first, especially when that means letting the door close on your date. To women, this action signals selfishness. Men, if you’re afraid of looking like you care too much, don’t. It’s not a sign of weakness to open doors for your dates, in fact, it is just the opposite.

, This may seem odd because it doesn’t happen very often these days, but by pulling out the chair for your date so she can sit down first, this shows your date that you care about her interests before your own. It is also a very gentlemanly gesture liable to score you a big win in the manners stakes.


Don't pull the chair out so she falls down. Remember how old you are; this kind of prank didn’t work in the sixth grade, and it definitely won’t work now. Your date will be embarrassed or shocked and if she doesn’t leave right then and there, she definitely won’t stick around for a second date.
If you are eating with others at the table, wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat before beginning to eat. A gentleman does not bolt down his dinner.

, Be a good conversationalist. Don’t be afraid of awkward silence; instead, keep the conversation rolling by coming prepared with plenty of things to talk about. Your date will feel respected if you listen to what she has to say and she will be impressed if you don’t let the conversation drop.


Don't play with your food, talk while chewing, yawn, etc. Being a modern gentleman means sitting up straight and looking your date in the eye when you’re talking to each other. Don’t spend too much time looking down at your plate – your mashed potatoes can’t talk back.
Don't flaunt being wealthy or talk derogatorily about people who are wealthy. Both approaches show a total lack of refinement and cause the listener to squirm uncomfortably, wondering what personal takeover or revolution you're planning next. If you are wealthy and you want to make this evident, wear quality clothing but don't brag.On the other hand, no man needs to be wealthy to have good taste, so wear good, clean, and well-pressed clothing whatever your means.
Read How to make small talk for more ideas on finding topics to talk about.

, If she offers to pay, kindly refuse. Remind her that you are on a date and it is your pleasure to take the bill. There is a lot of confusion about this aspect of a date but a gentleman is never confused; a gentleman simply gets on with paying.


Don't use the ruse of leaving your wallet behind and expecting your date to pay. Even if you don’t ""forget"" your wallet, don’t expect your date to pay for her own meal. When the waitress comes by with the bill, don’t hesitate to grab it. By leaving it on the table for too long, your date might get nervous wondering if you’re going to pay.

, This is a gentlemanly act and it is also one guaranteed to help your date when she's walking on uneven ground in her high heels. While it is an intimate act, it is perfectly acceptable for a gentleman and means nothing more than being respectful.Always walk alongside a woman when walking down stairs, not behind her.It's also a good idea to help her to put on her coat when leaving a building during the colder weather.Always walk next to the road on a roadside; that way if there is any splashing from puddles, it'll hit you, not her.

, Keep your boundaries by being polite and respectful. Women don’t like to feel forced into a goodnight kiss or anything more.


Don't try to force any moves, especially if she seems unwilling. Treat her with respect. It is a huge turnoff when a man assumes his right to move in on his date.
Maintain her honor. Never kiss and tell.

If you begin to experience vaginal itching shortly after you begin using a new product, discontinue use right away and avoid other products that contain the same ingredients.

, Many women experience vaginal itching shortly before and during menopause due to a decrease in estrogen. To combat this, your doctor may prescribe estrogen creams, estrogen tablets, or vaginal estrogen rings.If you also experience vaginal dryness during menopause, you may get relief from store-bought vaginal moisturizers and water-based lubricants for sexual intercourse., In some cases, the skin around your vagina may be irritated by a skin condition. In this case, it is best to seek treatment from a dermatologist.


Lichen sclerosis is a condition that causes white, flaky patches of skin. It can be treated with a prescription-strength steroid cream.Eczema and psoriasis can also cause vaginal itching. Your gynecologist or dermatologist can prescribe medications to help you manage these conditions."

Wash regularly.,
Use the correct soaps.,
Don’t douche.,
Wipe carefully.,
Use products carefully.,
Wear clean, fresh, correctly fitting underwear.",How to Make Your Vagina Smell Good1," You need to shower and wash yourself regularly to smell good. How often that is will depend on your body because everyone is different. However, you will probably need to wash at least every two or three days. Washing yourself will help combat a buildup of bacteria on the skin, which causes odor just like it does anywhere else on the body.;
, Your vagina is very sensitive. Using the wrong types of soap can cause irritation and bad odor. Avoid soaps which are heavily perfumed, contain too many unnatural ingredients, or have antibacterial properties. These upset the natural balance of your body. Instead, use natural soaps which are labeled as being fragrance-free.

, The only time you should douche (wash out your vagina) is if your doctor tells you to. Douching creates a terrible imbalance of your body’s natural bacteria and will almost guarantee that you end up with some kind of infection. The only cleaning that you will need to do will be with basic soap and water on the outside of your body. , Incorrect wiping after using the toilet can lead to infections. Wipe in the correct direction (front to back) and be sure that you are thorough. It is easy to miss the vaginal area and this can leave residue which leads to infections or overgrowth of bacteria., Be careful about the products that you use around your vagina. Using lubricants that are not water or silicone based can cause infections, and you should always clean lube off once you’re done using it. Anything with heavy fragrance can cause infections easily, so avoid feminine products which aim to make your vagina smell like flowers. This includes lotions.

, This is a very important part of keeping your vagina clean and healthy. Wearing the same set of underwear for more than 24 hours may quickly create an imbalance of bacteria. You will also want to wear the right type of underwear. Your underwear needs to breathe, since an overly moist environment will cause bacterial buildup. Cotton is best. Make sure you do laundry, it can get messy!

Use perfume.,
Watch your diet.,
Try trimming or shaving.,
Try using wet wipes.",How to Make Your Vagina Smell Good2," Yes, using perfume too close to your vagina is a bad idea. However, putting a dab of perfume on the inside of each of your thighs, roughly six inches from the vulva area, is a time-honored way to smell amazing when anyone puts their head down there.


You partner will associate musky smells with sex (since this is the type of smell you have naturally) so try to get a perfume which is generally musky. Sandalwood and vanilla are common “sexy” smells.

, Your diet can greatly affect your taste and smell. Certain foods tend to affect your body in certain ways, by altering your body’s balance of sugar, bacteria, and chemical compounds. Much like how if you eat a lot of garlic, your skin excretes a garlic smell for several days, you can eat or not eat certain foods to produce a better smell and taste in your vagina.


You’ll want to start by eating less sugar. A spike in blood sugar can cause yeast infections and buildup, which will cause bad odor.
You may also want to try eating pineapple. Though there is no scientific evidence, many people swear by the idea that pineapple improves both taste and smell for both genders.
Yogurt is considered to be a great way to help women keep a healthy vagina, as it contains the bacteria which naturally occurs in our body to maintain a healthy vagina.

, Pubic hair does not cause odor in that area, but can create an environment that harbors bacteria if not cleaned properly. It is unlikely that shaving your pubic hair will affect odor if cleaned properly but if you want to reduce the likelihood of this being a problem, you can shave your pubic hair or keep it cut short. Keeping it cut short is a better option when it comes to odor as as stubble can cause skin irritation and invite infections. (plus it is itchy and uncomfortable including for your partner in many sexual situations)

, Sometimes you can’t quite get yourself clean enough with dry wipes. Some small amount of residue, either from feces or the tissue itself, can remain and harbor bacteria. Occasionally use a wet wipe or baby wipe to clean your vulva if you feel basic hygiene methods aren’t working well enough.


Use wet wipes which are fragrance free. Baby wipes tend to use less chemicals and often have fragrance free options.
Remember to only clean your vulva. Don't put wet wipes, wash clothes and soap inside your vagina.

Watch out for infections and diseases.,
Be aware that certain sexual practices cause vaginal odor.,
Check for foreign objects.,
Be careful to practice proper hygiene.,
Avoid hot baths and hot tubs.",How to Make Your Vagina Smell Good3," These are the major causes of serious vaginal odor. Examples of such infections and diseases include yeast and bacterial infections (the most common causes), STIs, STDs, or viruses like herpes. Even much more serious problems like some kinds of cancer or internal ruptures can cause vaginal odor. You will need to monitor your body for other signs of illness and if you really feel that your vaginal odor is unnatural, see your doctor.One thing to look out for are unusual discharges from your vagina. Brown, green, or chunky white discharges are signs of infection and you should go see your doctor as soon as possible. Just remember that some discharge is normal and healthy but it should not smell.

, Any introduction of foreign bacteria can upset the delicate balance in your vagina and so sexual practices can have an effect. Certain practices in particular can set off a reaction, namely anal sex before vaginal sex, oral sex, and the use of objects or food as penetrative methods.


If you wish to engage in these practices, use protection (like a condom) and change it in between activities.

, Foreign objects lodged in the vagina will cause your body's immune response to react and try to attack the object. This can cause bad odor as well. Tampons that have been forgotten or left in for too long, pieces of a broken condom, or objects used in sexual play are examples of such causes for odor.

, Improper hygiene can lead to a buildup of bacteria around your vagina and vulva. This will cause odor, though it may not necessarily cause an infection. If you want to reduce odor, keep yourself and your clothing clean. Lose clothing can prevent smell too.

, Surrounding your vagina with hot water will kill much of your body’s natural bacteria which preserves the delicate balance of your vagina.

Know that your body cleans out vaginal discharge, blood, and semen on its own.,

Don’t douche in attempts to prevent STDs or pregnancy.,
Wash the outside of your vagina as an alternative to douching.,

Prepare the douching solution.,
Fill the squeeze bottle or douche pouch with the solution.,

Rinse the vaginal cavity using the squeeze bottle.,
Wash the outside of the vagina.,
Finish cleaning up.",How to Douche for Feminine Hygiene," Many women douche in order to clean themselves after a period, rinse out vaginal discharge, or to clean out semen after sex. The great thing about the human body though, is that it is built to do these things on its own. The vagina cleans itself without douching, meaning that you don’t have to refer to man-made soaps and rinses in order to keep your vagina in healthy, working condition.;
, The last few years of studies have offered up important research that shows that douching can be more harmful than beneficial to your body. The vagina naturally cleans itself with its high acidity and natural mucous, which douching removes. As a result of douching, you are more likely to suffer from a yeast infection or other bacterial infection. Talk to your doctor before you decide to douche, and do so at their discretion.

, Some women feel like they need to douche in order to get rid of itching or burning they feel near or inside their vagina. These are symptoms of an infection though, and douching simply covers them up. Rather than trying to wash away these symptoms, meet with your doctor and explain what you’re experiencing.

, Although the vagina may have a very mild, constant odor, if you are experiencing a strong odor (outside of your menstrual cycle), it is likely a symptom of a possible infection. Instead of trying to rinse out the odor, talk to your doctor and ask for their advice. They may or may not support the idea of douching, but it is best to go to them first rather than possibly making things worse.

, Douching is not an alternative to a condom or other contraceptive; its primary goal is to ‘clean’ the inside of the vagina. Therefore, don’t douche in attempts to prevent an STD/STI or pregnancy after sex, as it will be ineffective.

, If you are concerned about keeping your vagina clean and odor-free in general, stick to washing the outside of your vagina instead. Use a mild soap and warm water in the shower or bath to remove any sweat or grime that might have built up on the exterior of your vagina, while your body does the work of cleaning the inside on its own., Look through the available douching products at your local drugstore to choose an option that looks best for you. Avoid any solution that contains scents or dyes, as these are much more likely to cause an infection. If you prefer, you can create your own douching solution at home using vinegar and only buy a squeeze bottle at the store for application., If you bought a kit at the store, follow the box directions to prepare the douching solution it came with. Typically you will need to use a quart of water to prepare it. If you are making your own at home, mix one part vinegar with three parts water, in an amount equal to at least two cups.

, Follow the directions on the box to do this, or simply pour the solution into the squeeze bottle. If all the solution doesn’t fit, fill it as high as you are able and then add the rest later.

, Douching isn’t the messiest thing in the world, but it could be under certain circumstances. To prevent spilling any of the solution, get into the shower or bathtub for the entire process. You’ll likely want to shower or bath afterwards anyway.

, Insert the tip of the squeeze bottle or douche pouch into the vagina, and squeeze it to release the fluid. Continue rinsing the inside of the vagina until you have used all the available fluid.

, Use a mild soap and warm water to wash the outside of the vagina as you would normally during a shower or bath. Your goal now is to wash off any of the douching solution left on the exterior of your vagina. The douching solution is relatively harmless on any other part of your body, so rinse it off if it came into contact with anything else but don’t worry about it too much., Follow up with any post-douching cleaning activities you deem necessary. Clean out the douching pouch/squeeze bottle and store it for later use, and clean up anything else you might have made a mess with while concocting your solution.

Sterilize any feeding instruments.,
Store feeding instruments in a sealed container.,
Bleach your breast pump after you have used it.,
Wash your nipples after breastfeeding.,
Wash your nursing bra and clothes that you wear while breastfeeding.,
Wash your hands regularly.,
Dry your skin with paper towels.,
Keep your baby clean.",How to Prevent Thrush when Breastfeeding1," This is particularly important to do if your baby has presented with thrush symptoms. Any instrument that comes into contact with your baby’s mouth and your nipple should be sterilized. You can do this by bringing water to a boil and placing the instruments inside for five minutes after every use.The instruments you should sterilize include:


The teething ring, pacifiers, and the teat of the feeding bottle.;
, After you have boiled the instruments listed above, place them in a container that you can seal off from bacteria. Boil this container often.

, Because the breast pump comes into contact with your breasts, it is important to sterilize it. Use bleach to do this.


You should also consider boiling any of the detachable parts of the breast pump so that they are also sterile.

, Use clean, warm water to do this. Allow your nipples to air dry once you have washed them. It is important to make sure that your nipples are dry so that they do not provide a habitat for yeast.You should also try to expose your breasts to the sun for a few minutes each day, as the vitamin D is thought fight the thrush.

, By washing your clothes in hot water, you kill the yeast that is responsible for killing the thrush.


You should also change the nursing pads that you use against your breast while breastfeeding. Washing these pads or blankets often ensures that they do not provide an environment for fungus to grow.

, Washing your hands can help to prevent the transfer of yeast from you to other people and things that you come into contact with. Always wash your hands before and after changing diapers and breastfeeding.


Use regular soap rather than a strong anti-bacterial soap. Anti-bacterial soap also kills normal bacteria that can actually help to prevent yeast from growing.

, Use paper towels rather hand towels, as hand towels are more prone to getting dirty and housing bacteria.

, Check your baby’s toenails, fingernails, and around your baby’s groin and diaper area. You should also check to make sure that the area under your breasts and arms do not show signs of a yeast infection.Wash your baby’s hands frequently. Do not allow your child to put dirty things into his mouth.

Up your intake of live cultures.,
Quit smoking.,
Limit the amount of sugar you eat.,
Get plenty of sleep each night.,
Try to avoid high stress levels.",How to Prevent Thrush when Breastfeeding2," Take capsules of acidophilus to control the bacteria levels in your body. You can also do this by eating yogurt, as yogurt contains lactobacillus acidophilus. This live culture can work to combat and prevent the yeast and therefore thrush., Cigarettes contain nicotine; nicotine causes vasoconstriction and reduces the blood supply to your vital organs. This in turn reduces your immunity, making your more prone to yeast infections.

, Eating high amounts of sugar increases your chances of developing a yeast infection. Instead, eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, as they will increase your immunity. Foods that are high in sugar include:


Syrups, soft drinks, candies, dried fruit, jams and jellies, cookies, cakes, and sugary cereals.

, Getting enough sleep each night will help to keep your immune system strong; when you lack sleep, you are more prone to infection.


While everyone needs a different amount of sleep, adults generally need between 7 and 8 hours of sleep each night., Being stressed out can also lower your immunity. Because of this, try practicing stress-lowering activities like meditation, yoga, and walking.


If you are having troubles managing your stress, talk to a trusted friend, and consider going to see a therapist.

Watch for yeast infections if you have an impaired immune system.,
Skip unprotected sex.",How to Prevent Recurrent Yeast Infections," Underwear made from synthetic materials (such as polyester) can be bad because it keeps the area moist. In other words, these fabrics aren't breathable, and therefore, they trap moisture. Instead of synthetic blends, choose natural fabrics, such as cottons, which let air through., In turn, that can allow the yeast infection fungus to take over. It's best to skip douching altogether., Nonoxynol-9 is a spermicide. However, some studies have linked it to an increase in yeast infections. Therefore, if you have trouble with yeast infections, it's best to avoid this substance. It is often included with latex condoms, so read your packages., Scented products, such as pads, tampons, bubble baths, and vaginal sprays, can also lead to problems with yeast infections. They can upset the delicate balance of your vagina or cause irritation, both of which can lead to yeast infections. Try to avoid these products., Whenever you wipe or clean your vaginal area, it's always best to do it from front to back. If you do it the other way, you can introduce more fungus and bacteria into your vaginal area, which can increase your chance of getting a yeast infection., Moisture is the enemy when it comes to yeast infections, as it encourages fungal growth. Therefore, change out of bathing suits or sweaty clothes as soon as possible. If you're going to the gym, be sure to bring a change of clothes if you don't plan to shower there., Hot tubs can contribute to fungus in the area by encouraging fungus growth. Similarly, hot baths can cause similar problems. Stick to warm showers instead, which will keep you clean without contributing to your yeast infection problem., Tight-fitting clothing can cause you to be sweaty. In addition, it keeps moisture close to your body. Therefore, try to pick clothing that is loose-fitting to help reduce moisture. If you must wear tight-fitting clothing, remember to pick a fabric that's breathable., Some women have found that yogurt with probiotics helps to keep yeast infections at bay. Many grocery stores carry a variety of these types of yogurts.Look for one with lactobacillus., A maintenance plan helps reduce the recurrence of yeast infections. Once you have rid yourself of a yeast infection, you essentially continue on antifungal pills, such as fluconazole, for about half a year. You take these pills by mouth once a week. Alternatively, you can insert a vaginal suppository, such as clotrimazole, into your vagina once a week.Remember to ask your doctor about the risks and side effects of taking such a strong anti-fungal for so long.

, Most of the time, your yeast infection is caused by the fungus Candida albicans. However, if it's caused by another type of Candida fungus, you may need to change treatments, as it can be more serious.A yeast culture performed by your doctor can demonstrate this if the infection is recurrent.


More aggressive treatments include longer vaginal therapy (creams or suppositories lasting up to two weeks) or several doses of the antifungal pill fluconazole, rather than just one dose., Boric acid isn't often used to treat yeast infections because it can be toxic if you swallow it. It can also cause irritations.; however, used as a suppository, it can help get you off the cycle of recurrent infections. You can only get boric acid with a prescription.You cannot allow someone to perform oral sex on you if you are using boric acid as it is toxic to your partner.

, Some people have had luck taking probiotics on a regular basis to help prevent yeast infections. You can either take them orally or insert them into your vagina., Pregnancy can increase your chances of having a yeast infection because it increases your estrogen levels. Other conditions that increase your estrogen level can also put you at risk, such as taking high-dose birth control., Antibiotics are essential to cure certain diseases; however, sometimes they can mess up the balance of bacteria in your vaginal area by killing off good bacteria, too. Because you have beneficial bacteria that keep fungus like yeast infection at bay, yeast infections can develop after you've had a round of antibiotics.While you should take antibiotics when you need them, always ask your doctor if they are necessary. If you have a virus, antibiotics are not going to help.

, Being diabetic can also put you at risk for yeast infections, as high glucose levels can encourage fungus growth. If you have diabetes, do your best to keep your blood sugar under control to help prevent yeast infections., Your immune system helps to fight against infections like yeast infections, too; therefore, if your immune system is compromised, you are more likely to get yeast infections.For instance, HIV can cause you to have a compromised immune system. Similarly, being on corticosteroid therapy can mean your immune system is compromised., While sex is not the most common way to get a yeast infection, it can be passed from person to person; therefore, it's always best to practice safe sex by using male or female condoms."

If you have had your period for a while you will know which products you prefer, how heavy your flow is and if you prefer tampons over pads. When you have just started most girls use pads.;
, Even if you don't have problems with irregularity, a friend may be in need for supplies. It's always better to be prepared.

,


Order free samples so you can try them all (don't try them at school or work because it would be better to leak at home than in public.)

, After all, you are both women.

, This is especially important if your flow is heavy.


If you are unable to change it and you have a heavy flow either use both a pad and a tampon, or use a pad and two pairs of underwear. It is better to wear a pad and then wear some shorts and a pair of loose trousers for comfort and reassurance.
If you have an event where you have to wear a dress, wear spandex yoga/workout/bike shorts under the dress to prevent an unwanted accident.

, Since you won't be able to change it, a thicker pad will offer more protection as you sleep. Wear old pants and pajama bottoms. If you think you might leak, wrap an old towel or blanket around you or around the mattress at the level of your likely leakage onto the bed.

, Or, make sure to have a jacket with you to tie around your waist, just in case.

, For example, tight bottoms aren't comfy, while fabric with give will be much gentler on your tummy area. Maybe wear some loose jogging bottoms.

, Maybe do some exercise, but not intense exercise. Try doing some light stretching. If it feels really bad, ask your mother for some ibuprofen. Often you get backaches, so don't slouch and don't lie down. Try a hot water bottle or rub your tummy gently! If you have a cat, get him/her to sit on you, they act like a hot water bottle especially when they purr!

, If you cannot do so due to discomfort, get a note from your parents excusing you from participating.


If you are self-conscious about changing, go in the bathroom, in a private corner or wear a long t-shirt. Remember to check yourself regularly.

, The fact is that every healthy girl will get one and will understand how you feel. Talk to your best friend or someone you're open with about your feelings.

, You might be getting emotional, it might be PMS. Try to stay calm, laugh and smile, you will feel better emotionally. If you have really bad mood swings every time the period arrives, talk to your doctor.

, Remember to dispose of the used items properly.

, It's just one of those things all of us females have to go through, it proves we're healthy and fertile for the future.

, Stay away from salty, fatty foods - they will make you feel worse. Have some fruit - bananas are known for helping with cramps.Keep a little bit of chocolate with you; when you're feeling down, chocolate may help you feel better. Maybe even have a chocolate coated strawberries as a snack!

, Spray some of your favorite perfume/body spray to keep you smelling sweet.


Wear perfume if you like it. Wear a bit of perfume or scented body spray to help you feel nice and fresh.
Limit the amount of makeup you wear; it's best to feel fresh and confident.

, Panty liners are also a good idea to use when you're expecting your period to prevent an unexpected leak.

, It's best to get it checked out. Better to be safe then sorry!

, Note how long it lasts for, how you felt, and how heavy it was. This information can be useful for a range of reasons, including checking your health, knowing when the next period is due, and later in life, helping to determine your fertility. It's a good habit to get into.

, Also washing out the stain with hydrogen peroxide will work; make sure you test it out first to ensure it will not bleach or discolor your clothing. It will have faded hopefully, then fold them up or put them in the wash. Or pour something down it and rub it and say you've spilled something down your bottoms!

Be sure to consider that you may be sweaty and smelly if you choose not to shower after gym class. Choosing not to shower works best if the activities during class do not cause you to sweat much or if you have gym at the end of the day.
Consider talking to your gym teacher if you are uncomfortable showering at school during your period. He or she may let you do a less strenuous activity that will not require showering afterwards.;
, Your options for showering during your period will depend on what kind of setup your locker room has. If you have communal showers, you will have fewer options than you will if you have private shower areas. Be sure to understand how much privacy you will have when showering when deciding on the best method for you.


No matter what your locker room is like, it is possible to shower during your period without drawing any unwanted attention to yourself, so don't worry!

, When you get your period, you have three basic choices for how to collect the blood: a sanitary napkin (also called a pad), which sticks to your underwear and absorbs blood; a tampon, which is a small piece of cotton with a string on the end that is inserted into the vagina to absorb blood; or a menstrual cup, which is a silicon cup that is inserted in the vagina and collects blood.You can play sports with any kind of menstrual protection, so choose whichever method you find most comfortable.If you need to swim during gym class, you will need to use a tampon or menstrual cup because sanitary napkins will absorb water from the pool.If you have communal showers that offer no privacy, a tampon is probably your best option because you can leave it in while you shower and change it in the privacy of a toilet stall afterwards. A menstrual cup may also work as long as you do not have to empty it during your shower.

, Any time you have your period away from home, it's a good idea to make sure you have sanitary supplies on you. If you will be dealing with your period in gym class, it's a good idea to keep them in a discreet bag that you can bring with you wherever you need it.If you plan on bringing pads or tampons into the shower area, make sure they are in a waterproof bag. If they get wet, they will no longer be effective.
If you use a menstrual cup, you don't need to bring any extra supplies with you, but you will need to plan on removing the cup and rinsing it off.If you are using pads, you may want to consider packing a clean pair of underwear with a pad already applied so that you will be able to change into them quickly after your shower. Just be sure to keep them in a separate bag so the pad stays clean and sanitary.

, Depending on the kind of sanitary product you use and how much privacy you have in the shower, you may choose to leave your protection in place during your shower or remove it.


If you use a tampon, you can keep it in while you shower if you wish. You may want to do this if you have a heavy flow, as it will prevent any blood from getting on the shower floor.
If you are wearing a pad, you will need to remove it in order to shower. Depending on the size of the shower area, you may be able to keep your clothes on until you are in a private area. This will make it easy to remove the old pad.
If you have privacy, a shower is the perfect opportunity to remove your menstrual cup at school because you can rinse it out without having to use a sink. If you are having a light flow and do not need to empty your menstrual cup, you can leave it in while you shower.Keep in mind that if you remove any old sanitary products or put on any new ones while you are in the shower area, you will need to have a discreet way to dispose of them when you leave the shower. It's a good idea to bring some toilet paper (in a waterproof bag) into the shower area with you so you will have something to wrap up the pad or tampon in.
If there's no room to remove your old tampon or pad in the shower area, remove it in a toilet stall right before your shower.

, Take a shower just as you normally would, and try not to be self-conscious about your period. Remember there is no reason not to shower while you are on your period!, To stay clean and fresh, be sure to gently clean your genital area while you shower. You can use a wash cloth or loofah.It's best to wash this area with warm water only, as soap can disrupt the delicate pH balance of your vagina.
Always clean this area from front to back to avoid spreading bacteria from your anus to your vagina.
If you're using a communal shower, wash yourself as much as you feel comfortable doing. You can always take a more thorough shower at home, so you can make it as quick as you want.

, If there is any blood in the shower, be sure to rinse it down the drain before you leave the area.


Remember that you can avoid this by leaving your tampon or menstrual cup in place while you shower, which is probably the best option if you have communal showers.

, It's important to make sure that your dry off your genital area before getting dressed. This is especially important if you are using a sanitary napkin, as it will trap all of the moisture that is left on your skin and hair., If you are using a tampon or pad, you will need to use a new one after your shower. Even if you left your tampon in during your shower, you should change it afterwards.The right place to do this will depend on the layout of your gym's locker room.


If you have a private shower area, you can insert your new tampon before you leave the area. You may even be able to put on your underwear and a new pad in the shower area.
If you can't do this in the shower area, go straight to a toilet stall to put on your new pad or insert your new tampon.
If you left your tampon in while you showered, you can wait until after you have gotten fully dressed to change it.
Keep in mind that you may get blood on your underwear while walking between the shower and the toilet area with no pad or tampon, especially if your flow is heavy. You can solve this by putting a little bit of tissue or toilet paper in your underwear or by wrapping yourself in a towel and not putting your underwear on yet.

, If you're not already dressed, go ahead and put your clothes back on. Once your underwear is on, you should be able to get dressed like you normally would.


It may be more comfortable to put on the rest of your clothes in the main part of the locker room. If you are using a pad, you may want to try to put your underwear on before you leave the shower and then put the rest of your clothes on in the changing area.
If you left your tampon in while you showered, you can leave the shower, get dressed, and then go to a toilet stall to change your tampon.

, Whether you changed your sanitary supplies in the shower area or somewhere else, always be sure to dispose of them before you leave the area. Wrapping them up in toilet paper will make this much more discreet.If you change your sanitary supplies in a toilet stall, there is usually a disposal container right there, so you won't have to worry about finding a trash can.

, While exercise is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle, it is also another reason your body produces sweat. When you exercise, you raise your body temperature, so you sweat to keep cool.Thus, if you do not want to sweat, you should stick to exercises such as swimming, where it will not be obvious that you are sweating.

, If your clothes are tight and close to your skin, the clothing is more likely to absorb sweat. Additionally, close fitting clothes may make you feel warmer, causing sweating. Therefore, you should stick to clothing that is loose. This will also allow air to circulate.

, The more tightly knit a shirt is, the less it breathes and the warmer you will feel. Silk, for example, is a bad choice if you want to avoid sweating as it is tightly knit.Shirts that are loosely woven, will allow more air to circulate.

, For men, this step is easy, since they often wear undershirts. However, as a female, you can also use this method. The idea is that by wearing a few layers, you have more fabric to absorb the sweat. Thus, it is less likely that sweat shows through the outermost layer.


Consider camisoles, or thin shirts, which you can wear underneath your shirt for the day. You can even bring an extra one along in case you want to change.

, Colors such as navy and black are good at hiding most wet sweat marks that appear underneath your arms. Additionally, white usually also does a pretty good job of hiding sweat.


Colors to avoid include: Grey, bright colors, as well as most light colors, which will all show sweat.

, This product goes by many names (e.g. underarm shields, garment protectors, sweat pads, etc.), but the function is the same. The pads will either stick to your skin or have straps to go around your arms. As you sweat, the shields absorb the sweat so it doesn’t show up on your clothes., Baby powder (which is typically made of talcum powder and added fragrance) can help to absorb excess sweat. Additionally, talcum acts as an astringent, meaning that it causes your pores to restrict, which may help with sweating., This may sound silly, but if you are sweating a lot, you can raise your arms over your head for a few minutes (if you are alone) or place your elbows on your desk (if you are at school or work) to allow some air to circulate under your arms.

, Food that is very spicy can cause you to sweat more. If you want to reduce the amount you sweat then avoid spicy foods such as jalapeños.Additionally, foods such as garlic and onions can cause your sweat to smell worse. If you are concerned about this, then you should also avoid these., While you may not always have the opportunity to wipe away sweat discreetly, having a handkerchief with you will give you something to wipe the sweat away when it is unavoidable.

Use antiperspirant.,
Apply Antiperspirant at night, before going to bed.,
Make sure your skin is completely dry before applying antiperspirant.,
Give a product you are trying out at least 10 days to work.,
Use deodorant to avoid body odor.",How to Stop Sweating Under Your Armpits (for Girls)2," As the name suggests, antiperspirants are meant to avoid sweating (perspiring). Antiperspirants are widely available, and most deodorants sold today contain an antiperspirant.


Typically, these products come in different strengths. It is best to start with the lowest strength product. If that doesn’t solve your sweating problem, then try the next strength level.Antiperspirants work by creating a coagulant that clogs the pores., The antiperspirant solution will be diluted if you sweat shortly after using it. At night, you are moving around less, and less likely to sweat., This will help your skin from becoming irritated, and will also help the antiperspirant to work better (since it works best if it does not become diluted)., It may take time for the antiperspirant to clog the pores. If the product is not working after only a few days, don’t worry, the product may just need a few more days., In addition to an antiperspirant, you can also apply a deodorant. When sweat interacts with bacteria on the skin, it becomes odorous. Deodorant kills the bacteria to prevent this odor. Fragrance is commonly added to mask any smell that might occur.Sometimes antiperspirants may also include a deodorant and vice versa. Read the label of your current antiperspirant or deodorant carefully to check.

See a dermatologist.,
Ask for a prescription strength antiperspirant.,
Consider trying Iontophoresis.,
Ask about Botulinum toxin type A (Botox) injections.,
Ask about miraDry treatments.,
Consider surgical methods for reducing sweating.",How to Stop Sweating Under Your Armpits (for Girls)3," If you are not able to control your sweating using the previous methods, then a visit to your dermatologist is a good idea. Dermatologists are typically the best type of doctor to see for this problem, as they deal with skin, and are often familiar with treatments for excessive sweating (also known as hyperhidrosis).Be aware that you may need a referral from your regular doctor to see a dermatologist, be sure to check with your insurance company to see if this is necessary.

, If none of the over the counter products you have tried are working, your dermatologist may be able to prescribe you a prescription strength antiperspirant that you would not be able to purchase on your own.


The same procedure as for over the counter products will likely apply for application. Be sure that you do it at night before bed, and that your armpits are completely dry.
Read the information that comes with your prescription carefully. There may be special application instructions, instructions about how often to use, side-effects to be aware of, etc.

, If prescription strength antiperspirant doesn’t help, you might consider alternative treatments. One of these is known as Iontophoresis. Although most commonly used for sweating of the hands and feet, it can be used for armpits as well.The procedure involves placing the affected area into water, through which a mild electric current is passed. The procedure works well for many, but multiple treatments are often required, and the physical structure of the armpit can often make treatment a bit impractical., You may have heard of Botox injections as a method of avoiding wrinkles; however it can also be used to treat excessive sweating. Botox works by essentially “turning off” the sweat glands in the affected area.Be aware that this treatment can be painful, and only works for a few months at a time., MiraDry is a fairly new treatment method, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011.This treatment works by using electromagnetic energy to destroy the sweat glands in the affected area (and is most commonly used for armpits). Typically, two treatments are done over a period of a few months. As of now, it does not appear that the sweat glands will grow back.The procedure typically lasts about an hour, and uses a local anesthetic. There may be a bit of redness, tenderness, and swelling for a few days after the procedure, but mild pain medication can be used to help with this, along with the use of ice packs., Although typically only used in very severe cases of hyperhidrosis, surgery offers another option to control sweating. There are many surgical techniques used to deal with the problem, but they all have the ultimate goal of removing sweat glands in the affected area.Typically, these surgical procedures are performed in a doctor’s office under local anesthesia, which means that you will not be asleep. Only the affected area is numbed.

Try lubricants.,
Try a vaginal moisturizer.,

Make an appointment with your gynecologist.,
Ask about Hormone Replacement Therapy.,
Try an estrogen ring.,
Consider your existing medications.,
Use drug-free treatments.,
Do not douche.,
Allow foreplay during sex.,
Try masturbation.",How to Deal with Vaginal Dryness," If your vaginal dryness is a problem during intercourse, using lubricants can help temporarily alleviate the problem.


Lubricants can be purchased online, in pharmacies, and can also be bought at sex shops. Lubricated condoms can also be purchased to alleviate vaginal dryness during intercourse.Lubricants should be applied directly to the vagina shortly before intercourse. Lubricants only temporary relief, so if you're looking for a long term cure you might want to look elsewhere.;
, Vaginal moisturizers are topical creams applied directly to the vagina. Most non-hormonal vaginal creams can be purchased over the counter.


Vaginal creams can be found at the supermarket or drug stores. Replens, Luvena, K-Y Silk-E Vaginal Moisturizer and KY Liquibeads Vaginal Moisturizer are examples of over the counter vaginal creams.Talk to your gynecologist before using any new products. While most are safe for use, some may increase the risk of infection and adverse reactions, such as rashes or sores., Estrogen creams are topical ointments applied directly to the vagina that contain a low dose of the hormone estrogen. You must have a prescription to obtain estrogen cream.


Usually around bedtime, estrogen cream is inserted directly into the vagina with an applicator or a clean finger. Depending on your medical history, your doctor will tell you how often to use estrogen cream and in what amount.

, Vaginal dryness has a number of causes. If your vaginal dryness came on suddenly, you should see your gynecologist to rule out medical causes.


Usually, the cause of vaginal dryness is benign. Menopause, childbirth, and breastfeeding can all alter hormonal levels and cause dryness. However, occasionally vaginal dryness is caused by more serious problems like certain cancers and immune disorders. This is why it's important to see a doctor quickly if you notice any changes as for these types of diseases early intervention is important.Sjogren's Syndrome is an autoimmune disease in which your body's immune system attacks healthy tissues. In can lead to vaginal dryness, in addition to other symptoms like dry eyes and a dry mouth. Your doctor can perform a blood test to see if you have Sjogren's Syndrome., If you're entering menopause, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) can ease many symptoms including vaginal dryness.


Not only can hormone replacement therapy improve vaginal dryness, it can help with other symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes. Usually, you would wear a patch or take oral tablets of low doses of estrogen and other hormones that your body produces less of as you enter menopause.Hormone replace therapy does carry some risks. Oral combined hormone pills that contain estrogen and progesterone have shown to increase the risk of breast cancer, heart attack, and stroke. Talk to your doctor about these risk factors and how they might apply to you., An estrogen ring is a form of hormone replacement therapy that many women find easier to use than pills.


Your gynecologist inserts a small, flexible ring into the upper part of your vagina. The ring will release doses of estrogen on a regular schedule. It will need to be replaced every three months.

, Oftentimes, vaginal dryness is a side effect of existing medication. Decongestants especially, found in many cold or allergy medications, can lead to vaginal dryness. If you believe your dryness is caused by your medications, talk to your doctor about alternative meds., If you're interested in less drug-heavy treatment options, there are a variety of homeopathic options that are successful for some women.


Soybeans contain a substance called isoflavones that has an effect on the body that's similar to estrogen. A soybean rich diet might help reduce vaginal dryness.Black cohosh is an herb many women use as a dietary supplement and it may help with vaginal dryness.However, every major study has not found any benefit with use. Some women experience side effects like joint pain, shortness of breath, dizziness, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. You should not use black cohosh if you have liver damage or a hormone-sensitive condition like certain cancers or fibroid tumors. You should also not take black cohosh if you're pregnant. Talk to your health care provider before you begin any herbal treatments to make sure the herbs are safe for you.Some women use creams containing wild yam as a supplement, but no evidence exists that such creams are helpful and they may be damaging to the vagina., Cleansing your vagina with a liquid preparation, store bought or homemade, disrupts the balance of chemicals in your vagina and can lead to dryness and possibly infections. Do not douche as the vagina has self-cleaning mechanisms and does not need additional washing., Foreplay is any activity, like massaging, cuddling, kissing, oral sex, and other forms of erotic play, that occurs prior to sexual intercourse. Increasing the amount of time you and your partner engage in foreplay can increase arousal and therefore limit vaginal dryness. Talk to your partner about any issues you've been having with vaginal dryness and ask him or her to allow for more foreplay during intercourse. This may help lessen the problem.


In general, having an active sex life in general can help you stay lubricated and avoid vaginal dryness. Talk to your partner about the importance of regular sexual activity as it applies to both the physical and emotional aspects of your relationship., Regular masturbation, especially for older women, can have a variety of health benefits including reducing vaginal dryness.


Female masturbation comes in a variety of forms and techniques, but the stimulation of the clitoris, urethra, and vagina can result in increased lubrication. If you're experiencing hormonal or other changes that lead to vaginal dryness, regular masturbation can help."

Use the toilet first.,
Find the bidet.,
Straddle a standalone bidet.,
Activate a toilet seat bidet.,
Adjust the temperature and jet strengths for comfort.,
Position yourself.,
Clean your rear and/or your genitals.,
Dry your skin.,
Rinse out the bidet.,
Wash your hands.",How to Use a Bidet," The purpose of the bidet is to help clean off after toilet use. You can use the bidet in conjunction with toilet paper, or you can use the bidet on its own. Some people believe that using a bidet is a hygienic substitute for toilet paper, but many choose to use both.;
, Sometimes, the bidet is located near the toilet, attached to the wall: it looks something like a low sink or a toilet with a faucet. However, many modern bidets are built into the toilet seat, so you don't need to get up to straddle another fixture.These are the two main types of bidet: the standalone bidets found in Europe, and the toilet-seat bidets,embodied on the seat cover or fixed on back or side toilet rim,(called add-on bidets), that are common in Asia.

Standalone bidet: These bidets are separate fixtures which usually sit right next to the toilet. Sometimes, however, you'll find them across the room, or down the hall. Either way, you will need to use the toilet, then stand up and move over to the bidet. This is the original model of the bidet that originated in 18th-century Europe.
Add-on toilet side rim or seat bidets: Many bathrooms in Asia and America don't have the space to accommodate a separate fixture next to the toilet – so many toilets are designed with built-in bidets or fixtures that fit over the toilet side rim or the seat. This way, you don't need to get up to clean yourself., On most standalone bidets, you can choose to face the bidet's water controls – or you can face away from them, as you would on a toilet. It is usually easier to control the temperature and flow of the water if you face the controls. You will be able to see the water as it comes out, so you might have a simpler time cleaning yourself.If you are wearing pants, you may need to remove them in order to straddle the bidet facing the controls. If you don't want to completely take off your pants, try stepping out of one leg so that you can swing your legs around the bidet. in add on bidets things are much more simple. You have not to take off your pants.
In standalone bidets ultimately, the way you face may be dictated by the position of the jets, and which area of your body that you wish to clean. That is to say: if you need to clean your front, it might be easier to face the jets. If you're cleaning your rear, try facing away from the stream.

, Look for the “Wash” button on the bidet’s remote control, which is usually mounted on the wall next to the toilet. You may also find the button on the toilet itself. A nozzle will appear beneath you and rinse your nether regions with a stream of water.When you're done, simply press the “Stop” button. The nozzle will rinse itself off and retract back into the seat.
In mechanically controlled add on bidets, you just turn e lever or pull a string and turn the mains valve.

, If the bidet has both hot and cold water controls, start by turning on the hot water. Once it's hot, add the cold water until you have a comfortable temperature. Be very careful when turning on the water, as many bidets can produce a very high jet of water with only a slight turn of the control. You may find that you need to hold the control to keep the jets on.


In normally hot climates, such as the Middle East, you should start with the cold water. The water will not need time to heat up, and you may end up burning sensitive areas if you turn the hot water on first.
Be sure that you know where the water nozzle is, or you could end up with a surprise shower. If your bidet does have a spray nozzle set in the bowl (unlikely in the UK due to regulations), place your hand above it to subdue any jet of water and then either press or pull the diverter lever between or immediately behind the taps.

, Sit or squat over the stream so that the water hits the area you need to clean. You can continue to hover above the bidet or you can sit down on it. Note that most bidets don't have seats, but are still meant to be sat upon; you just sit directly on the rim. Some bidets do not have jets: they simply have a faucet that fills the basin, much as you would fill a sink basin. In this latter case, you'll need to use your hands to manually clean yourself.


When you use a mechanically handled bidet, after you had finished the ""job"", you don't do more than use the external mechanism to turn the water jet nozzle to the center inside the bowl and turn on the water supply valve, which is on your hands reach beside bowl. On those bidet types, as the water jet is very thin, you don't usually feel the water temperature. Of course in some cases you can use warm water, taking the water from bath's supply.

, If you're using a bidet with a jet, then you can mostly let the force of the water do its work. If you're using a basin, then you'll need to get your hands dirty. Either way, you might consider using your wet hands to ""scrub"" the area clean more quickly. You can always wash your hands afterward!


Consider combining the bidet with toilet paper. You can use the paper at the end, to finish the job, or you can dampen the toilet paper in the water and use it to wipe yourself clean.

, Some bidets have a built-in air dryer that you can use. Look for the ""Dry"" button next to the ""Wash"" and ""Stop"" features. If there's no air dryer, simply pat yourself dry with toilet paper. Many bidets have a towel on a ring positioned next to the bidet. This is meant for drying the genitals or the hands, but sometimes it is used for mopping up any splashes around the rim after rinsing it.

, Once you are off the bidet, run the jets at very low pressure for a few seconds to rinse the basin and keep the bidet fresh. This is a matter of discretion and common courtesy.


Make sure to turn off the jets before you leave the bathroom. If you run the stream, you'll waste water.

, Use soap and water, as you would any time after using the toilet. If you can't find soap, use whatever's available.

Know when to Get Additional Medical Attention.",How to Treat a Skin Yeast Infection Naturally," Fungal/yeast infections of the skin usually appear as an irritated rash that's red (sometimes grey), often scaly, and always itchy.The patches are slightly raised and can form little pustules if scratched a lot. On the exterior of the body, yeast grows best within folds of skin because it tends to be dark, moist and warm. As such, obese people and large-breasted women can be at higher risk of yeast infections of the skin if they have compromised immunity or practice poor hygiene.


A Candida diaper rash within the folds and cleft of the buttocks is not uncommon among infants, especially those who sit in wet or dirty diapers for too long.
Fungus also commonly invades scalp, fingernails and toenails, as well as the area between the toes and on the sole of the feet (commonly called athlete's foot).
Your doctor can confirm a diagnosis by scraping off a sample of the rashy skin and looking at it under a microscope or placing it in a culture medium (petri dish) to grow.;
, Another characteristic of yeast infections, and something that can readily distinguish them from other skin infections or rashes, is a musty odor. This odor is most pronounced when Candida yeast infects the inside of the mouth (called oral thrush) or vagina, but also fairly noticeable when it grows on the skin or within skin folds. The sweet and musty characteristic of yeast growth can sometimes be masked by or confused with regular body odors because they tend to proliferate near the underarms, groin and buttocks.


Although fungi have a characteristic odor, they can change shape and appearance in response to environmental factors and the area of the body they infect. They can grow as round shapes (yeasts) or as long, thin threads called hyphae.Some fungi species reproduce by spreading small spores in the air, which can land on skin or be inhaled. This is why yeast/fungal infections usually begin on the skin or in the lungs., Anyone can potentially get a yeast/fungal infection because they are so common in our environment, but people with really bad hygiene and those with weak immune systems are at much higher risk. In general, opportunistic infections (fungal, viral and bacterial) are much higher in people with weak immune systems because they have far less ability to fight them off.As such, microorganisms such as fungi/yeast can be opportunistic and take advantage of their weakened host.


The main causes of weakened immunity are age (being very young or old), chronic stress, chronic malnourishment, immune system infections such as HIV/AIDS, autoimmune disorders, diabetes, over-medication (with antibiotics or corticosteroids, for examples) and chemotherapy for cancer.People who use public baths and swimming facilities without foot protection are also at risk of fungal infections of the feet and toenails, which can then spread to other parts of their body.

, Coconut oil contains three different fatty acids (caprylic, capric & lauric acids) that are fungicidal, which means they kill fungi such as Candida and other species.These fatty acids within coconut oil kill yeast by destroying their cell walls, so it's very unlikely and difficult for fungi to gain resistance against them.


Buy a good quality coconut oil (it's likely to be a solid instead of a liquid) and rub some it into your yeast infection 3x per day. You should see results (less redness and itching) within a week.
Coconut oil is also a popular remedy for fighting systemic (internal) Candida yeast infections, although its taken orally in such situations.
Coconut oil is also effective against bacterial skin infections and other kind of skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis, which can look similar to yeast/fungal skin infections.

, Application of tea tree oil, an extract of melaleuca alternifolia, can also be effective on yeast/fungal infections of the skin because it has strong antimicrobial properties and works well as a fungicide.Tea tree oil also boosts immunity, which can be helpful in preventing initial infections and re-infections of Candida and other fungi. Start with 2-3 drops of the tea tree oil on your skin infection, 3x daily for at least a couple of weeks and see how it works.


Tea tree oil has been a popular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory for many years in Australia, but has become better known in the U.S. over the last decade or so.
Tea tree oil can cause both skin irritation and allergic reactions in some people who are especially sensitive, but the prevalence is rare. As such, test a little on some healthy skin before applying it to your yeast infection.

, Oil of oregano contains a couple of different compounds (carvacrol and thymol) that are both strong fungicides.These compounds completely inhibit Candida and other fungi via dehydration — they dry out and eventually die. Oil of oregano is quite strong and can cause a burning sensation on skin, so make sure to dilute it with vitamin E or some cod liver oil — water won't work well to dilute because it doesn't mix with oils.


Mix 1-2 drops of oregano oil with the same quantity of vitamin E or fish oil and apply it your skin infection 3x daily for a couple weeks and make note of the progress.

, With any type of infection (fungal, bacterial or viral), true prevention and protection depends on a strong and healthy immune response. Your immune system is made up of specialized white blood cells that are designed to search for and destroy potential pathogens such as fungi.However, when your immune system is weakened due to the above-mentioned reasons, disease-causing microorganisms can grow and spread virtually unchecked. Thus, focus on boosting your natural immunity in order to combat yeast infections and stay healthy.


Getting more quantity and better quality of sleep, eating more fresh produce, eating less refined sugars (sodas, candy, deserts), reducing your alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, practicing good hygiene and exercising regularly are all methods of keeping your immune response strong.Vitamin and herbal supplements that can boost immune system function include: vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.

, Although many yeast infections can be easily treated with natural methods, sometimes the infection will not clear up with the above suggestions. Some yeast infections simply need perscription-strength medication. There may be an underlying issue that creates reoccurring infections. In any case, while natural remedies are often a perfect response, be aware that you may need further medical attention if:


The infection gets worse, is spreading, or keeps coming back.
You do not see improvement within 2-3 days.
You have a compromised immune system.

,, Don't be afraid to ask whatever is on your mind because they've probably already heard your question before from someone else.

,


The vast majority of people choose to make a tandem jump. This involves jumping out of the plane while attached via a harness to an instructor who wears a parachute big enough for both of you. It requires very little training and you can just ""sit back and enjoy the ride"" while the instructor handles all the technical parts of the skydive.
Another type of jump called an AFF (Accelerated Free Fall) Level One jump is offered at most drop zones. The training for this skydive involves a ground school course taking approximately 5-6 hours followed by a jump with your own parachute. On this type of jump, you will have two experienced instructors holding onto you during your exit from the plane and subsequent freefall in order to assist you with proper body positioning as well as initiating the canopy opening. You will also have the assistance of an instructor on the ground who is in communication with you via radio to assist with your landing pattern and proper ""flaring"" for landing.
One additional option you may encounter is a ""static line"" jump. This jump includes the same training as an AFF Level 1 jump however upon exiting the plane, your parachute is automatically deployed by a ""line"" attached to the aircraft. Static line jumps have generally decreased in popularity in recent years, and most first-timers end up making either a tandem or AFF Level 1 jump.
The remainder of this article describes steps related to making a tandem jump which is the most common first time jump.

, Bring an extra layer if you want but part of the fun is feeling the rush of air and although it is colder at high altitudes, you probably won't notice the difference because of all the adrenaline.

, Even though you'll only be free falling for a minute, plan on being there for the entire day just in case.

, Before your jump, you will get a briefing and meet your instructor; this will help you enjoy your skydive much more. They will fit you into a harness that will connect to the instructor and the parachute.

, Before you reach the jumping altitude (between 9,500 feet and 17,500 feet) the instructor will clip your harness onto theirs. At this point you are literally joined at the hip.

, Listen to your instructor on how they want you to do this because every plane and every instructor/student combination is different.

, Enjoy the feeling of falling at 120 miles (190 km) an hour and feeling free as a bird. The sensation is like no other, it feels like you are floating but the rush of air tells you that you are falling

, Once the instructor deploys the parachute you have a 360 degree view of the beautiful earth from about 5,000 feet (1,524.0 m). Your instructor may loosen your harness at this point for your comfort. Don't worry, they won't drop you!

, Once again, listen to your instructor on how to land. Sometimes you'll stand up for the landing, other times you'll slide in softly. It depends on a lot of factors.

, You just did something that most people don't have the courage to do. Enjoy the accomplishment.

, If you enjoyed your first skydive and want to do it again, talk to the instructors and the people at the drop zone about how to get certified. It takes a lot of time, money, and effort but you'll find that skydivers are among the happiest people on the face of the earth.

A successful tandem flying experience qualifies you to receive your Student Paragliding P-0 rating. This rating allows you to fly solo under the direct supervision of a certified instructor.To schedule a tandem flight, contact a qualified paragliding school.


You do not any prior experience to embark on a tandem flight.;
, To obtain a P-0 rating, you must demonstrate to your instructor that you have acquired a basic understanding of paragliding equipment, techniques, and skills. These include:


Understanding and accepting the risks of tandem paragliding.
Understanding the acts of launching, flying, and landing.
Understanding the mechanics of brakes and risers.
Understanding the deployment of a backup parachute., When flying tandem, it is imperative that you cooperate with your instructor. To obtain a P-0 rating, you must:


Follow the instructions and commands of your instructor.
Only touch the paraglider in the areas indicated by the instructor.
Demonstrate that you understand that you must run with your instructor to launch the paraglider., In order to receive a Beginner Paragliding Rating (P-1), you must enroll in a basic ground school. These courses are offered by certified paragliding schools. While attending this school, you will acquire the knowledge necessary to pass a Beginner Paragliding written exam, such as the skills required to assess weather and wind conditions., To obtain a p-1 rating, you must demonstrate your ability to master the canopy, or sail. The skills you must master include:


The ability to properly layout a canopy and harness preflight.
The ability to launch a canopy under control.The ability to remain connected to the canopy while remaining clear of lines and risers (the points at which the lines attach to the harness) prior to inflation.The ability to deflate, immobilize, disconnect, and remove the canopy.
The ability to properly pack, store, and care for the canopy., To obtain your P-1 rating, you must also demonstrate your ability to launch, fly, and land a paraglider solo.


When launching, your inflation run must be smooth and exhibit your confidence. You must maintain directional control and control of the pendulum. Your transition from running to flying must be smooth.You must complete two flights that exhibit your ability to maintain a constant airspeed, fly smoothly and straight towards a predetermined target, and land safely into the wind.
You must complete two flights that exhibit your ability to handle variations in airspeed and land safely into the wind., When you have completed all the beginner tasks, you will receive a P-1 rating. This rating permits you to fly under the direct supervision of a certified instructor in winds of 12 MPH or less. Your flights paths must be straight and relatively free of obstructions., To obtain your Novice Paragliding Rating (P-2), you must enroll in a complete at least 8 hours of ground school theory courses. These courses prepare you to take the written Novice exam. In these courses, you will acquire theoretical and practical information on the following subjects:


Weather—observing and monitoring local weather.
Launches—considering air density, slope, wind factors, and angles of attack.
Danger signs—identifying high winds, dust storms, smoke, and shifting wind directions.
Landing—considering air density, wind directions, and various approach techniques.
Equipment—understanding the importance of packing food, water, and wind instruments.
Site orientation—learning how to familiarize yourself with the protocols and layout of a site.

, In order to receive your P-2 rating, you must demonstrate that you are capable of lowering your canopy between flights. Your log will serve as proof of your ability to do so. Present your certified instructor with a log of your flights that contains at least 25 separate entries., To obtain your P-2 rating, you must demonstrate your ability to complete 26 distinct skills. The skills include, but are not limited to:

, There is a wide range of options for dealing with menstruation, beyond just disposable tampons or pads. You may find that a menstrual cup is better, because you feel normal and don't have to think about it so much; or that reusable pads are best because they're more comfortable than pads but don't need to be inserted.

Have a warm beverage, like tea or cocoa.
Play with a pet. They don't care what you look like, only that you're nice to them.
Listen to comforting music.
If you're struggling with overwhelming emotions, try to talk to someone supportive-a parent or sibling, a friend, a counselor or therapist, etc. Another alternative is writing in a journal.
Take a hot shower or bath, or place something warm on your abdomen, like a hot water bottle, a warm towel, or even your laptop.

Land and get help.,
Disconnect the lines.,
Tidy up the kite.",How to Pack Away Your Surf Kite," Bring your kite down and turn it so your friend can grab it. Your friend should then grab the kite by the inflated edge and put it down with this edge on the ground. They should then place your board or a weights bag on the kite to stop it blowing around too much in the wind.;
, Take off your harness, walk up to your kite and disconnect all of the lines. Take the bar and grab the two outside lines on it and hold them in the middle. With your other hand, grab the rest of the lines and wrap them in a figure of eight around the bar.

, Remove the weight from your kite and flip it over so the inflated edge is pointing upwards. Undo all of the valves to let the air out. Once the kite is flat again, fold one wing tip over and then just simply roll your kite up till you get to the middle and then repeat this the other side. To hold your first roll in place use your board. Now you can fold your kite to fit bag in your bag.

, Unroll your lines from your bar downwind and lay them on the ground. Next, grab your 2 centre lines and walk up to the kite, making sure there's no tangles or knots in them. The outside lines on the bar always attach to the back of the kite. Attach your lines to the kite using a larks head knot remembering that the closer the knot to the kite the more power the kite will have in the air. Note that beginners should attach their lines to the knots in the middle of the rope.

, Now you are ready to attach your harness. Wrap this around your back and close the two flaps across your stomach. Next, secure the buckle and pull the fastening tight to make sure there is no movement. Pull the bottom straps as tight as you can to stop the middle bar rising. Pick up your bar and make sure the loop is facing you with the strap at the bottom. Hook the loop over the bar on your harness and thread the strap through the bar below the loop. Finally, fasten your leash on the harness to the leash point on the bar to act as your safety system should you come off your board.

, Walk back downwind to the launch point. Your knowledgeable friend should now turn the kite over and stand with the kite vertical whilst holding the inflated edge. When you are ready to go, give your friend the thumbs up and they should let go of the kite and then it should fly straight up to the top of the wind window.

Get informed!,
Do a tandem jump.,
Choose a method for training.,
Plan to complete your training with none or as little interruptions as possible.,
Choose a dropzone.,
Study.,
Do it!,
Don't give up!,
When you've got your license, don't just buy the first rig you see.",How to Become a Skydiver," The information available on the Web is enormous. One place to start is http://www.dropzone.com. Also, visit http://www.uspa.org which is the regulating body for U.S. skydivers.;
, This is a very good way of finding out if you'll enjoy skydiving or not.

, The two common methods are AFF and Static Line training. Research and find out which one is best suited for your personality, lifestyle and budget.

,


Choose the right time to start training. Skydiving is a weather dependent sport and the restrictions are stricter, the less experience you have. Each country's governing body has different rules regarding weather conditions though two conditions are important: low winds and a cloud cover that allows the drop zone to be visible from the airplane. It is ideal to start training during a time of the year when you'll be able to complete your training without weather breaks. Try to do your own research and take advice from drop-zones with a pinch of salt.






Ensure you have enough funds to finish training using the method of your choice. Besides the cost of training, you have to consider the cost of membership to your country's governing body for skydiving and transportation plus accommodation at the dropzone (see tips).






Ensure your lifestyle will allow you to finish training without major interruptions. While you can never predict weather or financial troubles, going away for extended periods will not allow for continuous training and may invalidate your theoretical briefing.







,


Make a list of all approved locations in your vicinity.






Research their reviews on dropzone.com or your country/ region's skydiving forum. Look for constant reviews from active members and be wary of ""cowboys"". Look at the fatalities section for the dropzone and avoid it if it has any student incidents.






Ask from information from the dropzone: student incidents, number of airplanes, number of loads, number of students and number of AFF instructors. Small drop zones are a good place to skydive, but large drop-zones offer more knowledge for the student skydiver. Do not be afraid of having a different instructor every time!







,


Go to your chosen dropzone and learn the theory behind skydiving.






During the course, be honest! Everybody is scared before the first solo jump. Even most of those with thousands of jumps will happily talk about their fears, worries, and stressful moments.







,


Follow your instructor(s) into the airplane and enjoy the ride.






Do not deviate from the plan. If you plan to do three dummy pulls and one did not succeed, do not try to do the fourth unless agreed beforehand with the instructor.






Smiling, relaxation and not over thinking can make a difference between a bad or a good skydive.







, Certain aspects of skydiving can be boring and frustrating, especially the weather.

, Rent, borrow and try as many different types as you can, before you spend your hard-earned money.

Consider your ability.,
Test the weight.,
Check the bindings.,
Look for a grab handle.",How to Choose the Right Kite Surf Board," If you're a novice, there is no point picking an expert board as you will need be able to balance on it or control it. Spend some time researching before you go into the shop.;
, You need to be able to carry your board with one hand and fly through the air with it strapped to your feet, so make sure it doesn't feel too heavy.

, The bindings need to be secure enough so that the board doesn't slip off mid-flight but light enough for you to get your feet out quickly if things start going wrong. Test the straps before you buy them by slipping you feet in and out in the shop.

, Some boards come with a grab handle. This is a small handle in the middle of the board which allows you to do tricks in the air, such as taking the board on and off your feet, mid jump. If you're just starting out then this is probably not for you, but some boards have detachable grab handles so that the option is always there for later.

Think safety.,
Select a good surface.,
Check the wind.,
Take care when kite surfing.,
Keep an eye out for non-kiters.,
Be attentive to the need for permits or outright bans on kite flying.",How to Choose a Suitable Location for Power Kiting," Make sure that the area you choose is safe. Avoid any obstacles, like buildings, power cables, cliffs, roads or trees, as these will put a very swift end to your day out. The area needs to be flat and open so the wind can easily blow through.;
, If you're land boarding, make sure the surface you choose is flat and even, with no major pot holes, as this could spell disaster. Freshly cut low grass or a flat hard beach where the tide has gone out are best. A hard beach surface will make you go faster so stick to grass if you are still learning, plus it's a lot softer when you fall off!

, The direction of the wind is crucial when you power kite. If you're kite surfing you need to check the wind won't drag you out to sea or pull you back to land. Wind speeds are also important in all forms of kiting. It needs to be strong enough to pull you but not above your ability level. If you feel out of your depth, stop and pack away. Look online for good localised weather and wind predictions.

, When you're kite surfing, be aware of other obstacles in the water such as groynes or small sailing craft. Make sure you have enough room to maneuver and that your kite will not tangle in anything and drag you under if it comes down to land.

, Non-kiters don't understand how much damage can be caused if they get hit by a kite or cut by the lines, so don't fly near other people and always make sure you kite drop zone is clear. Also keep an eye out for stray dogs or children who might wander into your path.

, Be wary that some councils and beaches aren't happy with people using these recreation spaces for kiting activities. Beware of signs warning you against kiting or you could end up with a fine.

As you get more experienced you can feel free to pick a kite board that suits your individual style and needs.Be sure to pick a kite that is appropriate for your bodyweight.They should be clearly labeled.
Beginner kites are usually 2.5-3.5m from wingtip to wingtip.If you are unsure, ask a dive or surf shop employee.;
, Choosing the right kite surfing board is essential. Every kite surfer is different, and you'll need to find one that is comfortable for you. Beginners will usually want larger, more stable boards. Be sure to pick up a board that is advertised for your weight.Your board shouldn't be too heavy. You should be able to carry it in one hand.
Make sure it has secure bindings to keep your feet connected to the board.
As you become more skilled you may want to get a board that has a handle so that you can learn to do tricks.

, In addition to having secure bindings on your board you will need safety equipment. You'll want a life jacket and a helmet at the very least, especially if you are a beginner. Be sure to also equip yourself with a safety or bypass leash so that you don't lose the kite if you lose your grip. You may also want to wear a wetsuit, especially in cold water.
A secure bathing suit is necessary. A string bikini probably won't do.

, Before you can do anything you will need to put your kite together and get it in the air. Lay your kite on its back, connect it to the pump, and inflate it.Setting up a surf kite for the first time isn't that hard, though it is easier if you have a experienced friend to help.

Tether your kite down while inflating, so it doesn't blow away.Learning on land can be done on the beach or even at a park.You don't necessarily need to be near the water for this.

, Walk backwards, downwind towards the launch point, laying out your line cleanly behind you as you go.Your partner should turn the kite over and stand with the kite ready to catch the wind. When you are ready, give your friend a signal to launch the kite. It should fly up and as high as possible, while being centered./images/thumb/8/84/Kite-Surf-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/v4-550px-Kite-Surf-Step-5-Version-3.jpg
/images/thumb/8/84/Kite-Surf-Step-5-Version-3.jpg/v4-300px-Kite-Surf-Step-5-Version-3.jpg








, Get used to flying your kite on land. You should be in control of the kite at all times. Practice flying the kite at the right and the left without losing control to practice turning. The area in which you maintain control is called your wind window. Keep practicing until you get used to your specific kite's wind window. /images/thumb/c/c4/Kite-Surf-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Kite-Surf-Step-6-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/c/c4/Kite-Surf-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Kite-Surf-Step-6-Version-2.jpg









For most kites the window will be at approximately 11 o'clock on the left and 1 o'clock on the right.
If desired and if the area is clear, you can ride a skateboard while you practice flying your kite., Once you are comfortable with the basic mechanics of the kite, it is time to get in the water. You'll do this without a board at first, and in wind conditions that are below 20 knots.Be sure that you are in a relatively clear area of the water. You don't want anyone within 100 yards.Practice the same flying exercises that you did while on land.

You will want to make sure that the area downwind of you is clear. That is probably where you will end up!, Whilst the kite is in the air, practice dragging yourself back and forth using the wind through the water. You'll be ""kite surfing"" without a surf board. Do this until you are comfortable controlling your kite.This is essential to safety so make sure you are practiced with it before progressing further./images/thumb/6/6f/Kite-Surf-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Kite-Surf-Step-8-Version-2.jpg
/images/thumb/6/6f/Kite-Surf-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-300px-Kite-Surf-Step-8-Version-2.jpg









You'll need to know how to do this if you ever have to retrieve a lost board.

, Whilst your kite is in the air, sit back in the water supported by your harness. Then put your feet onto the board and float to get used to the feeling. When ready, pull yourself up into a standing position. Keep your center of gravity low to maintain your balance before attempting to steer or surf.

Don't stand up too fast or aggressively - you might tip over the other way!
During the offseason you can practice your ""board skills"" on a skateboard., Turning the kite will be harder now that you are on your board. Push the steering bar forward to bring the kite over your head. This will slow you down, allowing you to more easily move the kite to the other side of the wind window and start in the opposite direction.

Avoid the chin stand if you have certain health problems.",How to Do a Chin Stand," To start, have two foam blocks sitting on your matt just in front of your face. You will need these when you transition into chin stand. You can buy blocks online or at a sports equipment store. They should be big enough that you can comfortably rest your shoulders on them when your arms are bent into a roughly 90 degree angle., Get onto your yoga mat on your hands and knees. Keep your knees directly below your hips. Place hands slightly forward of your shoulders with your fingers spread. Curl your toes slightly., To begin, lift your knees away from the floor as you exhale. Do not rise too much right now. Keep your legs slightly bent and your heels lifted off the floor., As you lift your knees, move your tailbone upward. As you lift your tailbone toward the ceiling, you will feel some resistance. Work against this and keep lifting, stretching your legs more as you go., Once you've lifted your tailbone as far as you can, stretch out your legs. Place your heels onto the mat. As you do this, straighten out your knees as much as you can without locking them.At first, you may not be able to get your heels to touch the mat. That's okay. Just do the best you can for now.

, Firm your arms and, while doing so, press your fingers into the floor. Keep your head between your upper arms and firm up your shoulders as you pull them back slightly., Walk a few inches forward in downward dog so you're closer to the blocks. Slowly bend your elbows to bring your upper body down. Keep bending until both shoulders rest on the blocks and your head hangs between the blocks., Slowly walk your feet inward towards the blocks. As you walk, raise your hips slightly. Keep walking in until your hips are high enough that your upper body form an almost straight line coming up from the blocks., Slowly, lift one knee in the air. To stay steady, keep your hips square. Spread the back of the knee open while fanning out your toenails for balance. Keep lifting until your leg forms a straight line with your body., Bend the leg on the ground. Give a small hop to lift your leg into the air. Draw your leg up and bring your legs together, hugging your thighs together as you spread out your toes., Hold the pose for as long as is comfortable for you. To hold, keep the core engaged. Continue to lift with your tailbone. Keep your toenails spread. It can help to pretend you're reaching for something on the ceiling.It's okay if your chin rests slightly on the floor, as long as it's not supporting any of your weight.

, The chin stand is a complicated move. If you're new to yoga especially, it's best to practice with someone else. See if you can find yoga classes in your area. A professional will help you make sure you're doing the move correctly and help you prevent injury.

, Eventually, you should be able to do the chin stand without the support of your blocks. However, this can take a great deal of time and practice. Do not attempt to do the chin stand until you can easily go through the movements without a lot of thought. They should feel second nature by the time you remove the blocks.Removing the blocks too soon can cause you to lose balance. This can lead to injury.

, The chin stand pose is not safe for everyone. If you have the following health problems, do not do the chin stand:Back or neck injuries
A heart condition
High blood pressure
Cervical spondylitis
Ulcers, hernias, or intestinal disorders

Some experts recommend taking at least one month to train and prepare your body to do a split.Follow the stretching and strength training regimen outlined in this article. Do not attempt to do a split without any training or preparation.;
, In addition to preparing your body, wearing the right clothes is important for doing the split. You'll want to wear loose-fitting clothes like sweatpants to help with your range of motion. It would also help to wear socks on a wooden or tile floor, so you can easily slide your feet out to the side., Just like with any stretching regimen, you can't attempt a Chinese split without first warming up your muscles. If you've been following a daily stretch and exercise regimen for several weeks to prepare for a split, perform your usual warm up regimen (about 15 to 20 minutes of physical activity) to make sure your muscles are ready for a split., After you warm up, you need to do some preliminary stretches. Stretch every major muscle group that's involved in doing the split before trying to do the actual split.Try to work through all of the stretches you've done in the previous weeks leading up to your Chinese split attempt. These are the muscle groups you will be using to do the actual split, so loosen your body the same way you've been training.

, After you've warmed up, you can start working on the split. It will probably take several attempts over days or weeks to do this split, so don't expect to get it your first time. Remember to stop at any point if you feel pain.Stand with your feet greater than shoulder width apart.
Bend down and put your hands on the ground. If you can't get your hands to the ground, you need to work on stretching more.
Shift your weight to your heels and rotate your toes and knees so that they're facing up.
Then gradually walk your feet out from under you. Keep your hands on the ground to maintain stability -- you don't want to go down too suddenly, or you could injure yourself.
Stop and hold when you've reached your limit. Even if you don't fully complete the split, try to hold the position to get your body conditioned.

, It's very unlikely that you'll be able to to a full split right away. It's not unusual for people to take months to get it down properly, even when they stretch every day. Keep up your routine and you'll be able to loosen up your muscle enough to perform a full Chinese split.


Try to extend the duration of your splits each day.Stay hydrated. Not drinking enough water can cause muscle cramps and may make you less flexible.Reduce inflammation in your legs and hips to help increase flexibility. One way to do this is by taking Omega 3 fatty acid supplements., Once you've completed the necessary flexibility and strength training, and once you've worked your way up to being able to slowly do a split, you'll eventually be able to simply drop into a split the way entertainers do in movies and martial arts competitions.


Being able to drop into a split will take some time and work - most people need over a month of consistent training and stretching to be capable of dropping into a split.You will need to develop a consistent stretching and strength-training regimen before attempting to drop into a split.

, Before you invest in training to do a split, it's important to be sure you're physically able to hold this position. Most people are capable of performing a split after proper training and stretching, but some people have a rare condition like coxa vara, which causes an abnormally deep-seated hip socket.This condition limits the range of movement in the legs and hips.A simple side split test can help determine if you're physically capable of doing splits.


Stand next to a table or chair that is about as tall as your waist.Keep one foot planted on the ground and lift the leg closest to the chair or table. Position your raised leg on the top of the chair or table.Repeat this test with your other leg to ensure both hips are adequately flexible.If you cannot perform this stretch painlessly, you may be unable to do a split.

, When your muscles are cold, they're less flexible and more brittle. If you stretch cold muscles, you could hyper-extend or tear them. To avoid this, do some light exercising before you stretch. That way, you'll increase the circulation to your muscles and loosen them up for stretching.The general rule is that a warm up exercise should just make you break a light sweat. This usually translates to about 15 minutes of activity.Some good workouts to try are a brisk walk, running in place for a few minutes, or doing jumping jacks.

, Chinese stretches require flexibility in almost all the muscles in your lower body, so you'll need to put in a lot of work before you can complete one. Do not try to do a side split right off the bat. You risk damaging your muscles and could even end up with a tear.To avoid injuring yourself, work to increase your flexibility before attempting a full split.Some techniques you should keep in mind for a proper stretching regimen are:


Spend about 30 seconds on each muscle, and repeat the stretch two to six times per session. Try to practice your sessions every day, unless you're sore or injured.At a minimum, you should be practicing your sessions three to four times each week.Keep your breathing under control. Quick breaths will cause your muscles to tense up. Learning how to breathe properly while you stretch can help you manage your range of motion.Never use a bouncing motion while stretching. Bouncing does not increase flexibility and can even be dangerous because it puts too much stress on the joints.Bouncing may have value for activities that require very quick bursts of motion, like sprinting, but since a split requires a sustained stretch, this technique will not be helpful.
Go slowly with your stretches. Don't try to stretch as far as you can right away. Ease into a stretch and repeat it several times to make sure your body is properly warmed up.Never push your body past its limits. While some level of discomfort might arise from a deep stretch, it shouldn't be painful. When a stretch hurts, you've gone far enough. Stop at this point to prevent injury.

, This stretch is very useful at loosening up your groin and inner thigh muscles, which are crucial to executing a Chinese split.


Sit on the floor with your back straight.Bend your knees and bring the soles of your feet together in front of you.Slowly pull your heels in towards your groin. Try to get your heels as close to you as you comfortably can, and keep your hands gripping your ankles.Gently flex your knees down until they are touching the floor, or as close to the floor as you can comfortably get them. You can use your elbows to push your knees downward.While exhaling, bend forward at the waist, and try to get your chest as close to the floor as possible. Hold the position for 20 seconds, then release it., This yoga position will help you stretch and loosen the muscles in your groin, calves, and quads, all major muscle groups needed to do a Chinese split.


Begin by lying flat on your back. As you exhale, pull your knees up towards your stomach.While holding the outsides of each foot in your hands, open your knees just past the width of your abdomen, and pull your knees towards your armpits.Try to keep your shins perpendicular to the floor. Hold the position for as long as you comfortably can (around 10 to 30 seconds should be sufficient), then release the pose., This yoga pose might be one of the best stretches to prepare your body for doing Chinese splits. Take it slow, though, as this position may be strenuous for first-time practitioners.


Begin by entering a staff pose. Sit on the floor with your back straight and your legs fully extended in front of you, with the insides of your feet touching.Spread both legs outward. Try to form both legs into 90 degree angles with your hips. Slide your bottom slightly forward while keeping your legs spread to help push your legs as wide as you can comfortably spread them.While keeping your knee caps pointed upward, stretch your hands forward between your legs as far as you can go without bending at the waist.Hold the pose for around one minute, or as long as you comfortably can. Then release the pose., The quads are the large muscles that make up the front of your thigh. They aren't the main muscle that works during the Chinese split, but if they're too tight it will impede the stretch.The easiest way to stretch your quads is by doing a standing stretch.


Stand up straight. If you're a beginner or have trouble with balance, stand in front of a wall and place one hand on it for support.Lift one foot up behind you, grabbing it with your free hand. Pull it up until you feel a good stretch in your thigh.Hold the position for 10 to 30 seconds, or as long as you can comfortably hold it.Repeat this motion for the other leg.

, This position is a common yoga pose, and it can help stretch your quads and build strength as you work towards doing a Chinese split.Start in a downward facing dog position, with your hands and feet (or at least the balls of your feet) firmly planted on the floor.While breathing out, bring your right foot forward between your hands.While breathing in, straighten your torso into an upright position while lifting your arms over your head. You should be kneeling on your left knee with your arms and torso vertically straight.Hold the pose for as long as you comfortably can, then return to downward facing dog. Repeat the pose on your right side., This pose is not for novice yoga practitioners, but if you've mastered the Virasana pose, you should be able to work toward a Reclining Hero pose. This position will help stretch your quad muscles even further.


Start by entering the Hero pose. Kneel on the floor with your knees touching slightly and the tops of your feet flat against the floor. Slowly slide your feet apart until they extend out past your hips.Lean back, first on your hands, and gradually stretching back so that your forearms and elbows are touching the floor behind you.Slowly lower your back towards the floor behind you. If you cannot stretch backwards to the floor (which will take a lot of time and practice), you can stack cushions behind you to lay your back against.Try to hold the pose for 30 to 60 seconds, or as long as you comfortably can., Your calf muscles make up the back of your lower leg. They are important to doing a split because they're attached to the hamstrings, and if the calves are tight they'll inhibit the hamstrings' stretching ability.Sit on the floor with your right leg extended in front of you.Bend your right knee slightly and grab the ball of your foot with both hands.Slowly pull back at the ball of your foot as far as you can.Hold the position for about 20 seconds, then release the pose. Repeat for your left leg., The hamstring is attached to your calf muscles, and is an important component in performing a Chinese split.


Sit on the floor with your right leg extended in front of you.Grab your right heel with both hands and slowly straighten your leg straight ahead of you.Bend forward while exhaling, slowly bring your chest as close to your right knee as you can. Keep your leg extended straight ahead so that you feel the tension in the back of your leg.Hold the stretch for about 20 seconds, then release the pose. Repeat for your left leg., This stretch will build off of the previous two stretches, helping you get your calves and hamstrings as flexible as possible.


Kneel on your left knee with your right leg straight ahead of you. Keep your right heel on the ground and the toes on your right foot pointed straight upward.With your back as straight as possible, reach toward your toes, or as close to your toes as you can reach.Hold the stretch for around 20 seconds, or as long as you comfortably can. Then release the pose, and repeat for your left leg., Contrary to popular belief, strength is very important for flexibility. Stretching pushes your muscles hard, and weak muscles could hyper-extend or tear. Make sure to strengthen your muscles before attempting a Chinese split.Unlike stretching, working out the muscles shouldn't be done every day. Your body needs recovery time after working out. Aim to do these workouts three to four days a week, with rests in between.

, Squats work out the entire leg, so performing these will help boost your leg strength.They are performed slightly different than traditional squats, so be sure to use the proper technique to get the best results.Start with your legs slightly greater than shoulder width apart and your toes pointed out at a 45 degree angle.
Bend your knees and squat down. Keep your back straight and make sure your knees don't go past your toes.
Aim to get your thighs and shins to form a 90 degree angle. Don't go further than that or you could hurt your knees.
Do two sets of 20 repetitions.
When you get used to this motion and build some strength, you can hold dumbbells in each hand. Start with light weights and then gradually increase them.

, Deep lunges are performed slightly different from traditional lunges. They involve a quick jump and a switch of your feet. This action both stretches and works out your entire leg.Start out performing a traditional lunge. Put your right foot forward with your left leg behind you.While lunging forward, twist your upper body to the right, toward your knee. Try to get your left elbow past your right thigh.Switch sides, lunging with your left foot forward and your right leg behind you.Change things up by twisting your upper body away from your knee.Do ten repetitions on each side twisting towards your knee, and ten repetitions on each side twisting away from your knee., Side lunges help strengthen your legs and also help stretch out the main muscles that perform the Chinese split. Include them in your workout regimen to train your legs for a Chinese split.Start by standing with your knees and feet together, and your knees slightly bent.Take a wide step to the right. Keep your toes pointed forward and lean into the stretch until your left leg is straight out to your side.Return to your starting position. Then perform the same motion leaning to the left, with your right leg straightened outward.Repeat the process, doing ten repetitions on each side."

Jump up as high and fast as you can several times in a row. This will help you to get a sense of what you'll need to do with the backflip. You should be jumping vertically, not backwards, and keeping your head faced forward.Get rolling: do some drills that get you used to the backward rolling motion. Try rolling backwards off your bed, do backward rolls on the ground, or go into a bridge backwards.Do a back handspring with spotters: start with one spotter on your left side and another on your right side. Have each place a hand against your lower back and another under your thigh, then lift you so that your legs are off the ground. Reach your hands above your head while the spotters lean you back so that your hands touch the ground. They should then throw your legs over your head. This will get you used to going backwards and being upside down.After doing the initial back handspring with spotters, use your legs to add some push as you flip backwards. Once you’re comfortable with that, keep using your legs but remove your hands (the spotters will still be holding you as you flip over).;
, The human body and brain don’t expect to be upside down, so they may react with fear when you attempt your backflip.This could cause you to startle or attempt to cut the backflip off midway through, which is likely to lead to injury. In order to pave the way for a smooth backflip, you can get your mind and body ready in advance.









Try a hanging tuck-up: hanging from a bar, tuck your chin slightly downward and bend your knees up toward your head. Then crunch your core and rotate your body as far backward as you can.Do some box jumps: leap onto as high a platform as you can, focusing on height, not depth.You might also try piling a couple of thin “crash” mats onto a thicker one and then throwing yourself onto them on your back. This will help you to see that what is likely your most common fear—that you will fall on your back during the flip—won’t actually hurt that much., When you're first learning to do a backflip, you want a surface that will provide some cushioning or is at least soft enough that it doesn’t interfere with your ability to jump.


A trampoline can work in this situation, provided that you can control your momentum. Or, you might try checking out a professional gym or a school gymnasium for access to gymnastics mats.A backflip newbie should absolutely stay away from hard, dangerous surfaces like concrete or blacktop.

, Until you have considerable practice under your belt, do not attempt a backflip without the assistance of a spotter, who can help you make it all the way around your flip, maintain good form, and save you from injury.


Ideally, your spotter will be someone who understands how the backflip works.This could be a gymnastics coach, a trainer at your gym, or someone who has practiced backflips on his/her own.
If you have access to more than one spotter to help guide you through the flip, you’re more likely to have a safe landing., Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart and your arms high above your head., You want to keep your head in a neutral position, facing forward.. It may help to pick a physical object to keep your eyes on.


Do not look at the ground! And don’t glance around either.If you do these things, you may become distracted or lose your balance.

, You want to bend your knees slightly, as though you are about to sit in a chair—however, don’t go quite that far.


Don’t bend too deeply. If you’re bending like you would for a squat, you’re bending too much., First, swing your arms from high over your head to back past your hips; then, swing them forward, back toward the ceiling. They should continue swinging until they go a little past your ears.This swinging motion will help to give you momentum to lift your body into the air.You are actually bending your knees and swinging your arms at the same time.
Keep your arms straight the whole time—don’t allow them to go flailing about.

, Many people believe that you have to jump back to do a backflip, but what you really need to do is jump up as high as you can.








Jumping backwards (instead of up) will cause you to lose your center of gravity and you won’t go as high.And height is very important for a successful backflip!
If you don’t yet have a powerful jump, there are a variety of surfaces you can practice on to improve its strength: a trampoline, a resi pit, or a springboard, for example., Once you lift off the ground, tighten your ab and leg muscles. You want these muscles to form a rigid line., Your hips, not your shoulders, provide the rotation for your backflip.







, For as long as possible, maintain your forward focus; if you look back before it’s absolutely necessary, you will change the angle of your body and slow your rotation, which will decrease the height of your flip.Once your body actually begins to flip over, you will naturally lose sight of your focal point. Just try not to do so before you need to and, if possible, look for it again on your way back down—finding it will let you know that you’re ready to land.While it may be tempting to close your eyes while flipping, you want to keep them open as this helps with the spatial awareness that is necessary for a good landing. You need to see what other people are doing so you can rim. , At the highest point of your jump, drive your knees toward your chest. At this point, bring your arms back toward your legs.








Your chest should be about parallel with the ceiling at the point at which you’ve finished pulling your knees to your chest.
You may choose to grab your hamstrings (the backs of your thighs) with your arms as you tuck your legs, or you can grab your knees if you prefer.If you find yourself turning to the side as you tuck, this is likely a result of your fear reflex. You may need to engage in some of the drills listed above to eliminate this fear before you are able to successfully complete the backflip., As you fall back toward the ground, open your body back up by extending your lower back and legs., This will help you to absorb the shock of the landing.If you land with your legs straight, you are more likely to suffer an injury.


You should be in a near-standing position when you land. If you’re crouched over, just keep practicing—it’ll come with time!Ideally you will hit the ground right around where you took off from; it’s likely that you may end up within a foot or two from your take-off spot.
It may help to look at a point on the ground right in front of you as you land., You want to land on your entire foot, not just the tips of your toes. If you find that you’re landing on your tip toes, you need to continue practicing to make your flip stronger., You should land with your arms parallel to one another and extended straight out in front of your body.

In order to get enough speed and rotation to achieve a front flip you will want to be able to take 5-8 steps before you leap.Make sure you are practicing over a mat or into a soft landing zone such as a foam pit.;
, Bend your knees to explode into your jump and push off from the balls of the front of your feet. Spring upwards and lengthen your body as you push off from the floor.Practice simple exercises such as deep knee bends, jump squats, and calf raises to build your leg strength and increase your jump height.Place a mini trampoline in front of a landing mat or foam pit to practice getting extra height as you jump.

, Keep your hands by your side as you flip forward in the air.


Tuck your chin towards your chest as you go into the air.
Pull your legs back to promote your body to rotate forward.

, After you have rotated ⅔ of the way in the air, raise your arms to stop your rotation to prepare for landing.Keep your eyes open as you rotate.
Look for the floor while you are in the air to spot your landing.
Practice flipping into a foam pit first to get a feel for how fast you need to rotate your body to complete the flip.
Build muscle memory of how much rotation you need to fully rotate your flip by practicing over and over into a foam pit.

, Cushion your impact with the ground by bending your knees slightly as you land. Use your arms to balance and stabilize your body as you land.


Make sure to spot the ground as you are landing.
When you finish your rotation in the air, keep an eye on the ground where you will place your feet.
Knowing where the ground is will help ensure you don't over rotate the flip.

, Before attempting a barani, make sure you are fully able to perform a front flip safely.Performing a front flip on a trampoline is a good way to gain muscle memory of the required rotation.

, The beginning of a barani is the same as performing a front flip.Get a running start.
Bend your knees before take off.
Extend your body and push off from the balls of your feet.

, Your arms will provide the momentum for your twist during your flip. Extend your arms to your sides to alter your center of gravity and allow you to propel your body into a twist as you flip.Lift your left arm behind your back.
Dip your right arm forward..
Use your arms to lead your body into the twist.
If your rotation is too much or too little, adjust the position of your arms in the air to change the amount your body rotates.

, As you begin your flip, turn your head to look at your left bicep as you pull your left arm backwards. Your body will follow the rotation of your arms and head.


Small motions of the head translate to large rotations of the body.
Adjust the amount you turn your head to change the speed of your rotation.

, Because a barani only involves a half twist, you will not have to rotate very much to achieve the motion. As soon as your body begins rotating, raise your arms above your head to stop the spin and prevent over rotation.

, Similar to landing a front flip, bend your knees as you land to cushion your impact. Be prepared to take a step backwards as your momentum may carry you backwards as you land.Spot your landing zone as you stop your rotation in the air.
Bring your arms to your sides as you land.
Try to keep your arms at your side, but you can use your arms to balance as you land to prevent a fall.

Hold each stretch for at least 15 to 20 seconds.
Don't overstretch. You can injure yourself by pushing a stretch too far.;
, This is a position in yoga where you bend your back from lying face down on the mat.Lay on your stomach with your hands on the ground, shoulder width apart, slightly in front of your head.
Press the upper half of your body off the floor, pushing down with your arms. Your legs and hips should stay on the ground.
Take the stretch as far as you can go.
A common problem for beginners is not being able to extend the arms the whole way. The only way to be able to gain enough flexibility to do this is to practice this position and regular stretching.

, This will gently stretch your back. It can be difficult to get into this position, but it will get better with practice.Lay on your stomach with your arms and legs straight.
Reach your arms past your sides and towards your feet.
Bend your legs at the knee and grab your ankles with your hands.
Lift your upper and lower body off of the mat and rock back and forth gently.
This can be very hard for people who are not flexible. If you are having trouble getting into the position, try some stretching exercises or yoga to improve flexibility.

, You can do this from standing or from the ground.Lay on the ground with your knees bent at a 90 degree angle. Your feet should be planted firmly on the mat.
Place your hands by your feet at your ears with your fingers pointing at your feet. Your elbows should point up towards the ceiling.
Push your back off of the mat with your feet and hands planted firmly on the mat. You are in a complete bridge backbend when your arms and legs are straight.
You might not be able to get into a bridge backbend completely at first, but this will improve with practice.
A common problem for people who can't seem to master a bridge backbend is the position of the feet. Often times they are too far forward for proper leverage. Make sure your feet are directly underneath your knees as you push your back off of the mat.
Also check the position of your hands to make sure they aren't too far away from your head.
You can also lower yourself into the same position from a standing backbend. Doing this from a standing backbend will give you more momentum for your kick-over.

, This will help you to get enough leverage for the kick-over.


Make sure your back is bent and not sagging down towards the floor.
Don't overextend your back in this position to avoid injury.
Don't stiffen your neck to avoid strain.

, You will need to have your weight shifted forward to have the momentum to do the kick-over.


Make sure your body is in the correct bridge backbend position before you kickover.
Correct your posture and hand position if needed.
Have your spotter check to make sure there aren't any people or objects in your way before you proceed.

, Remember to push forward.This can be the most challenging part of the backbend because you have to have enough flexibility and momentum to get your leg over your body as it is in a back bend.
A common problem as that the weight is not shifted forward enough to provide momentum for the kick-over. If you can't complete the move, then try to shift your weight forwards more and push off the ground firmly.

, A common problem for beginners is they don't have enough strength or flexibility to complete the kick-over part of this move.


To help fix this, use the wall to help you practice the kick-over.
Get into a bridge with your feet by a wall and use it to walk your feet upwards and push off. This will give you the momentum to complete the full kick-over.
You can also use a wedged mat for leverage if you are having the problem of not being able to complete your kick-over.
Stand on the thick side of the mat and perform your backbend. The thick side gives you extra height and makes the kick-over easier.
Use these modifications until you've mastered the kick-over. Then try again without them.

Stretch well.,
Stand up.,
Do a backbend.,
Lift your lead leg up.,
Move into a split handstand.,
Land on your lead leg.,
Stick your landing.",How to Do a Backbend Kickover," It is incredibly important to stretch before you attempt any gymnastics skill, even if you're only doing a simple somersault. To prepare for a backbend kickover, you'll need to stretch your ankles, your wrists, and your back. Here's what you should do:









Stretch your wrists. Extend one hand with your palm away from you, as if you're saying ""stop,"" and pull back your fingers with the other hand until you feel a nice stretch in your wrist. Repeat this move with your other hand. After you're done, you can hold on to one hand below the wrist and give the wrist a couple of nice rolls before doing the same with the other hand and wrist.
Stretch your ankles. Sit down and roll each ankle just as you rolled each wrist. Hold on to the leg just above the ankle around roll it a few times in one direction, and then the other. For a more thorough, deep stretch, you can even spell out the alphabet with each foot.
Stretch your back. You can always stretch your back with just a few simple yoga poses, such as such as the camel pose, bow pose, or cobra pose.
Stretch your groin area. Go into a straddle split if you can to help ease out the tension around the area between your legs.;
, Stand with your dominant foot pointing forward a bit. Your legs should be shoulder width apart and your arms should be above your head, strong and locked. Your arms should be near your ears. Relax your body but be ready to tense your muscles as soon as you move.









If this is your first attempt at a backbend kickover, then consider getting a spotter. A spotter can help you feel steady and secure by placing a hand on the small of your back and another on your stomach, or just by being there in case you fall.

, Once you're comfortable doing a bridge, you should be ready for a backbend. It'll take a bit of practice, but you'll be able to get it done with enough determination. You can practice by moving your hands down a wall behind you until they reach the ground before doing a backbend from the standing position. Here's what you should do once you're ready:









Stand with your feet about shoulder's width apart.
Flatten your palms until they face the ceiling, with your fingers pointing behind you.
Begin to slowly bend backwards while keeping your arms locked as you approach the ground. Just keep following your arms.
Plant both hands firmly and keep your feet in place once your hands reach the ground.
Keep your hands as close to your feet as possible when you are in the bridge. This will facilitate your movements when you go to do a back kickover.

, Lift up your lead leg so it's pointing almost straight up in the air. Use the power of your other leg to help you do this. To keep your backbend steady, gaze in between your hands and keep pushing up your hips. Straighten your legs and keep your chest above your shoulders so you look like an upside down check. This will lighten the weight on your legs, making it easier to kick over. Also, it is easier to kick over when your shoulders are directly above your hands, or pushed over your hands.








, Keep your hips straight and your body tight when you are upside down. Push your shoulders past your hands when you are in the bridge and about to kick over. Use the foot that's on the ground to help your body lift up until you're essentially in the split handstand position, with your lead leg pointing forward and your other leg pointing backwards; if you don't have the handstand yet, then work on this move before you attempt the back kickover.









Remember to keep your legs straight and your feet pointed.

, Continue to move your legs forward, through the handstand, until you've landed on the ground with your lead leg. The other leg should follow. Keep your hands planted on the ground and your shoulders squared. Keep in mind it takes a lot of strength. In fact, it's actually easier when you move faster because you have more momentum.








, Plant your second foot on the ground, stand straight, and lift your hands in the air, maintaining a straight back. Your lead leg should be pointed a foot or so in front of your other leg. You should find yourself in the same position you started in. If you had fun, you can go right into another back kickover from this position! If you've done enough work for the day, have a glass of water and praise yourself for a job well done.

Keep practicing.",How to Do a Back Handspring at Home," If you’ve never tried a back handspring before, then your best bet is to practice at the gym with your gymnastics coach or another professional. However, if you feel confident enough to do the back handspring at home, then you should make sure to get a spotter to help you when you’re starting out. Having a spotter will keep you from injuring yourself, overstepping your bounds, and hurting your head, neck, or back.


Ideally, your spotter should also be a fellow gymnast or cheerleader, so he or she is familiar with what to do. Your spotter should place a hand on your lower back while placing the other under your thighs as you flip backwards.
Stand by your spotter with your legs, feet, and knees nearly together and your arms in front of you.
First, do a “trust fall” back into your spotter’s arms just to make sure that he or she can handle your weight.
Ideally, there should be a soft mat behind you so you don’t hurt yourself if you fall.
At first, your spotter will do some of the work for you, helping to flip your body over by pushing your back and your thighs up as you flip backwards. However, once you’re comfortable on your own, the spotter should only be there to make you feel safe, not to actually help you.;
, You may be eager to get started on your back handspring, but any experienced gymnast or cheerleader will tell you that stretching is vital to your success and safety, even if you’re only doing a somersault. It’s important to warm up a bit and to get your blood flowing before you go into a full-on back handspring. Though stretching all of your body is important, you can focus on stretching your legs, your arms, and your neck, as well as your wrists. Here are some stretches you can try before doing a back handspring:


Stretch your back by doing a back bend. Then, do a counter-stretch by curling up into a ball on the floor and hugging your knees to roll out your back. For an extra stretch in your back, stand up and touch your toes.
Roll your head clockwise five times and then counter-clockwise five times, to stretch your neck a bit. You can also roll your shoulders forward and backward.
Place one hand in front of you, as if you were saying “Stop!” and then gently pull back the fingers of that hand with your other hand. Repeat with the other hand to get a deep stretch in your wrists. Then, roll your wrists clockwise five times and counter-clockwise five times to finish stretching them.
Sit down and roll your ankles clockwise and counterclockwise. You can even spell the alphabet with each of your feet to get a full stretch.

, The best thing you can do is to bring home a thick gym mat, which will give you some cushioning without letting you sink in too far, as a mattress would. If you don’t have that, consider using a long couch cushion or a mattress, while being careful not to sink into them too much — if you don’t have enough momentum, you may end up falling back into the handstand position and then sinking in to the floor instead of springing up.


You can also consider using a trampoline, if you have one, to give yourself the confidence to use a harder surface. Just remember that you won’t need nearly as much momentum to fall backward on a trampoline.
If you’re trying the back handspring outside in your yard, pick a softer surface, like a grassy surface that’s a little pliable, instead of concrete or another harder surface that won’t give.

, Keep your feet about hip distance apart and look straight ahead of you, in front of the tips of your fingers. Your hands should be about parallel to the ground when they’re in front of you. Keep your back straight, with a slight bend in your knees, preparing to lower yourself down.


You can also start in the true starting position, with your arms raised over your head, by your ears, before you move them down to be parallel to the ground before you swing them up again.

, Now, you can bend those knees further, as if you were lowering yourself into a chair. Place those knees directly over your feet to help yourself generate some momentum. As you do this, you should swing your arms over your head to help generate momentum as you swing backward.


It can be helpful to practice the first two poses so you get the logistics down before you to try jump right in to the back handspring.
It’s important to start with a strong foundation, so you’re generating enough momentum and maintaining proper form throughout the back handspring.

, Now, let your arms swing until they reach over your head while pushing through your toes to give yourself that extra upward momentum. You should lean your arms back as far as they will go; there’s no need to worry about landing your arms right near the place where your feet stood, because you’ll have to fall back a bit.


As you swing your arms up, you should make sure to keep them by your ears.
Make sure to tighten your shoulder and arm muscles and raise your head back between your arms.

, As you do this, make sure you don’t arch your back too much — there should be at least 2 feet (0.6 m) between the place where you start and the place where you land your hands. If you land those hands too close to your feet, then you will risk injuring yourself. Arching your back too much is known as undercutting and it could cause you to sprain your back when you land.


Your legs should continue to drive you backward and upward at the same time.
Extend through your ankles while pointing your toes.
Continue to keep your head between your arms as you get closer to the floor.

, As you finish falling backwards with an arched back, you should keep your arms straight and even with your head so your arms touch the floor, instead of your head. The momentum in your legs, along with that of your lower body, should carry you over. Keep your fingers pointing away and up from your face, with your palms staying flat on the ground, on either side of your head.


When you plant your hands on the floor, don’t put all of your pressure into your wrists. Instead, use the pads of your fingers and your palms for support. Otherwise, you risk injuring your wrists.
At this point, your legs may still be out in front of you, but your body will soon be almost straight, in a handstand-position.

, Now, you’ll find yourself in what is essentially the handstand position for a second. You should swing your legs over your head so that they are straight up in the air, in a handstand position, as they continue to swing downwards. Though you won’t actually “hold” the position because the back handspring is a continuous motion, your body will be in this position briefly as you move toward finishing the back handspring.


Keep your feet together or as close together as they can be, and keep your shoulders strong to support your body weight.
You shouldn’t lock your knees, but work to keep your legs as straight as possible.

, Your legs should swing over your arms and torso and all the way down to the floor. Make sure to snap them firmly down to the floor while your upper body remains straight as it begins to shift upward. Your feet should be about shoulder width apart, with your toes pointing straight in front of you, just in the same position that you started in. You’ll land with your knees slightly bent and will straighten out as you finish the move.


As your feet drift toward the floor, your upper body should prepare to pop upward. You’ll literally “spring” up as your feet hit the floor. Your arms and upper body should move upward just as your feet hit the floor.

, As you land, pop your body up and swing your arms straight in front of you, and then up over your head, in order to strike the finishing pose with your arms up over your head, and your feet touching with your back straight. Though your first back handspring may not be exactly what you were hoping for, with practice, you’ll be able to execute it as well as you can.

, It takes lots of practice to get the back handspring down. Once you’re comfortable enough doing the back handspring without a spotter, you can practice at home on your own, with a comfortable surface. You can work on getting the timing down, so you can reach your arms over your head and fall backwards without enough momentum to “spring” forward to execute the move. Aim to do a dozen back handsprings a day and you’ll be able to master the technique.


One common problem with the back handspring is falling backwards to one side. Make sure your feet and arms are parallel so you don’t fall to the left or right and end up with an uneven back handspring.
Remember to arch your back, but not too much. Another common problem with the back handspring is that you’ll arch your back so much that you’ll end up finishing almost where you started, creating a move that looks almost like a back flip, and risking injury.
You may also have trouble generating enough momentum to do a back handspring on your own. If that’s the case, you may want to practice doing a round-off backhandspring so you have enough momentum to spring upward.

Kick your back leg up.,
Keep your balance.,
Stand on a mat or soft ground.,
Bend your knees and squat.,
Drive your legs up.,
Hold your handstand.,
Put one leg down first.",How to Do a Back Extension," Bend your knees and come close to the floor, almost as though you are going to sit. Hover just above the ground, with your thighs hugging close to your calves. As you get more comfortable with this move, you can start from a standing squat. Eventually you will start from a completely standing position.;
, Bend your elbows close to your body so that your hands are by your ears. Tuck your head between your arms and curl your back forwards.


As you get more comfortable with the position, you can start with your hands extended out in front of you.

, When your head hits the mat, tuck your chin and push the ground with your hands. Think about pushing your body away from the mat with your hands.


Be sure to keep your shoulders and arms strong and close to your head. They are your point of strength.

, Using the momentum of your legs and the strength of your arms, bring your legs over your head and your feet to the mat.


You may have to use your core strength as well. Kick your legs to gain momentum, but squeeze your abs to pull your feet to the mat.

, Once your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands, pushing your upper body up to follow your feet. You will be in a squat with your hands on the mat. Stand up from there, with your arms up.


In order to practice for your back extension, you can practice ending in a pushup position instead of a standing position. When your feet hit the mat, press against the mat with your hands and use your ab muscles to straighten out into a plank position. Hold that position to build strength.

, Keep your arms extended upward and your legs together. Even though you will be putting a lot of stress on your shoulders, don’t shrug your shoulders and pull them up to your ears. Let them lie naturally on the mat.

, Use your core strength. Your toes should be pointed towards the ceiling.


Resist the urge to kick your legs up. Bring them up slowly, using your abdominal muscles to balance out the weight of your legs.

, It should be as though you are standing on your shoulders. Think about your shoulders as a lever, or point of strength. You will be resting on your shoulders and upper back with your body pointed straight towards the sky.


To keep your neck safe, tuck your chin and press your hips forward.

, To hold the position, you will need to have a fixed point to focus on. Keep your core strong.


You can either leave your arms by your ears, or put your hands on the mat to give yourself support. Some people also bring their hands to the small of their back for added support.

, One leg should be bent and in front, knee over ankle, with the other leg trailing behind. Keep your arms pointed toward the mat with your fingers spread wide apart.Keeping your fingers spread is an important part of creating a strong base. If you don’t have a wide base, it will be hard for you to get up and stay up.

, Fold your body forward, then lean forward and catch yourself with your arms. Your torso and legs should be at about a ninety degree angle.


If your hands hit the mat too close to your feet, you will not be able to get the momentum to get up into a handstand.

, As you do this, push your front leg against the floor and bring it up to meet the other leg.


Pushing against the floor will give you the momentum to bring the legs together.

, Squeeze your legs and point your toes toward the ceiling. Leave your head neutral--don’t tuck your chin or look towards the floor. Stare straight ahead and try to find a fixed point.Come down one leg at a time.


As you hold the position, keep your toes pointed toward the ceiling.
Keep your shoulders open, and your fingers splayed out.

, Keep your arms straight above your head. Do not swing them down before you initiate the roll.It may help to hook your fingers together if you are just beginning to learn the skill.

, Push hard with your feet and start rolling backwards.


This will be a lot like doing a backward roll, but the key difference is that you have to be more aggressive., This will be somewhat like driving your legs up into a candlestick position, but much more aggressive. Lever yourself up to a handstand. Use your shoulders as a lever against the floor when you bring your legs up and roll your weight onto your hands.


Just as you stood on your shoulders for your candlestick, you will use your shoulders as a point of strength to lever yourself into a handstand.

, You will want coaches and judges know that you made it to a handstand.


This is where practicing your handstand comes in handy. Squeeze your core and legs together to keep your handstand strong. Keep your fingers splayed and point your toes toward the ceiling.

, It doesn't matter which leg comes down first. When the other leg swings down, keep the first leg bent. That way, you can come down strong on the back leg, keeping it straight.


Remember to keep good form, with your arms up and head held high.

Decide where to store your kayak.,
Control the temperature of the storage area.,
Wash out your kayak.,
Dry your kayak.,
Remove soft materials if storing outside.,
Cover your kayak.",How to Store a Kayak1," You need an area with enough space for your kayak. Measure your kayak and your storage space ahead of time to make sure your kayak will fit. Kayaks take up a lot of room and should not be in contact with other objects when being stored. It is best to store it indoors so that it is protected. You could store it in a garage, basement, shed, or any other indoor storage area. Only store it outside as a last resort.If you'll be storing it for long periods of time and have minimal space at your home, you can have the kayak professionally stored. Many kayak schools, kayak rentals, marinas, paddling clubs, or state beaches have available kayak storage.;
, Make sure your kayak won’t be subjected to extreme heat or cold. Avoid temperatures below freezing or above 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.7 degrees Celsius). This is important so that your kayak doesn’t become brittle or damaged.Storing your kayak in direct sunlight is the worst option. The heat will warp the plastic and fade the surface. If you're storing the kayak in your garage, make sure it's in a dark area.
Make sure you are not storing your kayak near a direct heat source either.

, Use a mild all-purpose cleaner (such as diluted Castile soap) and a sponge to wipe down your kayak. Make sure to clean the inside and outside. There should be no remaining dirt or residue. Rinse thoroughly with water after cleaning with soap so that no soap remains on the kayak., Although kayaks are built for use in water, they are not made to be wet continually. Water will begin to break down the kayak’s surface. If it is covered and there is any moisture inside, mold and mildew will grow. To dry your kayak, wipe it with a towel and empty any water from its hatch or drain plug., Any fabric or soft materials on your kayak, such as the seat, should be removed for storage. This is especially important when storing outside. Soft materials should be stored somewhere dry and not too cold, like in a closet., Whether storing your kayak outside or inside, it is a good idea to use a cover. This will protect your kayak from the elements outside and from dust and critters in a garage. You can buy a special kayak cover, use a cover for the cockpit, or use a simple tarp and drape it over your kayak for added protection.It using a tarp, it is best to create space between the tarp and the kayak so that water or snow will not build up on top of the kayak (if it is outside) and so that any remaining moisture isn’t locked inside the kayak. To use the tarp like a tent, tie a rope a few feet off the ground in between two trees or poles. Drape the tarp over the rope and place the kayak in its mini “tent.”"
"
Find a level surface.,
Store the kayak horizontally on its side.,
Store the kayak vertically.,
Avoid storing the kayak flat.",How to Store a Kayak2," This will allow the kayak to balance evenly. Make sure there is a wall that it can lean against. It is best to store a kayak somewhere indoors. This will protect it from the elements outside.A garage, basement, or shed are great places to store a kayak.

, Tilt the kayak so that it is horizontal and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. It should be resting on its side, not flat. It will rest against the wall at an angle.The side of a kayak is one of the strongest parts, so it will not dent easily. But over an entire season, depending on what your kayak is made of (for example, plastic dents easily), it could begin to dent. To avoid this, flip it onto its other side once a month.

, Instead of resting it horizontally, turn it vertically and rest it against a wall with its cockpit facing out. To keep it in place while standing up, it should be at a slight angle. You should also store it so that its stern is touching the ground and its bow is up towards the ceiling.To protect your kayak and help it to stay in place, put some padding underneath it. You could place a few towels or cushions inside a small crate and place the end of the kayak inside.
To keep your kayak in place, you can install a couple of support pegs on the outer edge of each side of the top of the kayak., For a short amount of time, it will be ok, but storing it flat, whether face-up or face-down, puts significant stress on the kayak. Because of this, it is best to avoid storing it flat on the ground whenever possible.This includes hanging the kayak from the ceiling. Hoists can conveniently get kayaks out of the way, but they are not very secure, and since the kayak has to lay flat, significant stress is placed on the kayak. Therefore, it is better to mount it on a wall."
"
Find a sturdy structure.,
Buy a rope or bracket-style storage system.,
Attach the storage unit to the wall.,
Hang the kayak on its side.,
Attach the kayak on each side of the cockpit.,
Ensure the kayak is properly balanced.,
Avoid hanging it by its handles.",How to Store a Kayak3," Never hang a kayak from drywall or plywood. You need a sturdy wood beam or strong metal pipes that will support the kayak. Choosing a good location to hang it from is important to ensure the safety of the kayak and the wall.Most wall mounting storage systems require you to install them in the studs of the wall.

, A rope system works by attaching the ropes to your wall and wrapping the ropes around your kayak. A bracket system works by supporting the kayak on top of the brackets, which are installed into the wall. They are both good, safe ways to hang a kayak, but a bracket system is more expensive.


You can purchase a tilt storage rack for $100. This is a storage rack that consists of two large brackets that you will mount to a wall. They securely support your kayak and fold out of the way when not in use.You can purchase a kayak hanger for $25. It works by attaching ropes to the wall with hooks. It is easy to install and the ropes go around your kayak to hold it in place. Or if you already have sturdy ropes, you can build your own for free!, If you purchased a storage system, refer to the manual and follow its instructions. Different installation is required for different systems.


To attach the tilt storage rack, you must locate the studs of your wall and then drill a hole into the center of the stud. You will attach one post at a time, making sure they are perfectly level. You will attach the top of the post first and then the bottom. Your distance between the posts will depend on the size of your kayak. Their distance should be at least the diameter of the kayak’s cockpit.To attach the kayak hanger, you must locate wall studs or ceiling rafters. You will then drill a hole for the eye bolts. The distance between them should be about a third of the total length of the kayak. You will screw in the eye bolts by twisting them into the hole you drilled. You will then insert a hook into each eye bolt. The rope will hang down and you can wrap it around the kayak., Tilt the kayak onto its side. The kayak should be hung horizontally with its cockpit facing out. Its backside should lie flat against the wall., The cockpit is the strongest part of the kayak. The ropes or brackets should support the kayak right outside of its cockpit, one on each side., This is accomplished by making sure the straps or brackets are equidistant from each end of the kayak. By placing them just outside of the cockpit, it should be fairly centered, but feel free to adjust the kayak’s position so that it is completely level and not tilting towards one side or the other., It may seem convenient to hang a kayak by its carrying handles on its ends, but these are not meant for storage. The kayak will be put under a lot of stress by supporting it at its weakest points and will likely warp."
"
Buy PVC pipe and PVC joints.,
Assemble the PVC frame.,
Affix the PVC frame to a wall.,
Put your kayak vertically into the frame.,
Check on the kayak periodically.",How to Store a Kayak4," Purchase 10 feet (3 m) of 1-inch (2.54 cm) PVC pipe and 4 PVC joints and 3 1-inch PVC mounting clamps to create a 1 ft (.3 m) by 4 ft (1.2 m) rectangular frame. This will secure your kayak vertically against a wall.Buy extra PVC in case you need it.

, You will need to cut the PVC pipe using a saw and connect the frame by the joints. Saw two pieces that are 1 ft (.3 m) long and two pieces that are 4 ft (1.2 m) long. Attach them by gluing the pieces together in the joints using all-purpose PVC glue. It will form a large rectangle. Allow the joints to dry fully before affixing the frame to the wall., Place it 5 feet (1.52 m) from the ground on a wall in your storage area with the mounting clamps. Screw the clamps into the studs of the wall in a straight line. Screw in one clamp on each stud (with a standard distance of 16” between studs, this should require 3 clamps for a 4 ft frame), then clip each clamp on the same side of the rectangular frame. This will hold the frame securely in place, attached to the wall.Install it higher or lower depending on the size of your kayak.

, Place the bow through the rectangle from the bottom of the rack. Push up on the stern towards the wall so that the bow goes through the rectangular frame and the stern touches the ground. The cockpit should face out. The rack will hold it in place and allow it to lean against the wall.

, At least once a week, inspect the kayak to guarantee it hasn't slipped or sagged.

Find a river.,
Get a canoe (assuming you don't already own one).,
Plan your trip.,
Get a Map!,
Food is a must have.,
Water is important to stock up.,
Weather and Time of year.,
Fire equipment.,
Plastic Bags.",How to Plan a Canoe Trip," Consider your skill level, and do your homework. Do you feel up to tackling rough waters? Are there dams on the river you will need to 'port' (pick your canoe up out of the water and walk it to the other side of the dam)?;
, Lots of rivers that are navigable will have multiple canoe liveries that can not only rent you a canoe and the proper equipment, but also shuttle you to a convenient drop-off point and pick you up where you want to end your trip.

, A good livery will be able to give you a rough idea of how long it will take to travel down different portions of the river, what obstacles you might face during the trip (dams, rough water, etc), and who you will need to talk to for the proper permits.

, Even if the river is a straight shot from one end to the other, you will probably want to know where you are at some point. There are a few detailed maps published that you can purchase through Amazon.com for more common waterways, but the easiest (and cheapest) way to get a river map is to find it with a mapping tool like Google Earth. Just locate the river and print out the portion you plan on canoeing. It is a good idea to get a few good close-up images of important sections (campsites, forks in the waterway, entry and exit points, etc.) to help you identify landmarks. A GPS unit can be helpful to keep you on course, too.

, Plan your snacks and meals out and bring only as much food as will be consumed. Remember that you will probably have to pack out any opened cans or plastic garbage, and keep them to a minimum. It's best not to bring perishables (like eggs, meat, etc) on multi-day trips, but if you must then use a small cooler with a block of ice in the bottom and cubed ice up to the top, tied closed and to the canoe with bungee cords. Plan to use the most perishable items first.

, You will probably (or at least should) drink a great deal of water - much more than you normally do, since you are exercising and exposed to the elements throughout most of the trip. Bring a sports-style water bottle for each person, and a gallon of clean drinking water in a jug to get started. This probably won't be enough, however. To get potable water from a river, you can A) filter it with a pump-style water filter, B) clean it chemically with iodine tablets and neutralizer, or C) boil it.

, There is usually a distinct lack of shelter while paddling down a river. Check the local weather the day before you leave to get an idea of how to pack, but always expect at least one cold night, one hot day, and rain. Always bring a raincoat and some lightweight tarps in case of rain, sunblock and sunglasses for lots of sun, and a light jacket and pants for cool evenings.

, Pack all of your fire-making tools in a water-tight container, like a plastic jar or dry bag. Pick up a fire starting product that says it will light even when wet, since you might have trouble finding dry tinder lying around.

, All clothing, bedding, and food should be kept in plastic garbage bags (the clear ones are best). These won't help if you dump the canoe, but they will keep important things dry if it starts to rain or your canoe gets splashed. Pack an assortment of extra zip-locks and garbage bags to replace ones that have ripped open.

To do a back walkover, you have to stretch.,
There is also another wrist stretch that you should do put your palms up and lay them on the floor, then stretch your forearms towards the floor (when you feel a little soreness hold your position for 10 seconds) Then switch hands.,
Do split stretches.,
Do arm stretches.,
Stretch your legs fully.,
Do a backbend.",How to Do a Back Walkover Without Any Spotters1," If you don't, you might hurt yourself.



Do some wrist stretches by getting on your knees and turn your hands until your fingers are pointing at you and try to stretch your arms by trying to take your arms off without getting your hands off the ground.

Don't stretch to much or else you might hurt or here a crack in your wrists.;
, This will give you hand strength so your hands/ wrists won't turn off when you are flipping over in the back walkover.

, You should do split stretches because when you are doing a back walkover you are getting over and you are sort of doing a split.


Do the type of lunge where you kneel down and move forwards. Hold it for 30 seconds. Then switch legs.

, Bring your arm to your chest. Take your opposite arm and put it on your forearm and pull until it hurts a little bit. Hold it for 30 seconds. Switch arms.

, Lay flat on your back and lift your legs up. Put your hands on your thigh and bring it to your head.



Don't do it too hard. It might make something hurt.

, If you can't do one, there is a 99% chance that you won't be able to do a back walkover. First, learn how to do one if you can't do one. If you can, skip ahead to the next part. You also have to be able to do a backbend kick over.

If you are finished competing level 5 start working on all the level 6 skills, preparing for the next meet season.,
Practice uneven bars.,
Practice beam.,
Do the floor.",How to Compete Level Six in Gymnastics,"


Vault is a fairly easy event in level 6. If you competed level 5, you are very familiar with this vault. It is a handspring vault, punching off the springboard facing the vault and blocking off the horse, sticking on your feet. Although it is easy, it is an event that they take a lot of tenths off. To have a 9.0 on Vault, you must accelerate in you run at a very high speed to start the vault. If you don't accelerate, or run fast, you will not have enough power to block off the horse.
Practice at the gym or in your backyard, accelerating. If you are in your yard, pretend you are on vault. If you're at the gym, sprint past the vault table. Always remember to keep you arms to your side and swing back and forth, Practice swinging your arms like this. Next is punching off the board. Punch-backs are a perfect practice for this.
Just take two or three steps and, like a punch for a vault, punch forward and land on two feet and jump back.Do it while squeezing your bottom and tightening your thighs and abs. Always do a small arm circle(backwards) during your punch. After that is the flight.
Squeeze your bottom and every other muscle and block off your shoulders keeping your arms super-straight. Then its the after flight: all you have to do is squeeze everything super super hard and stick and salute to the judge.;
, A hard event. All your really need to do for a good routine is a straight-arm strait-leg kip, casting to 3/4 handstand, a clear-hip with your legs off the bars with straight- arms straight- legs and shootout 3/4 handstand.come out with a perfect push away kip, squeezing EVERYTHING.


Connect your squat-on, pike-on' or sole-circle, jumping to high bar with a hollow body into a long-hang kip cast 3/4 handstand, into a strait-legged long-hang pullover, connected to under swing(very big) tap swing, tap swing flyaway stick. Ask your parents to get a private with one of your couches. She will teach you about your routine?

, Schedule a private with your coach. The hard part about beam is the wobbles and falls. If you fall, don't get all worked up, but remember to stick always. Make sure you hold all your skills at the right time, and all your skills are exact. Have a graceful attitude like a Russian dancer.


Show your muscles though, and try not to shake. It makes you more wobbly. Focus on the end of the beam. Practice at home on a floor bean or tape on the floor, or even wood floorboards. They all make a perfect practice area.

, A favored event. You have to have excellent stamina for Floor. Do conditioning stuff(even if you do conditioning at your gym, you won't get strongest in your gym. Floor is fairly easy too compete. It shows your attitude and style. You have three major tumbling passes: front assault, front handspring step-out, front handspring rebound, and round-off back handspring backsault. Those are critical to stick. You have to have a good leap pass. Try taking a dance class. Always remember to SQUEEZE!!

",How to Paint a Fiberglass Canoe,";
, If your canoe is already in good shape, but just needs a sanding/painting job, skip this step.

, Apply fiberglass gelcoat, let it dry until the product recommends and then sand the gelcoat to obtain a smooth surface with a 60-80 grit sanding sponge or by hand with normal sanding sheet.

, If these aren't really deep, don't bother filling those, as the paint will cover it up beautifully.

, Do this gently, carefully and just enough to remove the old surface paint completely.

, Wash it up with the hose gently, and use the cheesecloth to wipe off all the dust on the canoe.

, Prepare a nice working space inside your garage or outside (far from trees or dust, and get this done before 11 am to let it dry all day before the night). Then, cover up your canoe border with the painting tape, be really precise.

, They say maximum 10% thinner, but 4-5% is highly recommended.

, You will obtain a fairly liquid type of paint because of the thinner. And, when you apply the paint, it will cause a lot of small bubbles. Don't panic, though! Just keep rolling on the bubbles until they vanish and continue on the next area of the canoe.

Keep the kayak on dry ground so you can learn how to properly enter it.,
Ask other paddlers to hold the kayak steady against the dock as you step into the cockpit.",How to Sea Kayak1," Although experts can enter while in the water, doing so as a novice will most likely cause the kayak to capsize.;
, Keep your weight on the dock and place both legs in the center of the cockpit. Swing your body into the kayak while keeping a firm hold of the dock. Slide your legs forward in the cockpit as you let go of the dock and stabilize the kayak. To exit a kayak, perform the previous steps in reverse.

Sit with a straight back and knees slightly bent.,
Grasp the paddle firmly, with your hands shoulder-width apart.,
Choose your paddle according to your needs.",How to Sea Kayak2," Most sea kayaks have “wells” or little pedals that the paddler can adjust to rest his feet on in order to maintain proper form. Adjust these foot wells, as well as the back rest, before putting the sea kayak in the water for optimal form and comfort.

, Dip one side of the paddle into the water, edge side down. Pull the paddle towards the stern of the kayak and up out of the water. As one side of the paddle comes out of the water, the other side should repeat the previous steps. Continue the paddling process as one fluid motion and do not move your hands along the paddle.

, Most paddles are offset to reduce wind resistance. With paddles that are not offset your trip range is reduced but you will not have to constantly twist the paddles.

"
"
Choose where you plan to kayak according to the type of kayak you have, your risk/reward level, and your waterman abilities.,
Develop a float plan.,
Carry a life jacket, signaling device, and a battery-powered running light that can go on the sea kayak’s bow.,
Pack enough water for the trip, usually 1 gallon (3.8 L) per person, but it's better to pack more than you think you need in case the trip is delayed.,
Keep a bilge pump or large sponge within reach.,
Consider carrying an anchor.,
Follow the weather report before going kayaking and know the depth of the water you will be in.",How to Sea Kayak3," For example, a sleek kayak designed for speed has no flotation foam and will sink if punctured by rocks or by a shark. The hard plastic scupper type kayaks, on the other hand, are very durable and can survive such impacts with greater dependability.

, Although a float plan will not prevent an accident, it will allow a friend or relative to know your route, destination, and estimated time of return just in case.

, Not only can these devices save your life but they will also make it easier for search parties to spot you in case you get lost.

, Also, pack high-protein snacks, such as trail mix or protein bars to fuel the high caloric demand.

, If a wave pushes water into the sea kayak’s cockpit, it’s nice to have a quick way to dry the cockpit. A paddling skirt is recommended as well, especially on rougher seas or in colder weather, to close off the cockpit from the elements and to keep your legs and lower body dry.

, You can fashion one from a bucket and a cord made of fabric, plastic, or rope, or you can simply buy one. The current or wind could sweep you 50 yards (45.7 m) away if you stop paddling for more than 5 minutes.

, The surface area of a kayak is huge, similar to a small sail.

Unload your canoe into the water (guides on this can be found elsewhere).,
Seat yourself in the canoe.,
Grip your paddle.,
Reach forward with the paddle on the side of the canoe corresponding to your lower hand until your bottom arm is fully extended.

,
Dip the paddle into the water until the blade is totally submerged.

,
Pull the paddle back until your lower hand is slightly behind your torso.

,
Rotate the paddle ninety degrees so that the face of the blade is parallel with the side of the canoe.

,
Push the blade out away from the canoe by using the edge of the canoe as a fulcrum and pulling the top of the paddle in the opposite direction.

,
Pull the blade of the paddle out of the water and return to step 4.

",How to Paddle a Canoe Alone Using the J Stroke,";
, When paddling a two person canoe alone you should sit in the bow seat (the one closer to the middle of the canoe) facing backwards (toward the stern). This position prevents the other end of the canoe from rising too far out of the water due to your weight. Steering a canoe with one end out of the water is extremely difficult, especially in windy conditions. Some people recommend kneeling in the exact middle of the canoe, but this actually makes steering much more difficult since most steering strokes will simply push the canoe sideways rather than turn it when sitting in this position.

, One hand should be gripping the top of the paddle, with the other hand gripping directly above the blade. Use whichever hand feels comfortable to you, preference for paddling on one side or the other actually seems to be independent of which hand is dominant.

, The games begin with Competition I events, where gymnasts compete to advance to the final rounds.If there's a tie for a spot in the C-II All-Around Finals, or if there's a tie in the finals themselves, break ties by comparing these scores from the tied athletes:

Add the top 3 highest final apparatus scores for women's gymnastics, or the top 5 for men. For example, if an athlete's worst score was the beam, discard it and add together her scores for the vault, floor, and bars.
If still tied, discard the lowest remaining score and compare again (now down to the top 2 scores for women, or top 4 for men). Continue discarding the lowest remaining score until the tie is broken.
If still tied, compare the sum of all E-scores (execution scores). Discard the lowest scores one by one if necessary as described above.
If still tied, repeat with the sum of all D-scores (difficulty scores).

, The C-I qualifier scores are also used to compare the results of entire teams, with the best teams advancing to the C-IV team finals. The same tiebreaker system used in C-II applies to these events as well, with the following changes:

For each apparatus, use the highest total score, E-score, or D-score from that team. Ignore teammates who had a lower score in that apparatus.
If you go through all tiebreakers and two teams are still tied, compare the total score from the best-scoring gymnast on each team.

, C-I competitors in vault perform two vault attempts, and the two scores are averaged into a final result. Gymnasts with the highest of these averages advance to the C-III vault finals. If there's a tie in qualifiers or finals, find out who won:

The highest score for an individual attempt wins (ignoring the lower score and the average).
If still tied, the highest E-score from either vault attempt wins.
If still tied, the highest D-score from either vault attempt wins.

, In battles for the floor, rings, or any other apparatus besides the vault, break ties as follows. This applies to C-I qualifiers as well as C-III finals:

Compare the highest E-Score.
If still tied, compare the highest D-Score.

"
"
Use the second score for the tiebreakers below.,
Break ties in competition levels 5 through 9.,
Resolve ties at higher levels.,
Handle an unbreakable tie.",How to Break a Tie in Gymnastics2," If the event involves two routines or passes from each gymnast, use the scores from the second routine when using the tiebreakers listed below.

, At these competition levels, go through each of these steps in order, until the tie is broken:


Add each gymnast's two highest execution scores together and compare the result.
If still tied, use the highest judge score for each gymnast, ignoring other judges.
If still tied (including if there is only one judge), the tie stands.

, At level 10, junior elite, or senior elite competitions, use this system instead:


Compare the highest total score.
If still tied, compare the highest execution score from a single judge.
If still tied, compare the highest difficult score.

, If two or more gymnasts are still tied, the tie stands and they both share a spot in the standings. Here's an example:


Two gymnasts tie for 2nd place.
The 1st place medal is awarded as usual.
The 2nd place medals are then presented to the tied gymnasts.
The next gymnast came in 4th, since there are three gymnasts ahead of her. No 3rd place medal is awarded for this event.

Before beginning to chalk up grips or use them at all, you must first designate which grip goes on each hand.,
Stretch the finger holes.,
Put on your grips and wristbands.,
Chalk up.,
Grab the bar.,
Swing!,
After each workout, store your grips in a way that will make them more broken in.",How to Break in Gymnastics Grips," Grips are made so they can be worn on either hand, but after you designate one grip as your left hand grip, it has to always be your left hand grip.


Mark with a Sharpie or pen the letter ""L"" or ""R"" on your left hand and right hand grip so you know which grip to put on each hand.;
, Your grips will have two finger holes if you are female, and three finger holes if you are male. If you have never worn grips before, you might find that the grips are uncomfortably tight in the fingers when you first wear them. This is normal, and will be fixed as you wear them more often, but there are ways to loosen the finger holes quickly, like sticking the hole on the bar adjustment knobs (if you are at the gym) and twisting. This will make the grips easier (and less painful!) to wear.

, Be sure that they fit snugly, but they aren't too tight.


If you feel like the grips are too big or are extremely small, you may have ordered the wrong size. If you believe you ordered the wrong size, you might be able to return them but they must be in factory condition!
Sometimes grips might feel too small at first, but this usually goes away as grips are broken in and the finger holes expand.

, Spray your grips with water and then use a block of chalk to make them chalky.

, Grabbing the bar with grips on is a bit different, because grips have dowels in them. Dowels help you to stay on the bar easier. When grabbing the bar, there should be a fold in the grips where your dowel will go over the bar.

, Tap swings are good for breaking in grips.


Your grips will feel uncomfortable at first, especially the first time you use them. This is a normal part of the process and should be expected for the first few days of wearing your new grips.
As you work with your grips more, add in other skills as you feel comfortable. This even includes ""basic"" skills, like back-hip circles, casts, and kips.

,


When you take your grips off, take one grip and face it like it would go on your hand.
Fold the top half of the grip down, so the dowel is hidden and the finger hole flaps face you.
Fold the grip in half again the other way so you now have a zig-zag or ""S"" shape.
Fold the grip down one more time towards you, so that the whole folded up palm part of the grip is inside the wrist area.
Buckle or velcro the grip closed, as if your wrist were inside the grip. Repeat to the other grip.
Store your grips like this after every workout, even after the grips are broken in. Storing grips like this will make the part of your grip where your palm goes more folded, so you can properly grip the bar with the dowel grip.

Go into bridge position.,
Put your weight on your knees.

,
Use your legs to pull yourself up while you rock on your toes.

,
If you can't pull yourself up try rocking back and forth a few more times for more power before pulling up.

,
If you can rock forth and back and get back up then with practice you should be able to just pull up.

,
Be confident and say to yourself,""I can do this, I know I can do this, I am positive, I can do this."",
Don't just expect it to happen.",How to Come up from a Back Bend,";

Learn about gymnastics.,
Find a gym.,
Become a Certified Gymnastics Instructor.,
Find out what level you are teaching, and the age group.,
Learn the kids' names.,
Find out what the kids' favorite events are.,
Introduce yourself.,
Find out which event(s) you are going to.,
If you are teaching a preschool class, read the following guides:


How to set up vault stations for preschool gymnastics

How to set up bar stations for preschool gymnastics

How to set up floor stations for preschool gymnastics

How to set up beam stations for preschool gymnastics.

,
If you teach an older class, you can run the event in this format: Warmup ---> Stations ---> Showoff (you have each kid show either a routine, or a series of skills).

,
Spot each kid on a skill of your/their choice.,
Have some time to goof off!,
Contact the parents regularly to update on progress.",How to Coach Gymnastics," The first step in becoming a gymnastics instructor is to learn about gymnastics. The same way you can't be a soccer/football (European) ref if you don't know the rules, you can't be a gymnastics coach if you don't know the rules and ropes of gymnastics. Learn about:


The apparatuses. Learn how to set the bars, how to set the vault, how to set a springboard, how to set a beam, and the rules about matting underneath.

How to spot. You may think there is only one way to spot, but spotting is different in almost every event.
The rules of competition. What's the white line of floor for? How far can you start back on the vault runway? Learn the complicated rules of gymnastics.
The way judges judge. Learn what the can take deductions off of, what they can't and what you can do to improve
How to do a handstand. The most important skill in gymnastics, you can't teach kids how to do a handstand if you can't! You don't need to know how to do all the skills you teach, but you should know how to do a handstand.;
, Find a gym to become a coach at. Look for these qualities in the gym:


Location. Is it close enough that you don't have to drive more than 15 minutes to get to? You may think you can drive 40 minutes every day, but just try it for a few days and see if it really works for you.
Equipment. Are the mats falling apart? Is there fuzz everywhere? Does the pit have clean, whole blocks? You also want to look at the apparatuses. Are they in a safe location, away from any kids who could go flying on to them?
Banners. Looks on the wall for any banners, such as ""First; Level 5; 2014 states"". This shows not only does the gym have talented gymnasts, it has talented coaches. Look not only for quality, nor quantity. Find a good middle ground between the two.
Children. Are the kids laughing and having fun? Or are they crying, grimacing, or flopping down? This is an important factor.

, You cannot legally become a gymnastics coach without becoming certified. This is a very important step..

, You can't have one without the other. If you know you teach level 4, but don't know you teach 6 year olds, you can't plan to drive them like 10 year olds!

, The kids will love you if you know all their names! Look at the attendance sheet; learning the names from the start, even if you don't know to whom the names belong just yet, can help you a lot with remembering the names to the faces.

, A fun way to do this is to have the kids stand up, while the other kids watch, and mime doing that event. This can be a great idea for younger kids, but it's not the best idea for older kids. You can also:


Ask their ages
Ask where they go to school
Ask about their siblings
Have them demonstrate a skill from floor, such as a roll, or split.

, If you know how, you can also do an ""amazing skill"" such as Round-off, back handspring (to impress them) though this may only work on kids who are at a low level.

, Check the schedule.

,,, This will give added thrill to the gymnastics lesson.

, Let the students fluff the pit sometimes, or offer a prize for the most leg lifts. Having them climb the rope then jump into the pit (if possible) is one of the most fun things to do.

, Did little Suzie fall off the beam today? Or did Betty rip her leotard? Did Brian have a great day? Is there a meet coming up? Anything that merits an email should be emailed.


Make sure you have all the parents' emails and keep the list up-to-date.

Purchase a strip canoe kit.,
Read the instructions.,
Build a saw back.,
Cut out the forms.,
Apply the forms to the sawback.,
Attach the ends.,
Cover the ends and forms with masking tape.",How to Make a Canoe1," Research a reputable canoe company and select the model of strip canoe you'd like to put together. Place your order and wait for the kit to arrive.


Your kit should contain the wood for your canoe, the layout and instructions, some hardware, and fiberglass cloth. You may require other tools to actually assemble your strip canoe.;
, This will ensure that you are completely prepared. Make sure you have all the necessary tools and equipment to put together your canoe.


This may take several hours, depending on the difficulty of the canoe you've chosen. Take your time to really read and visualize the instructions. If you don't understand a step or two, contact the company for assistance. This will save you time in the long run.

, This is what you will build your strip canoe on. Place a long thin table or platform on top of saw horses or blocks. The platform or piece of wood should be completely level.


Your sawback will probably be 12 to 15' long and will act as the skeleton around which you'll assemble your strip canoe., Hopefully, your kit contains molds or outlines for forms. Forms act as a support system to shape and hold strips that are stretched and attached to your sawback. Trace the forms onto particle board and use a saw to cut them out.


The forms will appear mushroom-shaped when stacked. The wider end will be placed on the bottom of your sawhorse or the bottom of your canoe.
Some kits may include pre-cut forms. In this case, simply spread them out in the correct order and begin to attach them to the sawback.

, You'll want to attach the forms to station blocks, small 1"" wide pieces of wood. Make sure the wider part of the form is connected to the station block. Then attach the station blocks flat on the sawback using drywall screws.


Attach your forms/station blocks about 12"" from each other and make sure they are evenly centered. This will keep your boat aligned.

, Depending on whether or not your kit includes them, you may have to cut 2 quarter-circle sections that will hold the shape at the end of your canoe.Again, use drywall screws to attach the ends to sawback. Make sure the ends are completely centered.


If you have to cut them, trace the outline onto plywood and use a saw to cut the sections out.

, You'll be attaching wood strips to the ends and you don't want them to accidentally adhere to the ends. Covering the ends and forms with masking tape prevents the strips from sticking and should make it easier to remove when you take the forms and ends out.


You need to cover the edges of the forms since glue from the wood strips could cause the strips to stick to your forms. The tape will make it easier to remove the forms.

"
"
Spread carpenter's glue on the edges of your wood strips.,
Strip the canoe.,
Continue working your way up the sides.,
Remove the staples.,
Plane excess material at the ends of your canoe.,
Sand the canoe.,
Remove the canoe from the forms.,
Seal your strip canoe.",How to Make a Canoe2," Strip canoes are edge-glued which is what will eventually allow them to hold shape. While you'll attach the strips to the forms and end of the boat using staples, the glue between the strips will create the shape.


You may want to wear gloves when applying glue and stripping the canoe.

, Start stapling the thin wooden strips directly to the ends and forms. Lay your first few strips across what will become the top of your canoe (this will be closest to the sawback). Alternate stapling strips on both sides. This will keep your boat even and centered.


Make sure the strips are placed snugly next to one another. This allows the glued edges to come into contact and seal with the other strip, maintaining the canoe's shape.

, Keep stapling and placing the edge-glued strips across both sides. You will be working your way up to what will become the bottom of your canoe.


If you need extra support while stapling the strips into place, use clamps.

, Once you've attached all your strips and allowed the glue to dry, carefully remove the staples from the ends and forms. Use a pair of pliers and pull straight out.Take care not to damage or dent the wood by twisting the staples as you pull them out.

, You may have an extra bit of wood sticking out at the ends. Use a block plane to trim off where the strips stick out.


If you notice any very rough strips of wood that stand out, use the plane to make it even and flush with the canoe.

, Use a coarse sandpaper and sand with the grain of the wood. Go over the entire canoe using long even strokes. Make sure not to spend too long in one spot or you may develop a weak area in the canoe.


Replace your sandpaper when you notice it starting to become dull. This will save you time and ensure that the canoe is evenly sanded., First, take out the drywall screws that are attached to the stations and sawback. You should be able to carefully pull the forms out of the canoe while turning the canoe out and off of the sawback.


The plastic tape will make removing the forms easier. You will also want assistance in holding the canoe and gently turning it over as you remove the forms.

, Many strip canoes use a combination of fiberglass, epoxy, and varnish to seal and reinforce the wood strips. Follow the individual package instructions regarding specific application, dry time, and safety precautions.


Wait for your epoxy or varnish to completely dry and seal before taking your canoe to the water.

Determine what kind of tree you want to use.,
Select your actual tree.,
Cut the tree into a log.,
Decide where you'll work.",How to Make a Canoe3," Research what kind of trees grow in local forests. Then, decide which kind you'd like to use for your canoe. Look for a sturdy stout tree that is straight and symmetrical.


Dugout canoes are often made from cedar, willow, spruce, pine, cottonwood, and redwood. Traditionally, they were made with whatever was growing close to a river source., Walk through a nearby forest and find a tree. Look for one that's large and tall enough to make into a canoe. Remember, you'll only be using the long trunk of the tree; you won't want to use branches.


You can cut down a tree, especially one that's already dead, or you can use a tree that's already fallen.

, If the tree is still standing, have someone help to first cut the tree down. Then, make two clean cuts at the ends of your log. Make sure no branches are growing out from any part of your log. Your log should be as long as you'd like your canoe to be.


Make sure you have permission to cut down a tree even if it's dead.
If you're unsure how long you'd like to make your canoe, cut a longer log. That way you can cut down and make a shorter canoe, if you choose.

, Given the enormous size of your log, you may want to work in the field or forest where you cut your log. This will save you from having to move it.


If you decide to move your log to an off-site work station, be sure to get help and use proper lifting equipment. Logs can weigh hundreds of pounds and cause serious injury if moved carelessly.

"
"
Strip the bark from your log.,
Draw an outline on your log.,
Create a flat bottom for your canoe.,
Roll the log over.,
Create a flat top for your canoe.,
Cut out the ends.,
Cut away the center.",How to Make a Canoe4," Use whatever tool feels most comfortable to you. A shovel might be your best bet for removing large sections of bark quickly. Or you can use an axe or an adz to chip away the bark which should easily break off.


Bark scraps make good kindling for fires. Keep them if you plan on camping or making fires.

, Using a pencil, draw along the sides just how your want your ends to taper. On the top of your log draw where the ends taper and mark where the center of the boat will be. The center outline will look a bit like an oval.


If you suspect it could rain and wash away your outline, consider lightly chiseling in your outline, using a small chisel and hammer.

, Make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log. You'll then use a chainsaw, adz, or axe to split out all the sections between the cuts., You'll want to have help and some rope to carefully roll the flat bottom onto the ground. You should now see a rounded part at the top.

, Again, make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log and then split out all the sections between the cuts. Don't go too deep, since you'll be cutting into the sides of your canoe., You can use either a chainsaw to crudely remove large chunks of wood, or you can use an axe or ads to chop away as much wood as you lik. Usually, the ends are tapered into points. This allows your canoe to move in either direction., Look to your outline and leave at least 5/8"" to 1"" on the sides. Be careful to stop at least 2"" to 3"" from the bottom of the log. This will prevent you from accidentally cutting holes into your canoe.


While it might seem like you're cutting out too much wood, you need to in order to reduce the weight of your canoe. Removing the bulk of the wood will help its buoyancy.

"
"
Shape the ends.,
Cut the sides of the canoe.,
Detail the center of the canoe.,
Sand your canoe smooth.,
Seal the canoe.",How to Make a Canoe5," You can use a smaller elbow adz for more control. Gradually cut and smooth the ends into your desired shape.

, At this point, your canoe probably still looks boxy. You can cut the top sides into a gentle swoop to reduce the weight of your canoe and give it an elegant look.

, Although you've removed the bulk of the wood from the center of your canoe, you still need to take a smaller knife, adz, or axe and clean up the edges. Try to make the center as uniform as possible.


Remember not to remove too much wood from the bottom or you might cut a hole.

, Use heavy grit sandpaper and rub your sandpaper over the entire surface of your canoe. Work the sandpaper with the grain of the wood. Be sure to blow away any sawdust before sealing your canoe.

, Use a spar varnish and apply multiple coats. Be sure to use a light sandpaper in between coats. This will help your varnish layers stick.


Follow specific package instructions on your varnish and be cautious when using.
Wait for your varnish to completely dry and seal before taking your canoe to the water.

,, Set them up so the cups are facing inward and are directly in line with the pole.

, At this point you may like to add fillers, such as low gates or a small wall. This will save you from needing to add extra poles when you go to make to jump higher. This jump is called an 'upright'.

Though rare, hazards like drowning are, tragically, no joke. Below are bare minimum equipment recommendations — contact your local outdoors authority (like, for instance, a park ranger's office) for specific information regarding the area you plan on canoeing in. Also see the ""Things You'll .


In addition, you'll want to be at least a reasonably competent swimmer, as capsizing (having the canoe flip over) can be a frequent problem for beginners.;
, Your very first time you climb into a canoe, you're likely to immediately notice that balancing is difficult and that every small movement seems to shift the boat more than expected. To counteract this rocky feeling, stay as low as possible — you can even sit or kneel in the bottom of the boat until you feel more stable. Most canoes' seats should provide fine balance as long as you aren't moving around or standing up. If you are paddling by yourself, sit in the back (stern) with your gear at the front (bow) so that you'll be able to steer the boat. If you don't have much gear, you may find it easier to balance by sitting in the center.


Try to sit up as straight as possible in your seat. Keeping your body perpendicular to the surface of the water (usually, this means straight up and down) gives you the stablest balance.Don't worry! The boat will be more stable when paddle/s are in the water, as the resistance from the moving water helps to keep the boat upright.

, Seated securely in the boat, grab a paddle with both hands.


Put one hand on top of the end of the handle (there should usually be a rounded portion here; if there isn't, grip the handle near the top.) This will be referred to as your boat-side hand.

Use your other hand to grab a lower point on the handle that's comfortable for you. Usually, this will be at least a foot or so above the flat part of the paddle — gripping right next to the flat part isn't advised as it forces you to work harder. Turn your hand so that your lower palm is facing toward the boat. This will be referred to as your water-side hand.


, It's time to begin your stroke! Start by twisting at the torso so that your water-side shoulder shifts forward. Move the paddle forward (out of the water), then plant it in the water so that the blade of the paddle (but not much of the handle) is submerged. Keep the shaft of the paddle as close to vertical as possible for greater strength.Don't forget your body position as you paddle. You want to reach as far ahead as you can without moving from your seat or leaning too far forward. This will put you off-balance.

, Turn the blade of the paddle so that it is perpendicular to the boat (and the direction of travel.) Use your arm and core muscles to pull the paddle through the water in a straight line parallel to the centerline of the boat.


Try to keep the paddle close to the boat as you make your stroke (some sources even recommend keeping the inside edge of the paddle touching the canoe). Having a wider stroke can inadvertently make the boat turn.Muscle discipline is important for efficient paddling. You want to be using mainly the core muscles of your body for power, not your back muscles, as using the latter can leave you sore and uncomfortable after your boating trip.

, Stop applying power to the paddle when the blade reaches your hip. Begin to bring the blade up and out of the water. Turn the paddle so the blade is parallel to the surface as you move it forward for the next stroke.


You are now back at your starting position! Simply repeat the steps above to continue paddling — the canoe should gather momentum and move forward at a good speed. However, if you paddle only on one side of the boat, you'll start going in circles. See below for information on cross-paddling.

, If you've ever seen someone paddle in a canoe, you've probably noticed that she will pull the paddle out of the water every few strokes and start paddling on the opposite side. This is to keep the canoe going in a straight line — paddle on only one side and you'll notice yourself start to turn to the side opposite your paddle. To cross, pull the paddle out of the water when it is at your hip. Lift it perpendicular to the boat and bring it across while switching the position of the top and bottom hands — this should feel natural. Insert it into the water and paddle as before.


Try practicing this a few times to get a feel for the ""rhythm"" of when to switch sides. For most, switching after every few strokes is best — the exact number will vary depending on your paddling form and how hard your strokes are.
If you're paddling tandem (i.e., with two people in the canoe), you'll want to coordinate the switch with your partner. See below for information on paddling with a partner.

, The simplest way to turn a canoe is probably the most intuitive — assuming you are sitting in the stern (rear) or center of the canoe, simply paddle as you normally would on one side to eventually start turning in the opposite direction. That is, to turn left, paddle on the right side, and to turn right, paddle on the left side. You should notice the course of the boat change slightly with each stroke.This method is great for gentle corrections in course because, while it doesn't turn the boat quickly, it doesn't slow you down either. For instance, if you see a sandbar jutting out of the water 100 meters ahead, it's probably appropriate to use this turning style to get around it — you're in no hurry.

, While canoeing, you'll eventually find that, while paddling on one side of the boat is an effective way of steering in many situations, there are plenty of times when quicker turns are required. One of the simplest ways to turn is called a J stroke. To use this technique, you'll ideally want to be sitting in the stern of the boat.To do a J stroke, put your paddle into the water behind you so that it is nearly flat against the side of the boat, which it should be almost touching. As you do this, twist your torso so that your shoulders point parallel with the sides of the boat. Use your core and torso muscles to turn back to a forward-facing position — this should make the paddle turn out to the side a little and the boat should turn to the same side as the paddle is on, just like if you were using a rudder.
Avoid over-using this stroke. While it will make you turn quickly, it will also slow down your forward momentum.

, The J stroke discussed above is actually just a smaller version of a special paddle technique called a ""back sweep."" By increasing the size of the back sweep, you'll increase the speed at which you turn. However, larger back sweeps will also make you slow down more, so you'll want to reserve them for situations when you need them or you'll have to paddle hard to build up speed again.


To do a back sweep, start out with your paddle behind you as you would for the J stroke. This time, as you straighten your torso, let the paddle swing out completely to the side — it should be perpendicular to the side of the boat when you finish the motion. You should immediately notice the boat turn to the same side as the paddle is on.


, Another technique for making sharp turns in your canoe is called the ""draw."" This technique is effective, but since its form is different from any of the other strokes', it can be more awkward to execute while moving unless you're an experienced paddler. Try testing it out at slow speeds before using it in a serious situation.


To do a draw, plant your paddle in the water directly out to your side. Your arms should be as straight as possible, the paddle should be as vertical as you can keep it, and your boat-side arm should be over your head. Pull the paddle toward the boat until it touches or is very near to it, keeping its blade parallel to the side of the canoe as you do so. Assuming you are sitting in the stern, the canoe should turn to the side opposite the paddle.Remove the paddle from the water by slicing it backward out of the water without changing the orientation of the blade. From here, you can transition easily into a standard forward stroke or a J stroke.

, Paddling in tandem (with a partner) is similar to paddling on your own, with some crucial differences. When two people are sitting in the same boat, it's important to keep the boat ""trim"" — that is, to make sure it sits balanced in the water. Thus, you'll want one person sitting at the bow (front) of the boat and the other at the stern (back). This should be the sitting arrangement that feels most natural and balanced.


If one person is significantly heavier than the other, you may want to consider putting more of your gear at this person's end of the canoe to evenly distribute the weight.
In traditional canoe terms, the person sitting at the bow is called the bowman and the person at the stern is called the sternman.


, When paddling as a team, you want to synchronize your strokes (start and finish them at the same time) to get maximum power. Since the bowman is facing forward and can't see the sternman, the bowman sets the pace. This means it is up to the stern man to match his strokes to the bowman's, not the other way around. Of course, both paddlers can (and should) talk to each other to figure out a comfortable pace — good communication is key for a quick, happy voyage.

, The person sitting in the stern of the boat will almost always have an easier time determining the direction of the boat than the person in front. Thus, the sternman is responsible for making sure the boat is going in the right direction. She should use her normal strokes as well as special techniques like J strokes and sweeps to keep the boat pointed forward. The bowman may assist in turns, but will not usually be able to take a leading role.The reason that the sternman has greater control over the boat's steering has to do with the force of resistance the water puts on the boat. Essentially, since the bow of the boat is responsible for ""cutting"" through the water, it is constantly feeling the resistance of the water that it pushes out of the way. The stern, on the other hand, doesn't have this problem, so it usually feels less of a ""push"" from the water around it, making it easier to turn.

, When traveling forward, having both people paddle on opposite sides of the canoe generally gives the straightest result. To make sure you don't accidentally start paddling on the same side of the boat and cause it to turn, make sure to switch sides at the same time. Generally, the sternman calls out ""switch!"" when it is time to do so.


Note that, since the sternman has greater control over the direction of the boat, the canoe will usually gradually turn away from the side the sternman is paddling on even if the bowman is paddling on the opposite side — this is why switching sides is important.

, With the addition of a second paddler, steering a canoe becomes slightly different. While all of the stern man's steering techniques described in the section above will work as normal, the bowman's efforts to steer can work differently because of his position at the front of the boat. If the bowman understands these differences, he can assist with the steering of the boat. Below is a summary of techniques the bowman can use to help steer:


Paddling forward works normally (the boat will turn away from the bowman's paddle.)
Draws work backwards (the boat will turn towards the bowman's paddle.)Instead of doing back sweeps, bowman usually use a technique called the front sweep to help steer. This is essentially the opposite of a back sweep — the bowman reaches forward with the paddle, then pulls it back and out to the side in a wide arc along the surface of the water. This works like a stronger version of the ordinary forward stroke, turning the boat away from the bowman's paddle.

Research.",How to Become an Elite Gymnast," You need to be flexible and strong to be a Level 3, 4, or 5 student. If you have never done gymnastics before, you better start now. If you don't know how to do a cartwheel, start in Beginners. You need to train as early as possible in order to have more flexibility at a young age.;
, You must know skills and stretches in order to be in a high level. The Elites or USAG is when you may be on a team and start competing. You need to keep track of your health because being on a team requires excellent nutrition. Most gymnasts are small, short, and are reasonably thin. That doesn't mean you should starve yourself. It means that they aren't necessarily overweight. They do have to be the right weight, and that means you cannot be underweight or else that may lead to further problems. They normally have thick, strong muscles and great abs. Do not overexercise. It may lead to soreness, weakness, and you will be in severe pain. But you must exercise at least five (5) times per week. Six (6) is optional, but you need some rest. You can take Saturday and/or Sunday off for rest.

, Some coaches are too easy on you and some are too hard. One coach pushed so hard on his Olympic gymnast that she became anorexic and bulimic and died at the age of 22. That is––for sure––not a good coach. A sign of a good coach means stability, precision, but still puts a little bit of pressure.

, In order to be elite, you must train a lot. Half of your day will be spent doing gymnastics. Half of the elites are homeschooled instead of public school, but some may make plans to do part-time public/private school.

, TOPS is a special USAG training program designed to help 7-11-year-olds prepare to become elite gymnasts. In TOPS you will spend a lot of time working on strength, flexibility, and advanced skills, and then attend a testing clinic. Your results will be compared to others across the country and those with top results will be invited to attend a training camp. TOPS training is not absolutely necessary, but is a great way to make sure you don't have any weaknesses that could stop you from becoming elite.

, These can be some of the most boring parts of training. It's always more fun to be competing and learning new skills, but these are also the most important parts of training. Don't cheat yourself! To do elite-level skills, you need to be very strong and very flexible.

, Fear is one thing that stops many gymnasts from ever becoming elite. The skills at the top level are scary but your coaches will know if you are ready to do them or not and will help you work toward them. It is safer to trust in your coaches than to try skills and pull out because of fear.

, The road to being elite will be very difficult one and there will be lots of times along the way where you will want to quit and go back to living a ""normal"" life. Just remember that quitters never win and winners never quit.

, Trampoline and tumbling causes less stress on muscles and joints, making it less demanding. Also, the top trampoline athletes tend to be older, around 30 rather than the 19 that artistic gymnasts tend to be. Alternatively, if you lack flexibility, or are larger, you can compete as a base in acrobatics.

, As you work up the gymnastics levels, you need to enter some competitions to get experience. Ask your coaches if they are entering teams to a competition or are hosting a meet.

, When you have free time, you should watch videos of Olympic gymnasts like Gabrielle Douglas and Aliya Mustafina. You can take notes of their artistry and technique which will help you in competition.

Devote your life to gymnastics.",How to Be a Gymnast," Being flexible is one of the most important qualities of a gymnast. If you want to be a gymnast, you can start working on your flexibility right now. Doing stretches and other exercises every day will make your body more limber, allowing you to perform gymnastics moves with grace and ease. Being flexible also improves your coordination. To improve your flexibility, do these exercises every day:


Do neck rotations and try to bring your ears as close as possible to your shoulders without raising them.
Next is the shoulder stretch, where you pull one arm at a time across your chest.
Stretch your chest by locking your fingers behind your back and extending your arms up.
Stretch your back with the seal stretch: get in a push up position, then push up keeping your hips on the ground.
Stretch your hamstrings and back by leaning forward to touch your toes.
Practice doing the splits until you can go into a full split with ease.
Starting from a sitting position, do a knee to chin press. Bring one knee toward your chin, hold it there, then repeat with the other knee.

Do bridges. Start lying down with your knees bent. Put your hands on the floor behind your head and lift your body into a bridge position.;
, It’s a fun gymnastics move that will help you get used to using your body in more flexible ways than you’re used to. You’ll also learn how it feels to be upside down. To start, crouch close to the ground with your hands firmly planted on the floor. Tuck in your head and roll forward onto your back, letting your legs follow naturally. Keep practicing until you can do a forward roll without thinking.


Make sure you keep your head tucked in, and don’t roll directly on your neck. You could injure your neck if you put all of your weight on it.
Try a more advanced version of the forward roll by starting from a standing position and smoothly rising to your feet without using your hands to support you at the end of the move.

, Find a soft or grassy spot to practice doing a cartwheel. This isn’t a dangerous move, but you might fall a few times before you get the hang of it. Start in a standing position with your right toe (or your left, if you’re left-handed) pointed in front of you and your hands above your head. Lean forward sideways, and place your right hand on the ground, following by your left hand. As your hands touch the ground, kick up your legs and use your arms to support their weight. Your left foot should touch down first, then your right. End the move standing upright.


The first few times you try to cartwheel, it will be hard to get your legs above your head. Keep practicing until you’re used to the feeling of being upside down. Eventually, you should be able to cartwheel without bending your knees.
To do a roundoff, try landing with both feet at the same time instead of one at a time. Keep your feet together and plant them on the ground.

, This is the foundation of many gymnastics moves, and it’s one you can perfect at home before you get lessons. Find a soft place to practice. Stand up straight with your hands over your head. Step forward with your right foot (or your left, if you’re left-handed) and tip forward to plant your hands on the ground. At the same time, kick up your legs above your head, keeping them straight and together. Hold the position for a moment before dropping your feet back to the ground and standing upright.


It might help to practice against the wall, or with the help of the spotter, while you’re learning this move.
Keep your chin tucked in and your shoulders against your ears.

, If you think you have an aptitude for gymnastics, and you’re ready to try more complicated moves, it’s time to take some lessons. A qualified gymnastics coach will teach you how to do advanced moves using the right form. You’ll learn how to strengthen your muscles so that you can execute moves with perfect grace. Also importantly, your coach will be able to show you how to train without risking your safety.


A coach can help you learn to do a roundoff, a front walkover, and a back walkover, moves that are a step up from what you can teach yourself at home.
In a gymnastics gym, you’ll get to learn how to use professional equipment like asymmetric or parallel bars, rings (for men), the balance beam, and a pommel horse, in addition to advanced floor moves like backflips, handsprings, front tucks, back tucks, and aerials.
To find gymnastics lessons near you, do an online search for “gymnastics gym” or “gymnastics club” and the name of your town. You’ll probably find a range of options, from free lessons offered at your local YMCA to more expensive private lessons. At clubs, your skill level will be evaluated and you’ll be instructed as to what class would fit you best.

, Gymnasts throw their bodies through the air headfirst like it’s no big deal. To be a good gymnast, you have to be willing to take physical risks for the sake of seeing what your body is capable of. It’s normal to feel butterflies before trying a new move on the high bar or doing a flip on the balance beam, but you’ll need to be able to push through the jitters if you want to excel. The more you practice, the less frightening it will be.


While gymnastics does involve risk, with the help of a coach you’ll learn how to minimize the dangers by using the correct form. Your instructor won’t have you try a move he or she doesn’t think you’re advanced enough to try.
You will fall many, many times as you train to become a gymnast. You’ll have to pick yourself up and keep going. The further the advance, the more tears and pain you’ll experience. However, if you’re a determined gymnast, the results will be worth everything it takes to get good.
Concentrating on the task at hand is a good way to overcome fear. If you’re thinking deeply about what your body needs to do, you won’t be as worried about messing up.

, Your body will be more able to move the way it needs to if you nourish it with healthy food. Athletes need plenty of calories to keep their muscles strong, but it’s important not to eat so much that your body feels heavy when you’re trying to perform. A healthy athlete’s diet includes the following:


Plenty of fruits, vegetables, nuts, and other plant-based foods that are as unprocessed as possible.
Lean meat, dairy, and other good sources of protein.
Whole grains and legumes to provide carbohydrates for energy.
Avoid sugary foods, sodas, processed foods, and anything that makes you feel less energetic.
Don’t forget to stay hydrated, too: drink six to eight glasses of water per day, especially before and after practicing.

, Being a gymnast is in some ways like being a dancer. A gymnastics performance involves style and grace, just like dancing does. Gymnasts and dancers both have a special mind-body connection that’s rare to see. It’s a special awareness of what their bodies can do, and an ability to move with pure confidence. Doing physical activities that feel exhilarating and fun can help strengthen your ability to make your body do amazing things. Consider giving one of these ideas a try:


Take dance lessons. Try hip hop, salsa, or beginner’s ballet. If you don’t want to take lessons, just go out dancing and lose yourself as you move your body to the music.
Try martial arts. Try capoeira, karate or ju jitsu.
Practice yoga. It’s a great way to get in tune with your body and improve your flexibility, too.

, The willingness to work hard day in and day out is a hallmark of every successful gymnast. Getting good at gymnastics moves takes so much practice that there’s really no way to avoid working hard. Even amateur gymnasts might train as often as four hours a day, four times a week, with light practice and stretching on days in between.


In addition to working hard, if you end up deciding you want to pursue professional gymnastics, you may have to make some sacrifices. You probably won’t have time for other extracurriculars, and your social time will be limited since you’ll have to stay in good shape for practice and competitions.

, Every move must be practiced over and over until you execute it perfectly. If you’re not a perfectionist, this repetition might get frustrating. However, it’s your coach’s job to help you reach perfection, since in a competition every movement you make will be judged. Having perfect form is also the best way to keep yourself from getting injured; a bent knee or waist could throw you off balance just enough to cause a bad fall from the balance beam.


Gymnasts have a reputation for being determined perfectionists, but this approach to life can backfire as well. Don’t take it so far that you damage your health or injure yourself just to get a move right. Know your limits, and take a break when you need to.

, As soon as you know you want to be a gymnast, start taking lessons right away so that your body learns flexibility from an early age. As you work with a coach and improve your skills, you’ll advance from beginner level to higher levels, and eventually you’ll be good enough to compete. It’s important to develop flexibility and muscle memory as soon as possible, since these qualities are harder to attain at an older age.


If you decide you want to be an elite gymnast, get your skill level assessed so you know exactly where you stand and how much work you’ll need to put in to advance to the next level.
If you’re on the older side, you can still become a good gymnast, but it may be more difficult to compete at very high levels. Many gymnasts reach their peak before age 18.

, While anyone can gain flexibility and find out what their body can do, professional gymnasts tend to have a certain body type that’s conducive to flying and flipping through the air. They’re usually on the shorter side and very slight, but strong. If you’re growing quite tall, or if your body tends to be stocky, being a professional gymnast might not be in the cards.


Work with a trainer to find out whether hard work will help your body get to where it needs to be to compete on an elite level. With the right kind of training, you might still be able to be a gymnast.
Don’t be hard on yourself if it turns out that your genes aren’t lining up with your desire to be a gymnast. It’s not worth starving yourself or trying to stunt your growth; don’t put your health at risk. Try pursuing an athletic endeavor that isn’t so dependent on being slight.

, A gymnast will not succeed without a brilliant coach helping him or her along the way. When you start getting serious, ask around and track down the best coach in your area as soon as possible. Work with your coach to improve your skills to the point where you can start entering professional competitions.


You probably won’t find who you’re looking for at your local YMCA or club gym. In fact, you might have to travel to a different city to work with the best coach available.
When your skill level is high enough, you can compete as part of a team. Each team will have certain requirements your coach will help you meet.
Watch videos of Olympic gymnasts like Gabrielle Douglas, Simone Biles, Aly Raisman, Laurie Hernandez, Nastia Luikin, and Aliya Mustafina to see their artistry and technique, which will help you in competition.

, At the elite level, your life will become gymnastics. Half of the day, almost every day, will be spent training. You’ll learn top-level skills that you simply couldn’t master any other way. If you want to compete with the very best, you’ll have to become a gymnastics expert, and that means making gymnastics the most important part of your daily routine.


Many elite gymnasts are homeschooled, giving them the flexibility to spend half their days training. There’s not much time for other extracurricular activities.
In order to work with the best coaches and teams, you might have to move to a new city, or even a new country, as many elites have done.
The reward for devoting your life to gymnastics will be seeing your body do amazing things — and maybe earning some medals, too.

",How to Become a Self Taught Gymnast," Once you find a video, watch it thoroughly. Do not start trying until you have watched the whole thing. If you can't find any videos on YouTube (or they aren't very helpful), search wikiHow for more help.;
, One of the most important attributes of a gymnast is flexibility. To become proficient in gymnastics, you must have at least one forward split down, but splits are not the only thing gymnasts need to be flexible in. Stretch your back, shoulders, pike, toes and wrists.

, A gymnast doesn't eat McDonalds everyday, nor do they eat fat-free everything. Eat a well balanced diet daily.

, You cannot learn gymnastics in a day. You must start small, and work your way up.

, You do not need a $60 leotard, but you do need some comfortable clothes, such as leggings and a t-shirt. Also attain mats. Though this is not mandatory, it will help you enormously if you have even a single mat. You may also(though this is more expensive) find gymnastics beams or junior kip bars. If you are unable to acquire mats, find an open gym near you.

, This can lead up to front and back tucks eventually.

, Arguably the most important skill in gymnastics, the handstand is the building block of nearly all gymnastics skills..

, One of the most basic moves in gymnastics, the cartwheel is almost as important as the handstand, because after a cartwheel comes the most important skill in tumbling: the roundoff

, This stretches your back and is the position for a backhandspring and back walkover.

, As mentioned above, this is one of the most important skills on floor for tumbling.

, This is a very flashy move that is easy to master if you stretch every day.

, A chin stand is a move that requires a very flexible back, but if you are flexible, you should be able to do it with practice.

, These are the skills working up to front and back handsprings.

, Doing a back handspring is every beginner's dream, but be very cautious. Master all previous steps before attempting and make sure you have a spot on your first time.

, The ultimate self-taught gymnast's achievement, learning to do a back tuck is a very exciting skill, and fun to show off. However, this is the most dangerous of the skills you can learn at home. Go outside, or into a huge open space. Get a spotter to help you. If you have a trampoline, try it first and master it there.

Try some gentle stretches, such as the side stretch. Stand with your feet together and lace your fingers together. Raise your arms over your head and focus on lengthening your torso as well as your arms and legs. Gently lean to one side, and hold for 10 seconds. Return to the starting position then repeat on the other side.Stretch your legs by standing an arm’s length away from a wall. Keep your arms straight and rest your hands on the wall, then bring one foot back, keeping it straight. Let your front knee bend and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. Return to the starting position then repeat with the opposite leg.;
, Sometimes people unknowingly hold their breath when stretching, but this is not a habit you want to create. Breathe deeply when you are stretching, and exhale on the more difficult movements. This will help you to concentrate, as well as get oxygen into your muscles., Aim to stretch your entire body each day rather than focusing on one particular area. Stretch your arms and upper body, your torso, back, and abdomen, as well as your lower body and legs., You may already be able to move certain muscles effectively, yet can do hardly anything in another area or on the opposite side. Practice where you need it and maintain the areas in which you are already flexible.

, There is no set limit of time or specific day to stretch. You can do it when you wake up, go to sleep, or simply during commercial breaks when you're watching television. Just be sure to stretch each day, or you risk losing flexibility., If you know a friend who is practically a master gymnast, ask for tips on how to stay motivated and get them to work with you daily until you achieve your goals.

, Gently tilt your head to one side then roll it down in a circular motion, sweeping from one side, toward your chest, and to the other side. Then roll your neck back so you are looking up at the ceiling or sky, and sweep it back to the starting position., Do this stretch standing up, and stick your arm out with your forearm pointing up at a 90 degree angle. Hold a broomstick in your hand so that it rests behind your elbow. Use your other hand to pull the bottom of the broomstick forward., It’s important to stretch your shoulders and upper chest as a gymnast. Sit on the floor and put your arms behind you with your fingers facing the rear. Straighten your arms as you slide your hands away from your body. Hold for 30 seconds, then slowly walk your hands forward., Put one arm behind your head and bend it at the elbow. Use your other arm to gently pull your elbow toward your head. Repeat on the other side., Stand straight up and keep your knees and legs straight. Bend over and touch your toes or the ground. Keep your back and neck straight, and bend at the waist. This stretches your back and legs as well., Stand a few feet away from the wall and place your hands on the wall behind your head by bending backward. Walk yourself down to the ground., Back bends stretch out your back muscles and help you become more flexible. Lay on your back and reach your arms over your head, placing your hands on the ground by your ears. Push your body up so that your weight is on both your hands and feet and your torso is in a bridge.For an added challenge, straighten your legs, rather than leaving them bent at the knee.
You can also walk your legs in and rock back and forth.
For advanced gymnasts, try to move your arms in toward your head and rest your weight on your forearms, rather than your hands.

, Lay on your back and bring your knees in toward your tummy. Hold your legs with your arms so that you are curled up in a ball. Rock back and forth to stretch your back muscles., Lay flat on your tummy then use your arms to hold your torso up. Tip your head back. This stretches your chest, abdominal, and back muscles. A snake or cobra stretch is another name for this pose.If that stretches your muscles too far, support your body with your elbows and forearms and work up to using your hands to support your weight.

, This stretches out your hip flexors and legs. Start with one knee bent, with your foot on the floor, and the other leg stretched out behind you on the floor. Raise your arms above your head.To stretch further, lean back so the leg that was bent is now straight out in front of you, and the other leg is bent at the knee and rests under your body. Lean forward and stretch your arms in front of you.
You can also bend your front leg, while keeping your back leg straight. Sit on the ground and reach forward to touch your toes.

, Start by sitting on the ground with your legs spread out in front of you. Open your legs as wide as you can but keep your knees and legs straight. Keep your back straight and lean over to one side to touch your toes. Repeat on the other side.You can also reach out in front of you with your arms and try to touch the ground.

, Sit on the ground and stretch your legs out in front of you. Point your toes and keep your legs together. Reach over with your arms and touch your toes.Then, flex your feet, reach over and grab your toes, and try to pull your heels off the ground.

, Sit on the ground and bend your knees to the sides so that the bottoms of your feet are touching. Gently press down on your knees to stretch your hips. You can also lean over and reach your arms out in front of you so that they touch the floor., Ask a friend to help you stretch your legs. Lay on your back and lift one leg in the air, bringing it toward your body but keeping the leg straight. Have a friend push your leg gently toward your body. When it starts to hurt, push back against your friend’s hands. Then, relax your muscles and your leg should stretch further. Repeat with the other leg."

Stand with your feet one hip width apart. Try to distribute your weight evenly over both feet.
Now, shift your weight so that you are balancing on your right foot only and lift your left foot just slightly off the floor.
Hold this position - balancing on one foot - for as long as you can while remaining steady. Aim to reach 30 seconds.
Lower your left leg and stand on both feet again. Now repeat the exercise, this time balancing on your left foot.
Repeat 3 or 4 times on each leg, and practice the exercise everyday until you can easily balance for 30 seconds on each leg.;
, This exercise is the natural progression from the weight shifting exercise. It is performed in the exact same way, except this time:


When you balance on your right foot, lift your left leg and bend it backwards at the knee. Try to hold for 30 seconds, before repeating on the other leg.
If you want to make this exercise more challenging, consider balancing on a pillow or thick rug - this provides more of an unstable surface and makes balancing more difficult.

, For this exercise, you will need a single dumbbell - the weight depends on your own personal preference, but somewhere between 5 and 15 pounds is good for starting off.


Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold the dumbbell in your left hand at waist level, with the palm facing upwards.
Shift your weight onto your left foot and lift your right foot off the ground, bending your leg forwards from the knee.
Perform a set of 5 - 15 bicep curls, depending on how long you can hold your balance for.
Repeat with the opposite arm and leg.

, This exercise is similar to the previous one and will also require the use of a dumbbell to perform.


Stand with your feet hip-width apart and your weight evenly distributed. Hold the dumbbell in your left hand.
Lift the dumbbell upwards toward the ceiling, until your forearm is perpendicular to the floor.
Now lift your right foot off the ground and bend your knee backwards. Try to hold this position for 30 seconds without losing your balance.
Repeat holding the dumbbell in your right hand and balancing on your left leg.

, This exercise tests your ability to walk in a straight line without wobbling or losing your balance. If practiced on a daily basis, it can help with your coordination and allow you to improve your balance.


Find a straight line on the ground. It could be the crack between the tiles in your kitchen, or a painted line in a children's playground. You could even make your own using a length of sticky tape.
Now try to walk along the line, one front in front of the other, without falling sideways. The first couple of times you can extend your arms out to the sides (like airplane wings) to help you balance.
Next try doing it it with your arms pinned to your sides. And once you've mastered that, try walking backwards. Finally, try walking along the line with your eyes closed - tricky, but not impossible! , Practice on a low beam, or even a line on the floor until you feel confident; falling from a great height can hurt badly.

, If you're on a high balance beam and feel like you're about to fall, just jump off, it's better to be safe then sorry when you're on a balance beam.

, Before you get up on a balance beam or tightrope, let your mind flow and concentrate on balancing by repeating ""balance"" in your head. Good concentration will lead to fewer falls.

, Always place a mat or something squishy under you, just in case you do fall.

, Pointing your toes is a wonderful way for you to not fall, because it stiffens your calf muscles as you walk on the beam.

Set up a date for your video test.",How to Become a Certified Gymnastics Instructor," You should have been a gymnast yourself for several years, 10 or more preferably and had exposure to all facets of gymnastics training, competition and more. Watch other coaches and take mental notes of what styles you like, who gets the best results from their training and what works and what doesn't work.;
, Start with young children teaching the basics. It will teach you how to deal with children in general and teach skills that to you are basic but to others may be difficult. Learn to simplify the process. Work as a coach for a few years. Ask other coaches who have more experience for advice and help when you have problems or questions about what to do.

, Look for a certifying company that works under the national standards. Fill out the application required and pay the certification processing fee. Wait for a box of study materials and books to be delivered. Once they are delivered, read all the books and start practicing the drills in the conditioning guides.

, Practice all the techniques and concepts in the study guides. Make sure you are familiar with all the lingo. Request a test date. A written test will be mailed to you. Complete it and mail it back.

, Someone will come to your gym and videotape your coaching sessions. They will be watching to see if you practice correct safety measures and have your students do appropriate conditioning drills. Wait for a response about whether or not you passed. If you did, then you will receive a plaque to hang to acknowledge your certification.

Wear loose, comfortable clothing.,
Find an open environment with a soft surface.,
Find a partner to oversee your cartwheel.,
Stretch out your wrists and hamstrings.",How to Do a Cartwheel1," Make sure you put on loose fitting, comfortable clothing that’ll allow you some flexibility when moving. You don’t want to split your jeans while doing a cartwheel!Gym clothes will work great.;
, Find a space that is free of furniture or other objects. It’s best to practice on a soft surface, such as carpet, a lawn, or a gymnastics mat.If outside, make sure the area you’ve chosen is level.

, A spotting partner is a good idea for those new to cartwheels. This way you’ll have someone to help guide your movements and be there to help you if you lose your balance.It’ll be easiest to learn a cartwheel at your gym under the supervision of a coach if you’re apprehensive about doing a cartwheel.

, Stretching your body before you begin will help you avoid injury while doing the cartwheel. You can stretch by bending your wrists back and forth gently. Stretch out your hamstrings by sitting in a straddle, with your legs spread wide, and bend your torso forward towards the ground."
"
Point your body in the direction you’d like to go.,
Lunge by placing your strongest leg in the direction you chose.,
Picture an imaginary line going straight out in front of you.,
Place your strongest hand on the ground and lift up your leg.,
Kick your other leg in the air as you place down your other hand.,
Straddle your legs in the air in a v-shape.,
Step down with your strongest leg and hand.,
Step down with your other leg and hand.,
Land in a lunge.",How to Do a Cartwheel2," Decide whether you want to go left or right and then turn your body in this direction.

If you’re not sure what direction is best, try one out. If it doesn’t feel right, try the other way next time.

, To get into a lunge, place your strongest leg in front of you in the direction you intend to cartwheel. Bend your strongest leg slightly and keep your back leg straight. Raise your arms straight above your head.Place your strongest foot in front, usually the one with which you would kick a ball. This will help you propel yourself., You’ll want to perform the cartwheel along a straight line, so imagining this line will help guide your hands and feet.

, Bend over and shift your weight onto the strongest leg. Then place your strongest hand, on the same side of your body as the strongest leg, on the ground along your imaginary line. Your back leg should rise into the air as your hand hits the ground.Your first hand placed on the ground should be the one that matches your strongest leg. For example, if you put your left leg forward in your lunge, your left hand should first land on the ground., Your other hand should come down to the ground at the same as time you kick up your leg that remains on the ground.


Your hands will now be side by side and spread about shoulder width apart.
You can think about this as if you’re going into a handstand., Once both hands are planted, you'll be balancing your weight on your arms, using your shoulders and core for support, and your legs will be in the air in a v-shape.Remember that you won't actually have to hold this position. This is the form your legs should take while in the air as you’re fluidly performing the cartwheel.

, To get out of the cartwheel, bring down your feet in a split leg method. Your strongest leg lands on the ground first at the same time as your strongest hand., Your back leg lands after the strongest leg. Your other hand lands at the same time as this leg., You’ll land as you begun, just facing in the other direction. Now your back leg will be forward and slightly bent with your strongest leg behind and straight."
"
Spread your legs shoulder length apart.,
Keep your arms straight out and level with your shoulders.,
Point your lead foot in the direction you’ll be going.,
Plant your lead hand on the ground with your opposite leg following.,
Plant your other hand and push off with your lead leg.,
Straddle your legs in the air while both hands are planted.,
Land on your lead hand and non-lead leg.,
Land in the same position you started in.",How to Do a Cartwheel3," Assume a standing straddle position with your legs spread shoulder length apart. Your hips and shoulders are in line with the direction in which you intend to cartwheel.Whether you’re performing the cartwheel towards your left or right depends on whatever you’re most comfortable with. Try out both ways, if you’re unsure.

, Stretch your arms out to your sides, keeping them level with your arms., Point your lead food toward the direction you’ll be going while turning the other foot slightly outward for better balance.

, Plant your lead hand on the ground and then your other leg should follow it up in the air.If your left hand was your lead, your right leg should lift up.

, Plant your other hand down in line with your lead hand and your remaining leg will follow in the air., Balance your weight on your arms, using your shoulders and core for support, like a handstand. Your legs in the air should assume a v-shape.Both hands should be in line with each other.
Stack your hips over your shoulders, keeping your body straight.

, To get yourself out of the cartwheel, you’ll land on your lead hand with your non-lead leg following.If your left hand was your lead, you’ll land on your left hand with your right leg following in a line.

, With the side-to-side cartwheel, you’ll land in the same position in which you started with your legs in straddle and your hands in the air."

The ball is usually made of either rubber or synthetic rubber. Its size is from a diameter of 18 cm (7.25 inches) to 20 cm (8 inches) and must weigh above 400g (0.9 lb). Like the other apparatus, it can be of any color.A ball routine will include bouncing, throwing or rolling. The ball is sometimes held in the arch of the back while a walkover is done. Gymnasts usually start with the ball as their first apparatus.
The rope is generally made of hemp or a similar material. The length varies depending on the height of the gymnast. One or two knots are tied on each end to aid in keeping a hold. The rope must be either all or partially colored. Leaps, skipping, swings, throws, circles, rotations, and figure eights are included in a rope routine.The hoop may be made of wood or plastic. The size of the hoop is from 51 cm (20 inches) to 90 cm (35.5 inches) in diameter, and must weigh at least 300g (0.66 lb). The hoop may be of a natural color or may be colored by one or several colors, and may have adhesive tape of any color. A hoop routine includes hoop rotation, rolling, swings, circles, throws, and passes of the body through and over the hoop.The clubs may be made of wood or synthetic material, similar to the hoop. The length of each club is from 40cm (15.75 inches) to 50 cm (19.66 inches). Two clubs are used. Each club must weigh above 150g (0.33 lb) and are typically weighted on each end. The shape is similar to a bottle. The neck and head may be covered with adhesive tape.The ribbon itself may be satin or another non-starched material. It may be any color. It must weigh at least 35g (1.25 oz). The width is 4cm (1.5 inch) to 6cm (2.4 inches) The length from one end to the other must be at least 6m (20 feet). The stick may be made of bamboo, wood, plastic or fiberglass.;
, The following elements are essential to understanding for scoring:


The victor is the participant who ends with the most points. Points are determined by a panel of judges, who judge the gymnasts' leaps, jumps, pirouettes, balances, apparatus handling and execution. Depending on the level, the routine must contain a number of these elements as well as flexibility movements. A high degree of athletic skills are needed for these movements.
The final score is based on a 30 point scale that requires three panels of judges. Each panel delivers scores for artistic expression, difficulty and execution.Dropping an apparatus is the equivalent of falling off an apparatus in artistic gymnastics.
If an apparatus breaks during the exercise or gets caught in the ceiling, the gymnast(s) will not be allowed to start over. The sport is governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG), or International Federation of Gymnastics (IFG), using the Code of Points. This organization regulates all competition.
The largest events are the Olympics, World Championships and European Championships.

, The following aspects detail the expected clothing and styling:Rhythmic gymnasts wear a variant of the artistic leotard. A rhythmic leotard has a short skirt as well as crystals and other decoration. It is also permitted to wear a unitard. The base color of a leotard may not be nude.
Rhythmic gymnasts wear half shoes to aid in turning or completely barefoot.
No jewelry is allowed.
Hairstyle must be neat.

, Rhythmic gymnastics has its origins to the early days of ballet. It began to take modern shape at the Swedish School of Rhythmic Gymnastics in the 1900s. When apparatus were incorporated in Germany in 1929, this became 'Modern Gymnastics."" The Soviets made the sport competitive. It has been called ""Modern Gymnastics,"" then ""Rhythmic Sportive Gymnastics,"" and now it is known as ""Rhythmic Gymnastics"". The FIG officially recognized it as a sport in 1961.Rhythmic gymnastics was originally judged on a 10.0 scale.

, Russia is the dominant force in rhythmic gymnastics.Bulgaria, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan and Spain are other dominant teams. Other Asian countries such as China also excel at rhythmic gymnastics. Many gymnasts train from very early ages.

, In the US, as rhythmic gymnastics is not as popular, it may be difficult to find a club. You can find a list of all the US clubs here. When looking for a club, make sure it has adequate room, high ceilings, stall bars, multiple coaches, is in good condition and is well lit.

, Generally, to practice, rhythmic gymnasts wear a black dance style leotard with black leggings or shorts with their hair tied back. Many gyms have dress codes, so make sure you adhere to them.

, When starting out, the gym will generally provide the apparatus, but it is beneficial to have toe shoes, as well as a gym bag to hold water bottles and the like.


Make sure to get a high quality bag. You will be using it a lot, and it will be worth it.
Explore different styles, such as a duffel bag or a backpack.

, Though men's rhythmic gymnastics is developing, only females can participate in FIG sanctioned events, and only female rhythmic gymnastics is considered a sport by the FIG. Many clubs do not offer men's rhythmic gymnastics.


Men compete in four events:

Stick (like a baton)
Rings (two small hoops)
Rope
Clubs



, Though it may look easy to toss apparatus, rhythmic gymnasts train from a very young age. It is very difficult to start rhythmic gymnastics late and still excel. The optimal ages for starting range from 4 to 8.

, A key aspect of rhythmic gymnastics is flexibility. Very early on you will begin to improve your flexibility, most likely even before you begin apparatus training. Practicing at home will also help. Many gyms have home requirements for days without practice. Aim to learn to do all the stretches below:



Splits (Right, Left and Middle)
Backbend
Chest Stand
Bridge
Triangle
Pike
Scorpion
Needle
Bow and Arrow

Pointe stretches.

, You thought just doing a split would be enough? Think again. You need to be very flexible for rhythmic gymnastics. Try the following to improve flexibility:


Get oversplits on all legs.
Grab your ankles with your hands in a bridge.
Try to straighten your legs in a chest stand.
Get a needle with and oversplit.
Point your toes to the ground with straight legs.

, Rhythmic gymnasts compete from 1:15 individually to 2:30 in a group. While that may sound like a short time, you are constantly moving quickly and endurance training will help. Here are some ideas to assist with endurance:



Run a mile.
Do a routine directly after a run.
Consult your coach.

, Rhythmic gymnastics requires incredible strength, though to the untrained eye it may no seem so.



Improve arm strength.

Improve core strength.

Improve leg strength.

Improve back strength.

, You should feel completely at home with your apparatus. Try to make it look natural that you are tossing apparatus into the air. The best rhythmic gymnasts make the apparatus look like an extension of their body.

, Needing to be as physically fit as possible, almost all serious competitors are put on strict diets. While there is nothing wrong with being a diet, its is important to make sure that there is still enough protein, calcium, carbohydrates, and yes, even fats in the diet. The diet of an athlete should be about cutting out unhealthy food, not food all together.



Eat fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables should always be included in a meal to provide the body with essential minerals and vitamins.







Eat foods high in calcium. Calcium is good for your bones and teeth as well as essential to the workings of your nervous system, muscle contractions, and blood vessel expansion. Foods high in calcium include dairy products, leafy green veggies and beans.







Eat enough carbs. Sure, carbs get a bad rap, but carbs provide the energy a gymnast needs to perform her best.







Eat enough protein. Protein helps strengthen and rebuild the muscles. Eating 3 to 4 ounce of lean meat after training is ideal for lean muscle building.







Eat enough fat. Consuming a small amount of fat can help improve endurance. Gymnast or not, everyone should avoid saturated fats. Non-saturated fats can be found in fish, nuts and olive oil.







, There is a lot of controversy over the fact that many rhythmic gymnasts do not maintain a healthy diet. Many gymnasts are too thin and don't practice healthy eating habits.Unlike artistic gymnastics, where the ideal build is short, muscular and compact, rhythmic gymnasts aim to be tall and lean. If a gymnast wants to win, not only do they have to perform technically perfect, but they have to look good doing it. This can lead to anorexia, bulimia and other eating disorders because the pressure to have the 'perfect' body is so high in rhythmic gymnastics.

, Only you know what your limit is. Rhythmic gymnastics, like artistic gymnastics, is very stressful the body and if care is not taken, serious injuries can occur. While you may desperately want to train and improve, ignoring pain can actually worsen your skill level.Ignoring injuries can result in more serious conditions that may lead to having to take more time out of the gym.

, A mastery is a ""technical element performed without the help of hands or with a roll on the body, which in addition uses a change of direction, level or a change of body in space, with or without loss of visual contact."" Simply put, it is an element in which the apparatus is manipulated while doing another skill such as a back walkover. Masteries can include a toss of the apparatus. Body coordination, balance, spacial awareness, and of course, skill with the apparatus can all help improve masteries. Examples of masteries are detailed below:


Rotating the hoop around the ankle while doing a back walkover.
Throwing the ball, then catching it with knees while sitting.
Placing the clubs on one foot, then doing a back illusion to pick them up.
Tossing both clubs with rotations, then catching the clubs with one hand.
Boomerang tosses with the ribbon (throw the ribbon stick out then pull back on the ribbon to bring it back)
Doing a full stag leap while jumping over the rope.

, A risk is a mastery with loss of visual contact with the apparatus. This just means that it has to be a blind catch or ending. A risk without a throw ""Always a rolling of the apparatus on the body during a body rotation around the horizontal axis, with loss of visual contact with the apparatus,""while a risk with a throw must have at least a total of two ""rotation of the body on the vertical or horizontal axis, with or without passing on the floor,"" during the toss and ""loss of visual contact with the apparatus during of an element with body rotation on the horizontal axis,"" during the catch. With risks come a higher difficulty than masteries. Examples of risks are detailed below:


Toss of the apparatus, forward roll(s)
Toss, Illusion forward and catch at the end of a roll forward on the floor without hands
Rolling the ball from the tip of the hands down the spine with a catch at the end
Boomerang roll of the hoop up the legs of a back walkover
Toss, three pas chaîné turns to catch

, Jumps and leaps are a crucial part of rhythmic gymnastics. The difference between a leap and a jump is while a jump starts and lands on two feet, a leap takes off of one foot and lands on the other. With this display of flexibility along with the look and feeling of weightlessness, rhythmic gymnasts spend much of their time on these elements. Some types of jumps and leaps to master are:



Split Leap, also known as a Grand Jete in ballet and a split jump (jump with a split at the height)
Sissone (a split jump landing like a leap)
Switch Split (the gymnast scissors her legs before ending in a split leap)
Stag Leap (the front, back, or both legs are bent) and stag jump
Wolf Leap (One leg is pulled up in a tuck position while the other is straight, landing on the leg which was tucked) and wolf jump
Side leap, also known as a straddle leap and straddle jump.

Leaps with twists (such as switch half or wolf full, which are leaps where a turn is added while in the air) or jumps with twists
Cat Leap
Ring leap (the gymnast kicks her back leg close to her head. Can be performed with or without a switch.) and ring jump (A.K.A phoenix)

Donut or sheep jump (the gymnast touches her head with both feet)

, Along with leaps, turns are something that rhythmic gymnasts focus on. Turns often include more than one rotation. Improving ankle strength to avoid sickling, and improving balance will help when learning turns and pirouettes. Some turns to aim to learn are:



Fouettés (often done en tournant or a la second)

Pirouettes (Usually in passé, with leg upright (in front or behind), with an arabesque or at attitude)

Double or Triple Pirouettes

Cossack turns (also known as squat or cat turn.)
Front scale turns (top half of body is held parallel to the ground)
Ring turn (a turn in a needle or scorpion position)
Penche turn (scale turn with a full or oversplit)
Front and back illusions.

, A balance is ""a fixed and well-defined shape.. performed on the toes or on one knee,"" meaning that they simply must be a pose en relevé. Most of the dazzling flexibility the rhythmic gymnasts display is through balances. All balances must:


 Be performed on the toes or on one knee;Be maintained long enough in order to be clearly visible Have a fixed and well-defined shape, without moving the free leg or the support leg during the difficulty; Be connected with a Mastery element of the apparatus"

Keep your right foot pointing straight ahead.Place your left arm behind you, with your palm flat on the ground. Try to get your arm directly behind you.Stretch your right arm in front of you, just over your knee, with your palm facing up.;
, From the seated position, shift your weight onto your left arm and lift your hips off the ground. As you lift off the ground, extend your right arm towards the ceiling.Use your right leg to help you push off the ground and kick your left leg up and over your body. Keep your left leg straight as you move it off the ground, and think about moving it directly over your body.Don't let your left leg or right arm sway to the sides. Keep them straight as you move into the bend., Keep moving your right arm back and over your body until you feel it touch the ground behind you. Both of your hands should be flat on the ground behind you, and your left leg should be pointing straight up.You will need to rotate your left arm 180 degrees to form a stable base for your bridge. You want both of your hands pointing in the same direction., With both hands on the ground, keep moving your left leg over your body, and kick your right leg off the ground. You should be doing a handstand at this point, and your legs should be in a 180-degree split.Hold the split position for a second before moving your right leg to the ground behind you., As your right foot hits the ground, keep moving your left leg through the air. Keep your leg as straight as possible and lower it the ground. As your left foot reaches the ground, your arms should be pointing straight up into the air.Shift your weight to your back leg and point your toes forward. Your toes should be bent to grip the mat., The bridge, also known as the press, is an advanced back stretch, but also a key component of the valdez. Start by laying on your back with your legs bent at a 90-degree angle. Keep your feet planted on the ground.Place your hands by your ears, palm down. Make sure your fingers are pointing towards your feet, and your elbows are pointing towards the ceiling.Lift your back off the ground by pushing up with your hands and feet.

Keep your arms straight, with your palms facing the ceiling, and your fingers pointing behind you.Arch your back backward and slowly move your arms closer to the floor. Look for the ground behind you.Use your arms to feel for the ground so that you don't hit your head when you land. When you feel the ground, firmly plant your hands to complete the backbend.If you are having trouble performing a standing backbend, use a wall to help you. Stand facing away from the wall. As you start your backbend place your hands on the wall and walk yourself down to the ground., To do a backbend kick-over, start by doing a standing backbend. Once you've completed your standing backbend, kick your legs over your head until you land back on your feet.Make sure you have enough momentum to get your legs over your body, and onto the ground behind you. If you are having trouble kicking your legs over, try performing a bridge in front of a wall. Keep your feet next to the wall, and walk your feet up the wall before you push off.You may find that you can't quite kick your legs over your body the first few times that you attempt a kick-over. If you try to kick, but keep landing in the bridge position, that's okay. Kick-overs are difficult, and it will take a lot of practice to complete one., A back walkover is a combination of a backbend and kick-over. Standing straight, extend one leg directly in front of you. Keep your other leg planted firmly on the ground.Keep your arms close to your ears with your hands in the air. Keep your arms straight and tight.Move into a standing backbend and let your extended leg move with your body.

Your standing leg should follow until both feet are on the ground. Finish in a lunge position with your front foot pointing forward, and your back foot slightly turned out., Stretching your back will help you build the flexibility needed to perform the valdez. Common gymnastics back stretches are the cobra pose from yoga, and the see-saw.To do the cobra, lay on your stomach and place your hands on the ground in front of your head. Keep your hands about shoulder width apart. Use your hands to press your upper body off the floor. Don't let your hips or legs lift off the ground, and remember to keep your arms straight. Hold the stretch for several seconds, and then release.To do the see-saw, lay on your stomach and stretch your arms back towards your feet. Bend your legs up and try to grab your ankles. When you can grab your ankles with your hands, lift both your upper and lower body off the ground. Your core should be the only thing touching the ground. Gently rock back and forth for several seconds, and then release the stretch., Perform a quick hamstring stretch by sitting upright and extending your legs out in front of you. Keep your back straight and reach your hands over your feet. Hold this for up to a minute and then release. Repeat this stretch four times.You can also stretch your hamstrings by doing a hamstring kneeling stretch. Get on your knees and place both hands on the ground in front of you. Extend one leg in front of you, placing it between your arms. Keep your other knee on the ground, bent at a 90-degree angle. Pull your toes back towards your body. Move your body forward until you feel the stretch in the back of your leg. Hold the stretch for up to a minute before releasing.Lie down on your back and extend one leg in the air.

When you are Kayaking push really hard with your paddle so you go faster.",How to Hold and Use Kayak Paddle," Unlike a canoe paddle, a kayak paddle has 2 blades attached to the shaft of the paddle. The shaft is the part of the paddle that you hold and the blades are the part that you use to pull yourself and the kayak through the water.;
,, It's a common mistake for beginners to hold their paddles backwards the first time they start kayaking. As a beginner, it may not seem to make a difference which way your paddle is facing, but it does have a big change on your power of stroking. Have the part of the paddle blade that is concave or smooth facing you, the face of the paddle is the part you want to pull through the water.

, Many kayak paddles are asymmetrical meaning there is a top and a bottom to the paddle blade. It is important that you hold the paddle as it is designed, The top of the paddle is more horizontal than the bottom and the bottom has more of a tapered effect. Sometimes there is even horizontal writing on the paddle, keep the writing upright and not upside down and this will help you remember to hold your paddle correctly.

,,, If you are right handed, your control grip will be with your right hand and if you are left handed your control grip will be with your left hand. When taking a kayaking stroke, allow the paddle to rotate and reposition in your ""loose hand"" to make sure that each paddle always enters the water smoothly. The control grip does not change positions once it is on the paddle.

, Make sure it goes deep.

, It's foolish to think that you'll be able to just hop on the river and go down. You need to begin with pool sessions that will familiarize you with your boat, learning to ""wet exit"" and the basic paddle strokes.

, Talk to your local boating shop about what kayak is appropriate for your skill level. Think about the type of paddling you'd like to do. Do you simply want to run class II-III whitewater or would you like to learn to pull cartwheels, endos and blunts in a hole with the big dogs? Don't forget about your PFD, helmet and paddle.

, Paddling in a group is best for safety on the river and for shuttle vehicles at put-in and take-out locations.

, Each section of river is rated on the International Scale of River Difficulty. Beginning kayakers are trained on easy Class I and Class II river sections. Then you can gradually move up to river sections with higher classes of whitewater as your paddling skills improve.

, River flows can vary dramatically based on weather and dam releases. River guidebooks should describe the minimum flows needed for boating and how higher flows affect whitewater difficulty on each section of river.

As you go throughout the process of learning your Eskimo roll technique, make sure that you maintain a firm grip on your paddle.;
, You want to lead your paddle into the water on the right, or starboard, side of your boat.


After you form this arch, you want to follow through with your paddle in the water all the way back to the stern, along the starboard side of your boat.
A higher arch with the paddle will give you more power in your Eskimo roll.
However, form takes practice. You’ll want to have maximum power without compromising your ability to pull the paddle against the resistance of the water. This is a personal balance, and it will depend on your upper body strength.

,


Make sure that you have a friend or instructor near by to watch and provide feedback on your technique. You don’t want to form any bad technical habits.
A large part of the success of an Eskimo roll lies in the fluidity of your motions. You want to be able to go through the motions of s roll without stopping to think about each position or step.
Practice for a few hours over the course of a few days before you attempt to roll under water.

, The first time you do this, you’re going to exit the kayak rather than roll. To make yourself comfortable, ease into flipping over completely.


Have your friend bring the bow of their boat next to your cockpit, perpendicular to your boat.
Reach out one hand to rest on their bow.
Slowly lean toward your friend, and tip your boat into the water about 45 degrees. Then, return to an upright position by pushing down on their bow.
Repeat this a few times. Each time, slightly increase how far you lean into the water.
Do this until you can lean far enough to flip yourself over completely.

, This will give you a safety net as you begin to practice your rolls. You’ll know you are never trapped underwater, as you can always perform a boat exit.


Practice with the spray skirt on your kayak. You will need a spray skirt when you roll.
Make sure that your spray skirt’s handle is within your reach, and that you are in a snug seated position in your kayak.
After you capsize your kayak, take a second or two to orient your self, and remain as calm as possible.
Grab your spray skirt by the handle, and pull it off.
Place the paddle between your hands, firmly grip the edge of the cockpit, and push yourself out to either side of your kayak. Keep your head as close to the surface as you can.

,


Each time you perform your exit, try to stay under water for a little longer.
You want to have as much control over your breath as you can.

, Because you are new to Eskimo rolls, you may not be able to flip yourself back over completely on your first few tries.Remember, if you need help at any point, bang your hands against the side of your boat, or stick your hand up out of the water.
Make sure your friend is on high alert.

, Once you capsize, your arm technique and paddle arch motion will be exactly the same as it was when you practiced on the surface of the water. It will simply be inverted.


If you can’t pull yourself up on the first try, you complete the motion twice to practice under water, depending on how long you can hold your breath.
Don’t be alarmed if you surface for a second and are pulled back underwater. You will need to exert a large amount of force to right yourself complete, and this takes trial and error.

, The only way to learn to do an Eskimo is to continue to practice. Don’t become discouraged and quit if you can’t get it right away. Eventually, the action will become natural and fluid.


Experiment with different amounts of force and the height of your paddle.
Don’t try to roll in a setting such as the ocean or a river until you are extremely comfortable with the action and have completed it many times.

,


White water or ocean water can be too rough and unpredictable for those learning to do an Eskimo roll for the first time.
If you are in a lake, avoid areas with submerged limbs or shallow areas with large rocks. You don’t want to hit your head as you roll.

, When you are learning new techniques, it’s best to kayak in places that you’ve been before. If you choose to kayak on a lake, try to pick a place where you know the landscape and are comfortable.


You want to choose a familiar space so you are aware of all possible variables and dangers as you begin your Eskimo roll.

, Anytime you’re out on the water, you want to make sure you have a friend there for safety, especially when you are learning new techniques.


If you can, recruit someone to help you who has kayaking experience and knows how to roll. They can watch your technique and give you personalized tips on improving as you begin.

,


In addition to air temperature, check the water temperature, as the water is often much colder than the air.
If you have access to one, wear a wetsuit.,


Practice holding your breath in increments, increasing the length of time you hold it.
Do upper body exercises like push-ups and pull-ups to increase your arm power.
For overall kayaking improvement, do core exercises like planking and crunches for better body control.

Look for a good area to get into your kayak.,
Place the kayak in the water.,
Approach the kayak.,
Make sure to secure the kayak before you get in.,
Start getting into your kayak.,
Go ahead and sit on the kayak.,
Bring your other leg into the kayak.,
Slide down into the kayak.",How to Kayak1," You will need to find a good spot where to enter the water. Find an area where the water is calm and where there are no rocks and is in shallow water.;
, Slide your kayak into the water with the bow(The front) first, place your hand firmly on the stern (The back) grab loop and position the kayak so that the cockpit area is in shallow enough water to stand in.

, Have your paddle in one hand and walk along the side of the kayak up to the cockpit.

, Start by placing your paddle perpendicular to the boat just behind the seat in the kayak and up against the cockpit rim. Put your closest hand across the kayak and on the paddle with your closest hand on the paddle and your fingers holding onto the cockpit rim., then steady the kayak.

, Place your leg into the kayak and into position, shift your weight and butt over the kayak while keeping your other foot on the ground.

, At this point you should still have your hand holding onto the paddle. Grab onto the paddle with your other hand to steady yourself and put your butt back of the kayak and sit down on the back of the cockpit.

, Use the paddle to steady yourself with your hands gripping them on either sides of your body, lean back on your butt, and keep your foot on the floor of the kayak. Bring your other leg into the kayak.

, Make sure your balance is good and you have both of your feet firmly planted on the floor of your kayak and your hands gripping the paddle, now slide into your kayak.

Know the structure of the kayak paddle.,
Have your paddle face the right direction.,
Have your paddle right-side up.,
Know your control grip.,
Grasp your paddle and hold it.",How to Kayak2," Unlike a canoe paddle, a kayak paddle has 2 blades attached to the shaft of the paddle. The shaft is the part of the paddle that you hold and the blades are the part that you use to pull yourself and the kayak through the water.

, It's a common mistake for beginners to hold their paddles backwards the first time they start kayaking. As a beginner, it may not seem to make a difference which way your paddle is facing, but it does have a big change on your power of stroking. Have the part of the paddle blade that is concave or smooth facing you, the face of the paddle is the part you want to pull through the water.

, Many kayak paddles are asymmetrical meaning there is a top and a bottom to the paddle blade. It is important that you hold the paddle as it is designed, The top of the paddle is more horizontal than the bottom and the bottom has more of a tapered effect. Sometimes there is even horizontal writing on the paddle, keep the writing upright and not upside down and this will help you remember to hold your paddle correctly.

, If you are right handed, your control grip will be with your right hand and if you are left handed your control grip will be with your left hand. When taking a kayaking stroke, allow the paddle to rotate and reposition in your ""loose hand"" to make sure that each paddle always enters the water smoothly. The control grip does not change positions once it is on the paddle.

, Grab your paddle and make sure to place the control grip on the paddle first. Have your hands are centered on the paddle and the distance between your hands should be just a little over shoulder width apart.

Hold your paddle properly.

,
Make sure to have proper posture in the kayak.,
Rotate your body.,
Take the stroke.,
Setup for the next stroke and rotate your grip.,
Take the next stroke.",How to Kayak3,", Sit upright with your legs securely in the thigh braces and the balls of your feet against the foot supports.

, Rotate your body while extending and retracting your arms. For example; If you want to take a stroke on the right side, rotate your torso counter-clockwise while extending your right arm and retracting your left arm.

, Place the right side of your paddle blade in the water near the feet and rotate the torso as you're pulling the blade through the water alongside of the boat, retract your right arm while at the same time extending your left arm.

, As soon as you've finished the stroke on the right side of the kayak, your paddle should be setup for the next stroke on the left side of the boat. Next to rotate your grip, you need to bend your wrist on the control grip hand. Allow the paddle to rotate in your other hand(The loose hand) until the paddle blade is lined up to enter the water at the proper angle and grasp the paddle with your ""loose hand.""

, Once you've rotated your grip, place the left paddle blade in the water near the feet and rotate the torso while pulling the blade through the water along the left side of the boat while retracting your left arm and extending your right arm.

Secure the kayak with a tie line.,
Use the paddle to steady the kayak.,
Crouch.,
You are now out of your kayak!",How to Kayak4," This isn't a mandatory step, but if you are getting off on a dock, it's extremely recommended.

, Since the kayak is in water, one off balance moment can send you swimming.

, This gets you ready to follow the next steps.


If you are going to get out onto a dock

Swing your bottom out of the kayak onto the deck.
Swing out your legs, onto the deck.


If you are getting out on shore (shallow water, not on a dock, but ground.)

Put one leg on shore.
Stand up, putting most of your weight on the foot that is on shore.
Put the other leg on shore.



, (Hopefully without getting too wet!)
