Recreational kayaks are non-specialized kayaks used for fun. These tend to be the cheapest kayaks.

Touring kayaks are used for longer trips, perhaps even overnight. This craft is sturdier than its recreational counterpart and has more cargo room.

Fishing kayaks have wide beams to offer better stability while you're wrangling your fish into your net. Some even come with rigging to improve stability.

Whitewater kayaks are designed to stand up to and easily negotiate the rough conditions created by rapids and rivers that have a fast current.

Racing kayaks are designed to go fast and are typically used for racing.;
, The material your kayak is made of will influence things like durability, weight, and ease of transport. You've already decided on the kind of kayaking you want to do, so you should think about the construction of those terms. There are three general types of kayaks: rigid, folding, and inflatable.



Rigid kayaks are the most common type of kayak. They are made of plastic (heaviest and cheapest), fiberglass (medium weight and price), or composite materials (lightest and most expensive). Wooden kayaks are also available.

Folding kayaks are easier to carry and store. They are usually more expensive than rigid kayaks, but maintain value and last longer.

Inflatable kayaks are the lightest and easiest to store of the 3 types of kayaks and are typically inexpensive. With routine maintenance, they can last a long time.

, Stability, in kayaking terms, is the ease with which your kayak stays upright in water. It is further broken down into two categories, primary and secondary stability. A short description of differences follow:



Primary stability is how stable your boat is when sitting flat on the water, with the correct side of the boat facing up. The flatter your hull, the better your primary stability.

Secondary stability is your boat's ability to balance when turned on its side. Secondary stability acts as a buffer when your balance exceeds the primary stability., The shape of your hull will effect the stability and maneuverability of your craft. Also, by learning the different varieties of hull available to you, you will be better equipped if you go to a store and talk with a salesperson about the kayaks available. Some common hull shapes are:



Displacement hulls imitate the traditional bottom of a boat, giving the profile of this hull a continuous curve along the profile and cross-section. The streamlined shape gives these boats efficient maneuverability.

Planing hulls will have angled sides that meet a flat bottom. The flat bottom of this boat will allow you to skim the surface of the water when you reach higher speeds.

Chine hulls come in two different shapes and two varieties. The shape can be either boxy or rounded, and the variety can be soft or hard. The name ""chine"" refers to the area where the boat bottom and sides meet.

Rocker hulls define a continuous curve to the hull of the boat stretching from bow to stern. Rocker hulls come in two styles: kick and continuous. These hulls are intended for trick moves and high maneuverability and will likely be unsuitable for a novice., Though not all boats will have these, some will come with adjustable pegs that you can push against with your feet, in addition to providing a foot rest. Other boats might have padded plates that you may or may not be able to adjust, or cut and shape foam blocks called ""bulkheads.""Foot pegs are usually more easily adjustable than other foot rests. This should be kept in mind while purchasing.

, Due to the fact that many modern boats sacrifice space and room for lighter weight and better maneuverability, peg-assemblies are sometimes difficult to find. Bulkheads are cut-to-shape foam that will provide a surface to rest and support your entire foot.


The stability offered by bulkheads can minimize ankle fractures cause from turbulent waters and rough impact., Though the name might be less than appealing, the big appeal of thigh-hooks is an increased ability to transfer body movement to your kayak. Since your lower body controls the tilt of the craft, lifting or dipping the edges of your kayak will offer greater control., You may be inclined to think of volume in terms of water, but where kayaks are concerned, volume refers to the inner capacity of the kayak, often measured in gallons.


High-volume craft will in many cases have a ballooned ends so the kayak resurfaces more quickly, which is exactly why this style of boat is ideal for beginners.
Low-volume kayaks are thinner and in many cases will have a ""scooped"" bow, which translates to a profile that cuts through water more efficiently at the cost of stability and cargo room., Kayak pricing varies greatly depending on model and the material in making the craft. An entry-level plastic kayak can cost as little as $250, while a top-of-the-line, folding, 2-person kayak can cost more than $4,000., Kayak requirements differ according to purpose. Flat or open water trips and whitewater trips utilize different kayak designs to effect the best in-water transportation.


For short, occasional trips, a cheap kayak is a good choice, but for frequent or longer trips, especially in treacherous water, you will want a higher-end model.
For the purposes of fishing and other traveling across smooth water, a larger kayak will allow you more room to stretch.A tighter fit, however, is recommended in a whitewater kayak., Before any other considerations, you should take into account how many people you will need to accommodate. Some sea kayaks can carry as many as three people. And while tandem kayaking can be a romantic activity for you and your partner, two solo kayaks will offer more autonomy and opportunity for exploration.


When inspecting 2-person kayaks, you should keep in mind that the extra length of these craft will make maneuvering more difficult.
Tandem kayaks usually weigh anywhere between 70 and 100 lbs. If you have to make a crossing with your kayak, or carry it between launch points, a lighter model might be best.
Long kayaking trips will require more room for cargo. Be sure the kayak you purchase has enough storage space to suit the duration of your trip., Some stores will allow you to check the fit of your kayak before you purchase, and kayak sellers on a waterfront might even allow you to take out a boat. You may even want to ask a friend if you can borrow a kayak and take it for a short test run.While doing so, you should consider:


The stability of the craft. Do you think you will need more or less stability? Do you feel comfortable with how your test kayak balances?
The maneuverability of the craft. If you feel that your kayak doesn't maneuver naturally or intuitively, you may want to consider a different style.
The shape of your kayak. Do you find that the shape facilitates your handling of your boat, or do you think a different configuration might be better?
Ask yourself, ""Am I going to be comfortable in this cockpit for an extended period of time?""
Think about whether the storage capacity of your test kayak will fit the needs of the kayaking you plan on doing., You can find kayak providers online, but many kayaking fans argue in favor of beginners testing out a purchase before paying for it in full. Many waterfront kayak sellers will allow you to take a test paddle for a small deposit, but once you have found your ideal water chariot, pay for your boat and get ready to enjoy.

Collect 4 to 10 logs.,
Collect 6 poles that are longer than the logs.,
Tie the ends of the poles together at each end to clamp the logs tightly.,
Scan the area.,
Done.",How to Build a Log Raft1," Lay them gently into the shallow water near shore that is deep enough for the logs to float. Choose equal sized logs because they fit better (be careful not to lay the logs into a rough sea because they might float away!).;
, At one end of the bunched up logs, put a pole under the logs crosswise with a matching pole above. Repeat the process, with the remaining poles, space them to the opposite end of the raft. Gently ensure that there are no big gaps between the logs or you may lose your valuable possessions while at sea.

, Scan the island for strong vines and rope like plants which may provide you with strong fastenings.

, Planks, driftwood and tree bark can be laid on the top sides of the cross poles to create an elevated platform. Bark works well and floats easily but split driftwood with the smooth, round side up looks more natural furthermore, it lasts longer in harsh weather conditions.

, In addition to this design, you could add a sail if you can locate any washed up sacking or old ship sails. After scanning your location, you might also find a large palm leaf which may work just as well.

Place two skid logs in such a way as to slope down to the bank of the river or seashore.,
Cut two sets of inverted notches at each end of the logs.,
Make four three-sided wooden crosspieces.,
Add a deck.",How to Build a Log Raft2," The raft for 3 people will need logs that measure around 12 feet/3.6 meters in length. The raft will need to be 6 feet/1.8 meters wide. Each log should measure around 12 to 14 inches/25-30cm in diameter. Importantly, they should match in size so as to ensure evenness across the flat area when assembled.

, If the skid logs are not even, use an axe to smooth them (remove twigs, bumps, etc.).

, These notches need to be both top and bottom of each log and they must match up in a line when the logs are pushed together.


The top notch rows should be offset from the bottom notch rows; have the top notch rows more to the edge and the bottom notch rows inward more but still close.
Small poles with straight edges can be used to make the notches; or a string pulled taut.

, These need to be approximately one foot longer than the width of the raft.


Drive the crosspieces through the notch sets on the underside of the raft.
Flip the raft over and drive the crosspieces through the top notch sets.
If wished, lash the overhanging areas of the crosspieces together with rope, vine, string, etc. Note that this is not absolutely necessary, as the crosspieces will swell when they are immersed in water, which will bind the logs to the crosspieces anyway. If you do have material to lash the overhang with, it will help tighten the whole structure.
That said, if the crosspieces appear to be too loose in the notch grooves, wedge with pieces of wood taken from a dead log. It must be dead because dead, dry wood swells on contact with water and creates the necessary tight seal.

, Light poles can be added on top of the raft to form a deck that will keep you and your traveling companions, plus gear, drier.

Keep the boat straight.,
Don't watch the paddles.,
Try a sweep stroke.,
Stay straight as much as possible.",How to Kayak Faster1," The most important part of kayaking straight is to always face forwards. Face your shoulders in the direction you are wanting to go, and keep your head facing in the same direction.
, Watching the paddles tends to cause you to turn your kayak, resulting in slowing down., If you're struggling with going straight, add a sweep stroke on the side you are turning towards in order to straighten up., Going straight will ensure you travel much faster than if you are curving."

Watch out for low bridges.",How to Avoid Dangers when Paddling a Kayak or Canoe," It is important to get good, reliable information about the water bodies you are paddling on before you set out, especially as a beginner. Ask park authorities, local kayak/canoe stores, hire stores, local adventure outfits etc. for information. The internet can also prove a useful resource.;
, Always paddle when you are in safe currents and winds. Currents that can carry you away faster than you can paddle must be avoided, as well as winds that have the same effect. If you are not sure, find someone seasoned to show you how to read the signs of currents and winds.

, Paddling can quickly become a nightmare if you encounter obstacles, such as slippery rocks, deep mud, boulders, trees growing near or in the water etc. Also watch for tree roots in some locations.

, Getting stuck against the upstream side of something like a tree, larger craft, rock etc. is a common cause of accidents when the current gets out of your control.

, Weirs and dams can have their own sources of challenges such as eddies, steep drops, unusual currents created by deliberate blockages etc. Beginner paddlers should simply steer clear. Dams can be barred from water recreation; find out in advance.

, If you get jammed under a low level bridge in a swift running current, you can strike a serious problem if the boat tips.

Stretch well.,
Do a bridge.,
Do a backbend against a wall.,
Take a final step before you do a backbend on your own.,
Do a backbend on your own.,
Once you've mastered going down into a bridge try coming back up from it.",How to Do a Backbend," The first and most important thing you should do before attempting to do a back bend is to stretch. If you rush into your backbend without stretching, you can injure your back, wrists, or ankles. Having the patience to do just about 15 minutes of stretching will help you do a back bend the right way. Here are some stretches to do:









Warm up before stretching to get blood flowing with jumping jacks, jump roping, or better yet, do the backbend after a workout.
Stretch your ankles. Sit down and hold your ankle with one hand, while rolling your ankle or even spelling out the alphabet with your foot. Stretch both ankles equally please make sure.
Stretch your wrists. Extend one hand with your palm away from you, and pull your fingers back with the other until you feel a nice stretch. Then do the same with the other hand. Next, hold your wrist with one hand while you roll the wrist of the hand you're holding, and repeat.
Stretch your back. Stretching your back is the most important stretch of all. You should stretch your back with some simple yoga poses, such as the camel pose, bow pose, or cobra pose.;
, Before you can do a backbend, you should be able to do a bridge. Learning to do a bridge can take time, so it may be a while for you to go from the bridge to the backbend. Don't be impatient and learn to stick the bridge before you move on, or you will injure yourself. Here's how to do a bridge in just a few easy steps:









Lay on the floor or a comfortable mat. Plant your feet firmly on the ground and bend your knees at a 90 degree angle.
Put your palms by the sides of your head. Your fingers should be facing your feet, mimicking the wrist stretch you were doing earlier.
Point your elbows toward the ceiling.
When you're in position, gently push off the ground with your hands while keeping your hands and feet planted. Push off each hand at the same time and with the same force.
Keep pushing until your arms are straight and your legs are only a little bit bent. Your gaze should fall between your hands.
You should be pushing with your finger pads and palms, and taking the pressure off your wrists.
Hold the pose for at least ten seconds to be comfortable with it and come down gently when you're ready. Practice the pose a few more times but take breaks, or you may be putting too much pressure on your back or wrists. When you stretch make sure that you don't push yourself too hard because even stretching can really damage your bones and joints.

, Once you've mastered the bridge, you will be ready to try a backbend against the wall. This will simulate what it will feel like to do a real backbend, but it'll give you a little extra help and confidence before you stick it. Here's how you do it:









Stand with your back to a sturdy wall. Stand two feet away from the wall or a little closer, depending on how easy it is for you to comfortably reach the wall.
Your feet should be wider than the distance between your shoulders.
Raise your arms by your ears.
Slowly bend your back and look at the wall behind you.
Touch the wall with your palms, and walk down the wall until you reach the floor and are in a backbend position.
Slowly lower yourself to the ground.

, Now that you've mastered the bridge and the backbend against a wall, you're almost ready to do the backbend on your own. Before you reach that step, you should do the following things:









Practice doing half of a back bend onto a raised surface, such as a bed or a couch. Then you'll only have to reach halfway down and will get a better sense of how a real backbend will feel.
Try doing a backbend against the wall, but don't hold on to the wall as soon as you bend back. Instead, every time you try a back bend against the wall, lean back a little further before you touch the wall so you're not using the wall for the entire process.
When you're ready to a backbend on your own, you should always have a spotter. The spotter should put one hand on your back and one hand on your side as you lower yourself to the ground.

, Now that you've mastered all of the pre-backbend techniques and were comfortable doing a backbend with a spotter, you're ready to do a back bend on your own. You'll be repeating a variation of what you already did against the wall. Here's how to do it:









Stand up straight with your legs positioned shoulder width apart.
Raise your arms over your head and flatten your palms until they face the ceiling. Your fingers should be pointing right behind you.
Slowly bend backwards and shove your thighs forward. Make sure to keep your arms locked as you move closer to the ground.
When you reach the ground, plant your hands and keep your feet firmly in place. You should be looking in between your hands.
When you've held the backbend for a few seconds or for however long you were comfortable, lower yourself to the ground. When you're done with backbends, remember to stretch.

, Be very careful not to hurt your back though.

Get a soft mat.,
Stretch.,
Gain some confidence.,
Get a spotter.,

Make sure your spotter can sustain your weight and make sure they can properly spot.,
Get in a sitting position with your arms swinging upwards.,
Push through your toes and lift your arms up, following your hands with your eyes.,
Continue to fall backwards without arching your back too much.,
Plant your hands on the floor.,
Swing your legs over your hands.,
Plant your feet on the floor.,
Pop up.",How to Do a Back Handspring," To get comfortable going backwards you should use a soft surface to prevent injury of any kind. Find a cushy, soft mat and practice jumping backwards on to it.






;
, It's important that you stretch before you do a back handspring or you are putting yourself in serious risk for getting an injury. The most important parts of your body that you should stretch are your back your wrists and your ankles, though stretching your legs, arms, and neck won't hurt, either. Here are some stretches to try:









To stretch your back, do a backbend. If you don't know how to do one, you should master this skill before you move on.
After the backbend, you should curl up into a ball on the floor and roll up and down, rolling out your back.
To stretch your wrists, get on your knees and place your hands on the ground palms-down, with the fingers pointed at you. Then, pull back on your arms to feel a deep stretch in your wrists.
After you stretch your wrists, roll them clockwise and counterclockwise five times each.

, If you're not feeling confident about backwards movements, or you're a beginner to this move, start off on a trampoline or mat. This way, you can gain your confidence until you're ready to go and do it on a harder surface like grass without the risk of injury. Also, having an experienced gymnast watching you will help you get over the fear of doing a back handspring so you can boost your confidence.








, Make sure that when you try to do a back handspring for the first time, you have a spotter, a coach or gymnastics teacher to spot you. This will prevent you from hurting yourself and will give you the confidence you need to successfully do the back handspring. The spotter should place one hand on your lower back and one hand under your thighs to help you flip backwards., As you stand by your spotter, bring your legs and feet together, your knees together and your arms in front of you. Also, make sure they can do the move and that you can support their weight and properly spot.
Practice doing a ""trust fall"" -- just fall back into your spotter's arms to make sure that the spotter can handle your weight. Make sure you are on a soft mat in case they lie or can't handle your weight.
At the beginning, your spotter can help you flip your body over by pushing your back and thighs upwards. As you get more experienced, the spotter will only be there for your safety and won't help you gather momentum. Make sure you jump hard, the spotter can not do all of the work

, First, stand tall with your arms up. Then, sit back, like you're going to lean back in a chair. Your knees should be directly over your feet, not positioned in front of your feet, or you won't generate enough momentum to land on your hands.









Raise your arms high, so they're pointing straight up and almost touching your ears, as you assume the sitting position.
Then, move your shoulders down and lower your arms to your sides and swing them upwards to generate momentum as you begin to fall further backwards.

, Continue swinging your arms to generate momentum until they reach over your head. At the same time, push through your toes to get that upward momentum. Lean your arms back as far as you can -- you shouldn't land your arms right near the place where your feet stood.









Tighten the arm and shoulder muscles driving up and back from your feet, raising your head back between your arms.
Make sure your arms are by your ears.

, Arching your back too much is called undercutting and will not only make your back handspring look less pretty, but it could also injure your back. As you fall, let your legs continue to drive you upward and backward. Point your toes and extend through your ankles. Make sure you keep your head back between your arms as they approach the floor. Start to look for your landing spot on the mat.








, Reach for the floor as you fall backwards. Keep your body arched as your hands touch the floor. Make sure you keep your arms straight so you don't hit your head on the floor. Your fingers should be pointing up and away from your face with your palms flat on the ground. Let the momentum of your legs, with your lower body still following, carry you over. This position is similar to a handstand, which is why it's important to know how to hold a handstand for a few seconds before you attempt the back handspring.









When your hands are planted on the floor, use the pads of your hands and fingers, your arms, and your shoulders for support. Don't put all of your weight and pressure on your hands.

, Make sure that when you swing your legs over if you feel the need to fall don't let your strength just loosen, lean off to the side like you were going to do a cartwheel.Your body will look like it's in the handstand position at this point, though you'll be holding this position very briefly. Just keep your feet together and pointed and keep your shoulders strong, directly over your hands. Don't lock your knees, but keep your legs almost straight.








, Continue by swinging your legs and feet over and snapping them down firmly toward the floor. Keep your upper body straight as your toes approach the floor.








, To finish the back handspring, just land with your legs slightly bent, pop up a bit, and swing your arms straight in front of you and then up, to strike the finishing pose with your arms up and your feet straight and touching. Don't be discouraged if you don't get it right immediately. Work with a spotter until you feel comfortable enough to do it on your own. With enough hard work, you'll have a neat and smoothly-executed back handspring in no time.

Master your backbend.,
Get a spotter.,
Stretch.,
Don't forget to stretch your back well!,
Start in an upright position.,
Do a back bend.,
Rock into a handstand.,
Lower your feet to the floor in a piked position.,
Finish with your arms overhead.",How to Do a Back Limber," The handstand is a basic gymnastic move that you'll need to be fully capable of doing in order to execute a back limber. If your handstand is a little rusty, practice until you can do it easily without the help of a spotter.


Practice using good form - keep your shoulders in and your legs together.
Be confident that you can hold your handstand for several seconds.;
, The bridge position is a key element of the back limber, so practice it until you have a good feel for how to do it. Start by lying on a gym mat with your knees bent. Place your hands on the mat behind your ears and lift your body with your hands and feet until your body forms an arched bridge shape.

, Starting in an upright position, arch your back and bend toward the floor until your hands are firmly planted behind you. This move is the first part of a back limber, so it's important that you can do it confidently!

, A back limber is a pretty advanced move, so it's a good idea to start with a spotter the first few times you do it. Ask your gymnastics instructor or coach, or a gymnast more advanced than you, to help you out. Practice the move in a soft area, like on a gym mat or in the grass. The s

, Warm up your muscles by stretching your back, arms, wrists and legs before proceeding. This will make it easier for your body to go through the motions of a back limber. Do the following stretches to get ready:


Stretch your back by doing a few backbends.

,


Pull back on your fingers as you hold your arm out straight to stretch out your wrist, then switch to the other side.
Jog a lap or two to get your blood circulating and stretch your legs.

, Hold your legs together and raise your arms so that they're pointed toward the sky. Your back and legs should be in a straight line with your arms.

, It can help to keep your feet a little apart if you're a beginner, but more advanced gymnasts should keep them together. Arch backward until your hands are planted firmly on the ground and your body is in the bridge position.

, As your hands land and your body forms a bridge, rock your body upward and pull your legs upright into a handstand. This part of the move takes some practice! The key is to move from a backbend to a handstand in one fluid motion, keeping your legs together and pointing them upright to finish.

, This is the most formal way to end a back limber. Keeping your arms and back in a straight vertical line, hold your legs together and bend at the waist. Your legs should stay straight and move together to the ground, like a hinge. Land with your feet firmly planted on the ground.

, The finishing position is the same as the starting position: keep your legs and back straight with your arms stretched overhead."

Extend the bow paddle out the front of the canoe to break the impact with the shoreline.,
Exit the canoe by reversing the steps in the ""Getting into a Canoe"" section.",How to Canoe," The canoe was developed by North American Native Americans, who developed a versatile and lightweight vessel for freshwater journeys. A canoe is an open, slender boat that tapers to points at both ends. There are several sizes of canoes, including those for one person, two people, or three or more people. The front of the canoe is called the bow, while the back is called the stern. The body of the canoe is called the hull. A canoe is classically propelled forward with a paddle.There are actually many types of canoes, such as the Hawaiian outrigger canoe, sailing canoe, and dugout canoes which vary from this description. However, the typical canoe for the beginner is pictured above.;
, Paddles are what allow the canoe to move. When you grip a paddle and plunge it into the water, and draw backward, the boat moves forward. There are four parts of a paddle:


The Grip: You place your top hand on the grip. For example, if you were paddling on the right side of the boat, your left hand would be on the grip, and your right would be on the shaft.
The Shaft: This is the pole that makes up the majority of the paddle. You place your hand in the middle of the shaft. If you were paddling on the right side of the canoe, you would place your right hand in the middle of the shaft and your left hand on the grip.
The Throat: This is what connects the blade to the shaft.
The Blade: This is what most people picture when they think of a paddle. It is the large, flat object at the bottom of the paddle. The blade is what pushes the water while you paddle, thus moving the boat forward.

, Life vests are always recommended while boating. Most American states have specific laws about life vests, including mandatory life vest use or at least having them in the boat.


Wear it properly. If a life jacket is too small, or not fastened properly, it will not work optimally.
A life vest is needed for emergencies, and you will not usually have forewarning when an emergency is imminent. Although uncommon, sudden accidental capsizing is always a possibility.
Even if you are an expert swimmer, you can be hit unconscious by a capsizing boat and drown if you do not have a life jacket. Or you can find yourself miles from land, a distance not safe to swim or advisable to do so. Just because you are a good swimmer does not mean you should forgo the life jacket.
If you are canoeing for the first time or don’t feel very comfortable around water, and are a non-swimmer or weak swimmer, life jackets are especially important.

, What you bring depends on the length of the time you are planning on being out in the water. A short paddle out to a fishing spot will be different than a week-long voyage through the Adirondacks. :


Water shoes. These are great if you plan on canoeing to a destination and then getting out and exploring. Water shoes are easy to swim in (which is good if you accidentally capsize) and make it easy to walk along the shore, especially one that is rocky.
Clothes that can get wet or dirty. Even if you don’t capsize, there is a definite chance that you will get splashed--either accidentally or on purpose. Canoeing can also be sweaty work, and occurs in an outdoor environment.
Swimsuit. Your clothes will likely get wet, and swimsuits are usually more comfortable to be in than wet cotton underclothes. Also, swimming often accompanies boating activities.
Protective hat. Ideally, your hat should be wide-brimmed, able to get wet, and have a chin-strap or a clip to attach to your shirt. Canoeist are often exposed to the sun from the sky and reflected from the water. Also, wind gusts can snatch away your hat in a moment.
Sunglasses with protective strap. The glare from the water on a bright and sunny day can be brutal. Even with a hat, sunglasses protect your eyes and increase comfort. Ideally, have a ""sports strap"" to prevent your glasses from falling overboard.
A dry bag. Dry bags are waterproof bags that are great for bringing on canoeing trips. Store a camera, your cell phone, an extra jacket, car keys, etc. in the dry bag and it is guaranteed to remain dry. If it will be damaged if immersed in water, it should be in the dry bag.
Water bottle. Canoeing can be a real workout, and the outdoor exposure to wind, sun, and reflected sun from the water can be dehydrating. Unless it is a short trip or just ""paddling around"", having water available is highly recommended.
Bailing device. Typically, this will be a detergent or bleach bottle modified into a ""scoop"", or sometimes a large sponge. If you do capsize, being able to bail (i.e., remove the water) from the boat can be important. It can also be nice to be able to easily remove water that finds its way into the boat.

, The bow of the boat should be closest to the shore or dock, while the stern should be further out. If you are ok with getting your feet wet, you can simply push the boat out so that it is floating in very shallow water (it should not be touching the bottom) and then climbing in from there. If possible, have someone hold the canoe so that it stays in one place., The more experienced paddler should sit in the stern. The person sitting in the bow just has to paddle, while the person sitting in the stern will paddle while also steering. (Steering is covered in Part Three.)

, You should push the canoe out so that most of it is floating, bow first. Keep a hold on the boat so that it does not float away. The person sitting in the bow should go first. Hold the boat steady while the person steps into the boat, crouches low and grasps the sides of the canoe. She/he should then slowly make his way up to the bow, making sure to keep his weight balanced by holding onto both sides of the boat and keeping his weight in the center. Once she/he is settled, you should put your foot into the center of canoe and then push off of the shore with your other foot while keeping both hands on both sides of the canoe. Lower yourself into your seat.


If you are getting into the canoe second, you can also get into the boat (making sure to keep your weight centered in the middle,) sit down, and then push off from shore with your paddle. Place the paddle directly behind you and push off from shore. You may have to push more than once.
If you are getting into your canoe from a dock, you do the same things. However, you will want to keep the boat horizontal to the dock, rather than perpendicular (like you would if pushing off from the shore.)

, Leaning forward will put unnecessary strain on your back, and leaning too far backward will be inefficient. Leaning to either side will put you in danger of tipping over. Place one hand on the end of the paddle's grip, and the other hand grasping around the shaft in the center above the blade. Make sure that one paddler starts out on the right, and the other on the left. When either of you gets tired, switch sides. Unless you are turning, you always want to keep your paddles on opposite sides in order to paddle forward as efficiently as possible., Reach forward with the paddle, set the paddle in about up to the throat, pull back. Be sure your strokes are even, not too deep or too shallow. Be sure the stroke is complete, and not taking out the paddle too soon. Paddling is typically at a slow, steady rate--this is not a race!


Hold the paddle over the water so that the top hand is near your face (not chest), and the arm nearest to the water is stretched out straight. Stick the entire blade into the water so that the shaft is nearly perpendicular to the surface.
Pull the paddle through the water, along the side of the boat. If the paddle stays close to the side of the boat, your body should be able to maintain its upright position without leaning to the side.

, If you are in the stern, you will be the person who does the most steering. When you are heading in a straight line, you may notice that the canoe begins to veer either to the left or to the right of the straight line. This could be because of a current, or because one of the paddlers is paddling harder than the other. Whatever it may be, you will want to correct the canoe and get it back to the straight line. In order to do this, you will want to paddle on the same side.Another way to steer is to perform a ‘J’ stroke. To accomplish this, place the paddle directly behind you, with the paddle parallel to the side of the canoe. Sweep your paddle out and towards the bow of the boat, creating a ‘J’ shape. If you want to turn right, do a J stroke on the right side of the boat. If you want to turn to the left, do the stroke on the left side of the boat.

, Paddling backwards is essentially the same as paddling forward. Place your paddle behind you and sweep it forwards in the water, making sure to lift your paddle all the way out of the water after you have performed the stroke. This will propel you backwards.

, Slow the canoe speed, if you don't want to run aground, by dipping your paddle blade into the water so it's perpendicular to the canoe. If there are two paddles, both paddles should be in the water on opposite sides of the canoe. You can also paddle backwards in order to slow the boat down when it is moving forward.

, You will want to be moving at an extremely slow pace at this point. Hitting the shore too hard could cause damage to your canoe. If hit extremely hard, it could even propel you from the boat.

, Always make sure to keep the boat balanced. Once one of the paddlers gets out of the canoe, that person should hold the boat steady for the other paddler.


If you are tying up to a dock, tie the boat down before getting out of the canoe if possible. This will keep the canoe in place, allowing you to focus on keeping your weight centered while you get out of the boat.

Determine what type shape your body is.,
See if you have an apple body type.,
Consider whether you are a ""pear"" type.,
Consider whether you're a straight/rectangular body type.,
Look at whether you have an hourglass body.,
Know that your current body shape can be modified somewhat by diet and exercise.,
Look at your genetics.,
Dress for the apple body type.,
Dress for a pear body type.,
Dress for a straight or rectangular body type.,
Dress an hourglass body.",How to Dress for Your Body Type," Pay attention to your curves. Look at how they connect your bust, waist, and hips.The body types as describes below describe women's bodies, not a girl who has not gone through puberty. Although it is sometimes possible to determine body type prior to maturity, it is only after growing a bust, hips, and so on that it will become evident.
Measure the sizes of your bust, waist, and hip. Depending on the size of each part (in inches), you can determine which shape your body is to find clothes that properly fitThere is no ""best"" or ""worst"" body type. A certain type may be fashionable in your particular locale, at this period in time, but this does not mean your body type is ""bad"".
All body types have pros and cons. Knowing your body type is about dressing to look your best.
Even model's bodies fall into one of these categories.;
, Generally described as ""top-heavy"", this is generally about 14 percent of women where the bust is three or more inches bigger than the hips. Just by looking at yourself in the mirror, you can see if you are an apple body type.Slim limbs, specifically the arms, but wide shoulders are usually a strong characteristic of this body type.
Weight is concentrated around your mid-section and chest, giving the appearance of a bigger bust and protruding stomach, at times.
If you naturally have a smaller bust, then weight can gather around your midriff.
Just below the mid-section, your waistline can have little definition, thus giving rise to the “top-heavy” description of this body type.
Though your top may be on the heavier side, your legs should be slimmer.

, Being the opposite of an apple body type means you are a pear body type. This one is bottom-heavy (or triangle) with about 20 percent of women having hips significantly larger than bust.You’ll notice if this is your body quite quickly, as your lower body: hips, thighs, and sometimes your behind are more noticeable.
Shoulders are narrower, sloping, and not as broad.
Usually described as the most “curvaceous” body. It’s a simple one to notice just by looking at your legs as they are sometimes noticeably more wider, muscular, and fuller compared to the rest of your body.

, About 46 percent of women are this shape where the waist is about the same as hips and bust. Your silhouette isn’t as curvy as the pear or apple bodies. Instead, you’ll look fairly straight up with flat shoulders.Unlike the prior two body types; the best way to determine for a rectangular type is to measure. Upon measuring, you’ll notice that your waist is one to eight inches smaller than your bust.
Standing straight up, you should not notice any significant curves around the waist area.
Your rib cage will define most of your shape, as there will be no waist definition to add curves.
Despite being rectangular, you may still have a curvy bottom (similar to a pear bottom), or a wide chest with a little bit of extra weight around the midriff.

, This is the least common with only 8 percent of women. The hip and bust measurements are usually equal, with a narrow waist.Unlike other body shapes, the hourglass figure has a significantly defined waist.
Your curves are flattering in the right places. Fat is usually evenly stored throughout.
Looking in the mirror your hip line and bust line are the same width.
You can still have an hourglass body even when: slightly fleshy upper arms, wider looking shoulders, and a slightly fuller bottom.

, Your genetics do determine how body fat is carried on the body; this predisposition cannot be altered. However, if you are not carrying around excessive weight, your body type will not be quite as exaggerated or obvious. Slender women look more similar to each other than obese women.


You cannot ""Spot Reduce"". Toning a certain body part is possible--you can do core exercises to help flatten abdominal muscles . But your body will not do it in just one place. On women, when women lose weight the change is most dramatic around your chest, hips, and posterior whether you want to or not.
You cannot ""Spot Increase"". Likewise, short of surgery, you cannot increase parts of your body. Doing chest exercises or using skin creams will not make your bust larger. While chest exercises firm and tone up the bust line, this is not quite the same as increasing your bust.
Certain body types have a predisposition to gain or lose weight in certain areas. For example, a woman with an hourglass figure will tend to gain or lose weight in the bust and hips, and not the waist. But a woman with an apple shape will tend to gain in the hips, and not so much in the bust--even if it is the same amount of body weight.
Cardio and resistance training are most commonly used to alter body types. By knowing if you retain fat more or lose it quicker, you can create an exercise plan to cater to your bodily needs.Remember that clothes are meant to flatter your body, not your body to flatter your clothes. Actresses, models, and the like dress to look wonderful no matter what the underlying body type is. In fact, models do not necessarily look good in everything. When a designer is putting together a photo shoot or runway show, they pick the model that best shows off the clothes...models are not interchangeable.
What is the ideal body type changes through history. In America during the Victorian period, the ""Hourglass"" was perfection, and required women to don corsets to get that look. In the 1920's, the ideal woman's body was the boyish ""Rectangular"" type requiring women to wear girdles and flattening larger chests. Different cultures and subcultures see different body types as ideal. An African-American woman in America may be praised for a shapely, round posterior. However, the same quality in a woman in Japan may not be.

, Family genes play a large role in your body type. Look at other women in your family to see a common trend. If the women in your family tend to have a certain body type, chances are good you do as well. Remember, it is not just your mother's family, but your father's as well!

, To dress successfully for the apple body, you need to direct attention away from your mid riff, and wear clothes to accentuate other parts.


Follow your bodyline and keep details on the top and lower third of your body. With this body type, it is easy to wear shirts, blouses or dresses with slight V-necks with out looking too fancy or over the top.
Draw attention away from your waist and shoulders/arms (wear long sleeves), and draw attention to your bust and neck (e.g. v-necks).
Choose flared pants over straight-leg or skinny pants, and to help balance out wide shoulders and/or a heavy upper body. Wear bottoms just below your hipbone to draw attention away from your mid riff.
Avoid dresses and belts that pinch at your waist. This will most likely accentuate curves that you may not wish to show off.
Wear tops that drape over any curves if you wish.
Enhancing a feature that is further away or you can cover it with dark colors.

, The trick to dressing this body type is to wear anything that adds to your shoulder and bust area. Keep attention to your upper body, by minimizing the lower half.


If you’re a pear body-type, there are things you can do to make your hips and butt look slimmer, if you want to make their butts bigger!
Balance your top with your bottom. Try to wear tops that accentuate your shoulders a bit more.
Avoid pants or tights that narrow your legs.
Wearing a bra that adds to or enhance your bust should be considered.
Wear straight-leg or slightly flared pants with heels. Skinny pants that hug your ankles can make your lower body take on the appearance of an upside-down triangle. Flared pants can make your legs look very thick, perhaps bowl-legged, in comparison to your upper body.

, With this body type, you may have a long, thin body that tends to lack curves. It is sometimes referred to as a ""boyish"" profile. Your aim is to wear clothes that flatter your thin profile, break up, your silhouette, and create curves that move up and down from the waist area.


If you have this body type, you can ""pinch"" in your waist to exaggerate curves. For example, add a belt to your dress.
Go for ruffles and frills to add texture, volume, and femininity to your figure. For instance, a dress with a lot of embellishment at the bust will often give some ""weight"" there that makes that area look a bit bigger.
Steer clear of menswear clothing. For example, dressing in baggy jeans and track clothes will make you look like ""one of the boys"", but not a potential girlfriend. Instead, opt for the skinny jeans that are made for your body type, and wear track clothing made for women at your workout session.
Stock up on miniskirts and bright tights to make the most of your great legs. They will also add more shape to a straight body.
Use shapewear. A Rectangular body type benefits from shaping undergarments. For example, a bra that adds a cup size will balance out your angular features without much effort at all.

, Avoid anything that makes you look ""boxy""! You have admirable curves, so embrace them.


Use your waist as the focal point when dressing. This means to wear snug clothes and accessories around the thinnest part of your waist. Directing attention here will make your curves stand out even more.
Dress to flatter your beautiful curves by following your body’s outline. Tailored clothing is usually more flattering. Shapeless or drape-y clothing tends to over-focus on the bust make hourglass shapes look heavy or pregnant.
Balance your top and bottom while accentuating your waist. Draw attention to your waist with belts and dresses that pinch at the mid-section.
Women with curves can end up revealing too much bust. If a neckline is too deep, or is inappropriate leave those clothes on the rack.
Shape your bust. If you have an hourglass shape, you probably have plenty of bust; your main concern should be to wear a supportive bra so that your chest looks perky, not droopy and saggy.
Embrace V-neck dresses and tops. While many necklines work well for well-endowed women, V-necks are typically quite flattering. Just be sure you do not show more cleavage than appropriate to the situation.

Wearing the wrong size bra can create cutting lines that dig into your skin and cause your bust to spill out from the top. Consider getting your bra size professionally measured at the women’s section of a department store.


Wearing underwear that is too small can create bulges and panty lines that can be seen through pants and other garments.Consider purchasing seamless underwear in your correct size.;
, While thin bikini bottoms and thongs prevent panty lines, they cover the bare minimum and offer no lift or support. Try boy shorts, briefs, and other styles that help pull in your buttocks, stomach, and thighs.These cuts can help create a tighter, smoother appearance.

, If you want extra help creating a shapely figure and keeping your excess weight in check, try a body shaping undergarments.These undergarments can slip over your stomach, thighs, chest, arms, and rear and help prevent these areas from jiggling around too much.


You may find this option a little excessive for daily wear, but it is especially helpful for special occasions.

, Control top hosiery has a tall, thick layer at the top hem designed to stretch over your stomach and keep everything in place.This creates a smoother look that will make your dress or skirt look more flattering.

, Clothes that are too small and tight will show every area of excess your body has. On the other hand, clothes that are too big and baggy will make you look wider and heavier than you actually are. Only clothes that fit you properly will flatter you. That means trying clothes on at the store.Just because a size tag claims a shirt is a certain size, doesn’t mean that that shirt is going to fit you the same as other shirts you have in that same size.


If having your clothes fit you properly means getting you garments tailored, so be it., Going further than just wearing clothes that actually fit you, wear clothing styles that flatter your body most. That means avoiding overly tight and clingy clothes.Tight material will hug to your body and show every fold you have. When you’re trying to look slimmer, you should aim to draw attention away from excess skin, not display it.


The same can be said for the opposite: Clothes that are too loose make you look frumpy and bigger than you actually are – which is unflattering. However, look for clothing that drapes over your frame rather than hanging off of it.You want your clothing to be fitted yet comfortably loose enough to follow along your body's contours without smothering them., Black has a slimming effect on you and can look especially nice with trousers, skirts, and dresses.All black looks can be flattering, but there is a fine line between looking chic and looking gloomy. If you decide to wear an all black look, incorporate a pop of color somewhere (blouse, shoes, lip color, purse, belt, etc.).

, Usually, dark colors have a slimming effect similar to the effect created by wearing black.A good way to bring color and interest into your wardrobe is by including a variety of rich colors, from deep plum to dark olive and navy blue to chocolate brown.


Strategically use dark colors to slim out your trouble areas, and bright colors to bring attention to your more flattering areas., A blazer is an easy way to cover up unflattering arms, but the vertical lines of the lapels create a nice elongation of your figure. An open blazer paired with V-neck shirt and dark jeans is an easy go-to outfit to quickly throw together., As mentioned earlier, bold colors can accentuate your good areas and dark colors can conceal on your problem areas. Consider adding some bold color and print patterns into your wardrobe to mix things up. Be sure that you choose print patterns that are small – approximately the size of your fist.Bold patterns can distract the eye and camouflage your outline, causing the observer to notice the item of clothing instead of your size.
Choose patterns in bright or deep colors, since patterns in light colors may actually draw further attention to your imperfections and make you look larger.

, Large blocks of solid color draw the eye up and down rather than side to side. As a result, the eye takes in more height than width, causing you to appear thinner and taller.Try wearing solid color dresses, top and bottom pieces, or even color blocked dresses.


Color blocked dresses can create the same flattering look a dress with one color creates, except color blocked dresses have with different colored panels that can create or accentuate a flattering figure., Stock up on V-neck shirts, sweaters, cardigans, and other vertical necklines to draw the eye up and down, elongating and narrowing your torso.Avoid horizontal necklines, like crew necks and boat necks, since these may make your shoulders and bust look wider.

, Think pinstripes, pleats, and vertical zippers, and avoid horizontal stripes or rows of embellishments. Vertical details prompt the eye to look up and down instead of side to side, which helps create the illusion of slenderness., Skinny jeans and other trousers with a tapered leg draw attention to your hips and upper leg, which can make your top look heavy. Instead, look for straight-leg, boot-cut, and other pant styles with a slight flare.These styles pull the eyes down and away, creating an overall leaner look.

, A-line skirts are fitted at the hip and upper thigh, but flare out toward the knee, creating a balanced look juxtaposed to your legs. Knee-length skirts are the most universally flattering, but many mid-calf styles may also work well depending on your height.

, For instance, if you carry excess weight in your stomach, look for peplum tops and dresses that flare out and can be paired with a high waisted a-line skirt. Additionally, wrap shirts and dresses can help cinch your waist and cover up bulky areas.Lean toward clothing that carefully masks your problem areas without adding too much bulk.

, If you carry excess weight in your thighs, look for bottoms with few pockets and no embellishments on the hip.Details draw attention, and any part of your body covered in visual detailing will look more noticeable.

, If you have strong legs and are proud of them, highlight them by raising your skirt's hemline a few inches. If you have a well-defined waist, look for nipped, high waisted waistlines and belts that really call attention to it.By drawing attention to the most slender parts of your body, you create the illusion of overall slenderness and confidence.

, High heels make your leg look long and lean, and a leaner-looking leg helps create a leaner look overall. If you have wide feet, strappy sandals and flats will only accentuate the heft of your foot.Your heels don’t have to be stilettos, but a thinner, two-inch heel or more, can help elongate the look of your legs. Try a pointed toe with a lower vamp (area that cover your toes) and avoid squared toes., Ankle straps place a horizontal line at the top of your foot, which cuts off your leg and makes it look shorter.A shorter looking leg reduces the illusion of overall skinniness.

, Shoes matching your leg’s skin tone will create the illusion of longer legs. Black booties or pumps paired with black solid tights are a go to look for the colder winter months.For the summer months, try skin-toned shoes and pumps and wear them with your bare legs., A touch of eye shadow or a popping shade of lipstick keeps the focus on your face and off your body. Be sure to keep your eyebrows nicely arched and shaped and to cover up and under eye circles that could appear to drag your face down.However, you don’t wear too much make-up. Just add a bit of color to one feature at a time—usually either your eyes or your lips—and keep the rest of your make-up looking natural.

, Ask your stylist about styles that can elongate your neck or face. In general, wide bob cuts may add too much width to your face, but many long, layered styles direct the eye up and down instead of side to side.


Considering pulling your hair up and away from your face. You could tease the crown of you head to give some volume, while tying your hair into a smooth ponytail., Think bright, sassy, long necklaces.Stick with jewelry and other accessories that create a vertical look, and avoid horizontal accessories like chokers that may make your neck or other features look thicker.

, Even though it creates a horizontal line across your body, a fashionable belt tied around your natural waist may emphasize the narrowness of your waist and create a flattering, slim silhouette. Stick with narrow belts rather than wider belts. This will encourage that your waist looks cinched, rather than bound. For example, consider a thin, leopard printed belt with a black outfit.

Outfit your upper body in bold colors and big prints. These catch the eye at the top, making your shoulders and chest seem a bit broader than they actually are.;
, Certain necklines are better for a pear-shaped figure, as they broaden the shoulders and emphasize the bust. Wide necklines like boat-necks and scoop-necks visually widen your shoulders. Bust-enhancing necklines like sweetheart necks draw attention to the bust, making it look fuller. Strapless tops and dresses can also make your shoulders and bust look wider, but may not be a comfortable choice for every pear-shaped girl.

, Deciding between tight and loose can be difficult, as there are pros and cons to each. Look for tops that are tight around the waist and highlight an hourglass figure. Loose tops should be worn a bit long so as to cover the hips and provide substance for the shoulders. In general, the fit of your shirts should aim to highlight your waist and shoulders, something that can be accomplished with the right combination of tight and loose.

, Bulking up with layers adds bulk to your torso, which evens out your body’s proportions. Use layers of tank tops, blouses, and cardigans to create visual interest and give the illusion of added size. If you’re using multiple layers which take away the smallness of your waist, use a thin belt to cinch them in and give yourself that hourglass figure again.

, Shirts that have adornment near the neck elongate the shoulder and neckline. Select a load of shirts which have beading, bows, or collars near your neck. These can be large or small, as they both accomplish the same task of drawing the eye upwards and away from your bottom half. You can also choose to wear a scarf to the same effect.

, Although it’s not always easy to find wide-sleeved shirts, keep an eye out for styles like bell and kimono sleeves. Wide sleeves add volume to your arms, and as a result, your naturally voluminous hips and rear look more balanced and proportioned. If nothing else, try to wear shirts that have rolled or scrunched sleeves; these also add volume to your arms, but without making such a bold fashion statement.

, Look for tops that skim over your hips; tops that extend just below you hipbone extend your torso and mask the widest part of your hips. Avoid hemlines that reach down to your thighs, however, since these will only make the widest part of your legs look wider. On the flip side, crop tops should be widely avoided for drawing attention to your midsection, which is too close to your hips to be flattering.

, Your entire upper body can undergo a major transformation when you wear the right undergarments. Consider a padded bra or push-up bra. This will add volume to a small bust, and accentuate an hourglass waist. Look for a natural style that can be worn under both casual and dress clothes., Visually, dark colors give a slimming effect and aren’t distracting; the eye tends to skim over dark colors. Denim is appropriate too, but wear dark washes and stay away from medium and light wash jeans. Choose a variety of pants and skirts in shades of black, gray, navy, brown, and olive green. As a bonus to being slimming, these will match nearly any shirt in your closet easily.

, Similar to your tops, you want to create proportional sizing in your legs and the rest of your body. Choose pants that are straight leg or flared at the bottom to create a bottom half with full volume all the way down. Pants that are very skinny will showcase the size of your hips/rear, while pants and jeans that are equal width or slightly wider in the calf and ankle area will draw attention away from your mid-section. Avoid cigarette-style pants, as these are the least flattering style for a pear-shaped body.

, Skirts that hit the knee or ankle are perfect for pear-shaped ladies. These draw the eye to the end point, rather than short skirts which forces the eye to linger on the widest part of your body. Look for skirts that start just above your hips near your waist, and are no shorter than just above the knee. Avoid tight-fitting skirts, and look for those with ruffles or beading along the bottom hem draw attention to your curvy bottom half without adding bulk to your hips. Placing these details at the knee or lower may even help balance out your hips.

, Although jeans with cute beaded and embroidered pockets may seem like a good idea, these can draw the eye to your least flattering location. Avoid glitzy pants and belts, and stay away from bottoms embellished with buttons, gemstones, sequins, or bold embroidery near your hips and rear.

, Dresses are a great way to accomplish both your tasks at once: draw the eyes upward to your torso, while creating a tight waistline and covering up your midsection. Look for dresses that are A-line or that have a tulip-skirt, and avoid those that are tight and stick to your hips. Dresses get bonus points if they are banded around the waist and cover up your shoulders to give the illusion of bulk., A bold, bright necklace that hangs low draws the eye to your upper half. The extra detail on your bust makes it look fuller, which keeps your entire body looking better proportioned. You can choose to wear a collar-style necklace which adds width to your neck and shoulders as well, a bonus for highlighting your upper body.

, Keeping in mind that you should wear only one statement piece of jewelry at once, putting on some glitzy earrings is a great way to draw the eye further up the body and away from your hips. Choose chandelier style or dangly earrings for the best effect.

, Scarves add volume and dimension to your upper half, as the extra detail at the neck often prevents onlookers from focusing in on your fuller lower half. Try a variety of scarves tied in different ways to see what looks best for you. Circle scarves are successful when worn for a pear-shape, as their lack of tail ends prevents the eye from travelling downwards as quickly.

, Believe it or not, your shoes can change the appearance of the rest of your body. Look for shoes that have a pointed toe, as these elongate your legs and make your hips look more proportional. High heels are often a good choice for adding height and sculpting the muscles in your legs, making them look more flattering. If you’re up for the challenge, wearing bold and colorful shoes can do the same thing as a big necklace; it draws the eyes away from the unflattering regions of your body and adds interest to a smaller area."

Exit bridge pose with a backbend kickover as an alternative.",How to Do a Bridge," Bridge pose, or short bridge, is a beginner backbend exercise that’s common in yoga and Pilates. It’s not nearly as strenuous as the full gymnastics bridge. It is performed on the ground, and the shoulders never leave the floor, so it’s a good move for beginners.Bridge pose is good for stretching the spine, neck, thighs, and hip flexors.
This exercise will work best if you're on a cushioned but firm surface, such as a carpeted area or an exercise mat on the floor.;
, While on your back, bend your knees to bring your feet in toward your bum. Make sure you keep the soles of your feet flat on the ground and your knees shoulder-width apart.







, Keep your palms flat on the ground. If your fingers can't touch your heels, bring your feet in closer.








, In bridge pose, your feet, shoulders, arms, and hands stay on the ground. Push into the ground equally with these parts to lift the rest of your body off the ground. You want your legs, hips, buttocks, and back to come off the ground and raise toward the ceiling.








, This will help stretch out your back fully.At this point, your knees should be bent and your weight evenly distributed between your feet, shoulders, and upper arm area.









Your neck should be able to move freely, but do not turn your head in bridge pose).Keep your feet parallel and flat on the ground, and keep your thighs aligned and slightly apart.
Hold bridge pose in this way for at least one minute, or go on to one of the variations.

, This is one minor variation of bridge pose. Because your weight is on your shoulders and upper arms, you should be able to bring your palms together under your body and clasp your hands together.








Keep your arms extended and pressed into the mat as you do this. Make sure your palms are touching.

, Another version of bridge pose involves lifting one knee at a time while maintaining the pose. With your arms flat on the ground or together under your body, lift one foot off the ground and bring your knee in toward your chest.


Hold this for 30 seconds before putting your foot back on the ground and repeating with the other leg.
Don’t let your hips or buttocks drop toward the ground when you're on one foot., Unclasp your hands and place your arms beside your body again, palms flat on the ground. Slowly, and with control, lower your chest and back, starting at the neck and working your way down your spine until your bottom is on the ground again.







, A more advanced version of the bridge, which is common in gymnastics, is to push your body up into a full bridge, which is sometimes called the full wheel.

, Bring your feet in so they're touching your bum. Keep your feet flat on the ground.








, Bend your elbows and bring your hands up beside your ears. Place your palms flat on the ground with your fingers facing your toes., To achieve this, you need to push with your legs to get your legs, hips, back, and chest off the ground. At the same time, use your arms to push your head, neck, and shoulders off the ground as well.









If you have trouble pushing into bridge, try tucking your feet in closer to your body and placing your feet farther apart.

, As your body comes off the ground, round your back so that your body forms a semi-circle. Straighten your elbows without locking them, and keep your knees slightly bent.









When in bridge, your head should be tucked in between your upper arms. Try to focus your gaze on a spot on the ground in between your hands., Before you let your body relax, tuck your chin into your chest to protect your spine and neck as you come down.Then, bend your elbows and slowly lower your body to the ground, keeping the weight evenly distributed between your feet and hands.









As you lower yourself down, place your bottom on the ground first before letting everything else come down.

, The backbend into bridge is the most advanced version of the bridge. To execute this move, you start in a standing position and slowly bend backward until your hands come to the ground and you're in bridge position.


To begin, stand up with your feet planted firmly on the ground, shoulder-width apart.As you become better at backbends, you can bring your feet in closer together when you perform this exercise.

, As you lean backward, you will rely on your arms to eventually catch the ground and support your bridge, so you need your arms fully extended as you lean back.








, Slowly, and with control, round your back as you lean backward, moving your arms and head at the same pace. As you lean, make sure your gaze follows where you're going, so that you can see better and don’t get dizzy.









If you have trouble executing this or are nervous, practice in front of a wall, so that when you start leaning back, you can catch the wall with your hands and slowly walk your way down to the ground., Whether you walked down a wall or executed a full backbend, place your hands on the ground as soon as you can reach.









Don’t let your chest or back collapse: stay in the rounded back position to hold bridge pose.

, You can come down from bridge pose as usual by lowering yourself down slowly. Or, for people with more flexibility, you can also exit bridge pose by walking back up the wall with your hands or pulling yourself out of the pose the same way you got into it.








, The other way to exit bridge is by kicking your body back into a forward facing position.To do this:


Bend your knees more and bring your feet in closer to your body. Push your head farther through your arms so that you're looking at your feet.
Stand on your toes and transfer your weigh to your non-dominant foot. Raise your dominant foot off the ground to about knee-height.
With your non-dominant foot, push off the ground as you kick your dominant foot up and over your head, followed by your other foot. Place your dominant foot on the ground when it reaches and then your other foot as it comes around, and from there you can stand up.

Have your bra fitted.,
Wear a minimizer bra instead.,
Wear darker colors.,
Wear the right top.,
Choose the right fabric.,
Wear jackets and cardigans.,
Avoid long necklaces.,
Don't wear tight blouses.,
Wear scarves.",How to Make Large Breasts Look Smaller1," Wearing a bra that fits is one of the easiest ways to improve your bust overall. Your bra cup should cover most of your breast and rest across the back in a straight line. The straps should not do the supporting; the band should support the majority of the weight. Go see a bra specialist to be fitted.


Go to a store that offers bras in a wide range of sizes, specifically sizes beyond DD. This is extremely important when finding the right fitting bra for you. Many stores will try to sell you what they have, and a lot of department stores only have the common sizes, which don't fit every body type.Don't stress over the fit of your bra. You might find out you're a 32E instead of 34DD. That's okay. A proper fitting bra is more important than the letter and number. A proper bra will make you look better, which can help boost your confidence.
Keeping your breasts well supported and lifted helps give you the appearance of a waist by increasing the length of your torso.
Have yourself fitted occasionally to make sure you're always fitted properly.;
, Minimizer bras redistribute your breast tissue, which helps it appear you've taken a couple inches off your bust line. The important thing about minimizer bras is that they don't flatten your breasts.Minimizer bras help clothes fit better while you still remain comfortable. They help button up blouses not gap open, and help reduce the size of your cleavage when wearing turtlenecks.

, Just like wearing solid dark colors will slim the look of your body, they will also minimize the impact of your breasts.


A well-fitted black blazer is a great all-around business look. A black dress for evening wear slims you, accessorizes well, and is always in style.
Go for a darker top with a bright skirt or pair of pants and eyecatching shoes.

, The blouses and sweaters you wear can go a long way to minimizing your bust. No matter what style you choose, you want to think about avoiding any cut, color, or pattern that emphasizes the size of your breasts.


Wear V-necks. Make sure the neckline stops right at your cleavage. Also try scoop necks, boat necks, or sweetheart necks. The key is to make sure the neckline doesn't plunge too deep. Deep cut necklines draw attention to your breasts.Don't wear anything with too many ruffles or flounces.Don't completely rule out horizontal stripes or boxy tops. Try a boxy top that hangs straight from your chest without ballooning. Wearing horizontal stripes in a looser fit will also detract some of the attention from your breasts. Try a cropped length to avoid a tented, baggy look.Avoid low-cut tops. A low cut top will frame and maximize large breasts so that it's virtually impossible to keep eyes away from them.

, Certain fabrics draw attention to your bust. Satin, velvet, and chunky knit fabrics can emphasize your bust. Stay clear of sequin tops and halter tops. Instead, wear terry cloth, cashmere, and cotton.When wearing a t-shirt, go for a slouchy fabric like a thick cotton or terry cloth that will drape over your bust and not be too clingy. Wear loose, crew neck t-shirts tucked into the front of a short skirt or boyfriend jeans to avoid the unflattering tent problem while looking stylish at the same time., Cardigans draw the eyes away from your breasts, and their long, straight lines minimize your curves. The layering also helps cover curves you may want to reduce.Wear blazers and jackets open. Don't worry about getting a size large enough for it to button or zip; get a fit for your arms, back, and shoulders that hangs open.The layered look works well with larger breasts. The different sweaters or jackets cut the line of your outfit, taking the attention away from your bust. If your shirt is too low cut, try wearing a cami underneath. It's not only fashionable, but helps cover your cleavage.
Find a jacket that has heavy, structured fabric that draws attention away from your breasts. Motorcycle jackets can work because of the layers of fabric over your chest along with the cropped length.
If lapels on a blazer won't lie properly on your chest, go for a lapel-free style.
When buying coats, go for a single-breasted style., They draw the eye downward and to your chest. Instead, opt for no necklace or a choker. Another great style is large, statement necklaces. Go for necklaces with multiple pieces or strands of beads/gemstones., Popping buttons with gaping holes draw the eye right to your breasts. Tight patterned fabrics or tight t-shirts stretch over your breasts, usually distorting the patterns on the shirt. Go for fitted shirts, but not skin tight.


Also avoid shirts too baggy. Shirts that are too loose can be unflattering. Go for shirts that are fitted to your shape.

, Draping a scarf around your neck is not only stylish and warm, but can also help diminish the size of your breasts. Try pairing it with a jacket or cardigan or jersey knit t-shirt.

If you're pear-shaped, you carry more weight around your butt, hips, and thighs. Because your top half is smaller, you want to dress to create balance between the two halves. Avoid super baggy clothing on your bottom half, as that can overwhelm this curvaceous section. Wear more form-fitting skirts and pants, and wear fun tops to attract the eye., If you carry most of your weight in your midsection, this is your body type. By drawing the eye to other features, such as your arms, legs, chest, and so on, you can create balance between your midsection and the rest of your body. Try tops that show a bit of skin on the shoulders and chest. Wear tailored skirts or pants to make your body look more sleek and smooth., Cone-shaped girls have larger shoulders and bust, with smaller lower sections.

There is nothing wrong with embracing a flowy, boho style, but try on other options too. You may like something you never expected to!You don’t need to buy any of the clothing you try, and you don’t need to show anyone. Just try to be open-minded about other styles of clothing.
Remember, you won’t know how something looks on you unless you give it a try.

, You can dress according to your body type and abide by fashion tips, but at the end of the day, you should show off whatever you want to show off! If you love your shoulders, expose them in a plunging off the shoulder top. If you love your backside, wear a formfitting skirt to boast your behind. You know better than anyone what you’re working with, so highlight your best features.

, If you want to wear stripes, opt for thin, light-colored stripes on a darker background. If you particularly love a part of your body, wear fun, bright patterns on other parts to draw attention to it. Don’t be afraid of bright colors – just make sure that the clothing fits appropriately! For a sleek look, try creating monochromatic outfits with various textures., While it's fun to highlight, accentuate, and maximize certain features, try not to worry about minimizing others. If there's an area of your body that you may not love as much as others, try something radical and show that area off! Dress to make yourself feel happy and confident, not to follow fashion ""rules"" or to hide your body.

, Soft, shiny hair is a gorgeous accessory. To keep your hair healthy, make sure you’re treating it healthy. Don’t shampoo it too often, as this can strip it of its moisturizing, natural oils. Use hot tools sparingly, and always use a heat protectant. Let your hair air dry whenever you can, but when you can’t, use a medium to cool setting on your hair dryer.A healthy diet promotes healthy hair.

, When it comes to applying make-up, the goal is to accentuate your natural, gorgeous features. Whether you’re a complete make-up rookie or an aspiring cosmetologist, developing a make-up routine that you enjoy can boost your confidence and help you look gorgeous. Creating flawless-looking skin is the first step.Even out your skin tone with a liquid foundation. With clean hands, dot the product all over your face and blend it in thoroughly with a thick, rounded make-up brush.
Use a concealer to cover up blemishes or discoloration. Use your fingertips to gently tap the product into your skin.
Set everything with a powder. When it comes to this step, less is more. Gently brush the powder over your foundation and concealer, focusing on areas of your face that tend to get oily.

, Most girls have a personal preference when it comes to this step, so feel free to develop your own routine. If you’re brand new to make-up, however, there are a few basic techniques to make your eyes really pop.Apply eyeliner to your top lash line. This will help make your eyes look big and bright, and also make your lashes appear more luscious and thick. The line should be thicker at the outer corner of your eye, gradually thinning out as it moves toward the inner corner.
Curl your eyelashes with an eyelash curler and apply mascara. By curling your lashes away from your eyes, your eyes will look more open. Adding mascara will add volume and intensity to your lashes.

It will add some dimension to your skin, and brighten your entire make-up look.Choose a color that looks and feels natural to you. Depending on your skin tone, this might be a bubble gum pink, a peach, or a bronze color.
Use a soft blush brush to apply this to the apples of your cheeks, gently sweeping it upwards towards your ears. Blend the blush into your skin softly.

, If you’re surrounded or bombarded with images of girls who look completely different than you, it can be easy to feel like an outsider. It’s important to find relatable role models who inspire you. It doesn’t matter if it’s a plus-size model in a fashion show, a super confident woman you know in real life, a teacher, a family member, or a body positivity spokesperson – just find someone who helps you love yourself.

, If there are certain things you don’t like about yourself, you’re most likely the only one who notices. If you can forget about your little “flaws,” others will too. If you’re having a great time and embracing what you have to offer, other people will be attracted to that.

, As cliché as it may sound, you only live once. Don’t waste your time worrying about a few extra pounds or trying to conform to a certain expectation. Embrace your body, and remember that it is completely beautiful in all of its uniqueness. When you feel confident, worthy, and gorgeous in your own skin, you will look like it too!

Choose the proper grey.,
Wear light grey with dark colors.,
Pair dark grey with softer hues.,
Keep it neutral.,
Combine your grey with bold prints.,
Choose grey clothing with fun textures.,
Opt for a fun cut.,
Add a bright accessories.",How to Wear Grey," If you have cool undertones, you can rock virtually any shade of grey. If you have warm undertones, you’ll need to be a bit more careful to ensure that the grey doesn’t wash out your face. Keep your skin looking bright by wearing grey on the bottom half of your body, or by limiting grey to accessories.Of course, you can play around with different shades and fabrics, and at the end of the day, just wear whatever you feel great in.


If your skin is cool-toned, that means it has tones of pink, red, or blue. An easy way to determine this is by looking at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they look blue, you're cool-toned.
If your skin is warm-toned, it is more peachy or gold. If the veins on the underside of your wrist look more green, you're warm-toned.;
, If your grey piece is on the lighter end of the spectrum, get bold and pair it with a darker color. Jewel tones, like a deep purple, ruby, or a striking royal blue work extremely well with grey. Because light grey alone can look a little drab, pairing it with a more intense color will add balance to your outfit and keep it interesting.

, This comes from the same school of thought as the tip above! To keep the balance in your outfit, lighten up your dark grey with softer, less intense colors. Consider a dark grey sweater paired with a light pink necklace, or a deep grey dress with a baby blue scarf. Contrasting these lighter colors against the darker shade of grey will help make sure your outfit isn’t too dark and dreary.

, For a sleek and more formal look, pair your grey with nude. Try styling a grey dress with nude heels, or pairing an off-white ensemble with grey accessories. You don’t have to mix your grey with a fun or bold color to have an eye-catching outfit. Create a refined, sophisticated look by keeping it all neutral.Because grey comes in all different shades and often has hints of different colors, it can truly go with almost any color. The main thing to be wary of is wearing multiple shades of grey at once. If you're going to combine greys, keep them the same shade.

, Because this color provides such a good, neutral foundation, add some excitement to your outfit by combining it with fun patterns. Throw on a bright polka dot shirt with your grey pants to add some flair. Throw a paisley cardigan over a grey dress to give it a pop of excitement. The great thing about grey is that it can work with virtually any pattern.

, If you’re worried about a grey outfit looking drab, add dimension with fun textures. Look for grey pieces with lace, ribbing, leather, suede, fringe– anything that’s different!This adds a bit of edge to your outfit, while still being sophisticated and posh with the beautiful neutral color.

, Because it’s such a basic color, you can pick pieces with a dramatic hem. Show skin with short skirts, cropped shirts, or fun cut-outs. You certainly won’t look plain or dreary if your grey outfit has a daring cut or creates an exciting silhouette., Nothing breaks up an all-grey outfit like a single pop of color, whether it be a bright red purse or a pair of cobalt blue shoes. Grey goes with everything, so don’t be afraid to grab your brightest and boldest accessory. By changing up the pieces you add to an outfit, you can style one dress in dozens of different ways!


You can also wear a bright lipstick for the same effect."

Decide if you want a long or short binder.,
Put on your binder.,
Adjust your chest to fit your binder.,
Use tips and tricks to make binder wearing more effective and comfortable.,
Practice safety while wearing your binder.",How to Bind Your Chest1," There are several companies online that design binders specifically for trans men. There are also trans men who sell used binders that either no longer fit or aren't of any use to them. You may also be able to purchase a binder from your local sex positive merchant.


Binders are not only used for trans men but also for males who have gynecomastia. You can find binders that specialize in helping men with gynecomastia.
If you can't afford a binder, there are many programs that you can apply for to receive cheap or free binders. However, most of these exchange programs are geared towards helping low income trans men when they're transitioning.;
, If you know your bra size, most merchants will be able to help you convert your bra size to a binder size. If you're buying online, a chart or online conversion tool may be available on the merchant's website.


It's important to get the right fit for your binder. A binder is not always comfortable to wear but you should always be able to breathe when you're wearing it. You should never feel restricted to a point that you can't.

, Short binders end right at your waist, or underneath your bust. Long binders reach several inches past your waist and about an inch before your belly button (depending on your body type).


Long binders tend to roll up and may need adjustment, while short binders stay unrolled easier. A binder that rolls can cause unsightly lines to show through your clothing. A way to counteract this problem is to fold up an inch from the bottom of your binder to stop it from rolling.
Choose a long or short binder based on your body type and the comfort of your fit. If you have a heavier body type, you may benefit more with a long binder as it will not roll up as often.

, Binders are put on differently than regular bras or sports bra. Start by:


Putting your binder inside out and upside down.
Step into your binder and pull the bottom up towards your head to your waist.
Use the shoulder sleeves to pull the binder outside.
Put your arms through the sleeves.
Pull out the bottom of your binder for it to lay flat. Some people will leave it folded to prevent the binder from rolling up when they're out and about.

Push your breasts down to achieve a flatter look. Reach your hand into you binder and push your breasts down to lay them flat.
Trim or alter parts of your binder to prevent bulging or chafing. Your binder may be too long or it may fit too close to your armpit. With a scissors, needle, and some thread, you can alter the binder to fit you better.
Alter the fit by adding velcro, spandex, or other materials to your binder. Maybe the bottom of your binder is too snug but everything else fits perfectly or the bottom rolls up all the time. You can add velcro or spandex to the bottom of your binder to help.

, For some people, a binder may not be enough, especially if you have a larger bust size. Or a binder is too uncomfortable or inconvenient to wear. Some tips to better your experience with binder wearing are:


Wear a shirt underneath your binder. It makes wearing a binder more comfortable and reduces the possibility of your binder moving around.
Wear layers of clothes to get a flatter look. Loose or baggy clothes can help you disguise the look of a bust.
Check the mirror for a better view of your chest. It may look bigger when you look down on it. So adjust your appearance based on what you see in the mirror.
Move, slouch, sit, and jump around when you're trying on your binder. It may look good while you're standing up, but it might feel or look differently when you start moving.
Apply cornstarch or baby powder on your body before putting on your binder to absorb moisture or sweat. Some binders may not be breathable and cause you to sweat in hot weather or when you're exerting yourself. Cornstarch and baby powder can help prevent your skin from getting irritated from the tightness of the binder.

, It is extremely important to wear a binder safely to protect your body from permanent health issues and damage. An extremely tight binder can result in restricted breathing, broken ribs, damage to chest tissue overtime, and cause fluid build-up in your chest.Do not wear your binder for more than 8-12 hours. If you wear your binder for long periods of time, you risk bruising and restricting oxygen to you body.
Chest binding is only a short-term solution. Long-term chest binding can cause permanent tissue damage. If you plan to bind your chest daily for any reason, consider looking into safer long-term options.
Never sleep with your binder on. Wearing a binder at night can affect your breathing and/or cause skin irritation.

Move around in your sports bra when you're trying it on by bending, slouching, jumping, and sitting. This gives you an idea of how your sports bra will fit and feel when you're in motion. It might feel and look good while you're standing up, but it might feel differently when you're moving in it throughout the day.
Look for bras that are made of spandex. Spandex is both stretchy and form-fitting at the same time.
Don't wear a sports bra for too long if it is particularly tight. The general rule for most chest binding methods is to wear the garment for no more than 8 hours.

, If one sports bra doesn't do the trick, try putting on two to better flatten your chest. You can try:


Putting the first sports bra on regularly and the second one on backwards.
A larger size for your second sports bra. If the second bra is too hard to put on over the first one, go up a size and see how it fits and feels.

, With any method of binding, it's always important to do it safely. Tight or long-term binding can cause permanent tissue damage, respiratory problems, bruising, and broken ribs.


Do not use ACE or elastic bandages over your sports bras. Any type of chest binding with bandages can be dangerous, causing damage to your breast tissue, lungs, and ribs.
Never wear your sports bra to sleep.
Only bind your chest for a maximum of 8 hours.
Get fitted for a sports bra. A professional can help you find a bra that fits you better and flattens your chest for effectively.

Put the waist trimmer on your chest.,
Cut the trimmer to fit your chest.,
Apply lotion and baby powder to reduce irritation.,
Practice safety while wearing a waist trimmer as a binder.",How to Bind Your Chest3," Wrap it around so that the velcro fold falls under one of your arms.


Neoprene waist trimmers work as compression wear to improve blood circulation for people who are exercising. They are also worn to give a better and trimmer-looking waist for people who aren't.

, If your waist trimmer is too long for your chest, cut the end without the velcro with scissors to fit your bust. You don't want to double wrap your chest which could create the opposite effect you want.


If the trimmer is poking at your sides or under your arm, cut the corners of the trimmer into a smooth curve with scissors.

, The neoprene trimmer can cause chafing and extra moisture to build up on and around your bust. Sprinkle from baby powder before wearing your trimmer to help absorb the excess moisture. Put on lotion after you take off your trimmer regularly to protect your skin from chaffing and drying out.


Don't put on lotion and baby powder at the same time or while you're wearing your trimmer. You could damage your trimmer and the combination of lotion and powder could make a paste.

, It is extremely important when binding your chest to do it safely and protect your body from permanent health issues and damage. An extremely tight trimmer can result in restricted breathing, broken ribs, damage to chest tissue overtime, and cause fluid build-up in your chest.


Do not wear a trimmer for more than 8 hours. If you wear your trimmer for long periods of time, you risk bruising and restricting oxygen to you body.
Never sleep with your trimmer on.
Do not put bandages or duct tape over your trimmer. In fact, never use duct tape or bandages to flatten your chest. These tactics restrict movement and oxygen to enter to your body.

Layer shirts over your binding.,
Wear clothes that will draw attention away from your chest, or make it appear flatter.,
Wear sports compression wear.",How to Bind Your Chest4," This is very effective if you've already bound your chest. It is also an alternative if you don't have anything to bind with. A tight t-shirt or tank top under some loose shirts or a button up can make your chest look smaller. You can further enhance the illusion of a smaller chest area by:

,


Wear patterns or colours that distract the eye from your chest. Shirts with regular patterns (like plaid) can emphasize the fact that there's something underneath, whereas irregular patterns, like camouflage, will break up outlines and make them harder to see. Depending on the shirt, shirts with a logo right across your chest may make your bust more or less noticeable. Details that cover the entire shirt are stiff and will make your front appear flatter. Darker colored shirts hide shadows to make your chest seem smaller.
Wear scarves, vests, and ties. These garments help cover or distract others from looking at your chest.
Wearing clothes with pockets on the chest. Instead of looking at your chest, the eye may be drawn to your pocket. This is most effective if the shirt is loose hanging.
Wearing hoodies. Hoodies are usually quite loose fitting. An oversized hoodie over a tight tank can hide your chest quite well.

, Sports compression wear is mainly worn to improve blood circulation when exercising or to help relieve tension in muscles after working out. These form-fitting garments can be found in your local sportswear retail store.


The same effect can be achieved by wearing a tight swimming suit top. However, the swimming suit might need to be several sizes smaller for it to take effect and trimmed along the elastic hems to relieve pressure on your extremities."

Clothing should mirror your shape; avoid anything too tight or too loose.,
Plus-sized clothing doesn’t always mean a plus-sized price tag.",How to Look Wonderful While Being Plus Sized1,"


Well fitting bras and panties are a must to avoid awkward lumps and bumps under clothing. Take the time to get measured at a specialty store to get under garments tailored to your shape.
Try shape-wear for under skirts, dresses, and blouses to smooth your stomach and thighs. Many offer variations of camisoles and shorts to fit your needs.
Don’t be afraid to indulge yourself with a pretty lacy bra or pair of panties. Feel confident about what you have on underneath it all.;

Outfit yourself with at least one pair of good fitting jeans, simple t-shirts, button-up blouses, a pretty skirt, and a few plain cardigans.
Solid colors and low-maintenance patterns are good to have in any style of clothing, and are flattering to all wearers.
Layering creates interest and is easy to do. Top off any outfit with a simple sweater or jacket for added depth.

Black is the most slimming of shades, but don’t rely on it too much. Find clothing in colors you prefer, no matter the hue.
Often time’s plus-sized women are warned of the woes of wearing white; ignore that! White can be flattering to any size woman when worn in a flattering style.
Don’t hide under dull colors. Just because a color may be dark or smoggy doesn’t mean it makes you look smaller; contrariwise, bright colors don’t necessarily make you stand out or appear larger.

Shapeless clothing is exactly that – shapeless. Don’t wear loose-fitting clothing to try to hide your body. The baggy layers will end up making you appear larger.
Your clothes should fit your body, but not cling. Anything too tight will accentuate any unflattering bumps you may have.
Search for clothing with ruching and wrapping-patterns. These will fashionably cover up any problem areas you may be concerned about.
Tailors are an oft-forgotten but incredibly handy tool. Don’t be afraid to take an article of clothing you love and get it altered to better fit your shape.

Maintain wardrobe diversity.",How to Change Your Style," Before making a style change, you should first consider what works and doesn’t work for you about your current style.


In particular, consider why you have the current style that you have. For example, is your style primarily jeans and t-shirts because you don’t like having to spend a lot of time thinking about outfits to put together? If so, the new style you choose will need to be simple and easy enough to work for you.
Trying to impose a new style on yourself that doesn’t mesh well with you, your habits, and your attitude will most often fail, so think carefully about what you need as well as want out of a style before committing.;
, Once you know your style needs, start thinking about the kind of style that will both meet those needs and represent the new kind of appearance you want to adopt.


To give your new style goal a clear direction, be as specific and descriptive as you can when envisioning the aesthetic you want. Some examples might include “laid-back hipster,” “brightly colored retro,” “modern punk,” etc.
Choosing a fashion muse can be a helpful tool in shaping your new style, so look for people (famous or otherwise) whose style inspires you and embodies how you’d like your new look to be. Write down how they style certain pieces that you like. For example, does she pair a skater skirt with that leather jacket? This can help when choosing your outfits.

, In addition to thinking about how you want to look, think about how you need to look. Some questions to ask yourself:


What’s your work or school environment? Are there any particular practical constraints on what you can permissibly wear?
What’s your social environment? How will your style best complement your lifestyle?
Where do you live? Do you want to fit in with or stand apart from your surroundings, and to what degree? Does one form of weather dominate, and will you style be workable in that weather?
What’s your budget? Make sure your new style goal is realistic, otherwise you may find yourself frustrated and unable to achieve what you had in mind.
How much time do you want to spend getting ready? If you’re a low-maintenance person by nature, choosing an elaborate style may not fit well with the kind of routine you’re comfortable with.
Don’t be afraid to have an aspirational style--in other words, don’t be afraid to start dressing like the person you want to be--but also be realistic and choose a style that’s compatible with your personality.

, Once you have your new style goal lined up, you need to then clear out the old one.Go through every item of clothing and donate the pieces that don’t fit the new model you’ve chosen, that no longer fit, or that are simply unflattering. You may want to recruit a trusted friend to help you make judgment calls.
If you wear makeup, similarly go through your supplies and eliminate any that are dated or won’t enhance the style you’re going for.

, The foundation of any style is versatile basics, and though the kinds of basics suited to your style will vary depending on the look you’re aiming for, commonly needed basics include:


Shirts in solid colors. Depending on your style, your basic shirts might be t-shirts, button-ups, polos, or camisoles, etc., but whatever they may be, your basic shirts will be the essential layering staples of your style.
Black pants. These are essential to most any wardrobe and are versatile enough that you can dress them up for formal occasions or down for more casual situations. Look for a cut of pant that is both modern and flattering to your specific shape.
Flattering jeans. Darker wash jeans are often most flattering and versatile, but it will again depend on your particular style. Whatever jeans you choose, though, be sure they fit and flatter you. Don’t be afraid to spend some time searching out the perfect pair.
Sweaters or cardigans in solid colors. Like shirts, sweaters are an important layering component. Whether you prefer luxury sweaters or retro cardigans, you should have at least a few different ones on hand to build outfits with.
A versatile skirt and dress. If skirts and dresses are part of your style, you want to be sure you have at least one of each in a versatile color and shape, like a black pencil skirt or a neutral wrap dress.

, Clothes that fit well and flatter your body are essential to successful style.


For women’s clothing, make sure that pants aren’t too small for your waist or too short for your height and that they don’t bunch or bulge anywhere. Be sure that tops fit so that the shoulder seems sit squarely on your shoulders, there isn’t any gapping between buttons, sleeves come down just below your wrist, and the fabric doesn’t bunch or bulge around your hips.For men’s clothing, be sure that shirts fit squarely on your shoulders, the sleeve hits just below your wrist without bunching, and that the shirt torso (particularly if it’s a button-up shirt) lies flush with your waist and doesn’t bunch or puff out at the sides. Pants should not be so loose that they billow out around your legs, but they should also not be so tight that they hug the leg--instead, they should be just loose enough to lie comfortably next to the leg without awkward bunching or puffing. Suit jackets should be able to button without stretching and should lie flush with the shoulder so that there’s a smooth transition from shoulder to arm with no wrinkling or bunching.When shopping online, be sure you have your most recent measurements. For men, you’ll need your height, waist, and inseam. Having your hip measurement can also be helpful for finding a precise fit. For women. you’ll need your height, bust, natural waist (the slimmest part of your torso), actual waist (where your pants sit), hips, and inseam. Always check your measurements against the retailer’s sizing chart, don’t just rely on size alone, which varies among brands., Decide which colors most flatter your skin tone and eyes and work within that palette.


A new style that doesn’t flatter you won’t serve you any better than your old one.
To determine your most flattering colors, bring a trusted friend shopping with you and then try on clothes in a wide range of colors and have that friend help you judge which are most flattering for you.

, Accessories allow you to make a look specifically yours, so finding the right pieces for your style will help you fine-tune the tone and look of your personal style.


Accessories allow you to add nuance to your outfits, so think about the subtle aspects you want to communicate with your style when buying them. For example, accessories can add understated elegance, bold confidence, or funky humor to your overall style.
The basic accessory line-up includes belts, jewelry, hats, scarves, and glasses. Each of these, either singly or in combination, can change the focal point of an outfit, add a pop of color, or take an outfit from casual to office-appropriate to dressed-up, so shop strategically..

, Once you’ve gathered the basics of your look, begin building a balanced selection you can draw from to suit your most common needs, eg, office wear, casual wear, date wear, club wear, etc.Avoid buying multiples of the same. Don’t buy three black sweaters, for example, or four white t-shirts. Even if they aren’t identical, you don’t want to have too many of the same kind of piece--it will stifle your style and take up unnecessary closet space.
Avoid fixating on the same color. Don’t buy all of your clothes in the same color--it will quickly run your style into a monotone rut. It’s fine to work within a flattering color palette, just don’t fixate on a single color.

, As you continue adding pieces to your wardrobe, keep your fashion model fresh in your mind.


If you need a visual aid, design your own personal lookbook that includes images that embody your style model and can help guide you in your choices.
Make a list of what you’re looking for. Showing up at a store without a clear idea of which specific items you’re looking for can leave you directionless and may lead you to making purchases you’ll regret or to giving up in frustration. But with a clear sense of what you’re after, you can consistently add items to your wardrobe with confidence and efficiency.

, Before choosing an item, be sure that it fits into your style model and that it will be a useful part of a versatile wardrobe.


Avoid super trendy items, which likely won’t be useful to your wardrobe for more than a single season and afterward will only date your look. .
Have a good mix of neutral and statement colors. Mixing neutral pieces with a bright pop of color is a great way to make a stylish impression.
Make sure each new piece you buy could be part of at least several different outfits.

, To get the most mileage out of your wardrobe, shop with versatility, not just style or color, in mind.


The new pieces you add should fit your style, flatter your body, and add versatility to your wardrobe.
If you're eyeing a piece of clothing that already resembles an item you have in your wardrobe, don't buy it. Look for something complementary but also different from your current pieces to ensure your wardrobe doesn't devolve into too much of the same.
When buying tops, ask yourself whether a particular top can be worn in different ways as part of different outfits. For example, when selecting a top, ask questions like, can I wear it tucked in or loose? Can I layer it? etc. When choosing a skirt, ask questions like, can I wear it with different shoes (heels, boots, flats)? Can I wear it with both casual and fancier tops? Can I layer a jacket with it? etc. "

Maintain good hygiene.",How to Avoid Looking Inappropriate for the Office (for Women)," While the idea of “office wear” typically summons up images of business suits and patent leather heels, dress codes among companies actually vary greatly. Some companies prefer that their employees maintain more formal appearances, while other companies allow employees to dress casually, five days a week. Don’t be shy to ask the hiring manager about the dress code before your first day of work.When in doubt, overdress! It's much better to be the only woman in a dress and heels on the first day of work, rather than the only woman in jeans. Dressing up shows that you take the job seriously, while under-dressing can give the impression that you don’t care as much.;
, If you are expected to wear business suits every day, you need to invest in some fitted, high quality pieces. You don’t need to buy a new outfit for every day of the week, but it’s important to have some neutral-colored, “go to” items that you know are office-appropriate and you can easily mix and match.Even if your office is casual, it’s still important that you present yourself appropriately at your place of work. Ripped jeans, dirty sneakers, and belly-baring shirts are fine for the weekend, but keep a drawer stocked with modest, casual clothing specifically for the office.

, Again, every office has a different dress code, but this is a great rule of thumb. Make sure that your chest is fully covered when you head off to work.Not only is cleavage inappropriate in the office, but it’s also inconvenient to be holding your shirt up every time you reach for a paper or open a drawer! When it comes to tops, opt for ones with sleeves. To avoid looking inappropriate at your office, modest tops are your best bet.


Don’t confuse “modest” for “frumpy.” There is no shortage of trendy, fun tops that still keep you covered and appropriate for work.
If you want to be taken seriously, let your work performance do the talking. If people are distracted by your voluptuous cleavage, they probably won’t notice the great work you’re doing.
If you have a closet full of sleeveless tops that you want to wear, throw a cardigan or blazer on over top. These can easily take a top from backyard barbeque to board meeting.

, Nothing says professional like a great fitting blazer. Avoid boxy, “masculine” suits that mask your figure with hard, straight lines. Instead, find a blazer that slightly hugs your body while still giving you ample room to move. Pairing a crisp blazer with a floral top or a sweet dress can help you look work-appropriate and dainty at the same time.Pick up a blazer in the colors that you wear most often, such as black, cream, or navy, to get the most use out of it.
When it comes to blazers, and all work clothes for that matter, you get what you pay for. Cheap clothing can seem like a bargain, but fall apart after a few washes. Loose strings, frayed hems, and holes can turn the most perfect, appropriate office outfit into a disaster.

, This bit of advice may sound antiquated, but it will ensure that you don’t look inappropriate at the office. Mini skirts and flirty dresses are fantastic, but they have no place at work. Make sure that your skirts and dresses hit at the knee or below. If you’re worried about looking unfashionable or overly modest, just make sure your skirts and dresses are properly tailored. You can show off your womanly curves while making sure your hemline is appropriate.Depending on just how formal your office is, you may need to slip on a pair of nude or black tights under your skirt.

, The word “slacks” may conjure up a picture of some repulsive, passé trousers, but don’t write them off just yet! Form-fitting, structured black pants are perfect office attire, and you can pair them with almost any type of top, blazer, or sweater. You can wear them through most seasons, and you won’t have to worry about hosiery or hemlines (or shaving your legs)!If the pants are a bit long, get them hemmed before wearing them. Scruffy, frayed hems do not look office-appropriate.

, Regardless of the footwear that your job calls for, you need to make sure that you can wear them for the duration of your workday. Ditch the sky-high heels for some more appropriate pumps or ballet flats. Stick to close-toed shoes to ensure you look appropriate.Some offices permit sandals or even sneakers, but just make sure you confirm this beforehand. Just like with your clothing, it’s better to be safe than sorry. For example, unless you've seen your boss wearing flip flops, don't wear flip flops!
If you have a long commute, you can bring an extra pair of shoes. Some women prefer wearing comfortable walking shoes to and from work, and popping on a pair of heels for the work day.

, Statement necklaces, clunky bangles, or giant hoop earrings can be a lot of fun to wear, but leave them at home. The most work-appropriate jewelry consists of pieces that add a little sparkle, but don’t blind. Delicate necklaces, stud earrings, watches, and other unobtrusive pieces can help pull a look together without distracting observers. Less is more!, Cross-body bags, colorful totes, and backpacks can be great for other things, but a sleek, structured bag is perfect for the office. Make sure that it can fit everything you need for a full day of work, because it won't look appropriate if your bag is bursting at the seams and spilling all over your desk space.


You can spend a good deal of money on a designer bag for work, or you can check discount stores for a steal. The only nonnegotiable criteria for a work bag is that it looks clean and in good condition.

, The key to keeping your makeup office-appropriate is to remember that you should only be enhancing your natural features. Appropriate makeup can actually help to give you a neat and professional appearance.Neon blue eye shadow and hot pink lipstick doesn’t exactly create an au natural appearance, so leave that look for after hours. Instead, opt for neutral colors that only highlight your own beautiful features.


Unless you need the full coverage of a foundation, use a simple tinted moisturizer to even out your skin tone. This will even out your complexion while still being light and fresh-looking.Rub some light concealer under your eyes to remove dark circles.
Use mascara to accentuate your eyelashes while making your eyes look bright. Avoid dark eye shadows and eyeliners, as they can appear dramatic and inappropriate for the office environment. Nude or very light eye shadows are acceptable.
Limit your lipstick or lip gloss to natural colors. Make sure you bring it with you so you can re-apply throughout the day.

, You don’t need to create a fancy up-do every day before work, but it’s important to make sure your hair looks polished and tidy every day. It is inappropriate and distracting to have hair hanging down over your eyes and face. If you wear your hair down, make sure it’s tucked behind your ears or held back with a headband. To get it away from your face, a simple bun or ponytail is fine.Dry shampoo works wonders if your hair is prone to becoming limp and greasy, and you don’t want to shampoo it daily. Spritz a little in your hair before work and it will look clean and smell great.

, The importance of this office etiquette cannot be overstated. It is extremely inappropriate to come to work without brushing your teeth, combing your hair, or taking a shower. No one wants to be in close quarters with someone who did not have the common courtesy to clean themselves up.


Wear deodorant. It doesn’t matter if you don’t think you’ll sweat. Wear deodorant.
Use perfume and body spray sparingly. Even if you love the scent, it can be overwhelming when you’re in a small office, especially if everyone else is also wearing scented sprays.
Brush your teeth before work, and bring your toothbrush or mouthwash with you for after lunch. Oral hygiene is especially crucial if you’re talking with co-workers or customers all day.

, They can be found at any bookstore. Typically, they have a beautiful, well-dressed model or celebrity on the front cover. Pick one up and flip through it observantly. Times have changed, huh?

, Celebrities often double as fashion icons, prancing around in the latest fashions. Don't waste times on seeing what celebrities wear to major formal events (an expensive gown won't necessarily update your look). Instead, try to find out what they're wearing on a day-to-day basis.

, You don't have to throw out every piece of clothing to update your look. There are some things that never go out of style(cardigans, blouses, fitted t-shirts) and some things that might be back in style (e.g. bell bottom jeans--those with flared legs--were big in the 70s, then fell out of favor during the 80s, and returned, though not as dramatically, in the 90s and have been lingering ever since).A lot of people favor the skinny jeans these days. The key to updating your look is knowing the difference. Plus, there are certain things that are out and that you should never wear again, if you want to have an updated look (e.g. tie dye).

, These days, almost anything goes. Just remember to go with a haircut that accents your face, and a color that makes your skin glow and pop. Remember to be upfront with the hairdresser. A silent client could end up regretting the change.

Sort out the clothes that can most easily be turned into fashionable clothes.",How to Turn Old Clothes Into Fashionable Outfits," Examples are plain tanks and tees, old jeans and other pants. Clothes that look slightly worn, have a few holes, small stains, or are slightly too short to fit you, can still be used fairly easily. However, if your clothes are starting to resemble rags or are far too small to fit you, it's probably better to put them in the rag pile or donate them to the salvation army.


Plain tees and tanks: If you have a t-shirt or tank top that looks in a fairly good state, it is very easy to glam it up. Try cutting the sleeves off of your t-shirt or cutting one shoulder out. For a tank top, play around with the sleeves: cut off the straps where they meet at the back, and then tie them around your neck like a halter top. Another idea is cutting them off completely and replacing them with ribbon or braided yarn. For both tanks and tees, you can try splattering it with various shades of ""t-shirt paint"" (available at most craft stores) for an artsy look, or screen-printing a design on (again, ask the workers at your local craft store.) Get a needle and thread and sew a pretty bow onto the front or back, or iron on some sequins. If your t-shirt is too short for you, try layering a camisole or tank-top underneath.






Old jeans and other long pants: These are very easy to work with: just turn them into shorts! Measure out exactly how short you want them to be, and then get a ruler and draw a straight line across each leg. Then take some scissors and cut them off. You may want to turn up the hem to avoid the material fraying. If so, fold up the fabric at the bottom about half an inch, and pin it in place. Then simply sew over it. You can also glam them up a bit, as seen below:






Old shorts: For shorts, try braiding 3 strands of yarn tightly together, and then sewing them onto the bottom. You can also make a braided belt this same way. Add any sequins, embroidery, or even patches of other materials. If you feel that your shorts are a bit too short, you can try wearing them over leggings or tights. You can also get other bits of material and sew them onto the bottom so that they make them look longer.






Holes and stains: If your clothing is holey or stained, try cutting it up some more. Cut out all stains, and around all holes. Add a few more as well, but not too many; it should still look fairly neat. Then just wear a different-colored camisole or tank top underneath. Make sure that the colors compliment each other. If a top is slightly stained all over, you can try dying or bleaching, or wear it under things instead. Try adding other embellishments as well if the top still doesn't appeal to you after you have cut it up. For pants, try wearing them over tights, or even sewing material under the holes. Otherwise, distressed jeans are fashionable.






Worn-looking clothes: Clothes that look work are thrown out all too often. However, the fabric can be cut up and used to add accents to your other clothes. Worn clothing can be worn under see-through clothing and lace. If the clothing is white, try bleaching it to even out the color, and if it is colored, try dying it.






Other clothes: For all other clothes, remember to think of all possibilities of keeping clothes. A hundred years ago, clothes were kept much longer. This was not only because clothes were made of less synthetic materials, but also because they were valued a lot more. In order to save money, and help to protect the environment, it is wise to try to reuse clothes.

Find pretty jewelry to match your style. Avoid pieces that are too small or dainty; they give the appearance of being out of proportion.
Shoes are something you can fit into at a traditional department store. Look for comfortable pairs that offer a pop of color or pattern to enhance your outfits.
Try something new; a belt around the waist highlights an hourglass figure, while a scarf or headband will frame your face.

Keep your locks tamed and styled to add sophistication to your look.
Long hair is flattering no matter your size. If you want to elongate your body, try growing your strands to a length a bit longer than your shoulders.
To show off your upper body, cut your hair in a bob or pixie. These will frame your face and allow for viewing your collar bones, shoulders, and chest.

Keep a balance; don’t wear heavy eyeshadow and bold lip rouge. Instead, focus on either your eyes or your lips.

Choose linens and cottons during the warmer months, especially summer.,
Choose woolens and cashmeres during the colder months, especially winter.,
Mix and match difference textures when wearing an all white outfit to keep things interesting.,
Try getting white fabrics with a simple, colored print.,
Try different shades of white.,
Wear a slip or camisole under transparent whites.",How to Wear White1," Summer is the perfect time to break out your favorite white pants, skirts, and dresses. The bright sun will give your skin that perfect glow, and it will help make your white clothes sparkle even more. You can even try a white cotton or linen blazer during the summer.Try something loose and flowing in the summer, such as peasant blouses or maxi dresses. If you'd like a more streamlined look, wear a wide belt around your waist to cinch in the excess fabric.;
, Yes, you can wear white even during the winter. What really matters, however, is the material. A white, linen dress may look out of place during the winter, but a cozy winter sweater will be everyone's envy. Similarly, white linen or silk pants may look out of place in the winter, but white jeans will look right at home.White parkas and jeans are great for the winter.Other materials that work in winter include: fur, leather, and mohair., There is nothing wrong with pairing white shoes with a white skirt and a white shirt. To keep the outfit looking more interesting, however, try choosing pieces made from different materials. For example, you could try a cotton skirt with lacey top. You could also try a white leather jacket with white slacks. The different materials will help each piece look distinct, and they will keep your outfit from looking too bland.


Some people find that mixing textures when wearing an all-white outfit also creates a slimming effect., If you are hesitant about wearing all white, you could always try something with a bold print. For example, you could try a white dress with a bold, black tribal or chevron print. Your outfit will still be predominantly white, but the pattern will add a touch of color.

, If you are very pale, you may find that white causes you to look washed out. Try a bright, crisp white without any warm or yellow undertones. You can also bring in a pop of color with a colorful accessory, such as a necklace or silk scarf. If you have a darker skin tone, try a warmer white; the contrast will still keep it looking white and bright, but not overly so.Try wearing different shades of white to keep an all-white ensemble interesting. For example, you can pair cool-toned pants and shirts with a warm-toned scarf or vest.Be careful, however; not all shades will match or look good together. Before stepping out, try to get a good look at your outfit in different lights: daylight, indoor light, and so forth., Even if you are wearing skin-toned underwear and bras, transparent whites may reveal more than you'd like to show. When shopping, stick your hand under the fabric to determine whether or not you will need a slip or camisole.If possible, try to take the outfit over to a window, where you can see the transparency in daylight.

Turn on the iron and dampen a cloth.,
Prepare your pants.,
Place the damp cloth over your elastic.,
Iron the elastic.,
Repeat as necessary.",How to Take the Stretch Out of an Elastic in Clothing1," You want your iron on and set to the highest setting. Run a face cloth or hand towel under water until it is damp, but not soaked.;
, You can either pin each side of your pants to the ironing board—stretched to the desired length. Or, you can simply slide the pants around the ironing board until they are the proper width.

, Make sure it completely covers the elastic that you’re trying to stretch out. If needed, use two cloths.

, With the damp cloth on top of your elastic band and your iron on the highest setting, iron over it. Iron for 10 seconds and then let sit for 10 seconds. Continue doing so for 5-10 minutes. This will help your pants fit because as the elastic heats, it will heightens the breaking weight. This means that it will be able to stretch more before reaching its limit., If it hasn’t’ stretch enough, try flipping your elastic band and repeat the process. Do so until you reach your desired fit."

Locate a small tub, baby shampoo and consider using purified water, especially if your home has well water.,
Fill tub with warm water.,
Add a capful of baby shampoo to water and mix until suds form.,
Add sweater to tub and allow it to soak.,
Place sweater in a waiting towel and roll in order to remove excess water.,
Mold sweater back into shape and then lay flat in a cool, dry area.",How to Stretch Sweaters with Baby Shampoo," Most sweaters can endure either a little hand washing, however a quick check of the tag will ensure you won’t destroy the sweater with this washing attempt.;
, Well water can transform the sweater’s color so using bottled, purified or distilled water might be your best bet.

, If the water is too cold, it may not do the job with getting the sweater to stretch; too hot and you may damage the sweater fibers.

, Use your hands to do the mixing, as you want the shampoo to be well distributed throughout the tub water.

, Use your hands to swish sweater around in the water and then allow it to sit in the water for a few minutes (no need to soak this overnight unless you are trying to remove a stain).

, Rolling the sweater in the towel will help to remove residual water.

, Never crumple the sweater or else it will get/smell moldy. Also, a humid area will only harbor bacteria on your sweater so its imperative you locate a place that is cool and dry.

You can instantly make a plain white dress look more chic by pairing it with a thick, red belt. On the other hand, a pastel-colored handbag can bring a touch of color to any white outfit without being too distracting.


Try colorful accessories such as belts, silk scarves, or hand bags.
Jewelry doesn't just have to include rings, necklaces, and earrings. You can also try chunky bangles, statement necklaces, pins or brooches, and watches.
Colorful accessories are perfect for bringing a spark of interest to an all-white outfit., For example, you could try white jeans with a navy blazer or brown loafers. This will keep your outfit from looking too summery. You can wear white blazers in the winter as well, but try to pair them with a dark shirt, such as a black turtleneck, to keep them from looking too summery., If you want to wear all white, such as a white skirt and shirt, but can't find the perfect pair of white shoes, go for silver or nude colored shoes instead. Nude and silver are both considered to be neutral colors. They will keep your outfit looking monochromatic without detracting from it., In the wintertime, this will also have the added benefit of keeping you warm. For example, you could try white jeans with a long-sleeved, white-and-navy stripped shirt. Finish the look off with a navy blazer. For the shoes, you could try something in black or navy., This will keep your shoes from becoming the focus of your outfit. For example, if you are wearing a white dress and black shoes, try adding a black belt."

Tuck the shirt into a pair of white, straight leg pants and put on a pair of black-and-white loafers if you'd like something more chic., Go for a light, neutral color for the sweater, such as beige, tan, or camel.This is a perfect, cozy look for any chilly fall or winter day.

, For the shirt, you could try a black tank top, or a loose-fitting, grey blouse. For a special night out, try the shirt in a different material than the skirt, such as silk., For the pants, try something fitted to balance out the bulk of the peacoat, such as leggings or skinny jeans.

Find a chair.,
Stretch your elastic clothing over your chair.,
Let it sit.",How to Take the Stretch Out of an Elastic in Clothing2," If you have a chair that is the right size to stretch the elastic, that will work perfectly. If you don’t have a chair that’s the right size, you can try using the side of a small table, an empty drawer, or an empty poster frame.

, If you can, line up the sides with the side of the chair. This will help stretch the elastic evenly.

, Let your elastic sit, being stretched, for 24 hours. If the desired size still isn’t reached, put the elastic back in the stretched position and leave it for several days. Leave it in a warm place to help the elastic band stretch."

Cut the elastic.,
Pull the elastic out.",How to Take the Stretch Out of an Elastic in Clothing3," This will make it much easier to work with. Plus, you will be less likely to make an error with your scissors if you can see what you’re doing.

, Sometimes, elastics are sewn into the seam of clothing. If this is the case, you won’t be able to pull the elastic out of them if you cut the somewhere other than the seam. Find the seam by holding on one side of the seam and stretching the other side. If you feel the elastic shift, you are free to cut wherever you’d like. If you feel it snag at the seam, make sure to cut here.

, To remove the elastic band from your clothing, make a slit (around ½”). If the elastic is sewn into the seam, you’ll have to cut the seam the size of the elastic., Use scissors to go through your slit and cut the elastic. Cut through the entire elastic without cutting any more holes in your clothes., Slowly pull the elastic out, being careful not to catch a lose string and bunching your fabric. Once the elastic is out, your clothes are ready to wear.


You can sew the slit closed if you want to, but it’s not a necessary step before you wear your clothes.

Stand with your back straight in front of a full-length mirror.,
Wrap a soft tape measure around your bust.,
Bring the ends together in the center front.,
Place the tape measure around your chest.,
Calculate your bra size.",How to Take Measurements (For Women)1," Having good posture is the key to taking accurate measurements.;
, Take it around your back, across your shoulder blades and under your arms. It should wrap around the fullest part of your bust. The tape should be straight and parallel with the floor.

, Place your thumb beneath the tape measure and keep yourself from pulling too tight, as this could give you an incorrect measurement. Record the measurement. Use a pencil and paper to record the measurement.

, Wrap it so that it rests just under your bust, where your bra band would sit. Record the measurement.

, To figure out your bra size, take your bust and under bust (band) measurements while wearing a bra. Round up your bust size to the nearest whole number, and subtract your band size from your rounded-up bust size. For instance, if you have a 36 inch (91.4 cm) bust, and a 34 inch (86.4 cm) band size, that leaves you with a difference of two inches. Add approximately one cup size for every inch difference.


A difference of one leaves you with an A cup, while a difference of two equals a B cup, three equals a C cup, four equals a D cup, and so on.

Say ""Jag."",
Say ""älskar."",
Say ""dig."",
Combine the words into one phrase: ""Jag älskar dig.""",How to Say I Love You in Swedish1," This word is the subject form of the first-person pronoun (or, in English, ""I""). Swedish grammar isn't exactly the same as in English, but for this phrase, the words are in the same order as in ""I love you,"" so ""I"" goes at the beginning.""Jag"" is pronounced roughly like ""Jah.""Note that the g is silent — the word isn't pronounced ""jog.""
Some Swedish speakers pronounce this word with a Y sound (""Yah"") because of their regional accent. Whether you use a J or a Y sound is a matter of personal preference.;
, In Swedish, this is the present-tense verb form of ""love"". It is made by adding an r to the end of ""älska"" (""to love"").


This word can be tricky for non-Swedes to manage. Roughly, it is pronounced ""elskuh."" The letter ä sounds like the 'e' in ""fell"" (though, in some dialects, it sounds more like the 'a' in ""hang"").The r at the end is more or less silent — if you pronounce it, it should be very light and delicate., This word is the object form of ""you"".


Don't be fooled by the way this word is spelled. ""Dig"" is pronounced almost exactly like the English word ""day."" It shouldn't sound like the English verb ""dig"" at all., Practice saying each word individually until you're confident with all three. When you're ready, put them together. Saying these words in order will give you the Swedish phrase for ""I love you.""


The entire phrase is pronounced as roughly ""Jah elskuh day."" Don't forget that you can also use a Y sound for the first word, giving you ""Yah elskuh day.""

Use et al.,
Use et al.,
Determine whether to use a comma before et al.",How to Use Et Al1," with in-text citations. The intention is to make references shorter and easier to absorb. Aside from authors, this can also apply to characters in a book or novel. In general, it’s used in academic situations or when writing very formally such as in-text citations and parenthetical remarks. If Lewis, Gilbert, and Lamar wrote something about teamwork, the reference could be: ”Lewis et al. (2006) demonstrated teamwork environment is critical to success.”;
, after the last dissimilar author. Cite similar references based upon the first different names. Whenever you have multiple, initial authors that are the same, citation should go to the first dissimilar author. This rule does not apply when the leading authors are different. The following examples demonstrate how to solve the dilemma of nearly identical authors.In 2009, Dobbs, Almond, and Chen wrote Alpha

First citations: (Dobbs, Almond, & Chen, 2009)
Subsequent citations: (Dobbs, Almond, & Chen, 2009)


Dobbs, Almond, Chen, Brown, and Ender wrote Beta

First citations: (Dobbs, Almond, Chen, Brown, & Ender, 2009)
Subsequent citations: (Dobbs, Almond, Chen, et al., 2009)


In 2009, Wilson, Dobbs, and Almond wrote Gamma

All citations are (Wilson, Dobbs, & Almond, 2009), and do not coincide or conflict in any way with the previous two citations because Wilson is the lead author, and different from the lead author (i.e. Dobbs) on the other two.



, There is some confusion and disagreement concerning the usage of a comma before et al. The guidance is based on whether or not the Oxford comma (i.e. the pre-conjunction comma in a list greater than two) is being preferred. In general, however, literally substituting the words “and others” into the phrase can help you make the decision. Use the following examples for guidance:


Not using the Oxford comma, “Moe, Curly, Larry and Shemp” would be “Moe, Curly et al.”
Using the Oxford comma, “John, Paul, George, and Ringo” would be “John, Paul, et al.”

Say ""Jag tycker om dig"" for ""I like you."",
Say ""Jag längtar efter dig"" for ""I long for you."",
Say ""Tack"" when you are complimented.,
Say ""Känner du för en bebis?""",How to Say I Love You in Swedish2," Use this phrase when someone tells you ""Jag älskar dig"" and you feel the same way. ""Med"" can be used as the preposition ""with"" in other situations, but here it means ""too"" or ""also.""""Jag älskar dig med"" is pronounced roughly ""Jah elskuh day mah."" Note that the first three words are exactly the same as in the section above. ""Med"" has a silent d and uses a short a sound (like the a in ""apple""). It sounds like the word ""mad"" with the d removed.

, Just like in English, the meaning of this phrase is slightly different than ""I love you."" You can love close friends, family members, pets, and even objects, but if you're in love with someone, it should definitely be your romantic partner.


This phrase is pronounced ""Jah eh SHAAAHD ee day."" The letter k has ""sh"" or ""ch"" sound when used before some vowels.The r at the end of ""kär"" has a sound like a light d (almost like an r in Spanish).
Finally, note that ""kär"" is emphasized and pronounced for longer than the other words. This is important — in Swedish the length of the sounds you make in a word can be part of its proper pronunciation.

, If you enjoy the time you spend with someone but you're not ready for romance, use this phrase. It carries much less weight than saying you love someone.

The word sounds just like the ""ohm"" sound made by people who are meditating. Stress this word and hold it for slightly longer than the others.
If someone says this to you, you can use ""Jag tycker om dig också"" to say ""I like you too."" This is pronounced the same except for ""också,"" which sounds like ""oak-soh.""

, If you want to impress your romantic partner with a flowery Swedish compliment, try this phrase. It's not the sort of thing you might here Swedes say every day, but it can make a striking impression when used wisely.


This is pronounced ""Jah LAANG-tahd efteh day."" The ä in ""längtar"" gets a long a sound (as in ""ray""). Stress the first syllable of ""längtar"" and hold it for longer than the others.

, Though Swedes generally consider it consulting to give lots of insincere compliments, you're bound to receive at least a few if you're dating.When you do, you can respond politely with ""tack!"" (""thanks!"")


This word is pronounced similarly to the English word ""talk."" Don't stretch out the ""ah"" sound like is common in some English dialects. The word is a single quick, crisp syllable.

, to ask if someone wants a baby. The rough translation here is ""Do you feel like having a baby?"" Use this phrase with caution! You'll only want to pull it out when it's clear you're going to be with someone in the long term (or if it's clear you're joking, of course).


This is pronounced ""SHEEN-eh doo for en behbess?"" Don't forget to stress the first syllable of ""känner,"" which is pronounced with a short e sound (as in ""red"").

Don’t use et al.,
Use et al.,
Apply et al.",How to Use Et Al2," if there are fewer than three authors. For both the first and subsequent in-text citations, both the authors should be listed out as (Dalton & Wade, 1989). The usage of et al. should be avoided because et al. always refers to plural authors, and (Dalton, et al., 1989) would indicate two authors aside from Dalton., on the subsequent citations for three, four, or five authors. Any time you have more than two authors, the potential for using et al. with in-text citation is there. As such, the first citation should spell out all their names, and any subsequent citation can include et al. after the first author. First citation – (Balboa, Creed, & Drago, 1985)
Subsequent citations – (Balboa et al., 1985)

, to all citations of works with six or more authors. Listing six or more authors is cumbersome, even for the initial reference. As such, using et al. allows the shortening of such references universally. For instance, authors Highway, Choozoo, Jones, Fragetti, Profile, and Johanson would be cited in-text as follows: First citation – (Highway et al., 1986)
Subsequent citations – (Highway et al., 1986)

Don’t use et al.",How to Use Et Al3," into work emails. When referring to a group of coworkers, it may be easier to use et al. than list everyone who made a contribution. Keep your audience in mind when using et al. in informal writing. If they are unlikely to understand what it means, substitute “and others” or “and the rest.” The following general writing examples work well:


”We should go to the work overtime this weekend Jim, Jesse, Brian et al. to get the project done.”
”If David et al. get the financing, we can move forward with the prototype.”

, in general, everyday speech. It is generally used with academic writing and doesn’t translate well into speech. Opt to include your entire list or say some shorter English equivalent in place of this Latin abbreviation.Instead of et al., use a variation as in the following examples.


”The Bulls would have lost the game if not for Jordan and the other guards.”
”Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest made it safely to the day care.”

, with a salutation. Most greetings, like “Dear,” are friendly in nature. The usage of et al., which may confuse readers because of usage and/or punctuation, is very stiff in nature, not friendly at all. On top of that, it’s largely uncommon in introductions, and the mere inclusion will have the recipients questioning whether the usage is proper.Try substituting an appropriate plural word for the group you’re addressing, instead of forcing et al. into a greeting.

Decide if you should get a short, regular, or a long suit.,
Pick your suit size ranging from sizes 36-54.,
Pants are sized based on the ""chest sizing."",
Make sure the suit jacket isn't too wide.,
Make sure that the proportions of the jacket are correct.,
Be sure that your suit jacket isn't too long.,
Make sure that the suit isn't too loose.,
Check that your pants are not too long.",How to Tell if a Suit Fits," This will depend on your height and the length of your limbs. If you have particularly long or short arms/legs, you might want to consider a long or short despite your height.



Short (S) is for men roughly shorter than 5'7.

Regular (R) is for men roughly between 5'8 and 5'10.

Long (L) is for men roughly taller than 5'11.

, This is based on your ""chest"" measurement.To measure your chest, have someone else use a tape measure to wrap around your chest (just under arms and across shoulder blades). This should be straight across the fullest part of your chest. Do not hold your breathe while you are being measured.

, Typically, there is a 6 inch (15.2 cm) drop between your chest size and the waist size of the pants. Again, the length is based on the S, R or L sizing in step one.

, Check this by making sure the end of the shoulder pads (the seams) end where your shoulders end under the jacket.;
, If you are buying a three button suit the middle button should not fall below your belly button. If it's a two button suit the top button should not fall below your belly button.

, If you put your arms at your side, your knuckles should be roughly even with the bottom of your suit jacket.


Check that the length of the sleeves is right. The sleeves of your suit jacket should sit at base of your thumb (where your thumb meets your wrist). The button up shirt under your suit jacket should be visible. You should have roughly 1/4th to about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of shirt's cuff peeking out from the sleeves.

, Slip your hand into your lapel. If you hand is flat, it should slip in easily. If you put your fist into your lapel, the highest button on your jacket should pull.

, There should be roughly one inch of ""break"" at the bottom of your pants (where the end of your pants fall on your shoes). There are three options to the size of your ""break.""



Full break is when the hem hits the top of the shoe's soles. This is a fashion forward look.

Half break or medium break is when the hem hits roughly halfway down the back of the shoes. This is a traditional look.

No break is when the hem ends right before top of your shoes. This is a casual look.

Stand barefoot or in socks with your feet flat on the ground.,
Ask a friend to measure from the back of your heels to the top of your head.,
Record the number with the rest of your measurements.

",How to Take Measurements (For Women)6," Keep your feet slightly apart and your back against a wall.

, Have them keep the tape measure straight and perpendicular to the floor.


If taking the measurement alone, hold a book or other stiff, flat object flat on the top of your head. Use a pencil to mark the bottom edge of the book, where it meets the wall. Step away from the wall, and measure from the floor to the mark.

, Cover them in plastic, or choose a cloth covering or garment bag which will allow the leather to breathe. Use wide hangers instead of wire hangers which leave creases in garments and can damage or destroy the items over time. Similar to using wire hangers, using any ribbon loops located inside the clothing items to hang them can disfigure the clothing due to the counterweight of the leather. There is just as much a chance for the loop to pull out of the fabric, resulting in a tear, due to the weight of the garment.

, Good storage container choices for leather are fabric bags, suitcases or wooden trunks. Do not store it in plastic because leather needs breathe and plastic prohibits that. Leather can mildew if the surrounding conditions are too humid. Leave enough room around each item so it can each breathe and is not crowded.

,, Exposure to elements like heat, sunlight and moisture will jeopardize the leather's quality.

Call a few of the furriers in your area to see if they will examine your coat, and if you need an appointment to have them do so., Bring your coat into the shop and let the furrier examine it. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or longer. You may be required to pay a small fee, but a professional appraisal is worth it so that you can resell your fur coat for the maximum value., Once the furrier has completed the examination, have them give you an examination certificate or paperwork that states the value of the fur coat. Make sure the name of the furrier is listed, along with the furrier's credentials, the date, and the value of the coat, all printed on a company letterhead.

, In your advertisement, note the type of fur the coat is made from, the size of the coat, and the value of the coat. You should also note what the lining is made from, the length of the fur coat, the color of the fur coat, and the listing or asking price.You can use sites such as Craigslist, eBay, Cashforfurcoats.com, and Buymyfur.com.

, Arrange your coat on a hanger or mannequin and take photos from the front and back, as well as from each side. Also take close-up photos of the fur as well as any damaged areas. Ensure you have good lighting to show potential buyers the plushness and texture of the fur coat., Upload the photos of your fur coat online, and label them accordingly. Add details that let people know what they are looking at (e.g., “Front of Chocolate Brown Mink Fur Coat”). Be sure to upload several photos so potential buyers can get a feel for all aspects and angles of the coat., Give potential buyers a means to contact you, such as an email address or telephone number. Provide them with any other details they may need, such as if you are willing to pay for the shipping cost, or if they will be responsible for that., You can choose a local shop or an online consignment shop. Do an internet search to find retailers that specialize in selling furs by consignment., You will have to split the profits from the sale with the consignment shop, so review the policy and contract before agreeing to or signing anything.

Choose the shop that has the best policy (such as offering cash rather than store credit), the most agreeable contract (perhaps one that will pay for you to ship the coat to them), and will give you the most money for your fur coat (e.g., a 70-30 split, rather than a 50-50 split)., You can either drop off the coat and certificate, or ship it to the company if it is not local. They will contact you when the sale has been made and provide you with payment for your item."

Go casual with joggers made of knitted sweatpants material.,
Select a black pair made of nice material for a dressier look.,
Experiment with different colors and patterns.,
Embrace the details.,
Don’t stick to “athletic” clothing.,
Stick to tailored and fitted tops.,
Tuck longer shirts in.,
Wear lace-up sneakers.,
Dress up jogger pants with high heels or dress shoes.,
Pair jogger pants with high-top sneakers or booties.",How to Style Jogger Pants," If you want jogger pants for running errands and lounging, try a pair made of this traditional material. These joggers are very comfortable and feel almost like pajamas, but the tapered ankle and more fitted legs will make you look more pulled together.Stick to lighter, airier pairs for warmer climates. A lightweight cotton or linen pair is perfect for this.
If you need some extra insulation, check out fleece-lined jogger pants or versions in heavier fabrics like wool.;
, Most jogger pants are worn casually, but you can dress them up, too. If you want to wear these to work or for dressier nights out, choose a pair of jogger pants made of a nice material and in a dark color.Look for fabrics like tweed, corduroy, linen, and even leather to create a dressy look., You can basically find jogger pants in every color and pattern under the sun. A boldly patterned pair can make a fun statement, but they’ll be less versatile than a solid color.Try a solid statement color, like neon green!


Think about how a pair will fit into your current wardrobe. Ideally, you can find a pair that will look great with tops and shoes you already own!

, All jogger pants are not created equal. Simple pairs are great, but there are plenty of pairs with fun details and trendy features that will turn heads. Look for a pair with cool metallic zippers on the ankles, or a colorful drawstring around the waist.For example, a solid pair with a different color or fabric cuff around the ankles creates a nice contrast., Jogger pants might seem like they must be paired with t-shirts, but that’s not the case. Dress up your jogger pants with things like blazers, button downs, and nice sweaters. The contrast between the more relaxed pants and a nicer, more sophisticated top is incredibly on trend.For example, you could pair a black pair of tweed joggers with a black blazer and look polished.

, The beauty of wearing jogger pants is that they are comfortable while still being acceptable to wear in public, but pairing them with slouchy, oversized tops can ruin that. To balance out the relaxed look of the jogger pants, it’s best to pair them with tops that are more fitted.


Whether it’s a t-shirt, a nice blouse, or a button down, opt for something that hugs your body a bit more.For example, go casual with a fitted green tank top and dark gray or black joggers.

, Again, jogger shirts can go from trendy to sloppy easily. If your shirt covers the waistband of your pants, it’s a good idea to tuck it in. If you’re wearing a t-shirt, you can tuck it in super casually, letting the top still hang loosely. If you’re dressing up your jogger pants with a nicer top, tuck it in properly. If you want to pull these pants off in public, it’s important to look put-together.If tucking looks strange, try tying up your shirt into a side knot. The key is keeping the waistband of the joggers exposed.

, If you’re embracing the athleisure look, pick a pair of sneakers that have laces. Slip-on shoes are popular, but they will make your ensemble look a bit juvenile. Whether you’re wearing a pair of every day casual sneakers or a high-tech pair of running shoes, a lace-up pair will work better with jogger pants.For a sporty look, wear lace-up sneakers with a fitted hoodie and matching joggers.

, You may think your sky high stilettos or patent leather dress shoes have no place with jogger pants, but they’re actually perfect with them. A pair of jogger pants can be styled similarly to skinny jeans, so visualize outfits that way! From solid black to light colored corduroy, a pair of dress shoes can completely “formalize” your outfit.For example, you could create a dressy vibe by wearing a black cardigan with black fitted joggers, and finish off the look with patent leather pumps.

, You don’t want your footwear to cover the elastic ankles, because you’ll lose the shape of the jogger pants altogether. However, high-top sneakers, dress shoes, or short boots that come up to the tapered ankles are perfect. You can pull up your jogger pants a bit to ensure the hem sits on top of the shoe, rather than inside the shoe."

If it feels awkward to tilt it, avoid doing so. However you feel most comfortable is the best way to pose, as the camera will highlight your ease and confidence.

, Make sure that your shoulders are held back rather than slouched. Practice walking with your shoulders back until it becomes second nature to you. Stay aware of your posture at all times, since people judge your confidence based on your posture."

Make sure the sleeves are the appropriate length.,
Make sure the pants are the correct length.",How to Measure for a Suit," Anytime you're buying a suit, whatever the style and the size, it's a good idea to take a recent measurement of your height and weight to provide. While the individual measurements associated with the suit are also important to get the right fit, basic height and weight are good ways to get in the ballpark.


This is especially important if you're going to have your suit tailored, because height and weight helps tailors determine your “drop” of the suit, which is the difference between the size of the pants and jacket. It'll help the suit be tailored more quickly.;
, It's important to be wearing the type of shirt you might be wearing under a suit while you're taking measurements for a suit. The shoulder seam in the shirt can serve as a vantage point when measuring the width of your shoulders or your arm length, and the bulk of the shirt will help ensure that your jacket isn't too snug.

, The over-arm measurement will help to create the width of the entire jacket, from shoulder-to-shoulder. Start your tape measure at the back corner of one shoulder, just below where you clavicle ends. Run it across the top of your shoulders, behind your neck and to the back corner of the other shoulder.


When determining measurements, don't pull the tape measure tight. Instead, make sure it fits snugly around the body part(s) you're measuring. Pulling the tape measure too tight will result in a suit that is too tight.

, The chest is an essential measurement to get the right body-fit and flattering cut for the jacket. To take it, raise both arms and run the tape measure around the fullest part of your chest, underneath both your arms. Lower your arms to record the measurement once the tape measure is in place.


Don't flex your chest muscles when figuring out your chest measurement. Flexing your muscles could result in over inflated chest measurements and your suit will not fit well.

, Start your tape measure from the same point on your shoulder where you measured your shoulder width. Slide your tape measure down your arm to your wrist.


You also may need to provide your coat in-sleeve measurement, while wearing a jacket. Put the tape measure on the inside of your arm, slightly below your wrist. Pull the tape up into your underarm for the complete measurement.

, If you're going to also buy or rent a dress shirt, it's also important to take a neck measurement. Wrap the tape measure around the bottom of your neck, just above your collar bone, where your collar would be normally. This will help you find a shirt that fits properly.

, Because dress shoes change the way you stand slightly, as well as giving you a little extra added height, it's important to wear dress shoes, the type of which you may wear with the suit, while you're measuring for the pants, to help you take accurate measurements.

, To get the right waist size of the pants, measure the widest part of your hip bones. Wrap the tape measure all the way around the points of your hips, generally where your pants normally sit.


Measure your waist as well. Depending on the style of the pants, you may or may not need to take your waist measurement, so it's a good idea to bring it along to the store anyway. Find a starting point slightly above either hip bone along your waistline. Loop the tape measure around your waist and back to your starting point to help get an accurate measurement for the waist of the suit pants.

, The outseam is the measurement of the outer-most leg of your pants, trailing down from your hip to your ankle. To take the measurement, stand with your back as straight as possible and measure from your belt-line to the side of your foot in shoes.

, While wearing appropriate shoes, begin the measurement at the top, inside part of your leg where your leg meets your groin. Run the tape measure down the inside of the leg to a point near the middle of your foot.


It's also possible to take this measurement on a pair of pants that you already have that fit you well. Lay the pants out on a flat surface, hip side down. Fold one pant leg out of the way and measure down the entire length of the inseam.

, Suits are typically described with a particular number that describes the size and a word describing the length. A 44 extra-long, for example, would be a relatively large jacket. The size of the jacket refers to the body-fit and the style, based on your chest measurements and your over-arm measurements. The most common jacket sizes for adults include:


38 jackets are for people with a 40 in. chest, 18 in. shoulder, and 24.5 in. sleeves.
40 jackets are for people with a 42 in. chest, 18.5 in. shoulder, and 25 in. sleeves.
42 jackets are for people with a 44 in. chest, 19 in. shoulder, and 25.5 in. sleeves.
44 jackets are for people with a 46 in. chest, 19 in. shoulder, and 26 in. sleeves.

, Coat length is based on height, so you should be able to know what size coat you’ll need if you know size of the dress shirts you get and your height.

Wear stripes that flatter your figure.,
Consider where on your body you are wearing certain patterns.,
Match colors.,
Use varying sizes of patterns.,
Break patterns up.,
Consider the 60/30/10 approach.,
Take your cues from common garment pairings.,
Go easy on accessories while wearing patterns.,
Match buttons.",How to Mix Patterns," You may encounter clothing with horizontal, vertical, and diagonal stripes. Each is best-suited to a different body type:


Horizontal lines are best for lean and thin people. These stripes create the illusion of a wider body. People with heavy torsos should avoid horizontal lines.
Vertical lines help to create the illusion of a taller body. Vertical stripes are best for pants and bottoms, as they make your legs appear long and thin.
Diagonal stripes can be worn to hide a little extra weight on your body.;
, The complexity and location of certain body parts can affect how a pattern looks. On the hands and feet, for example, complex patterns like plaid, tartan, or flowers can look garish, creating the illusion that the hand is misshapen.

, Make sure that the two or three pieces you're pairing have a common color, even if one is slightly lighter than the other. One of the most important things about matching patterns is making sure the colors look good together. For example, a medium green flowered infinity scarf would look good over a light green striped top. The color of the main pattern should contrast with the background color to create a multi-dimensional look.


Repeat colors in patterns. Repeating colors from pattern to pattern can help even disparate patterns seem related. Accentuate shared colors in the patterns. If you use one pattern, such as a stripe, repeat it somewhere, even if the color and scale change.
If you're just wearing two plain items of clothing, like a t-shirt and jeans, try not to make them the same color. Sometimes you can get away with it, as with a blue jumper and jeans, or army green trousers and a green top, but you should usually avoid it.
When mixing patterns, you only want one item of clothing to stand out, so that both patterns don't stand out and blind you. If you're going for a bright pattern, try teaming it with a pattern of a lighter shade, or even grayscale.

, One of the patterns should be thinner or smaller. The other should be medium or large. If you're wearing a flowered scarf with a striped shirt, the shirt would look best if it had thinner stripes, and the flowered scarf had medium sized flowers, scaled to the size of the scarf. The contrasting sizes help put the focus on the accent of this outfit. If the stripes were big, the outfit would look wacky and disproportionate.

, Especially if you're wearing a long garment, like a dress, belts or jackets can be used as accents to stop patterned clothes from looking garish. This is especially true when wearing multiple patterns. Subtle patterns and showy patterns can make outfits look more balanced, and can act as accents for each other. If you are so not sure about teaming up the pattern, pair it with one solid color.


Don't mix two heavy patterns, such as floral and abstract. It may make you look tacky. 'Busy' patterns, such as camo or animal print, tend not to look good when paired.
If you're wearing a few patterned purple shirts layered, then wear a chocolate-brown vest over it. Team a heavy mirror work scarf with a plain black dress to make the scarf stand out.
Make sure that you never wear a top and bottoms with the same pattern going in opposite directions. For example, don't wear a t-shirt with horizontal stripes, then leggings with vertical stripes.

, Stick to 60 percent of a favorite pattern, 30 percent of a second pattern, and 10 percent of a third as an accent. Try three patterns in a range of scales, such as a narrow stripe, a midsize geometric, and a bold floral. Include solids in supporting roles elsewhere.

, Many trends and styles are popular because they're consistently pleasing to the eye. Consider the following clothing combinations:


Patterned pants or leggings with a solid top. Striped is okay if you think it will work. It depends what color and pattern the pants or leggings are.
Colored jeans or capris with a floral-patterned short-sleeved shirt. These shirts look good tucked in and puffed out a little at the bottom. If you choose to tuck in, belts look good also.
Thin striped skirts often look good with patterned top. A small polka-dot maxi skirt looks great paired with a medium or large floral patterned tank top.

, You don't want people to get confused as to what they should focus on. If you are wearing an abstract-patterned dress, you can complete your look with simple diamond ear studs. The same holds true for shoes and belts. Remember that the pattern you are wearing should be the prime focus of your overall look.

, If all else fails, try to match the place of the buttons on your top and bottom. For example, if you have a jumper that has buttons that go down the left arm, try to get some shorts maybe that have buttons going around the left pocket. This doesn't always work, but its worth a try if you are having one of those mornings when nothing at all seems to fit!

Create an account with a marketplace website.,
Prepare yourself for the fees involved.In order to make money, you have to spend money, first.,
Find out what methods of payment you must use.,
Gauge how easy it will be to contact customer support.,
Consider starting your own website once your business grows.When you start to develop your own customer base, you can switch over to your own website and most of your customers will follow you there.",How to Sell Homemade Jewelry Online1," A marketplace website is any website where potential buyers can search through a wide range of items from many different sellers. Many marketplace websites sell a broad range of content, but those that specialize in homemade items or homemade jewelry may make it easier for you to draw the right client base to your online shop.;
, Marketplace websites make most of their money by charging fees. Many online market places charge listing fees, which are fees you pay to post an item to the website, and renewal fees, or fees paid to renew a listing if it expires before being sold. Some websites also take a percentage of the money you make from each item you sell. Every marketplace website is different, though, so you must research the fees for each one before signing up.

, The majority of marketplace websites will accept the most common methods of payment, but this is not a guarantee. If you have a preferred method of payment, you should first find out which marketplace websites allow that method to be used.

, A marketplace website that provides a phone number as well as an email address is more likely to be able to help you if any problems arise. Better customer support will lead to a more pleasant selling experience.

, There are still fees involved with having your own website, but if you can generate a lot of sales, the fees will be much smaller than they would be if you continued selling through an online marketplace.


Allow your customers to pay you through a certified, third-party payment service. New customers are more likely to feel safer using a third-party payment group than they would be giving you their credit card information directly.
Go the extra mile to make your website look professional. Use webpage software or hire a web designer.
Note that you should only switch to your own website once you are able to invest a good deal of time into building your business. Otherwise, the cost of maintaining a website may not be worth it for the amount of sales you generate.

Know what people want.If you sell generic pieces of jewelry that can be found just about anywhere, you are less likely to attract attention as a new seller.,
Take good pictures.,
Price your items for what they are worth.,
Use accurate keywords.,
Make use of social media.,
Advertise where potential buyers might be.,
Look into pay-per-click advertisements.,
Advertise in the real world.",How to Sell Homemade Jewelry Online2," Instead, cater to a specific interest or niche. Browse through message boards and blogs to get an idea of what people want. You can also visit online stores and marketplaces that rank search results by popularity.

, The downfall of selling jewelry online is that buyers cannot examine the piece in person. As a result, clear, informative photographs are essential. Take pictures using a high-resolution digital camera. Photograph each piece of jewelry from different angles, getting as close as possible without blurring the image and using natural light or other clear lighting. You may even want to prop the jewelry up next to coins or other items that show the size of each piece.


As your business grows, you can consider hiring a photography student or professional photographer to take better pictures for you.

, Pricing an item too high will discourage customers for obvious reasons, but pricing an item too low will decrease the perceived value of a piece. There are several common pricing models used by jewelry designers.First, you must determine the wholesale value. Then, determine the retail pricing that you will sell at.


The simplest wholesale value scale is to take the total material cost and multiply it by 3 or 3.5.
You can also factor labor into the wholesale cost more directly by multiplying the number of hours you worked by an hourly wage, like $35 per hour, and taking the product of that equation and adding the total cost of the material to it.
Determine the retail price by multiplying the wholesale price by any number between 1.4 and 2.0, depending on how high quality you feel your jewelry is.

, Accurate keywords will draw interested customers to your shop while making sure uninterested customers are not misled there. You should also take into consideration the types of keywords you choose.


When people shop via online search engines, they generally type in the most basic information possible. For instance, someone looking for a heart-shaped pendant is likely to search for ""heart necklace"" or ""heart pendant."" When choosing titles and keywords, avoid using overly specific terms that are unlikely to show up on a search engine hit.
At the same time, you should avoid being too vague. A necklace titled ""silver aquamarine heart necklace"" will pick up more hits than one titled ""heart necklace,"" since anyone interested in ""silver,"" ""aquamarine,"" ""heart,"" or ""necklace"" will have a chance at making it to your online shop.

, Advertise you products on as many social media websites as possible. Actively seek out friends and followers, and continually post links to new listings in your online store.

, Instead of advertising in forums that are geared toward jewelry makers, advertise in forums that are a little more neutral. Create a blog and connect to other bloggers with an interest in fashion and design. Join message board communities and leave a link to your online store in your signature, as long as the rules of the board allow it.

, You only pay for these advertisements when someone clicks on the ad and is redirected to your store. Essentially, you are advertising your online shop and only paying for the people who notice your ad.

, Your homemade jewelry business may stay online, but that does not mean your marketing campaign should. While the majority of your advertising should be done online, you can also print flyers or business cards to spread out around your local area. Include information about how to visit your online jewelry listings, as well as information and pictures of some of the jewelry you sell.

Check the current price per ounce. The price of gold per ounce is now a fixture that is easily found on the Internet, in the newspaper, and through other sources.
Evaluate nonphysical gold holdings. In some cases, it can be helpful to look at the values involved in nonphysical gold assets like stocks, funds or bonds to know whether to sell a piece of scrap gold.;
, Before selling, the owner of an item needs to consider whether it is worth more as a coin, piece of jewelry, or as a lump of raw gold.

You can get your gold appraised at a jewelry store to determine the worth as scrap gold and the worth as jewelry., The price of gold changes so it is important to consider when the right time is to sell your gold. You will want to sell your gold when the currency of your country is strong. If you want to sell your gold and the currency is doing well, then it is best not to hesitate. If you need quick cash, you can sell your gold even when the currency is not strong you just might not get the highest price you could. , It is important to know the karat of your jewelry before you sell it to determine the price.

Check the Better Business Bureau’s website for complaints against companies to see if they are reliable before you give them your gold. , Gold sellers are required to ask to see your ID. If they do not ask for your ID, they are not legitimate and you should sell your gold somewhere else. , Make sure you understand the unit that the jeweler is measuring the gold in. Make sure that the different karats are being weighed separately. Some jewelers will weigh all the jewelry together, instead of individually, to give you the lowest karat. If you see your jeweler doing this, stop them and insist they measure the pieces individually. , It may sound fun to gather around with your friends and make money off of your gold but they can often be scams.


Guests often sell their jewelry to the buyers who host the gold parties for you and your friends for much less than it is worth. (Often as much as 50% or less of what the jewelry is actually worth.)
The buyers try to confuse you with weights. They sometimes will use a broken scale, be unclear about the unit of measurement, and tell you your gold is a lower karat than it is.
The buyers might tell you the gold is for charity. Be careful about this because it is usually a lie. , The fine print of a mail away gold service is very important to read and understand.

Gently wipe your pearls with a soft cloth after you remove them for the day.,
Immediately wipe your pearls clean with a soft cloth if they get exposed to acid.",How to Take Care of Pearls1," When you're taking everything off, take them off first.

, Acid can come in the form of sweat, perfume, fruit juice, vinegar, or a number of other substances. The acid will break down the crystallized calcium of the pearl, ruining its luster and causing a very long-term damage.

This is especially true if you are a guest, as guests often have more opportunity for incorporating bolder colors into their outfits than brides do.

, There are many different lengths of pearls but some necklace lengths suit some dress styles better than others. In general, the longer the strand of pearls, the higher the neckline the dress should be.


Strands 14 inches (35.6 cm) in length will fit tightly around the neck and will suit scoop necks, V-necks, off-the-shoulder-, and boatneck dresses.
Strands between 16–18 inches (40.6–45.7 cm) will fall between the base of the throat and the collarbone, respectively. These strands will pair well with almost any style of dress or neckline. This will give you plenty of flexibility!
Strands that are 20–24 inches (50.8–61.0 cm) are best suited for business or casual wear.
Pearl necklaces that are 28–42 inches (71.1–107 cm) will pair beautifully with high necklines and evening wear."

Gently apply a baby shampoo or another mild soap using a soft manicure brush.,
Support the strand if the pearls are on a necklace or bracelet.,
Only use mineral water or distilled water to rinse your pearls.,
Gently dab the water and soap of your pearls with a dry, soft cloth.,
Polish your pearls with a dry, soft cloth to maintain their luster.

,
Avoid jewelry cleaners or ultrasonic cleaners.",How to Take Care of Pearls2," Harsh cleaners can destroy the pearl, and a harder brush can also cause scratches. Soft-bristled toothbrushes work well as they can poke into thin crevices as well. Some good brands are Walgreens Fresh Smile, Smile and Save, and Oral-B Cross Action.

, Do not stretch the thread as you clean. The pearls may get loose and drop out.

, Standard tap water contains chlorine and other chemicals that can damage the surface of your pearls.

, Do not let chemicals or water sit on your pearls too long.

,, These are too rough and will damage your pearls.

"
"
Fasten any clasps or pins before storing your pearls.,
Keep your pearls in a separate compartment, away from other jewelry.,
Consider storing your pearls in a silk bag, velvet-lined box, or satin-lined pearl folder.,
Never store pearls in a plastic bag.,
Store pearl strands flat to avoid stretching out the string.,
Do not keep pearl stored in a safe or safety deposit box for an extended period of time.,
Keep a glass of water inside a vault or safe if you must store your pearls there.,
Keep your pearls stored in a jewelry box or other case.",How to Take Care of Pearls3," These sharp metal objects could rub up against the pearl and cause scratches. Unclasped strands may also become tangled and cause your pearls getting horribly scratched.

, Other gems may scratch the surface of the pearls if they come into contact with them. Even other pearl pieces may have metal elements that could scratch the pearls on a separate piece, so store each pearl piece in its own compartment. If possible, use a small velvet drawstring bag and insert the pearl in there.

, Taking this extra precaution will ensure that nothing else scratches your pearls.

, Some plastics can emit a chemical that, over time, will cause your pearls to deteriorate. Airtight plastic bags can also cause vapor or sweat inside.

, Avoid hanging them high or hanging them at all.

, These dry conditions will dehydrate you pearls, causing them to develop small surface fractures. Air them at least every week or a month.

, This will help humidify the air, slowing down the dehydration process.

, Avoid jewelry boxes with windows that expose your jewelry to light. Long-term exposure to sunlight can cause your pearls to turn yellow.

"
"
Avoid long-term exposure to strong light or heat above 140°F (60°C).,
Examine strands of pearls for loosening strings.,
Have your pearls restrung every one or two years, especially if you wear them consistently.,
Ask your jeweler to knot the strand in between beads to provide the strand with added protection.",How to Take Care of Pearls4," These elements can dry out your pearls, causing them to crack.

, If the threads begin to fray, you should have your pearls restrung.

, Even if you do not notice visible signs of wear on the strand, the string will likely start to fray by then.

, This way, if a string breaks, you only lose a single pearl. Moreover, a knotted string keeps your pearls from rubbing against one another, which helps reduce surface scratching.

Determine the type of material of your watch band.,
Remove the band from the watch dial, if possible.,
Gather your materials.,
Immerse your nylon watchbands in the laundry.,
Make a mild soap and water mixture.,
Place the band in the mixture.Remember that you should only use a mild soap and water mixture if the band is made of metal, otherwise replace the dish soap with a small amount of vinegar instead.,
Allow the band to soak.,
Remove the band from the mixture.,
Bend and fold your band to check the nooks and cracks.,
Use a toothpick to get remaining dirt from small spaces.,
Dry the watchband thoroughly.,
Use a leather cleaner to wipe down leather bands.,
Make a soap and water mixture.,
Wipe the dial or face of the watch.,
Clean between the areas of the watch that attach to the watch band.,
Wipe the entire watch once more with the clean lint-free cloth.",How to Clean a Watch," The cleaning method you use will depend upon the type of band you have. Common band types are metal, leather, cloth, or stainless steel. If your watch is made out of plastic you can follow the same procedure to clean it as you would if it was made out of metal.;
, Be very cautious about using liquids to clean your watch if you cannot remove the band. You can permanently damage the band. If you can remove the band there will be two tiny screws on either side of the band where the band connects to the watch face.


You may need watch tools depending on the size of the screws, but take these out and you'll be able to remove your band. Put them in a safe place and don't lose them.

, Depending on what kind of watch you are cleaning, you’ll need polishing or lint-free cloths, mild detergent, a small bowl or container, and leather cleaner if you’re cleaning the band of a leather watch.

, Easy enough! You don’t have to worry about them as long as you keep them in a separate mesh bag. The rubber in your nylon band will absorb sweat and oil and if you don’t wash it now and then it will crack and break.

, If you have a watch band that is made of leather or cloth, use a small amount of vinegar instead of soap. You can use dish soap and room temperature water.


Use only a small dollop of dish detergent. There’s no formula, but you don’t need that much.

, This will help clean your band if it is leather or cloth without drying it out and cracking it.

, You don’t have to wait hours if the watch isn’t noticeably dirty, letting it soak for a couple of minutes in a shallow bowl or container should do the trick. If your watch has been sitting in the mud outside your door step for ten years and you just found it, you might need to leave it for a few hours.

, Take the band from the mixture and dry it using a polishing cloth from a jeweler or a lint-free cloth bought at a grocery store. Be careful not to scratch the surface. Check if there is any dirt remaining on the band.

, If you have a linked band you should be certain to check back and forth. These areas often house dead skin, dirt and skin oils.


There are less nooks in leather bands than there are in metal bands, but you'll still find areas where sweat and debris has gathered to form a layer of muck.

, If you find dirt or any other material in your watch band you can use a toothpick to remove it.

, You may choose to remove excess water with the cloth and allow the watchband to air dry, if time allows. Air drying is probably your best option. , Be certain that no excess cleaner exists on the band before reassembling the watch.

, Use a mild dish soap and make sure you don’t put too much in there. It’s not going to hurt your watch necessarily but you will make the water all soapy. Do not apply bleach. This will destroy your watch. Don’t use any sort of chemical substance other than mild soap or you risk causing serious damage to your watch. Always be careful and see how the watch responds to the treatment. , You have a few options here – you can clean with a polishing or lint-free cloth, a soft bristled toothbrush, or a chamois cloth. Just don’t brush too hard or you might scratch the face of your watch. Rub to remove fingerprints and smudges from the crystal or glass. , You can use a tooth pick to get into these areas. A Q-tip is also a good option.


If you're going to complete a thorough cleaning of your watch then you have to take care to clean every part of the watch. Don't neglect the watch band just because it doesn't tell the time. The more time you spend caring for your watch band the longer it will last.

, Once you have reassembled the watch and the watch band you should wipe the whole thing down once more to clean off any excess water or soap. "

Choose a string to use.,
Gather your pearls.,
Buy or make a beading needle.,
Thread the needle.",How to String Pearls1," Either silk or nylon thread will work. Thread comes in many colors, though white is most commonly used. If your pearls are colored, choose thread that closely resembles the color of the pearls.;
, If you are restringing pearls, cut them from the old string. Line the pearls up in the order you plan to string them. Place them in a tray or on a surface where they won't roll away.


If the pearls are graduated, place them in order of smallest to largest and back to smallest.

, A beading needle is a very thin needle that fits through the hole in the pearls.They are available to purchase at most craft and beading stores.


You can make your own beading needle by cutting a 6-inch (15.24cm) strip of beading wire. Fold it in half and cut the non folded end to a point.

, Cut a piece of thread that will be used to string your pearls. The piece should be at least three times the intended length of the necklace. Pull the string through the eye of the needle.


For needles made of beading wire, make your own needle eye by cutting a 4-inch (10.2cm) piece of thread, pull it through the folded wire and tie it into a loop at the folded end of the needle. Feed your stringing thread into this loop.

"
"
Cut off a strand of thread about 10 inches in length.,
Thread one of the thinner strands through the eye of the beading needle.,
Thread the loop.,
Attach the clasp.,
String all pearls on the thread.,
Remove the needle and tie a double knot at the end of the strand with two loose ends.,
Knot the first pearl.,
Continue to knot the remaining pearls.,
Attach the final clasp.,
Secure the clasp.",How to String Pearls2," Once you've cut the strand, separate it into at least three finer strands., After it's threaded through, tie a knot so the strand remains looped through the needle's eye. The loop will hold the thread that you'll actually use to string your pearls.


Leave the loop on your needle so you can reuse it over and over again, Think of it as enlarging the ""eye"" of the needle into one big loop.

, Cut off a strand of thread at least three times the desired length of your necklace, then double it over and slip the loose ends through the loop of thread you've already made. Pull the ends through far enough that they don't easily slip out.

, Cut one of the clasp ends from your original necklace and loop the thread through it. Slip the threaded beading needle through the ring on the clasp and then back through the end loop in the thread. Tie a knot close to the clasp to prevent the loop from slipping up onto the ring incorrectly.

, If using graduated pearls, be sure to string them in order from smallest to largest and back to smallest again. There should be plenty of extra thread.

, The knot will prevent the pearls from slipping off while you tie knots. You can then push the pearls to the end of the thread where you tied the knot.

, Tie a knot immediately outside the clasp to prevent the metal from scratching the first pearl. Push the first pearl up against the knot and tie another knot on the other side of the pearl.


You may find it helpful to hold the loop down on the pearl and tighten.
Hold the thread tightly against the pearl as the knot is pulled shut.

, Push each pearl up against the last knot and tie an additional knot immediately on the other side of the pearl.


After tying each knot, separate the two threads and pull them tightly apart to move the knot closer to the pearl.
Try placing a needle through each knot to guide the knot tightly against the pearl.
Keeping a finger tightly over each knot as it's being pulled will help to pull it snug against the pearl.

, Once you've knotted the final pearl, cut off the end thread knot and slide the two threads through the other side of clasp. Then pull the threads tightly up to the final knotted pearl strand and tie a strong double knot.

, If you used silk thread, apply a tiny dot of super glue with a tooth pick, carefully keeping glue off the pearl or pearl hole. Once the glue dries, cut the thread as close as possible to the knot.


If you used synthetic thread, cut within a 1/4-inch of the knot and melt the loose ends with a small flame from a lighter or a match.

String each pearl onto the thread.Do this by pulling the needle and thread through the hole in each pearl.

,
Fasten the clasp.,
String the pearls again.,
Secure the two sides of thread.,
Knot the pearls.,
Attach the clasp.",How to String Pearls3,", Take one side of your clasp and tie it onto the end of the silk thread after you have strung all the pearls.

, Take the wire needle back through the pearls in the opposite direction you were stringing before.

, Tie a basic knot at the end of the string of pearls to tie together the first and second threads strung through the pearls. Pull the knot so it rests as close to the last pearl as possible. Secure the knot by applying a dab of glue or clear nail polish to the knot, being careful not to get any adhesive on the pearls.


If you have trouble placing the knot right against the pearl, you can pull it close using tweezers., Take the needle and thread back through each pearl. After each pearl, tie a knot as you did in the step above. Secure the knot with adhesive, making sure to keep the substance off the pearls.It's important to have a knot in between all of the pearls, as well as between the pearls and the clasps, because pearls and extremely fragile and could otherwise rub against and scratch each other., Tie the other half of the clasp onto the other end of the string of pearls to complete the strand.

Clean the watch with a damp cloth.,
Wipe away dirt with rubbing alcohol.,
Scrub problem areas with a toothbrush.,
Use a Q-tip to clean crevices.",How to Clean a Casio G Shock1," Even if you don’t have a waterproof G Shock, you can still use water on a damp cloth to target the problem areas on your watch. Run warm water briefly over a sponge or soft cloth, then squeeze to release excess water. Rub the areas of dirt or buildup carefully with the damp cloth. Your rubbing should cause the dirt to lift away from the surface of the watch.


Don’t use paper towels or other abrasive cloths to clean your watch, as they may cause scratches in its surface.;
, If using water to remove the buildup on your watch didn’t do the job, you may have to use a stronger cleaning solution. Rubbing alcohol is a potent and safe cleaner to use on Casio G Shock watches. To use, pour about a teaspoon (4.92 ml) of rubbing alcohol onto a soft cloth. Then rub the surface of the watch, as you did before with the wet cloth, to remove the dirt or buildup.If you successfully removed the dirt with the rubbing alcohol, wipe away any lingering rubbing alcohol with a damp cloth, then dry with a clean soft cloth .

, If you are tackling particularly stubborn dirt, it may be more effective to scrub at the buildup rather than to wipe it. Dip a toothbrush in warm water or rubbing alcohol, then shake it to remove excess liquid. Use the bristles to scrub in gentle circular motions on the dirt or buildup on your watch.Use a toothbrush with soft, as opposed to stiff, bristles.

, Dirt and other buildup often forms in the cracks and crevices of watches, making it difficult to clean. If you have dirt that has gathered in a hard to reach area, use a Q-tip dipped in water or rubbing alcohol to clean the spot.Make sure to pick out any fluff from the Q-tip that may get snagged on the edges of the watch.

Pour two cups of hot water into a bowl.,
Add salt and aluminum foil.,
Submerge your jewelry in the solution.,
Rinse the jewelry.",How to Clean Your Silver Jewelry1," You just need enough to cover the jewelry you're cleaning. This method works as a gentle cleanser that removes tarnish without abrading the silver.If your silver is lightly tarnished, the salt bath should take the tarnish right off.









If you're cleaning a lot of jewelry at once, you can use more water. For just one piece of jewelry, use less water.
If your jewelry has gemstones, make sure they won't be affected by being submerged in a saltwater solution. This solution is gentle on most stones, but if you're cleaning very fine jewelry with expensive gemstones, you're better off taking it to a professional just in case. You can also contact your jeweler for advice.;
, Stir one tablespoon of salt it into the hot water with a spoon until it completely dissolves. Take a sheet of aluminum foil and tear off a few strips, then put them in the bowl. The combination of salt and aluminum will react with the tarnish on the silver's surface and create a bright, shiny surface in place of the tarnish.

Tarnish happens when the surface of silver combines with sulfur and turns into silver sulfide, which is black. When silver sulfide reacts with aluminum in a salt solution, the chemical reaction between the substances turns the silver sulfide back to silver. The reaction happens faster when the solution is warm.If you don't have table salt on hand, you can use baking soda instead. It has the right properties to facilitate the same chemical reaction.

, Allow it to sit for 5 minutes. Stir it around a bit to see whether the tarnish is going away. When you see that the silver's shine has been restored, remove the silver from the solution.








If you're working with deeply tarnished silver, you might need to repeat the process two or more times. Make sure the solution is completely heated, since the reaction is much slower if the solution is cool.

, Run it under cool running water to rinse off the salt, then gently dry it using a soft cloth or microfiber towel. The jewelry should be good as new. If you still see signs of tarnish, repeat the process until it looks clean.

Rub at scuffs with a pencil eraser.,
Use toothpaste to remove scuffs from the face.,
Use a jeweler’s cloth to remove minor scratches.",How to Clean a Casio G Shock2," If you wear your watch regularly, you likely have a few scuffs and markings from regular wear. A handy tool that you can use to remove scuffs is a regular pencil eraser. To use an eraser, rub it gently on the scuff several times, then wipe away the eraser dust.Use a white eraser as opposed to a pink eraser to avoid discoloring the watch, especially if the watch is white.
Scuffs are not to be confused with scratches. Scuffs are superficial skid marks on the surface of the watch, whereas scratches penetrate the surface of the watch.

, Toothpaste is an unlikely but highly effective tool for removing scuffs and light scratches. To use toothpaste, dab a small amount on the end of a Q-tip and rub the scuffs or scratches gently in circular motions. After wiping, use a slightly damp soft cloth to rub away the toothpaste.Use a standard white toothpaste as opposed to a gel-based or non-white toothpaste.

, A jeweler’s cloth is especially formulated to remove minor scratches from the surface of a watch or piece of jewelry. To use the jeweler’s cloth, rub the light scratches with the cloth for about 30 seconds. You should see that the scratches have gone.If you have particularly large or deep scratches on the surface of your watch, you may need to bring your watch to a professional jeweler to get them removed.

Make sure your watch is water resistant to 50 m. Before you rinse your watch, you need to make sure that it is waterproof.,
Run warm water over the watch.,
Spread clear hand soap over the watch.,
Hold the watch under the water.,
Dry the watch with a clean cloth.",How to Clean a Casio G Shock3," There are several classifications of water resistance within the Casio G Shock brand, ranging from the class of “Water Resistant” to “Divers’ Watch 200M.”A “Water Resistant” watch, the first classification on the scale of water resistance, is only resistant to splashing and minor contact with water, and is not designed to be be rinsed or submerged in water.
Make sure that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” classification watch, which is the next classification after “Water Resistant ”, before you submerge it.

, Once you have ascertained that you have at least a “Water Resistant to 50 M” Casio G Shock watch, turn on the faucet and wait until the water is warm, then hold the watch directly under the jet of water. Turn the watch over to ensure that you are rinsing the entire surface of the watch., After you have gotten the surface of the watch wet, squirt a small amount of hand soap into your hand. Hold the watch away from the running water and use your fingers to spread the soap over the entire surface of the watch, including on the band and into the nooks and crannies of the watch.Use clear soap, as colored soap may stain the band of the watch, especially if you own a white watch.

, Once you spread the soap all over the watch, hold the watch back under the jet of water. While the water is running over the watch, use your fingers to massage the soap into the watch, letting the water wash the soap away. Run water over the watch until all the hand soap is removed from the surface of the watch., Once you have finished washing away all the soap, dry your Casio G Shock watch with a clean, soft cloth. It’s better for the materials of the watch to manually dry it rather than to air dry it."

Purchase a silver polish.,
Rub the jewelry with a little polish.,
Rinse and dry the silver jewelry.,
Consider using common household products for less rare or less valuable pieces.,
Try a silver dip.",How to Clean Your Silver Jewelry2," When tarnish develops on silver, a simple salt and aluminum bath may not suffice to remove it. Specially formulated silver jewelry polishes are your safest option for polishing silver jewelry, especially if you are dealing with an antique or a piece that has intricate designs etched into it.








Even special polishes can remove a layer of silver, so get a professional cleaning if you're dealing with a delicate piece.
Instead of buying silver polish from the drugstore, consider getting it from a jewelry store or a store with a high-quality jewelry department.

, Moisten a soft silver-polishing cloth or the sponge included with the silver polish and take a little bit of polish onto the cloth. Rub the polish into the silver jewelry gently. Use only a straight-line, back-and-forth motion. Avoid scrubbing or rubbing in circles, since this can leave scratches or patterns in the surface of the jewelry. Just let the polish do the job.








, Rinse it under cool running water. Be sure to clean off all of the polish residue so it won't continue working on the surface of the jewelry. Dry it completely using a soft cloth.








, They will usually work to remove tough tarnish, but may cause damage such as pock marks or scratches. Try them at your own risk.









Try toothpaste. Select a plain white toothpaste without the special whitening options. Take a soft, dampened cloth or a damp sponge and put some toothpaste on it. Gently rub over the silver jewelry in straight, back-and-forth motions. Be very gentle, and if you notice scratching at any point, stop and rinse the toothpaste off. As the cloth or sponge becomes dark with tarnish, add more toothpaste to a clean part of the dampened cloth/sponge and continue gently polishing. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and dry with a soft towel.













Baking soda may remove stubborn tarnish, but don't use it unless you don't mind the risk of damaging the silver. Make a paste of baking soda and warm water, gently rub it into the surface of the jewelry, and rinse when the tarnish is removed.













, Commercial silver ""dips"" can dissolve stains without rubbing the silver jewelry, although they may take off a layer of silver. For this reason, they should only be used as a last resort. Contrary to what the word ""dip"" implies, professionals rarely actually soak silver in these products, at least not for long. Dips are generally harsh, potentially dangerous chemicals, so follow the directions carefully and consult a professional when in doubt.

Clean it often.,
Wash it separately.,
Dry it with a polishing cloth.,
Store your silver jewelry correctly.",How to Clean Your Silver Jewelry3," Clean your silver jewelry often, and clean it promptly after use. Silver jewelry that is frequently used rarely has tarnish problems. When tarnish is not yet present, or when it's just beginning to develop, simply wash your silver jewelry in warm (not hot) water with a gentle, phosphate-free detergent.









Prompt cleaning is especially important when the silver jewelry has been exposed to certain foods containing sulfur, or those which are acidic or salty. In particular, common foods such as table salt, eggs, some fruits, onions, mayonnaise, and vinegar are harmful to silver.
In any case, wash your silver jewelry right away or at least rinse it well with warm water, and don't leave silver sitting in dishwater that may contain traces of these foods.

, It's a good idea to wash silver separately from your other silver pieces, like bowls or silverware, because metal sinks and utensils can scratch silver jewelry.









You should also avoid using rubber gloves when washing silver, as rubber corrodes silver jewelry.













Stainless steel can also damage the finish if it comes into contact with your silver jewelry, so avoid putting it in the sink; use a bowl to wash it in instead.

, Use a special polishing cloth or simply a soft, lint-free cloth to gently rub the silver clean after washing. Make sure it gets completely dry.









Silver can be so soft that even using a scratchy, rough towel could be enough to make indentations in its surface. Make sure to use a soft cloth.
As you dry the jewelry, gently buff the shine back with a soft cotton cloth.














, Beyond prompt and frequent cleaning, the best way to preserve your silver is to store it correctly. Make sure each piece is completely dry before storing it. You can buy special bags for storing silver jewelry that prevent them from getting tarnished. If you don't have the bags, use this technique:









Wrap each piece of silverware in acid-free tissue paper or anti-tarnish paper. You can also wrap pieces in flannel.













Store the silver in a compartment separate from the rest of your jewelry. Never store silver jewelry where it can contact rubber, stainless steel, or paint.

Place dishwashing liquid in a small bowl.,
Soak the chain.,
Scrub with a toothbrush.,
Rinse with water.,
Dry with a soft cloth.",How to Clean Gold Chains1," Mix a few drops of mild dishwashing soap into a bowl with club soda or seltzer water. Make sure that the water is room temperature or warmer. If you are worried about spillage, place a towel under the bowel before setting it down.








Club soda or seltzer water can help to remove stubborn spots on gold due to their carbonation.You can also use dishwashing detergent. Just make sure that it is labeled as mild. Harsh detergent can ruin your jewel.;
, Take the chain and immerse it into the bowl. Take your time to avoid damaging the jewelry and to limit any spillage. Move the chain around so that it is not balled up or overlapping overly much. Leave the chain in the bowl between 2-15 minutes. Soak it again, if necessary, to remove particularly stubborn dirt or grime.








You can also place your chain into a metal strainer and then lower the strainer into the bowl until it is submerged. Then, you can remove the chain by simply lifting the strainer. This is a good method to use if you are concerned about dropping the chain., Get out a soft bristled toothbrush. Pull your chain out of the bowl. Dip the toothbrush into the cleaning solution and gently stroke over the chain. Use quick, light strokes and make sure to never scrub heavily. To get in between the chain links, push some of the toothbrush tines into these spaces. Make a clockwise, circular motion and repeat anticlockwise. This ensures the dirt to loosen up or remove altogether.








Going with a medium or hard bristled brush could make it easier for you to scratch your jewelry. It is also best to keep a brush set aside specifically for jewelry cleaning. This is on your own risk since it can spoil the jewel if it is delicate or sensitive., When you are finished running your toothbrush over the chain, place your chain back into the strainer. Then, run some warm water over the chain and strainer. If you feel as if there is a chemical residue on the chain, you may want to move it a bit under the water.







, Place your chain onto a cloth and gently pat it dry. Continue to do so until you can lift it up without feeling wetness or grease. Keep polishing in small motions until the shine is restored. Your jeweler can give you a polishing cloth to use or you can get a simple microfiber cloth.

Use ammonia.,
Use beer.,
Use toothpaste.,
Use a professional cleaning solution.,
Use an ultrasonic cleaner.",How to Clean Gold Chains2," This method can be a bit abrasive, so it is not suggested for antique or fragile gold chains. Create a 50








One good thing about using rubbing alcohol is that it will disinfect the chain while also cleaning it., In a small bowl, make a mixture of 6 parts warm tap water to 1 part ammonia. Leave your chain soaking in this mixture for a minute maximum. Ammonia is a very powerful cleaner, so you should only use it for newer, undamaged gold chains. You will also want to rinse the chain out thoroughly under water when you are finished.








Using ammonia as a regular jewelry cleaner can break down the pieces over time. Therefore, it is best if this method is only used on occasion and for deep-set grime and residue., With this method you’ll need to pour a bit of beer onto a soft cloth. Place the chain within the cloth and rub up and down the links. You can also dip a soft toothbrush into beer and use it to lightly scrub the chain. You can use any beer with the exception of dark ale.







, This is a cheap, all-purpose approach to cleaning jewelry. Place a small dot of toothpaste onto a soft bristled toothbrush. Then, gently scrub at the chain until you start to see results.

, You can also purchase a specialty gold cleaning solution from your jeweler directly or from a jewelry site online. Check the label to verify that it okay for use on gold chains. Follow any additional instructions carefully, including any safety warnings.







, If you want professional results without messing with cleaning solutions, you can purchase an ultrasonic jewelry cleaner. You will place your gold chain inside the machine which will clean it through the use of small, fast vibrations. This is best used for sturdier, thicker chains without any embellishments.Before you use an ultrasonic cleaner, it may be a good idea to talk with a jeweler to see if it is appropriate for your type of gold chain.

Make any repairs prior.,
Test out a small area.,
Block off the drain.,
Take care with any precious stones.,
Consult with a jeweler.",How to Clean Gold Chains3," In a brightly lit room, raise your chain to eye level and carefully inspect all of the links, the clasp, and any embellishments. If the clasp is already loose, then you may damage it beyond repair by cleaning it. If any gemstones are damaged, then they may fall off during the cleaning process.You can take your gold chain to a jeweler and ask them to repair the damage and give it a thorough cleaning as well.

, If you are unsure about how your cleaning solution will affect your chain, then take a q-tip, dip it in a bit of solution, and apply it to one link. Observe to see if the link shows any discoloration as a result. If you see any discoloration or problems developing, rinse the chain out under warm water right away.







, It is quite common to lose a piece of jewelry down a drain as a result of the cleaning process. Before you start to clean, block off the sink drain with a cover. Or, place a mesh strainer over the drain to ensure that your chain is safe to handle, even if dropped., If your gold chain includes gemstones, such as diamonds or pearls, you will want to carefully consider how a cleaning solution or process could impact them as well. Some solutions that are fine for gold alone, such as ammonia, could prove overly abrasive to an embellishment, like a freshwater pearl.Also, make sure to keep your scrubbing gentle. Or, you could accidently snag and pull a gemstone out of its setting. Some gemstones can even loose color if scrubbed too hard., When in doubt, go to a jewelry store and talk with a professional jeweler. They can suggest cleaning methods and even offer advice regarding possible cleaning solutions. This is especially important if your gold chain is antique or especially delicate.If you bought your gold chain from a national jewelry chain, you might also be able to contact customer service for cleaning advice."

Understand that while toothpaste is great for cleaning silver jewelry, it can damage silver as well.Toothpaste contains abrasive particles that can polish off tarnish.,
Choose a plain, solid-colored toothpaste with no baking soda, tartar control, or whitening agents.,
Dampen the silver with some water.,
Apply a small amount of toothpaste to the jewelry.,
Rub the jewelry gently with a damp tissue, paper towel, or q-tip.,
Use a damp, soft-bristled toothbrush to clean out grooves and intricate designs.Some pieces, such as rings and brooches, have nooks and crannies that are hard to reach, even with a q-tip.,
Let the toothpaste sit for about 2 to 3 minutes for stubborn stains.This will give the ingredients in the toothpaste to work on tough tarnish.

,
Wipe the residue off with a clean paper towel, tissue, or q-tip.,
Keep adding toothpaste and rubbing it off until the tarnish is gone.,
Rinse the jewelry in warm water.The best way to do this is to plug your sink, and rinse the jewelry under running water.,
Gently pat the jewelry dry with a soft cloth, then let it air-dry before putting it away.,
Store your jewelry some place cool and dry.,
Put on all your hair products, lotions, makeup, and perfume before you put on the jewelry.,
Don't wear your jewelry where it might get wet.,
Wipe your jewelry clean with a silver polishing cloth before putting it into storage.",How to Use Toothpaste to Clean Silver Jewelry," These same particles can scratch silver up as well. In particular, you should avoid using toothpaste on sterling silver, highly-polished silver, or anything that is silver-plated.These items are very soft, and can be easily damaged by the toothpaste. The best way to clean these delicate items is to buff them with a silver polishing cloth.Toothpaste is considered safe for satin or matte silver.Make sure that the patina is not intentional. Some jewelers intentionally ""age"" their pieces to make them look more rustic.
Consider taking fragile or antique pieces to a professional cleaner.;
, These ""extras"" are too abrasive and can scratch your jewelry.At the same time, however, you'll want to avoid using gel toothpaste because it isn't abrasive enough to remove tarnish., This will help soften the toothpaste, and make it easier to spread. You can dampen jewelry by squirting it with some water in a spray bottle, or by dipping it into a bowl filled with water. Avoid working over a sink; if you drop the jewelry, you may lose it down the drain.

, Start with a pea-sized amount—smaller if you are cleaning something tiny, such as a post earring. You can use your finger, a sponge, a paper towel, or even a q-tip to apply the toothpaste.

, Use a light touch so that you don't accidentally scratch the silver. Use tissues and paper towels for larger items, such as bracelets, and q-tips for small items, such as earring hooks. If you are cleaning a necklace chain, run the chain through a folder paper towel.


Use caution around gemstones, especially around amber, emeralds, lapis, and turquoise. These tend to be very soft, and can easily be scratched up by toothpaste.The paper towel, tissue, of q-tip may turn dark. This is a good thing; it is the tarnish coming off the jewelry.

, For these pieces, you can gently scrub over them using a toothbrush.


Baby toothbrushes and toothbrushes for sensitive gums tend to have the softest bristles. Don't use this toothbrush for any thing else other than jewelry cleaning.

,, Once again, if you are cleaning a necklace chain, gently pull the chain through a new, folded paper towel.You may notice the tarnish disappearing, and the silver becoming brighter.

, Depending on how badly tarnished the piece is, this can take about 15 minutes., If you are too hesitant to do this, you can also dip the jewelry in a bowl of warm water, and rub the toothpaste residue off.

, Use a soft cloth, such as microfiber, to dry the jewelry. Once you have gotten most of the water off, place it onto a clean, soft towel. Wait until it dries completely before storing it. This is especially important for pieces with lots of nooks and crannies, such as chains and ornate brooches.

, Humidity causes jewelry to tarnish faster, so the more you limit the humidity, the slower your jewelry will tarnish.Here are some tips for storing silver jewelry:Store chains and earrings in anti-tarnish or tarnish-proof bags. You can buy them in jewelry stores.Wrap larger pieces, such as brooches and bracelets, in anti-tarnish cloths.Get a jewelry box that is lined with tarnish-free material to limit the rate of tarnishing.
Consider adding an anti-tarnish strip to your jewelry bags. You will need to change these strips every 2 to 3 months.
Try adding a silica gel pack to your jewelry boxes. They will absorb the moisture.

, If you are using wet or oily cosmetics, such as lotions, wait for them to dry completely before you put on your jewelry. Cosmetics contain chemicals that can not only speed up tarnishing, but also damage silver., This includes activities such as bathing, cleaning, exercising, showering, or swimming. Sweat, tap water, and household cleaning products can all cause jewelry to tarnish faster. In some cases, the chemicals in tap water and household cleaning products can also damage silver., Throughout the day, your jewelry will come into contact with things like body oils, dirt, lotions, and sweat. All of these can cause silver to tarnish faster. You will want to clean these off before you put your jewelry away.

Add a blazer.",How to Wear a Pleated Skirt," Stitch down pleats tend to lay flatter than other pleated skirts. If you have a larger stomach, stitch down pleats can be flattering. They create a slimming effect and minimize the appearance of your stomach., Accordion pleats have long, vertical lines running through them. These tend to be fuller through the hips. If you have an hourglass figure you want to accentuate, go for accordion pleats., Knife pleats tend to not have a lot of volume. Therefore, if you have a larger, rounder bottom, knife pleats can look great. They will not make your lower half look bigger than necessary, but will still highlight your curves., One of the big draws of a pleated skirt is that it can highlight your waist, creating a slimming effect. To highlight your waist, always tuck whatever you're wearing into the pleated skirt. This makes your waist stand out. Whether you're wearing a blouse or a casual t-shirt with the pleated skirt, tuck it in., Shorter legs may look stubby in skirts. To counteract this, choose a skirt with a hemline that's higher in the middle. This will prevent the skirt from getting cut off at your calves, drawing attention to shorter legs., Lighter fabric that flows more easily does will not bunch up at your hips. This is great if you have curves. The skirt will fall nicely over your figure instead., Some pleated skirts come in a single neutral color, but many come in bright colors with intricate patterns. If the skirt you chose is bright in nature, pair it with a plain t-shirt or other top for a casual or formal look that makes your skirt the focus of the outfit.For example, say you're wearing a pleated skirt with a purple paisley design. Pair this with a light purple t-shirt for a fun, casual look. If you want something more formal, use a button-down purple blouse.

, Pleated skirts often come in bright, vibrant shades. If you want to add extra color to your outfit, opt for a bright pleated skirt. This can be paired with a neutral top, or a patterned top in a similar color.For example, say you're wearing a white and red polka-dot blouse for a top. Pair this with a bright red pleated skirt for a cute look.
Remember to tuck any top you wear into your skirt to highlight your waist.

, Pleated skirts are often appropriate office attire. If you want to wear a pleated skirt to work, your top can give the outfit a formal feel. Tuck in a button-down top into a pleated skirt or wear a formal blouse with a pleated skirt for a formal feel.Account for the style of pleated skirt as well. Bolder fabrics, like metallic fabric, should be avoided for work occasions.Instead, go with a pleated skirt in a played down solid color or one with a work-appropriate pattern like paisley or plaid.
Make sure to check your work's dress code before wearing a pleated skirt to work to make sure it's okay.

, Pleated skirts can be matched with plain t-shirts, tank tops, or other sleeveless tops for a night out. This can change the skirt from formal attire to informal attire.Also, think about a metallic skirt for a night out to give your look a bold style.


Make sure to account for the skirt's colors and patterns. Do not pair a skirt with a dramatic polka-dot pattern with a patterned top, as this can be overwhelming. Instead, pick a solid-colored top.

, Pleated skirts can be worn with a variety of footwear. Choose your shoes based on the occasion.


Heels are often worn with pleated skirts. This is great for formal occasions or fun nights out to give your skirt a classy vintage feel.Sneakers can easily be paired with a t-shirt and pleated skirt for a casual look.
For something in-between casual and formal, grab a pair of flats and pair it with your pleated skirt.

, If you're feeling a little chilly, or just want an extra layer of color, wear a cardigan with your pleated skirt. A cardigan can be slipped over a lighter top, or a sleeveless one, to add some warmth and layers to your outfit.Coordinate your cardigan with the skirt's color. For example, say you're wearing a pink plaid pleated skirt with a white top. Wear a pink cardigan to highlight the skirt's color.

If you're wearing a solid-colored and plainer top with a pleated skirt, add some extra flare with bold necklace choices like pendant necklaces or long, dangly chains.Make sure to account for the skirt. Do not choose a color that clashes with the skirt's color.

, Pleated skirts are great to highlight your figure. If you want to highlight your figure further, go for a belt that can be worn around your waist. This can create a very slimming effect when worn with a pleated skirt.Belts work great if you're wearing a top with a looser fabric, as it will help pull the fabric slightly closer to your body.

Choose a thicker material.,
Choose capris with minimal detail for a sleek look.,
Go with a wide-legged pair for a breezy look.,
Create curves with a tuxedo or trouser style.,
Avoid busy patterns for a slimmer look.",How to Wear White Pants1," When it comes to white pants, go with a thicker material like cotton or denim. Thin material, like linen, tends to show every little bump and crinkle. Transparency can also be an issue. Avoid pant pocket linings from showing through (or worse!) by opting for white pants made of thicker fabrics.If you find a pair you adore but they’re more see-through than you’d like, consider taking them to a tailor to have them lined.;
, White capris are a great summer look, but avoid the ones with large cuffs, big side pockets, drawstrings and elastic waistbands. These can unfortunately make you look frumpy or create the illusion of extra weight. Avoid heavy cargo styles for the same reason., Skinny jeans aren’t for everyone, and a pair of wide-legged white pants can look fabulous! Choose a flowy material to create a summery, casual vibe perfect for a beach party. Wear a white button-down in a similar fabric to complete this look., If you’re on the slim side, a loose-fitting pair of trouser cut pants can create the illusion of curves without swallowing up your small frame. Look for a simple design, with two pleats in front, and a flowy fabric. Add a bright-colored blazer to complete the look., Patterns can make white pants appear even less slimming, so try to avoid them. Look for plain white pants with a flat front and no additional detail around your problem areas. Avoid drawstring waists, pleats, large belt loops and big pockets; opt for sleek and minimal."

Go with a slim-fit pair if you’re petite.,
Wear flares or a boot cut style to balance curvy hips.,
Go up a size.",How to Wear White Pants2," White pants tend to swallow small frames; if you’re petite, avoid baggy fits and choose a slim-fit or skinny pair. These will show off your fit physique, rather than obscure it.With slim-fit and skinny styles, definitely make sure you choose a thicker fabric. The closer fit raises the risk of things showing through., If you have curves, slim-fit and skinny styles tend to emphasize problem areas. Balance out your curves by choosing a pair with a boot cut or flare legs.Go for a fabric that has some stretch to it, which will further disguise any imperfections.Look for small pockets and detailed stitching, as well. Both features can help create a more proportionate look.

, White pants can be tricky, since the color tends to emphasize flaws and makes everything appear larger (as opposed to black, which is known for its slimming effect). To combat this, choose one size up from your usual fit. Crinkles and imperfections will be concealed better, and your curves won’t look crammed into too-tight white pants."

Wear flesh-colored underwear under your white pants.,
Wear white on white for a slimming effect.,
Wear a top with a fun pattern or bright color.,
Elongate your legs with nude, metallic or white shoes.",How to Wear White Pants3," White underwear might show through even the thicker materials, but flesh-toned undies will provide coverage and invisibility. It’s still a good idea to check out your backside in a full-length mirror before you head out the door, though. Confirm there aren’t any panty lines, bulges, or other unflattering issues., If done right, white on white can actually create a long and lean look. Go with a pair of skinny jeans in white and pair them with a fitted white tank top and white blazer for a super crisp look. Finish the look off with white shoes, or silver metallic shoes and matching silver jewelry., Try wearing a classic pattern, like polka dots, with your white jeans. A blue chiffon polka dot top and matching polka dot shoes can create a fun, summery look. Add a pop of color and texture by adding a red leather handbag and red sunglasses.Stripes also look great with white pants. Try a navy and white striped top with a pair of fitted capris. Add a cropped denim jacket for a versatile look.

, If you’re on the short side, try heels or flats in white, nude, or metallic shades. A bright-colored shoe with white pants breaks up the illusion of a long, lean line, making your legs look shorter. Light or metallic shoes have the opposite effect. Opt for a pointed toe, which creates more length than a rounded toe."

Unwind with casual selections.",How to Wear a Patterned Suit," Try on a suit that’s streaked with stripes of various colors, widths and thicknesses. Stripes are a familiar part of many men’s wardrobes, and are one of the least daring pattern choices, meaning you can safely pull them off with just about any outfit. Stripes look great with a solid color shirt and tie or mixed with other patterns.Vertical stripes are excellent for formal wear. They are visually slimming and create a sleek, fitted look.
This style can be worn by men of any height, size or build, though if you're trying to cut an imposing figure, you may want to choose a pattern that accentuates your size rather than streamlining it.;
, Take a look at different plaid designs. In the world of men’s fashion, “plaid” is a kind of catch-all term that refers to patterns made from intersecting lines or squares. Plaids are very versatile. Smaller, more subtle plaid patterns can be worn in the boardroom or the bar, while louder patterns are an especially eye-catching way to do something a little different with your formal look.Plaid comes in a wide enough variety of sizes, colors and configurations that it can be worn with just about anything.
Some of the most common plaid patterns include glen, window pane, madras, Prince of Wales and checked designs like gingham.

, Dotted patterns are similar to stripes in that they add some texture and depth without looking garish or distracting. Like other patterns, dotted suits can be found in different colors, sizes and spacings. These will look smart with both muted accessories and louder patterns.Dots look the most refined when they are small and evenly spaced, as in bird’s eye and pin-dot patterns.

, One of the most recognizable of the traditional suit patterns, herringbone is characterized by its zig-zag chevron pattern. Most herringbone suits feature small-scale, understated designs, making them both tasteful and versatile. Herringbone is a pattern of choice among many executive professionals.Herringbone is one of the easiest to pair with different patterns.
This style is similar to chevron, though the jagged lines in chevron are usually thicker and feature more color variation.

, Houndstooth is another hallmark pattern that’s known universally, and can be found on dishes, furniture and wallpaper in addition to clothing. It is marked by asymmetrical tessellations of alternating colors. As long as you let the suit do most of the work pattern-wise, you can’t go wrong with houndstooth.Because of its sharp contrast, houndstooth looks best over simple, solid colored shirts and ties.

, Though it’s most commonly spotted as a tie print, paisley suits exist, and they say a lot about their wearer. With its oddly floral scattering of shapes, paisley is one of the more adventurous patterns, and one that should be worn with panache. It might not be practical for all occasions, but because it’s so visually interesting, it will get you noticed.Paisley should be worn with consideration. It is often thought of as a dated pattern, and may make you look out of touch if it’s not properly colored and fitted, which is the opposite of what you’re aiming for.

, When you’re first learning how to pull off patterns, play it safe and stick to solid (or very subtle) shirt and tie combinations. That way, the pattern design will stand out without creating a jarring effect. Keep your look consistent by complementing the color of your shirt and tie with the dominant hue found in the suit.A dark gold herringbone suit will look perfectly exquisite over a solid beige shirt and maroon tie, for instance, but when paired with a bright plaid shirt and pinstriped tie, it might be too much.
Solid shirts and ties can also be reworn more often without anyone noticing, as they're not as conspicuous.

, You also have the option of wearing multiple patterns in combination, but this requires a keen eye. Your best bet is to select patterns that are visually distinct so that there’s no off-putting blending effect. Make sure you also provide a contrast in the colors of your shirt, tie and other accessories. If you choose wisely, you can pattern your outfit head to toe.A light gray glen plaid suit will look right at home with a navy pinstriped shirt and pastel yellow dotted tie.
It’s best to avoid wearing the same pattern on two different items of clothing. If you do decide to duplicate patterns, make sure they’re different enough not to interfere with each other.

, A good rule of thumb is to keep smaller, more subdued patterns closest to your body and let them become larger and bolder as they move outward. This helps produce the appearance of depth. Try wearing pale or plain colored shirts with tight designs under an attractive jacket and trouser combination with a vivid pattern like glen plaid or black-and-white houndstooth worn over the top.Patterned vests and overcoats should also be consistent with your suit. Otherwise, it could throw off your completed outfit.

, In general, the guidelines for finishing with the right accessories are the same as when wearing a normal suit. Hats should match the color and pattern of your suit, while an overcoat can either match or offset it. Your shoes and belt should always be the same color, and preferably the same material, as should your metal watch band and tie pin. Use your best judgment in making sure these items go with the patterns you’ve picked out.Keep earth tones and neutral tones consistent. A tan or olive suit will go best with a brown belt and shoes, while black accessories should be reserved for grays, whites and matching blacks.
Though opinions have swung back and forth through the years, it’s usually a good idea not to wear black together with brown or navy blue.

, The next time you’re laying out clothes to wear to the office or art gallery, lend some flair to your look by incorporating a patterned suit. Search for suits in neutral, respectable tones like black, gray, navy and khaki. Pinstripes and dots are particularly popular for business attire, along with less conventional patterns like window pane.Avoid wearing brightly colored or mismatched suits for formal or professional engagements.

, Just like colors and materials, the patterns you clad yourself in should reflect the time of year. Designs like seersucker and madras plaid offer a splash of color and are breathable enough for the mid-summer heat, while dark patterns like herringbone and Prince of Wales plaid have long been favorites in the winter months. Take into consideration other types of seasonal clothing (shorts, scarf, overcoat, etc.) you might be wearing and match your colors and patterns accordingly.Think big, bright and bold in the summer and dim, modest and elegant in the winter.
In addition to pattern, shop around for fabrics that are light (cotton, linen) or heavy (wool, flannel) enough to keep you at a comfortable temperature., Show people your fun-loving side with snazzy chevrons, paisleys and multi-colored plaids. Feel free to go as wild as you please. Parties, night spots and celebrations are just a few situations when unusual styles and colors can be put to best use. Just be sure not to let the different parts of your outfit clash too much—you’re going for wacky, not tacky.There’s a difference between choosing a suit that says you’re laid back and carefree and one that says you escaped from a circus.

, Layer a patterned suit jacket over your favorite pair of jeans and a solid t-shirt or collared shirt of contrasting color. You have much more leeway as far as what goes with what in non-formal settings, so your options are nearly endless. Most iconic patterns are adaptable enough to go straight from the workplace to a friendly get-together with equal success.Trading your patterned suit bottoms for a pair of khakis can instantly make your outfit more casual.
Throw on a chic patterned jacket and tie when you attend a graduation ceremony, opening night at the theater or fundraiser event.

Accessorize in moderation.",How to Wear Thigh High Socks," Thigh high socks are inherently bold and definitely lean toward the sexy side of chic fashion, even if you carefully plan the rest of your outfit around them. Don't be too surprised if you raise a few eyebrows when you slip them on. Fashion is a mode of self expression and it shouldn't matter what people's eyebrows do.


That being said, there are definitely ways to wear thigh high socks without looking trashy. Balance is key, and pairing the socks with with casual or structured pieces can tone down a night look for going out, to a more casual or conservative outfit.
Since thigh high socks are somewhat provocative, they won't be appropriate for every setting or occasion. As a general rule, you should avoid wearing them at the office or to formal events. They usually work best when incorporated into a daytime weekend look.;
, If you've never worn thigh high socks, it's best to start with dark neutral colors.Black, dark gray, dark brown, and navy blue socks are some of the easiest to work with.


If you feel adventurous, consider choosing thigh high socks in a non-neutral dark color, like plum or burnt orange. The deep shade will still tone the socks down enough to make them look fashionable acceptable in most social circles.
Patterned thigh high socks are difficult to coordinate, but as long as the pattern is classy and the rest of the outfit is relatively muted, you might be able to make them work.
In most circumstances, you should avoid white thigh high socks and other notably light colors. At best, white socks will make it seem as though you're dressing up as a school girl, resulting in an overall juvenile or costume-like appearance. At worst, they could make your outfit look cheap rather than sophisticated.

, Textured socks are a great way to add a little visual interest without taking your look too far over-the-top. Keep the color of the socks relatively dark and basic, though, and avoid socks that have both texture and pattern.


For casual ensembles, consider ribbed or crocheted socks. Loose, scrunchy socks are also fairly casual, but they have an additional cute or youthful edge very 90s though so know what you're getting into with those.
For sultrier styles, consider choosing sheer thigh high socks. Avoid the fishnet look, however, since these socks can quickly make your style look desperate and cheap.

, If thigh high socks seem a little too bold for you, tone them down by layering them with tights or other socks. Doing so will keep more or all of your leg covered, providing extra coverage and added warmth.


Sheer tights are a favorite among many fashionistas.Choose tights that match the color of your socks to maintain an even, unbroken appearance and elongate the leg.
Patterned tights are a good choice if you want to make your outfit cute or whimsical. Since many patterned tights can seem too overwhelming when worn alone, slipping thigh high socks over them can actually downplay the effect and make the pattern seem less loud.
If you still want to show a little skin, consider wearing knee high socks over your thigh high socks. Choose two colors that are distinct from one another yet still neutral. You'll end up looking a little more covered without losing the seductive edge offered by thigh high socks in their natural state., Flats and moderately low heels work well with thigh high socks since they tend to seem subtle and classy.Most low heels work well with thigh high socks, but professional or sophisticated styles may work better than evening styles. As a rule of thumb, opt for shoes with a sturdy heel and closed, rounded/square toes. Oxford heels are one good option worth exploring.

, Boots look great with thigh high socks, too. Choose ankle high to knee high boots; anything taller might rise about the tops of your socks, which defeats the point of wearing them.


Both ankle boots and knee high boots work equally well with thigh high socks, so the choice is merely a matter of personal preference.
Color is actually a more pressing concern. If you match the color of your socks to the color of your boots, you can create the appearance of faux thigh high boots. If you want to keep your boots and socks distinct, however, you should make sure that the colors coordinate without matching.

, It's a bold choice that leans on the sexy side. But that's your decision.


Skip shoes with notably tall, skinny heels and pointed toes. These styles tend to have a sexy edge, which is fine under many circumstances, but it might be too much when paired with the naturally sultry thigh-high sock.
On a similar note, you should also avoid footwear that seems too loud, even if the style isn't necessarily sexy. Thigh high socks are a bold fashion choice, so if you pair them with equally bold or loud shoes, you might create a disjointed style instead of a coordinated one.

, This is one of the most important rules to remember when you're wearing thigh high socks. Since these socks lean toward the provocative side of fashion, you need to balance them out with conservative tops and bottoms.


In other words, you should avoid wearing your thigh highs with pieces you usually consider sexy. Pass on skin-tight garments, tops with a notably low neckline, or tops with an open back.
Keep your outfit fairly subdued in terms of color and pattern, too. Loud patterns may not make your outfit look too seductive, but they could make it seem too busy since they'll likely compete with your eye-catching socks instead of coordinating with them.

, There are plenty of tops that work well with thigh high socks. Oversized tops and proportionate flowing tops tend to keep the look more casual. If you want to make your look a little more sophisticated, gravitate toward structured garments.


Some good casual options include baggy sweaters, tunics, kimono-style blouses, and comfortable cardigans.
For something a little dressier, consider button-down blouses, fitted jackets, or fitted blouses with high necklines (think turtlenecks and Mandarin collars).

, Skirts and dresses are probably some of the easiest garments to pair with thigh high socks. Since thigh high socks highlight your womanly curves, they coordinate well with these naturally feminine pieces.


During the autumn and spring, you can pair thigh high socks with spring and summer dresses to prolong the garment's season. In cold winter months, thigh high socks work great with sweater dresses and other heavy winter styles.
Regardless of the exact style, try to stick with skirts that flow away from the body instead of hugging your hips. Good options include skater style skirts, A-line skirts, and circle skirts.

, Shorts and rompers both work well during the autumn and spring months, when warm weather just left or is just around the corner. Wearing thigh high socks with shorts and rompers will usually create a notably casual look, but this may vary depending on the style shorts you choose.


For instance, if you wear the socks with denim shorts, casual khaki shorts, or patterned shorts, you'll likely create a fairly laid back look.
On the other hand, if you pair the socks with structured, tailored shorts made from formal trouser material, you'll create something a little more savvy chic.
Note that rompers usually fall under “higher end” fashion when compared to shorts, so choosing a romper over shorts and a separate shirt is an easy way to stay stylish. Some rompers are still more casual than others, however, and the exact look will change depending on fabric, color, and pattern., To make the most of your thigh high socks, you need to find a good balance between “too high” and “too low” as far as your lower hemline is concerned.


The hem of your shorts or skirt should be high enough for the tops of your socks to show; otherwise, you may as well skip the socks and go for tights.
On the other hand, hems need to be long enough to avoid straying into “slutty” territory. If there's a chance that your undergarments could peek through from beneath your skirt or shorts as you go about your day, your bottom hemline is way to high.
As a general guideline, aim for 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.5) of space between the top edge of your sock and the bottom hemline of your skirt or shorts. This amount will vary depending on how long or short your legs are.

, If warmth is your primary interest, you could easily pair thigh high socks with a pair of skinny jeans. This is probably one of the most conservative ways to wear these types of socks.


Wearing the socks over skinny jeans still gives your style fashionable flair. You could technically wear thigh high socks under loose-fitting flared jeans, but since no one can see them, they won't earn you any additional fashion points.
The best way to do this is to match your skinny jeans and thigh high socks with knee high boots. You only want a little of the sock to show above the top of your boot; too much can look awkward and out of place.

, The exact accessories you choose will need to vary on your overall outfit, but as a general rule, stick to simple pieces that pull the look together instead of loud pieces that demand the spotlight.


Since thigh high socks are often worn in autumn and winter, scarves and hats are some of the most natural accessories you'll see.
Match the style of your accessories to the style of your overall outfit. Avoid berets and beanies, you'll look like you're straight out of a movie from 2005.

Try pink eye shadows.,
Choose a pink lip color.,
Dye your hair pink.",How to Wear Pink2," It has become pretty popular to use pink eye shadow recently. It can be tricky to pull it off, but try out different shades of pink eye shadow, and layer it with other shadows (e.g. gold) to find a look that you like. Remember, too, that pink eye shadow doesn’t necessarily have to mean hot pink. You can also pick more neutral shades of pink if you want a more toned down look.If you are worried about looking as though your eye is inflamed or infected, try using black eyeliner and mascara to help tone down the pink. It may also be a good idea to confine the pink shadow to the top lid, especially if you don't use another color to break up the pink.
The best way to find a pink eye shadow that looks good on you is to experiment. Since there are many factors that play into how the eye shadow will look on your face (e.g. eye color, hair color, skin tone, etc.) it is hard to pin down what shades will look best without trying them out.

, One of the most classic ways to incorporate pink into your makeup is to use a pink lipstick or lip gloss. However, though it is a very common color, it can be difficult to choose a color that will flatter you. Try out a few different shades to see what you think suits your skin tone and your personality.If you have pale or fair skin look for pinks in lighter, more sheer shades. If you have reddish undertones, choosing a peachy pink color will help to neutralize the redness in your skin.
If you have medium or olive toned skin you can probably pull off just about any shade of pink that you like. However, try to avoid pinks that have a blue undertone or you might end up looking washed out.
If you have dark skin, a bright and bold pink will look great on you. Avoid the more neutral shades of pink in order to avoid looking washed out. You can even opt for a more purply-pink color if you want to be adventurous.

, These days it is very trendy to dye your hair a more bold color. If you’re very adventurous, you could dye your hair pink. Though you can buy do it yourself hair color, for non-traditional hair colors, it may be a good idea to visit a professional salon so that you avoid damaging your hair unnecessarily.For a less permanent look you can use hair mascara, hair chalk, or temporary hair colors to put some pink in your hair for a night out.
Alternatively, don’t forget that you can always accessorize with pink hair accessories instead of applying color directly to the hair.

Pick out a cool pair of pink shoes.,
Try adding a pink hat or scarf.,
Carry a pink handbag.,
Paint your nails pink.",How to Wear Pink3," If you have a very neutral, but edgy outfit on, you can mix it up a bit by adding in a pair of pink shoes. They can be in whatever tone looks good with the rest of your outfit, and they can be whatever style you like. High heels for a big night out might work well. Try flats for a more laid back day time look.Your shoes say a lot about what kind of style you are trying to go for, so look for shoes that express your personality and personal style.
If you are wearing pink elsewhere in your outfit, try to choose shoes that are a different shade of pink to mix it up.

, A scarf will probably be easier to pull off than a pink hat, but if you find a pink hat that you love, then go for it. The trick with pink is not to over-do it. A scarf or hat is a great way to dress up an otherwise boring outfit.You can also try pink hair accessories. Try a pink headband, clip, or even a bow if you like them.
If you do want to wear more than one piece of pink, try varying the shade of each piece to give your look some character.

, If you’re wearing a neutral outfit (e.g. a white dress or plain denim jeans with a white/khaki top) carrying a pink bag with you can add a bit of flair. Try to keep the bag in line with the style you are trying to present. For example, if you are going for an elegant look, opt for a more neutral or pale shade of pink.If you want to go for an edgy look, find a bag that is in a bold, bright pink.

, Pink is a classic nail color choice, and you can find nail polishes in every shade of pink you can think of. Choose a shade that you like, or, if it is for a particular occasion, choose a pink that matches the tone of the event. For example, a soft pastel pink could be great for a more professional event, while a hot pink would be great for a big night out.


If you can’t decide, you can also try out a trend that is called ombre nails. This involves using a small sponge to paint each section of your nail a slightly different shade from bottom to top. This creates a sort of gradient appearance with dark colors at one end of the nail and lighter shades of the same color at the other end.

Opt for bootcut jeans.,
Wear the jeans over the boots.,
Check the length.",How to Wear Ankle Boots with Jeans1," The term “bootcut” isn't just for show. These jeans are fitted around the hips but flare out slightly below the knee, making them the ideal cut to wear over ankle boots and other boot styles.


Be careful when pairing ankle boots with jean styles that are cut wide down the length of the leg or those that flare out dramatically from the knee down. If you have shorter legs, these styles can make your legs appear even shorter when paired with ankle boots.;
, Instead of trying to tuck or hem these jeans, allow them to fall directly over the top of each boot, masking the boot from sight.


Avoid tucking and cuffing bootcut jeans. The extra material used to create the wide, open legs can look bumpy and unflattering when manipulated.

, Bend your knees while wearing both the jeans and the boots. If the jeans are long enough, they should continue to hide the top edge of the boots even when the material bunches in this manner.When worn poorly, ankle boots can break the visual leg line at an awkward place and cause your legs to look shorter as a result. By wearing bootcut jeans that sufficiently and smoothly cover the tops of these boots, you can prevent that broken, stubby look and help your legs appear longer.

"
"
Opt for skinny jeans.,
Choose the right length.,
Roll the hem into a cuff.,
Fold a hidden cuff.,
Rip off excess material.,
Scrunch up the jeans.,
Avoid bringing the hem beyond the upper edge of the boot.",How to Wear Ankle Boots with Jeans2," While there are several types of slim cut jeans, the “skinny jean” style is probably the easiest and most flattering to pair with ankle boots.


Fitted straight-leg jeans and similar slim-cut styles can be harder to manipulate since they don't hug your legs in the same way skinny jeans do, but if you choose to wear these jean types with your ankle boots, the same style principles still apply.

, Try on the skinny jeans without the boots. Ideally, the lower hem of each leg should fall to the approximate mid-point of the ankle.


The jeans can be a little longer than this, but try to avoid skinny jeans that fall below the ankle. Unnecessarily long jeans may look bulky when you fold or otherwise manipulate them.
Similarly, super short jeans that sit well above the ankle may not provide enough material for you to work with when creating folds or bunches.

, Cuffs are one of the easiest, most popular ways to pair skinny jeans with ankle boots. The cuff should bring the lower edge of each jean leg just above your natural ankle, revealing a thin strip of skin between the boot and the jeans.Note that the revealed strip of skin should be approximately 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide. A small glimpse of skin can help lengthen the visual leg line, but too much visible skin can create a large block that makes your leg look shorter.
You can use either a single cuff or a rolled cuff. Single cuffs work best on snug skinny jeans, but rolled cuffs can be used on multiple jean cuts.

For a single cuff, fold the bottom hem up once.
For a rolled cuff, fold the hem up once, then fold it over itself once more.


Stick with short, rolled cuffs if you have naturally short legs since long, single cuffs can shorten the visual leg line too much. Regardless of your legs' natural length, no cuff should exceed 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) in height.

, If you don't like the cuffed look, try folding the hems inward instead of outward.Keep folding until you create about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between your jeans and your boots.


It's best to stick with a single-fold cuff since rolled cuffs can create lumps. You'll likely need to wear skinny jeans that are snug against your ankles to make this option work; looser jeans may not hold the single fold well enough to last all day.
To improve the look's longevity, fold the hidden cuff and press it into place with an iron before putting on your jeans.

, This option is best considered when you're working with an old, beaten up pair of jeans that are already past they're prime. Instead of cuffing the bottom hem to an appropriate height, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut off the excess material altogether.


Use a tape measure and pencil to mark off the section you'd like to remove. Try to create around 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space in between the bottom of the jeans and the top of the ankle boots.
You can hem the cut edge, if desired, or leave it unfinished to create an edgier distressed look.

, Scrunching your jeans at the bottom hem or around the knees can raise the hem without cuffing or removing any of the material.This option will only work when you wear snug skinny jeans, however, since looser styles may not stay secure for very long.


When the hems naturally sit at the top of the ankle boots, you could let the jeans simply bunch up and rest at the top of the boot while letting the rest of the leg remain snug and smooth.
When the hems naturally fall below the top of the ankle boots, scrunch up some of the material around the knees and lower thighs. Continue until 1 to 1-1/2 inches (2.5 to 3.75 cm) of skin shows between the jeans and the boots.

, In other words, don't wear skinny jeans over your ankle boots or tuck them into the tops. You may run across both methods, but each one is generally considered a fashion faux pas by amateur and professional stylists alike.


Since the bottom of the legs don't flare out, the upper edge of the boot will create notable lumps and lines from beneath your jeans if you try to wear your jeans over the boots.
While it might seem tempting to tuck your jeans into the boots, doing so can actually make your legs look shorter and wider. This is true regardless of how snug your skinny jeans fit. Essentially, tucking them in breaks up the visual leg line, tricking the eye into believing that your legs end sooner than they should.

If the fit is off in the shoulders, then the blazer likely will not be a good fit for you at all.


When trying the blazer on, observe where the shoulder seam hits. If the seam hits past where your natural shoulder ends, then it is too big. If it hits closer to your neck than to the end of your natural shoulder, then it is too small. Look for it to hit right about where your natural shoulder ends.If you have broad shoulders, seek a style of blazer that has thinner or no shoulder pads. Large shoulder pads will accentuate your broad shoulders further. On the reverse, if you have narrow shoulders, then you should seek a blazer that has a little more shoulder padding.
While wearing the blazer, reach one arm across in front of you to grab the other arm. Observe what the shoulder pad of the blazer does while you do this: If it juts out past your shoulder, it is too big.;
, Buttoning the blazer should not cause it to stretch or pull at the buttons or along the back.


Look for a blazer that buttons easily over the largest section of your torso, whatever that may be.It should naturally follow the curves of your body without pulling, bunching, or wrinkling.
If you are busty, then it is best to search for a blazer that has more buttons, because these will help keep you in place. You may also have to buy a blazer in the next size up in order to accommodate your bust and then have it tailored in other areas to fit you best.To determine if a blazer fits properly in the bust, it should cover about half of each breast when you measure coming in vertically from the sides of your torso.Take note of the size and shape of the pockets and lapels. Both of these elements affect how the blazer fits and looks on you. Petite women look good with small lapels, while busty and plus-size women look best with large lapels. Also take note of whether the size and shape of the pockets flatters your body shape and flows with the fit of the blazer. Large pockets can add size to the hips, which is often undesirable., When you are standing with your arms straight down at your sides, the sleeves of the blazer should hit just about at the joint where your wrist and thumb connect.There are some styles of blazers with different sleeve lengths, such as three-quarter length, which hit just below the elbow, and bracelet length, which leave room to show off a watch or bracelet on the wrist.
Observe the details on the sleeves, as well, such as buttons. If you need to get the sleeves altered, lining or buttons can make it more costly. However, these accessories add a nice touch to the blazer.Look at the width of the sleeves. Wider sleeves tend to take away from the overall fitted look of the blazer, so look for one with more fitted sleeves or consider having the width of the sleeves altered., If the arm hole is too wide, it may restrict your arm movement and look sloppy, but if it is too small, then it can be uncomfortable to wear and limit your options for layering underneath the blazer., There is a flattering length and fit of blazer for every body type, and typically, appropriate blazer length is when it just touches the hips. Knowing what your body type is and finding a blazer to flatter it are key to choosing a great-fitting blazer.


Women with broad shoulders but straight hips should aim for finding cropped blazers. These tend to add curves to the waist and hips without further drawing attention to the shoulders. A blazer without shoulder padding would be best.For busty women, single-breasted slim-cut blazers are recommended.Look for blazers that accentuate the waist and avoid a lot of structure or decoration.Women with a body shape that is straight and lacks curves should aim for a blazer that is fitted. Blazers with belts added as accessories also help to add curves.If you have a pear-shaped body, a blazer that has some padding in the shoulders or a wide lapel and some length on it (e.g. it skims your hips) can help give the illusion that your top and bottom are more evenly sized.A blazer that tucks in at the waste a bit will still accentuate curves.

, A longer blazer is better suited for pant suits, while a shorter blazer is better suited for skirt suits.If you work in an office environment where suits are expected, then pay attention to where the blazer hits your hips. A blazer that skims the top of your hips looks less professional when worn with dress slacks than when it is worn with a nice skirt.
Pay attention to how you match your colors when creating a suit outfit. For example, a stark white blazer may not look the best with dress slacks or skirts that are shades of brown; in that case an ivory or off-white blazer would be a better match.

, The modern blazer is fitted to flatter more body types, and it can still be dressed up to look professional. A blazer with a more classic or boxy fit is also viewed as professional, but some delicateness and style are lost with those fits.Blazers with a classic or boxy fit are often recommended for women who are 50 or older.Especially when a blazer is white, these fits detract from the overall togetherness of the outfit and tend to make it look sloppy.
If your white blazer is not as fitted as you would like, but it fits well in all other areas, then use an accessory like a belt to give the appearance of a tighter fit. Find a small belt that fits around your waist and matches the blazer; neutral tones of black or brown would be best.

, Blazers come in many different styles, ranging from professional to casual.


If you work in an office with stricter dress code requirements, you will need to choose a white blazer that meets those standards, such as one with full-length sleeves and without flashy details. A white blazer with buttons will likely also be ideal here.
If you work in an office with a more casual dress code, then you will likely be able to wear a white blazer that has shorter sleeves, like the three-quarter length, and possibly ruching. A white blazer that does not have buttons or that you choose to leave unbuttoned will be acceptable in this environment.

, They give you the sophistication and cover-up you desire while still looking fashionable.White blazers look great over tops or dresses that are patterned. Take the dress code of your work environment into consideration when choosing a pattern; for example, a more subtle pastel pattern may be preferable to a large, multicolor pattern.
They create a more professional look than cardigan sweaters, which is desirable in many office environments.Use the white blazer to dress up a more casual sleeveless top or dress.
Layering a white blazer over a sleeveless top or dress affords you the ability to transition easily from the office to an after-work happy hour or get-together., Pairing a white blazer with jeans is a great way to dress up jeans without looking too professional.


A fitted blazer will go well with jeans that are slim fit, especially if the blazer lacks structure and flows with your body.However, it also looks great with a great flare jean.Cropped or cuffed jeans also pair well with a white blazer. With a casual tee underneath the blazer, you have a laid-back look that is perfect for grabbing dinner with friends or running errands.Which pair of shoes you choose to wear with the outfit also dictates how dressed up or down you want to seem. A white blazer with slim fit jeans and heels is more sophisticated, while a white blazer with cuffed jeans and sneakers or sandals is more relaxed.

,


A fitted white blazer will look great with almost any style of skirt or dress. Whether your skirt or dress is fitted or flowing, the blazer will add a touch of sophistication and shape to your body.
Patterns or neutral tones will both be a cute match with a white blazer. Colorful, large patterns will be highlighted by the whiteness of the blazer, but pairing it with a black or charcoal gray dress or skirt will look excellent, as well.
Be sure to wear heels to elongate your legs. The blazer could have the opposite effect, so heels will help give the appearance that your legs are long.

, A casual white blazer with shorts is fun way to show off your fashion sense.Jean shorts, especially high-waisted jean shorts, would look cute when paired with a white blazer. Aim for a casual tee underneath the blazer and dress up the outfit a bit with heels or ornate sandals. You could also dress it down by wearing sneakers.
A white blazer would also look great with shorts that are a solid color but not necessarily denim material. You could pair a white blazer with coral, black, red, or navy shorts, for example.

,


Pairing a white blazer with some detailing, like studs, with a casual tee and leggings gives some visual interest to the outfit without dressing it up too much.
This is a great way to dress up an outfit when you have a meeting or an appointment but then intend to exercise afterward, for example. It gives you the ability to move from one to the other without a complete wardrobe change.

However, there are acceptable variations on the standard tutu, as well, such as more flowing fabrics that simply seem like a ballerina ought to be wearing them. In general, tutus are short but they don't have to be; there are mid and three quarter length tutu options as well.


Tutus may be one layer or layered.
Tutus can be made from a variety of colors, or be one single color.
Tutus can be plain (just the netting fabric) or there may be embellishments, such as a ribbon border, some ribbon bows, beading, sequins, etc. The fancier it looks, the better it will be for evening wear, while less embellished versions are great for day wear.
Some tutus are even reversible (different color each way around), making them more versatile within your wardrobe.
Real ballet tutus are a bit full on for fashion wear. But there's nothing stopping you trying...;
, Visit fashion stores that carry skirts. Many of the younger-fashion oriented stores will carry at least one tutu, such as Claire's, Sanrio's Hello Kitty stores or your usual favorite fashion store.

, Traditional colors are white, black, pastel pink or other shades of pastel. In more recent times, tutus have branched out into other colors, such as hot pinks, neon greens, rainbow shades and more. When deciding on the color, be sure to consider your existing wardrobe and whether the color match will enable you to make use of your current clothes. If not, you'll be up for buying new matching clothing and accessories too, which can add up quickly.


If you're not sure, stick with black or white or silver/gold; these are nice and neutral and are easily paired with many other color schemes.

, The tutu is already providing sufficient bulk for your look, so it's good to keep the other items as fitted and small as possible. Let the tutu be the statement piece.

, For a more modest look with a short tutu, simply wear it over the top of your leggings or jeans. It spices up the usual and gives you a girly touch without having to bare the legs.


Wear skinny jeans; anything bulky or baggy will look odd and overwhelming. Consider matching the color, although blue or black denim are just fine with most other colors.

, Pair it with tights or bare legs. Add some flats and you're good to go.


During winter, a thin turtleneck sweater, chunky tights, short boots and a tutu makes a very original (and cute) statement.

, After all, the two have exactly the same origins––ballet––so it makes for a super sweet combination. Try to match or complement the tutu and ballet flats color wise.


For the ultimate ""ballet-hits-the-street"" look, wear a wrap cardigan, don some leg warmers and put your hair in a bun.
Shoes could also be heels but with the standard ballet shoe ribbons wrapped from heel right up your legs.

, Wear heels. Add your sunglasses and head out of the house, filled with confidence that you look chic.


Wear a denim jacket for the weekend.
Wear a suit jacket for work or more formal occasions.

, This is the ultimate in simplicity and yet, it's a color combination that rocks and you'll look amazing. Pair with accessories in the same color combination for a complete look.

, Wear the tutu with a camouflage tank top, combat boots and a studded belt. Gel your hair into a mohawk. This says ""fashion statement plus""!

, This can be chunky jewelry, long necklaces, colorful ribbons in your hair, etc. Try on a few of your favorite pieces to see what looks best.


Girly wear such as pearl and ribbon necklaces can be a nice fit with the tutu skirt.

, There is no perfect tutu look; feel free to experiment with your own ideas, with the pieces you already have in the wardrobe and your own style. Ultimately, if you like what's staring back at you from the mirror, you'll feel comfortable.

Wear a chain belt with jeans.,
Enhance a simple skirt or dress.,
Try adding a chain belt to work clothes.,
Define a halter jumpsuit with a chain belt.",How to Wear a Chain Belt1," Jeans look great with almost any kind of belt, including chain belts. Try pairing your favorite jeans with a chain belt threaded through the loops or hanging around your hips to emphasize your curves.


Consider the cut of the jeans when deciding how to wear the chain belt with them. For example, if they are high rise jeans, then you would probably want to position the chain belt around your natural waist. If the jeans are low-riders, then wearing the chain belt around your hips would probably be the most flattering.
Consider other features of the jeans like embellishments before pairing it with a chain belt. For example, a pair of jeans that has crystal studs all over the back pocket might look over-accessorized with a chain belt.;
, If you have a solid color skirt or dress that could use a little something extra, then try wearing a chain belt with it. Position the chain belt near the waistline of the skirt or dress, or down around your hips.


For example, you could dress up a little black dress with a gold or silver chain belt. Or, you could dress up a white denim skirt with a gold or silver chain belt.

, Chain belts can be included in your office attire as well. Try wearing a gold or silver colored chain belt with a pair of black pants, a simple white top, and a black blazer.Avoid wearing a chain belt down around your hips at work. This may a look a bit too casual. Thread it through the belt loops on your work pants or skirt and keep it around your natural waist.

, Jumpsuits work well with a chain belt because it helps to add definition. Try wearing a chain belt with a jumpsuit around your natural waist.Be cautious about wearing too many other accessories with the chain belt and jumpsuit. The chain bet and jumpsuit will make quite a statement on their own. Keep the rest of the look simple with understated jewelry or no jewelry at all.

Thread it through the belt loops.,
Wear it low on your hips.,
Define your natural waist.",How to Wear a Chain Belt2," If the pants, skirt, dress or jumpsuit you are wearing has built in belt loops, then threading the belt through the loops may be the best way to wear a chain belt with this garment. Thread the chain belt through the loops and secure it in front or slightly off to the side.If you are concerned about the belt loops hiding the chain belt, then just thread it through every other belt loop or even just the two loops on the side of your pants, skirt, dress, or jumpsuit.

, Chain belts emphasize the area that they cover, so wearing a chain belt low on your hips can emphasize the curves of your body. If you want to make your hips seem wider or simply draw attention to them, then position a chain belt around your hips.


Be sure to cinch the belt tight enough so that it will stay on your hips, but not so tight that it will cause discomfort or create a muffin-top effect.

, Belts of all kinds are great for defining your natural waistline. You can wear a chain belt around your natural waistline to define your figure and emphasize your waist.Your natural waistline is the smallest area of your waist, usually around your belly button or slightly above it.

Wear different washes.,
Use your denim shirt as a jacket.,
Know the power of accessories.,
Wear the right shoes.",How to Wear a Denim Shirt1," Wearing jeans that are the same wash as your denim shirt can make your attire look monotonous, bland, and overly casual. Mix things up by wearing different washes. The stronger the contrast, the better. A light blue or white washed denim shirt can look trendy when paired with dark wash skinny jean or boot-cut jean.;
, When you wear a denim shirt with jeans is to wear something beneath your denim shirt. Moreover, denim is considered a neutral in the fashion world, so you can mix and match a variety of colors with it. Try wearing a pink camisole tank top or a black fitted t-shirt with embellishments beneath an open-button denim shirt. For an edgier look, wear a sparkly metallic top beneath a light or medium-wash denim shirt and above dark wash jeans.

, While denim matched with denim will create a fairly casual look, you can dress it up for a day out with friends by wearing the right sort of accessories. Simple metal jewelry, like gold or silver hoop earrings or bangle bracelets, can give your style a chic upgrade. Funky, chunky gems, on the other hand, can give off a more carefree appearance.

, Since denim on denim tends to be along the more casual side, ultra feminine strappy heels may not make the best choice. Instead, opt for a good fashion boot. A brown fashion boot plays into the casual nature of denim while a black boot adds a subtle hint of class.

Pair a fitted denim shirt with classic trousers.,
Match a denim shirt with leather pants.Fitted leather pants paired with a slouchy denim shirt creates an edgy, rock-n-roll atmosphere.,
Wear leggings if your shirt is long enough.",How to Wear a Denim Shirt2," Try wearing the shirt with a pair of straight-leg trousers in black, gray, pinstripe, or khaki. Tie the look together by throwing a fitted blazer over your denim shirt. Choose a blazer in a classic color, like gray, navy, or white, to create a classy business casual look. Finish the look off with closed-toe heels or flats and simple jewelry.

, You can wear the shirt on its own, or you can highlight your feminine form by wearing a sparkly metallic tank top beneath it. You could also try a lace-up boot or some funky, chunky jewelry in gunmetal gray to further glam this look up.

, For tunic style denim shirts that extend past the rear and down to the mid-thigh or longer, leggings can create a look that is both casual and edgy. Black leggings make the look relaxed, but you could also try a metallic print legging for a funkier twist. Because of how form-fitting leggings are, though, they generally do not look right with shorter shirts.

"
"
Wear denim with printed shorts.,
Try on white shorts or capri pants.,
Match denim with khaki.,
Gravitate toward simple footwear.",How to Wear a Denim Shirt3," Since denim is a fairly simple material, you can usually get away with wearing a loud print on your shorts. Bold gray and white stripes are a good example. Make sure that the shorts fit well and appear to be in good shape, though. On the other hand, the denim shirt you pair with the shorts can have a distressed look as long as the denim itself is not too faded or washed out. Finish the look with bold metal accessories in clean, strong lines.

, White is a clean color that works well with just about any wash of denim, but because it gives off an air of crispness, it tends to work better with clean-cut denim shirts that are not distressed. For loose cotton capri pants, try a more fitted denim shirt. For snug capri pants or fitted white shorts, a slightly looser denim shirt may be in order.

, Long, full-length khaki pants can look out of place with a simple denim shirt unless paired with other pieces that can ""class"" the denim up or make it look more professional. Khaki capri pants and shorts do not have this same issue, though, since shorter pants are automatically more casual than long pants by nature. As such, you can get away with wearing a denim shirt with plain khaki bottoms.

, Denim shirts and shorts are both fairly casual pieces, so casual sandals and flats usually make better footwear options than dressy heels or boots. If you wear the denim shirt with a dressy capri pant, however, you could get away with a kitten heel sandal or an embellished flat more easily.

Create a feminine look with a long, flowing skirt.Denim shirts may not scream ""feminine,"" but because of their simplicity, they can be matched with a feminine skirt to create an interesting contrast.,
Go for texture and print.,
Bring out your leggings.,
Go for classier shoes.",How to Wear a Denim Shirt4," Bohemian style maxi skirts, in white, brown, or patterned, work especially well when matched with a clean, non-distressed denim shirt. Since these skirts tend to by loose-flowing, they generally work best with fitted denim shirts or loose denim shirts that are belted around the waist to create form.

, Girly floral skirts or lace skirts are another way to play off the casual, boyish look of denim to create a surprisingly feminine look. You can either wear these textures and prints on loose-flowing maxi skirts, or you could wear them as tighter-fitting mini skirts and knee-length skirts. You could even try a ruffled skirt, if it flatters your body shape. To create a more noticeable feminine edge, leave a light-wash button denim shirt open and wear a soft white or plain pastel beneath it.

, For a fall, winter, or early spring look, match a pencil skirt made from heavy material with a denim shirt, leggings, and fashion boots. If the shirt is loose, tuck it in to create more form; otherwise, you can leave it hanging out. The skirt can look casual, like a cargo khaki skirt, or it can be a little dressier, like a wool or twill skirt. For a chic twist, throw a colored or patterned blazer over your shirt or tie a fashion scarf around your neck.

, In this instance, you want your footwear to match the style of your skirt rather than the style of the denim. If you have on a loose Bohemian skirt, flats or sandals may work best. For more fitted skirt styles, though, you might want to try fashion boots or closed-toe heels. If you are trying to play up your feminine side, a strappy kitten heel might give your look the boost it needs.

However, choosing a bold color can set your tulle skirt look apart from the rest. It can add interest and change your whole look.For example, you can try wearing a black, purple, red, or dark blue tulle skirt for something more dramatic. Or, go for a fun take on the tulle skirt look with a neon colored tulle skirt, such as lime green, hot pink, or tangerine.;

For a more formal look, go for a floor length maxi skirt.Keep in mind that no matter what length you choose, you can dress it up or down depending on your needs.

, Tulle skirts vary in fullness as well. You can find an extra full tulle skirt, or find one that is more subdued. Try out a few different levels of fullness to see which one looks best on you.Tulle skirts are flattering on just about anyone because they flare out at the hip. Therefore, they make the waist seem smaller and produce an attractive A-line effect. However, a skirt with less fullness may not give the same effect as one that is full.

, Some tulle skirts are layered and simple, while other tulle skirts may have other details, such as tiers, pleating, a ruffled hem, or a cloth underlay.Try out different styles to see what you like and what works best for your body type.


Pay attention to the waistband as well. Some tulle skirts have wide waistbands, while others have very slim or even nonexistent waistbands. A thicker waistband may define your waist more, while a slim waistband provides more subtle definition.

, Tulle skirts are the height of feminine fashion, so why not go all the way with it?By choosing a top that is fitted, you will be balancing out the look and enhancing your feminine curves.Try pairing your tulle skirt with a soft, form-fitting scoop neck sweater or a delicate fitted blouse.
Look for tops with feminine cuts as well. For example, you could choose a top that reveals a bit of your chest, shoulders, or back.

, Lace is another great way to intensify the femininity of your tulle skirt. Try wearing a tulle skirt with a form fitting lace top or a top that has lace details.For example, you can look for a tank top with lace around the neckline, a long sleeved top made entirely of lace material, or a blouse that has a wide strip of lace down the front.

, A masculine touch can make for an interesting pairing, and emphasize the contrast between your skirt and top. Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plaid flannel shirt or a plain white button down shirt to get this contrasting effect.Other ways to add a masculine touch to your tulle skirt look is to wear a denim shirt or a band t-shirt.Both of these tops will contrast with the feminine, fluffy skirt in a fun way.

, Pairing your tulle shirt with a simple top can tone down a tulle skirt for casual daytime activities, and make it easier to transition your look from day to night.Try wearing your tulle skirt with a plain white t-shirt, band t-shirt, or a solid tank top for a toned down daytime look.

This can take your look from feminine to ultra-feminine in a heartbeat.For example, you could try wearing a pearl necklace or a pair of pearl earrings. Other great feminine jewelry options include statement necklaces, bow shaped earrings, and anything pink.
If you are trying to downplay the look, then you may want to opt for something very simple or skip the jewelry altogether.

, The shoes you wear can also change the tone of your outfit. You can dress up a tulle skirt with some high heels, or dress it down with a pair of flats.To build more contrast into your look, try wearing a pair of sneakers or combat boots with your tulle skirt.

However, it is best to avoid anything that laces up your ankles because it may make you look like you are wearing a ballerina costume., Wearing tights with a tulle skirt is a good option in cold weather, but you can also go bare-legged if the weather is warm enough. If you decide to wear tights with your tulle skirt, then choose a color that will complement your skirt.


Black tights are usually a good option, but you can try other colors as well. For example, you could pair pale pink tights with a pale pink tulle skirt, or purple tights with a purple skirt.

, Adding a belt to your tulle skirt look can be a great way to accentuate your waistline.Try wearing a wide belt around your natural waist for a slimming effect.

Wear heels or nice shoes.",How to Wear Faux Fur1," If you are wearing your faux fur coat to a special event or just want to look nice, remember that simplicity is the key to elegance. Because faux fur is such a lush and eye-catching material, make the your faux fur coat the statement piece of your outfit.Try not to wear especially bright clothing, or anything that catches the eye too much. Also don’t wear any other bold textures like snakeskin or pleather.;
, In general, mid length or long length faux fur coats tend to be more formal, whereas short coats tend to be more casual. Try to wear a longer coat if you are trying for a more formal look.If you have a short faux fur coat that you want to wear in a formal context, pair the short coat with a mid length or short dress along with heels to dress up the coat. A long dress or skirt can look mismatched when paired with a short coat.

, If you are trying to dress up your faux fur coat, pay attention to its color. In general, more traditional colors like tan, brown, black or white faux fur coats tend to work better in elegant outfits. Compliment the color of your coat by wearing other neutral colors.You can still wear non-neutral colors and still look formal and elegant, just try to wear dark or muted tones like deep blue or dusty rose as opposed to brights or neons.

, Even the most chic faux fur coat can be somewhat chunky, so to stay looking formal it’s important to keep the other pieces in your outfit somewhat fitted.Wearing a pencil dress or gown with a straight silhouette underneath your faux fur coat keeps your outfit looking formal.
You can still look formal and stylish wearing pants with your faux fur jacket. Wear dark or neutral-colored skinny or straight leg pants with your fur coat.

, Because your faux fur coat is your statement piece, cut back on the amount of accessories that you normally wear. Instead of wearing multiple large and chunky accessories, try to wear either a few thin and minimal accessories, or one bold accessory.For example, you could wear a couple of thin bangles, a ring and stud earrings. Alternatively, you could wear a pair of diamond drop earrings or silver chandelier earrings and no other accessories.
Try to wear good quality, formal looking accessories if you are trying to dress up your coat. Wearing plastic or low-quality accessories will detract from the classiness of your coat.

, Even if the rest of your outfit is perfect, wearing the wrong pair of shoes can completely change your outfit. If you are going for a chic look, wear a pair of heels or heeled boots with your fur coat. If you don’t want to wear high heels, wear a pair of low-heeled shoes that still look dressy.Try to wear neutral colored shoes or shoes in muted or dark tones.
If you are going for a formal look, don’t wear shoes that look clunky or are overly bright,

Select a shirtdress that looks good on you.,
Select the right bottoms.,
Wear the right shoes with it.,
Accessorize!,
Be confident.",How to Wear a Shirtdress," There are many different styles of shirtdresses out there and finding the one that accentuates your skin tone and body shape is vital to wearing it to advantage. Make sure to get a second opinion before buying your shirtdress.;
, Wearing the right clothing on your legs is just as important as finding the right shirt for your body. Shirtdresses look great with leggings, skinny jeans, or jeggings. Most shirtdresses will be versatile and can be doubled up. However, it is important that you try your shirtdress(es) with multiple styles to see which looks best with what.

, Like everything, you need the right footwear to pull off the shirtdress. Running and skater shoes, rubber boots, clogs, flip flops, and sandals are definite no-nos. However, a pair of ballet flats, boots (any style, as long as they match your outfit), or heels can look fantastic. Like the bottoms, one pair of shoes will go with a variety of styles but it is still very important that you try them out first with your shirtdress and bottoms for the best results.

, Accessories such as belts, necklaces and scarves can do wonders to a plain shirtdress and bottoms. If your shirtdress is not fitted (i.e. baby doll or just a bigger shirt), a belt can really pull it all together. A tasteful bit of jewelry or a matching scarf can also look nice.

, Sometimes wearing a shirtdress may feel awkward or weird as it is a style that not everyone chooses, though it can be quite trendy. There are also many critics of this style, particularly when paired with leggings. However, as long as you feel good in and about your new outfit, there is no reason for you not to wear it with confidence. When you go out in your shirtdress, remember that you are unique and beautiful, as is this amazing outfit that you have put together. Give it the final accessory of a smile and show your outfit off with confidence.

, Do the same things you did with the pants except you don't need to check for if it's adjustable. Most shirts don't have that feature.

, Maybe headbands. If they hurt your head, get rid of them. If they keep falling off, get rid of them too. You also should check if they make you look crazy, just in case...

, You all know what we mean. Bras, underwear, that kind of stuff. Again, if they don't fit, just get rid of them. Don't worry about the way they look. No one's going to see them.

Wear neutrals with a brightly colored coat.,
Accessorize your coat for a funky look.,
Coordinate your shoes with the rest of your outfit.",How to Wear Faux Fur2," If you are going for a casual or everyday look, you have a little more leeway with how you want to style and accessorize your outfit! If you are wearing a traditionally colored neutral faux fur coat, you can either stick to neutrals, a mix of neutrals and muted tones, or neutrals and one bold color.


For instance, if you are planning a casual neutral outfit, you may decide to pair a tan faux fur jacket with a white sweater, dark jeans, and a stylish pair of black and white sneakers.
If you want to wear an outfit that includes a bold color, you may choose to wear a light brown faux fur coat with a bright red dress and dark brown low-heeled booties.

, One great thing about faux fur is that it can come in all sorts of fun colors! Brightly colored fur coats are very trendy and fun, but it can be difficult to know how to wear them. The best rule of thumb is to wear neutral or muted tones with a bright coat so that your outfit isn’t doing too much.


For instance, if you have an emerald green shaggy coat, you may choose to pair it with a simple white T-shirt, black skinny jeans, a brown purse and white trendy sneakers.If you have a colored faux fur coat in a muted color, you can get away with wearing one bright color along with neutral or muted tones. For instance, if you have a light pink faux fur coat, you can wear it with light blue jeans, a black top, a bright red beanie and gray sneakers.

, Accessorizing a faux fur coat for a casual look is fun because you can wear bold or even tomboy-ish accessories for a funky look.For a causal, feminine look, wear a chunky rose-gold watch with your coat along with a pair of hoop earrings.
For more of a tomboy look, wear a dark beanie and a large pair of sunglasses.

, Just as with accessories, you have more shoe options if you are wearing a faux fur coat casually. Take cues from your coat and the rest of your outfit when choosing what kind and color of shoes to wear.If you are already wearing one or two bright colors, wear neutral-colored shoes. For instance, if you are wearing a white faux fur coat with dark red pants, wear neutral colored shoes like tan boots or black sneakers.
Wear sneakers for a more causal outfit. If you are running errands or going for a funky look, wear a pair of sneakers along with your faux fur coat. Go for a trendy pair of sneakers rather than tennis shoes.
Wear heels for a combination of casual and chic. Create an outfit that falls in between casual and dressy look by wearing an outfit like a shaggy tan fur coat, leather leggings and black stilettos.

Wear fur faux accessories for a more subtle look.,
Limit the number of faux fur accessories you wear.,
Mix and match faux fur coats and accessories carefully.,
Dress a faux fur vest up or down.",How to Wear Faux Fur3," Faux fur isn’t only for coats; there are countless faux fur accessories out there including faux fur hats, headgear and stoles, faux fur-trimmed boots and gloves, and even faux fur purses. Wearing a faux fur accessory is a good way to wear faux fur if you don't want to go for the full-on look of a coat., Although faux fur accessories are more subtle than a faux fur coat, it's still a good idea to wear one or two faux fur accessories maximum.If you have a bold accessory like a faux fur bag, try to make this your only faux fur accessory. If you have a more subtle faux fur accessory like faux fur trimmed gloves, you can pair your gloves with a faux fur hat. Try to wear approximately the same color faux fur so that it looks like they match.

, It’s hard to pull off multiple faux fur garments, especially if one of those garments is a faux fur coat. The best rule of thumb is to not wear other faux fur items if you are already wearing a faux fur coat, but it is something that you can do if you pick the right piece.If you are already wearing a fur coat, pick a small dark or neutral colored faux fur accessory. For instance, if you are wearing a brown faux fur coat, wear a black faux fur headband or brown faux fur-lined gloves instead of wearing a large faux fur handbag or scarf.

, Faux fur vests are trendy items that can be extremely glamorous or funky and cool, depending on how you pair them. Creating your outfit around your faux fur vest is very similar to creating an outfit around a faux fur coat, except that since vests don’t have sleeves, the kind of top you wear under your vest is very important.


For a chic, glamorous look, wear a tank top underneath your faux fur vest so that your arms are exposed. You may also choose to wear black leather leggings or dark colored skinny jeans, along with a pair of heels.
For another chic look, wear a long sleeved black dress under your vest with a pair of patterned heels.For a more causal look, wear your fur vest over plaid shirt tucked into a pair of dark blue skinny jeans.

Wear shoes you feel comfortable in.",How to Walk Gracefully," The first step to mastering a graceful walking posture is to make sure your head is always in a natural, upright position, instead of bent forward or pointed towards the sky. You will know that your head is in the right position if your chin in parallel to the floor.


You should also be conscious of not jutting your head out in front of you, which can often happen when you walk in heels. If you notice that you are doing this, try to lean back slightly so that your head is in line with your spine.;
, Try to keep your shoulders down and back. You want to avoid having them hunched forward or elevated near your ears at all times, whether you are walking or not.


If you're not sure about the position of your shoulders, try standing with your back against a wall. You shoulders should be far enough back that they both touch the wall, but not so far back that they prevent your upper spine from touching the wall.

, If you try too hard to avoid hunching over, you might find that you are arching your spine. This is not ideal posture either, so try to relax a bit! Your spine should be as straight as possible, without any noticeable curves in your shoulders or low back.


The easiest way to check the straightness of your spine is to look in a full-length mirror. Your spine should create a straight line all the way from your neck to your tailbone. If you're arching your back, you will probably notice that your butt is sticking out a little.

, Your legs are the foundation of your posture, so it's important that they are in the correct position when you are walking. Not only will the proper leg position make you appear more graceful, but it will also help prevent back pain. To achieve the ideal posture, the distance between your feet should be about the same as the width of your shoulders. You should also avoid locking your knees.

, Your abdominal muscles are very important for maintaining good posture. Try to consciously draw your lower belly in while you walk.


If your abdominal muscles are not very strong, a good exercise regimen can help you both strengthen your core and improve your posture.

, In order to perfect your walking posture, you will need to devote some time to practicing. If possible, videotape yourself while walking and then watch the footage carefully to look for ways in which your posture can be improved.


You can also try practicing walking with great posture by balancing a book on your head. The more you do it, the easier and more natural it will become.

, In addition to being mindful of your own posture and poise, be mindful of the way others carry themselves. If you see someone who has a particularly graceful walk, make note of her posture and try to learn from it.

, You don't need to stare at everyone you pass by, but don't be afraid of making brief eye contact. Even if your posture is perfect, you will not look very graceful if your eyes are always looking at the floor.


It might help you feel more comfortable if you imagine a straight line on the floor and focus your attention on a spot far in front of you. This will help you walk straighter, and it will make it appear as though you are looking straight ahead, without having to worry about direct eye contact., Nothing will ruin your otherwise graceful walk more easily than fidgety hands. As you walk, hold your arms gently by your sides and allow them to move ever so slightly. Avoid crossing your arms, putting your hands in your pockets, or touching your hair and clothing with your hands. All of these actions will make you look anxious and uncomfortable.It's important to find a natural-looking arm position. Your arms should not be swinging wildly by your sides, nor should they be so rigid that you look like a robot.
If you can't seem to hold your arms at your sides without looking too stiff, try holding a clutch. This will give your hands something productive to do so they don't fidget., Sudden movements will make you appear jittery and uncertain of yourself, while calm, deliberate movements come across as graceful and confident.Be especially mindful of how fast you are walking if you feel anxious. It can be easy to pick up the pace without realizing it. The more deliberate you are with your movements, the more natural this kind of walk will become.
While you want to move slowly, make sure your movements are not unnaturally slow.
If you are walking in heels, it is even more important not to walk too quickly. You will probably find that your natural stride is slightly shorter when you are wearing heels, so walking quickly will look awkward. It will also make you more likely to lose your balance., There's no need to have an artificial grin on your face all the time, but it will help you appear more confident and graceful as you walk if you have a pleasant expression on your face., If your shoes are too loose, it will be very hard to walk in them. If they are too tight, you will be in so much pain that your walk may look very awkward. Make sure to take some time to walk around in them at the store to make sure they really fit well and don't pinch your feet.If you find that your shoes are slightly too big, you can purchase inserts to add a little bit of cushion and prevent rubbing., High heel shoes come in many different shapes and sizes. In order to walk gracefully in them, it's crucial to choose a pair that is right for you.Start off with a lower heel and gradually work your way up to a higher heel. Keep in mind that not everyone is capable of walking in super high heels. Typically people who have smaller feet need to wear shorter heels.
Shoes with super narrow heels are much more difficult to walk in, so look for a slightly wider heel if you are not used to walking in heels.
If your ankles tend to get wobbly when wearing heels, you may want to look for a pair that has ankle straps.
Heels with pointy toes are usually less comfortable than other styles.
Don't choose high platform heels unless you are experienced at walking in heels.

, Walking in heels is a little tricky, and you can easily come across looking clumsy and awkward if you are not used to walking in them. Before you go out in public in your heels, make sure you take some time to practice walking in them around the house. Keep these pointers in mind when walking in heels:Always put your heel down first when taking a step.
Take smaller steps than you would if you were wearing flats.
Watch out for soft or uneven surfaces that might catch your heel.

, You can walk gracefully in almost any kind of shoe, so don't feel like you have to wear heels. If you prefer flats, just work on improving your posture and conveying confident body language, and you will look very graceful.


You may want to avoid walking around in flip flops, as they make a lot of noise, are bad for your posture, and may cause you to trip, none of which is very graceful."

Keep your mechanical watch wound.,
Clean your watch often.,
Store in a dry place.",How to Protect Your Watch," Wrist jewelry has the potential to scratch either the sides or the face of your watch. Only fabric or thin leather bracelets would be acceptable along with a watch. Avoid metal on the same wrist, no matter what. Friendship bracelets, knitted and crocheted bracelets are not harmful either., Specifically no warmer than 140 °F (60 °C) and no colder than 32 degrees. High heat or cold may affect how lubricants inside the mechanics of the watch allow it to operate.


The temperature doesn't have to be extreme to be harmful. For example, the considerable heat generated by a warm shower along with the humidity involved make a dangerous environment for a watch.

, If you know you're going to play sports or go rock climbing, leave your watch off to avoid damage. While most watches can take some hits, too many will add up to serious damage. This too is why you must always avoid dropping the watch. The mechanics inside it can also get banged-up too much.


Alternatively, purchase an inexpensive watch that you wouldn't mind getting dirty or scratched. There are also more pricey options designed for wear and tear if you're unable to avoid high activity entirely. Bertucci A-2S is a good, sratch-resistant watch.

, While acceptable to the human body, some chemicals in cosmetics may interfere with water resistance or the operation of the watch. Keep your watches out of your bathroom while you ready yourself for the day. As a rule, have the watch be the last thing you put on when dressing., Usually found in televisions or laptops, keep your watch away from common electromagnetic devices. Never allow your watch to rest on your laptop. Magnets may adversely affect how the metal components inside the watch work which in turn will affect its operation. This will not apply to digital watches, or any watch which does not rely on gear mechanics.


If unavoidable, look for ""anti-magnetic"" watches which include technology to prevent damage from magnets.

, Take your watch to a professional to be serviced every three to four years. Make sure to have your water resistance tested after every battery change; the act of changing the battery compromises the water resistant seal. If your watch is a Quartz time piece, you may want to consider having it serviced entirely after every battery change.


It's almost always best to have your batteries replaced by a professional. For the most part, you should only change your own watch's battery if it is both digital and not water resistant. Digital watches are without the complex mechanics which might get damaged when changing a battery. If not water resistant, there's no seal to check after the fact.
At any given moment, make sure the crown of watch is screwed or pushed in. Having it out may also affect water resistance in some watches., If you have a mechanical watch (it should not say ""quartz,"" ""kinetic,"" or ""eco-drive"" on the face) it will need to be rewound every once and a while to maintain the time. Unscrew the crown of the watch (if necessary) and begin to turn it clockwise (away from you). This may take anywhere from 20 to 40 turns. Stop winding once you encounter resistance, then turn back the crown five or six turns to reset the lubricant and reduce some of the strain on the watch's mechanics., Dip your watch in warm, slightly soapy water. Rinse it with clean water and dry it with a soft cloth. Do this every couple of weeks, or whenever your watch gets dirty. Regular brushing with a soft toothbrush is also helpful to get rid of tiny debris or anything stuck in the wrist band.


If you've got a leather band that needs cleaning, dip it in the same soapy solution, brush it and rinse with clean water. Leave out to dry, but be sure to keep the damp leather away from any source of heat.

, Humidity and dust are the two main dangers in storing your watches. Have designated dry place (away from your bathroom is a general tip) and try to keep the original packaging of all your watches for an easy storage space. Never store your watches face down to prevent scratching the face. Be sure to wear any one of your watches from time to time to monitor their operation; don't let a broken watch gather dust.


If you're storing watches near one another, make sure to have something to keep them from contact, to avoid scratches. For something on the cheap use acid-free tissue paper wadded up as an effective barrier.
Don't use bubble wrap as protective storing. The packaging can retain moisture, causing rust or other damage."

Once you have your earrings in the buttons, you can keep them in a box, dish, or drawer.Avoid coat buttons or buttons that have a single loop in the back.

, Store each pair of earrings in each compartment.


If you'd like, you can spray paint the box a different color, or decorate it with stickers.

, Use a thick, sturdy ribbon, such as grosgrain. It will last longer and will be less likely to tear or run.Something that is between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters) will work the best.

Get some mesh.,
Take apart a picture frame.,
Paint or decorate the frame, if desired.,
Trim the mesh so that it is slightly larger than the opening in the frame.,
Glue the mesh down to the back of the frame, and let it dry.,
Lean the frame against your wall or dresser.,
Hang your earrings onto the mesh.",How to Organize Earrings2," This can be a sheet of plastic canvas, window screening, tulle, or even lace. Plastic canvas is a great choice, because it comes in all sorts of colors and is easy to work with; you can find it at an arts and crafts store. This holder will work best for hook earrings, but it can work for stud earrings as well.


If you are using window screening, consider spray painting it a fun color first. Paint one side first, let it dry, then flip it over and paint the other side.
For a rustic frame, try burlap instead. You can even add a silhouette or letter to it with some fabric paint and a stencil., Discard the glass panel and the backing, or save them for another project. Alternatively, you can also use a simple, wooden frame base from the craft store; it doesn't come with a glass panel or backing, so it'll be less work for you.


Don't worry about the color of the frame; you can always paint it.

, If the frame is the right design, but the wrong color, you can spray paint it to suit your taste.You can also decorate your frame with glitter, glitter glue, or colorful rhinestones. Let everything dry completely before continuing.

, Turn your frame over so that the back is facing you, then lay the mesh down on it. Use painter's tape or masking tape to mark off where you need to cut the mesh. When you are done, cut the mesh using the tape as your guideline. Peel off any excess tape.


Don't use marker. Not only will you mess the frame up, but the marker will be hard to see on the material.

, Draw a line of glue around the outer edges of the opening on the back of the frame. Quickly press the mesh into the glue. You can use hot glue or tacky glue for this. If you used tulle, lace, or burlap, you can use fabric glue instead.


Different types of glue will take different amounts of time to dry. Tacky glue will take a few hours while hot glue will set almost immediately.
If you'd like to hide the glue, outline the inside edges of the mesh square with glue, then cover it with strips of ribbon. Make sure that the ribbon does not stick past the opening of the frame.

, Because you took the backing out, the frame won't be able to stand up on its own. You can't put the backing in again either, because it will ""block"" the mesh and prevent you from inserting your earrings. If you want to make your frame a little more stable, there are a few things you can do:


Cut a piece of ribbon and tie it into a loop. Glue it to the back of your frame, and use it to hang it up on the wall.
Use a frame holder or frame stand to hold up your frame.Hot glue a short dowel or two to the back of the frame to make a stand.If you'd like, you can paint the dowel to match the frame.

, This earring holder is best for hook earrings, but it can work for stud earrings too. Simply take the earring backing off first, poke the earring through the mesh, then pop the backing back on.

Cut several strips of felt that are the same length as the inside of your box.,
Roll each piece of felt into a tight tube.,
Pack all of the felt tubes into the bottom of the box.,
Consider covering the tubes with a scrap of fabric for a more finished look.,
Set your earrings in between the felt tubes.",How to Organize Earrings3," The best wooden box to work with is something that is relatively shallow, between 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to cc centimeters) deep. It is best for stud earrings, but it can work for hook earrings too. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint for this.


For something more girlish, paint the outside of the box with fine, scrapbooking glitter. Be sure to coat it with a glossy sealer afterwards to keep the glitter from shedding, however., If you plan on wrapping these strips around a pencil (for extra support) make them 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide.If you don't plan on doing that, make them 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 2032 centimeters) wide instead.

, If you'd like, you can roll the felt around a short dowel or pencil to make it sturdier. Make sure that the dowel or pencil is long enough to fit inside the box., To make this permanent, glue the felt rolls seam-side-down into the box.Make sure that all of the felt tubes are facing the same direction. If you can still see the bottom of the box, you will need to make more felt tubes.

, Cut a piece of fabric the same width as the inside of your box, but a few inches/centimeters longer. Drape it over the top, then tuck the fabric in between the felt tubes. Tuck any excess fabric between the first/last tubes and the sides of the box., This holder works best for stud earrings, but it can also work for hook earrings if you insert them sideways.

Choose a brown suit shade.,
Default to wool suits.,
Wear light blue or white with a light brown suit.,
Consider a colored shirt for dark brown suits.,
Default to warm-toned ties.,
Try a black or patterned tie with a white shirt.,
Pick a patterned shirt if you’re eschewing a tie.",How to Wear a Brown Suit1," If you don't have a brown suit yet, you may be wondering what shade of brown would work best for you. If you have dark hair and/or a dark or ruddy complexion, a darker shade of brown will complement your features. That said, a light brown or tan suit is better for professional use, especially in warmer climates.Dark brown suits are better if you like to incorporate color into your outfits.
Lighter browns will go better with neutral features of an outfit, as well as pastel colors.;
, In terms of fabric, wool is best. It is natural and durable. It also breathes well, looks great, and can be woven into many different weights and textures.The best type of wool will be labeled ""worsted"" and/or ""high-twist.""
Cotton is an acceptable material for men's suit as well, especially if you live in a warmer climate. Go for a cotton suit with a bit of lycra woven in for added stretch and color retention.

, Crisp, clean white or a light shade of blue are the best colors for a button down shirt beneath a brown suit. For a bit more formal look, go with white. Light blue, meanwhile, balances many lighter shades of brown very well.Beige and tweed can also be considered variations of light brown. As such, suits and jackets of these colors will also look best with light blue or white shirts.

, If your suit is on the darker end of the brown spectrum, you have a bit more flexibility regarding the color of your shirt. For instance, consider a light brown or a bold jewel tone, such as emerald, ruby, blue, or purple.White is still the best option for more formal events, and ivory can look great with especially dark brown tones.

, Reds, oranges, and softer yellows compliment many browns, especially lighter and moderate browns. A muted red or burnt orange tie on a light blue shirt beneath a mid brown suit is a classic, reliable look., For the most formal way to wear a brown suit, wear a black tie on a white shirt. Thin black ties will look especially good. If you want to go with a white shirt but don’t need to be particularly formal, you have more freedom to experiment with lively, patterned ties.You can even get away with a jolt of bright color on a tie that is paired with a brown suit and white shirt. For instance, a blue or green tie can brighten up an otherwise neutral look.

, If you’re wearing a brown suit but don’t need a tie, you have lots of options regarding a shirt. Stripes and gingham patterns, especially with reds, oranges, or purples will work well as long as they’re complimented with a dash of confidence.A plaid that incorporates greens and/or blues can work well too.

Pair a brown suit coat with other pants.,
Forego a collared shirt.,
Play around with multiple layers.",How to Wear a Brown Suit2," One of the best features of a brown sport coat is its versatility. They don’t need to be worn with matching pants; many are intended for use in less formal outfits. They can even be worn with a pair of well-cut blue jeans.Darker denim washes tend to look better with light brown sport coats, while lighter denim matches well with either tan or dark brown options.
For the especially bold, consider pairing colorful slacks with a brown suit coat. Coral or salmon shades will go especially well.

, You don’t always have to wear a button up shirt beneath sport coats. Even a well-fit white or black t-shirt can work well. Grey can work too, especially as a thicker long sleeve.One good “dressed-down” look packs plenty of stylish punch: all black with a brown sport coat.

, Lightweight sweaters or knit shirts can look great beneath a brown sport coat. Wear them without a collared shirt beneath. Either crew necks or v-neck options are fine. A different shade of brown can look particularly good, such as a tan sweater beneath a dark brown sport coat.Shades of green will work well in layers too, particularly those that have undertones similar to those of brown, such as olive or dark green.

Select shoes carefully.,
Match your belt to your shoes.,
Avoid matching your tie to your pocket square.",How to Wear a Brown Suit3," Brown suits should be paired with either brown or burgundy shoes. However, the particular shade of the shoes is important. There needs to be a distinct contrast between the color of your shoes and the color of your suit.In general, look for a shade of brown or deep red that is darker than the color of your suit.
Avoid pairing black shoes with a brown suit.

, This is one of the most well-known rules in suit fashion. It’s hard to beat a pair of rich mahogany wing-tips with a belt made from matching leather. Slight variations are acceptable, but wearing shoes and a belt of significantly different colors risks looking youthful or sloppy., If you’re planning to wear a pocket square with a brown suit, use it to compliment your tie, but don’t match it exactly. A well-chosen pocket square can make an outfit, especially if you’re able to complement colors from several other items.For instance, if you’re wearing a deep red tie on a white shirt, try a yellow pocket square to make your suit pop and provide contrast to the color of your tie.

Wear a brown suit for semi-formal or business casual contexts.,
Consider another colored suit for an interview.,
Keep brown out of the courtroom.",How to Wear a Brown Suit4," Brown suits are best for dinner parties and warm-weather celebrations, such as weddings. They are also great in relatively informal but professional office environments., Job interviews are not an appropriate time to wear your brown suit. Even if you look great, brown sends a comforting and reliable vibe, but also risks making you seem simple, old-fashioned, or overly intellectual. Other colors, such as charcoal and navy, send the message that you are productive and forward thinking., Some professional environments still favor specific formal attire. Law is one of these realms. The courtroom calls for more traditionally assertive and powerful colors, including dark blue and black. Keep your brown suit for days at your practice."

Transfer your jewelry into another bowl filled with glass cleaner for a few moments, and then use your soft brush to wipe away any residual dirt. Rinse under water and let dry.


Simply spray the window cleaner onto your jewelry and wipe dry with a lint-free cloth. If you are allergic to any chemicals, you may want to avoid spraying them, as they will find their way onto your skin.







, If you want to step it up a bit, baby your gems and diamonds with an ultrasonic cleaner. These devices combine high-end technology and efficiency to provide unstoppable gem-scouring power! Bonus: Ultrasonic cleaners are completely hands-off when it comes to grime. You won't even have to get your hands dirty.

, Baking soda has an amazing amount of cleaning uses, and can also get the grime off of your jewelry. Combine the baking soda with water to create a paste, then use a soft brush to gently scrub your gems and metals. Next, dry and polish the ring with a lint-free cloth and your jewelry will shine. (If your jewelry is very dirty, a stronger chemical solution will get your diamonds and gems sparkling better.)

, If you use ammonia, you'll know that it is a very strong chemical — cut the solution with water. Typically, one part ammonia to three parts water will make a safe solution that won't harm your jewelry.

This method isn’t suitable for silver pieces that have porous stones or gems, such as pearls, shells, or turquoise, or for antiques (such as candlesticks) or jewelry that are affixed with glue.For this method, you will need:2 tablespoons (30 g) each of salt and baking soda
2 tablespoons (30 ml) liquid dish soap (optional)
2 cups (480 ml) boiling water
A baking dish (or bowl) large enough to fit the pieces you wish to clean
Aluminum foil to line the baking dish
The silver pieces you want to clean.;
, Line the dish with the aluminum foil. Make sure the shiny side of the foil is facing up.Then place your sterling silverware into the baking dish.

, Pour the salt, baking soda, and dish soap over top of the silver pieces, and then pour the boiling water on top. Stir the solution to help dissolve the salt and baking soda.


Make sure all the silver pieces are touching the foil, as the tarnish from the silver will transfer to the foil.

, Let the silverware sit in the solution for five to 10 minutes. Don’t be alarmed if it smells like rotten eggs: this is just the sulfur on the silver.To help the process along, use your fingers to gently rub and move the silver around in the solution., Remove the silver from the solution and rinse it under warm water. Gently buff the pieces with a soft cloth to dry and polish the silver.


Because silver is so soft, it can scratch easily. Be sure to use a soft and non-abrasive cloth to polish, such as microfiber or lint-free flannel.Always polish and buff silver in the direction of the metal’s grain, and never in a circular motion.

, For jewelry decorated with porous gems, watches, antiques that have pieces held with glue, or other delicate silver pieces that can’t be immersed in water or cleaned with the electrolysis method, there are still several options for cleaning.


Mix one tablespoon (15 ml) dishwashing soap (something that’s phosphate-free and ammonia-free) with one cup (240 ml) warm water and stir well. If you want, use a hand blender to mix up some suds.
Dip a soft cloth into the soapy water and wring out the excess. Use the damp cloth to clean the silver. Rinse out the cloth with plain water, and wipe off any leftover soap residue. Use a fresh cloth to buff and dry the silver.

, Take a tablespoon (15 g) of baking soda and mix it with just enough water to make a paste. With a soft-bristled toothbrush or cloth, clean the silver with the paste, making sure to get into the nooks and crannies with the bristles.


When the silver is clean, rinse it under warm water or remove the excess paste with a damp cloth. Buff it dry with a clean cloth., In a small bowl, whisk together 1 teaspoon (6 ml) lemon juice and 1.5 cups (327 ml) olive oil. Dip a cloth into the mixture, wring out the excess, and use this to polish your silver.


For small pieces that can be immersed, soak them in the oil and lemon solution and place the bowl into a small saucepan. Fill the saucepan with enough water to bring the bowl off the bottom and turn the heat to medium. Bring up the water temperature and keep it hot, but not boiling, for 15 to 20 minutes.
Remove the pot from the heat and take the silver out of the oil and lemon juice solution. Gently scrub the silver with a soft toothbrush.
For either the hot bath or the polishing method, rinse the silver with hot water to remove excess solution, and dry it with a soft cloth., Glass cleaners like Windex can also be used to clean silver. Spray some glass cleaner directly onto a soft cloth or soft-bristled toothbrush.Use the cloth to clean the silver, and then either rinse the piece under warm water or wipe off the excess cleaner with a damp cloth.


Dry and buff the silver with a soft cloth.

, Anything that contains sulfur will cause silver to tarnish. To prevent this from happening, keep your silver away from things like:Sweat
Rubber and latex
Food items like mayonnaise, mustard, eggs, and onions
Wool
Lotions, creams, and beauty products

, Since there are so many things that can tarnish silver, it’s a good idea to remove your jewelry when you go swimming in chlorinated water or do household chores (to keep the silver away from the chemicals).


Sunlight can also have an effect, so take your jewelry off any time you plan on spending time in the sun., Moisture can cause silver to tarnish, so store your silver somewhere that isn’t too hot or too damp. You can also keep camphor,silica gel packs, chalk, or activated charcoal to the storage area to help remove some of the moisture.Store silver away from direct and indirect sunlight to prevent the sun from causing it to tarnish.

, To store silver, seal individual pieces in sealable plastic bags. Push out as much of the air as you can before closing the seal. This will prevent the other metals in the sterling silver from oxidizing."

, Use a clean toothbrush, and do not use the toothbrush on your teeth afterward. Gently rub the toothpaste into the jewelry as though you were brushing your teeth. If it gets gummy, add more water.


Make sure to clean between any cracks or ridges in your ring. Use the toothbrush like you would use it on your teeth, brushing gently, firmly, and thoroughly.
You should clean your ring every few weeks to months, depending on how often you wear it. Consider dedicating a toothbrush to ring-cleaning, and do not use it for anything else.

, After a little while, rinse the jewelry and watch it shine! You can use oils or anti-oxidizing agents (citric acids, no-ox, tarn-x, etc.) to promote and prolong the shine. If you need heavy-duty cleaning, use denture bonding agents like Fix-O-Dent, which will practically sandblast your jewelry if you brush them lightly into the material.

Try rinsing with water.,
Use a Q-Tip.,
Use a precious metal cleanser.,
Soak the ring in water and ammonia.,
Follow these steps to rid your ring of tarnish:


Wrap the inside of a bowl with aluminum foil.,
Varnish gold and silver rings with nail polish.,
Consider taking your ring to a jeweler.,
Clean your ring with alcohol swabs.,
Use an ultrasonic cleaner.",How to Clean Rings3," If your ring is stained with dirt, dead skin, blood, lotion, food, or other grime, try rinsing it with water before you use more abrasive cleaning agents. Fill a bowl with clean, filtered water, and rub the ring gently between your fingers as you hold it in the water. Let your ring dry in the sun.


Don't use any towels or napkins to try to clean your ring, since it could scratch the surface or ruin any stones present. Don't pat it dry with a 100% cotton cloth.
It's important to use thoroughly filtered water in this process. Try putting a magnet in a flour sifter, then running your tap water through that before using it to clean your ring. This will eliminate any metals containing magnetic properties—these metals are the ones that could ruin silver, gold, or other precious metals.

, If your ring isn't too dirty, you can swab off the grime with a cotton bud or Q-Tip. Dip the ring in lukewarm water and wipe the dirty spots. Let your ring air-dry. Do not try to scrub your ring, as this may cause damage.

, Buy a cleaning product from the store that has the specified precious metals in your ring on the label—it should be easy to find. Look for a cleaner that comes with a cloth for application. Never use any regular house cleaner in order to clean rings, especially if your ring is made with any precious metals. Use a cleaner, not a polishing element, which serves a different purpose altogether.

, To loosen dirt and grime, let the ring sit for 20 minutes in a solution of one cup warm water and 1/4 cup ammonia.


Rinse the ring in soapy water.
Scrub the ring.
Rinse in warm water and leave to dry.

,
Mix one cup warm water and one tablespoon baking soda in the foil.
Place your ring in the water-soda mix, making sure it touches the foil.
Leave your ring in the mixture for 10-30 minutes, or until it is free of tarnish.

, Brush a coat of clear nail polish onto the ring so that the coat of gold or silver doesn't wear off, and so that rust doesn't grow on it. If your ring leaves green or colored marks on your finger, coat the inside with a light layer of nail polish to prevent staining.

, If the ring is very important to you (e.g. a wedding ring or a class ring), consider taking it to a jeweler to be professionally polished. Most stores will provide a free cleaning or give you a solution and polishing cloth to use.


A jeweler can test for the presence of precious metals, as well as the quality of those metals. This information will help the jeweler decide which cleaning agents are safe to use.
This is especially important for engraved rings. Cleaning a ring with engravings on it could potentially wipe off the inscription or design. If your ring has important engravings on it, take it to a jeweler.

, Make sure not to scrub too hard. If the grime doesn't come off when you wipe it, you may need to try a heavier-duty solution.

, Ultrasonic cleaning machines can clean jewelry in a matter of minutes using high-frequency sound. You can find these machines in a variety of models and prices. They can be a convenient way to quickly clean your jewelry at home. However, ultrasonic cleaners can damage some jewelry.Your local jeweler can tell you if an ultrasonic cleaning machine is right for your jewelry and recommend an appropriate model.

Use an old toothbrush.,
Dry the quartz crystals in the sunlight.,
Remove iron stains with a high pressure water tool.,
Soak overnight in oxalic acid to remove iron deposits.,
Remove stains by soaking in a store-bought solution.,
Remove algae deposits by soaking the crystals in bleach.,
Perform the cleaning in a well-ventilated area.,
Wear gloves when handling any type of acid.,
Dispose of the acid waste properly.",How to Clean Quartz Crystals," If you have just a few quartz crystals or crystals that are only slightly tarnished by clay, you can use an old toothbrush to clean them off. Simply wet the toothbrush with water and scrub the quartz crystals in your hand.You can even use scouring powder and a steel brush for tougher stains, as quartz is a very durable material.;
, If your quartz crystals are covered by a large amount of clay, you can place them outside in indirect sunlight for several hours to let the clay dry and crack. Once the clay is sufficiently dry, you should be able to brush off the remnants.You may need to repeat this process several times.
Be sure not to place the crystals in direct sunlight because this could cause them to heat up too quickly and become damaged or cracked.
This method will only work to remove dried clay from your quartz crystals. If the quartz is covered in iron deposits, you’ll need to use an oxalic acid method.

, Most iron stains can be removed with a high pressure water gun. Simply shoot the water spray at the quartz crystal and watch the stains disappear. This will work for most iron stains on your quartz, leaving only some slight staining in the cracks of the crystal.You can also try removing many of the iron stains with a high pressure air tool.

, If your quartz crystals have only a small outer layer of iron, you should be able to thoroughly clean them by soaking them in a weak solution of oxalic acid overnight. Put the quartz crystals in a plastic bucket with the oxalic acid and cover the bucket overnight.You can rinse the crystals with a garden hose or in the sink the next day. Be sure to stopper the sink so that you don’t lose any of the crystals.
Oxalic acid can be purchased from most drug stores in powder form.

, You can purchase a cleaning solution called Iron Out at most home improvement or household stores (like WalMart). Simply soak the quartz crystals in the cleaning solution and watch the stains disappear. You may have to let the crystals soak for days or even weeks for them to become completely untarnished.Be sure to rinse the quartz crystals with water when you finish.
If you want to make your own Iron Out cleaning solution, you can combine 33 grams of sodium dithionite, 28 grams or sodium bicarbonate, 59 grams of sodium citrate, and 800 milliliters of water. Simply swirl the mixture around until all of the chemicals are dissolved in the water.

, If your quartz crystals are covered in algae deposits or other minerals, you can try cleaning them with household bleach. Soak the crystals in a bowl filled with water-diluted bleach and let them sit for several days.Be sure to rinse the quartz crystals well after taking them out of the bleach solution.
Let the crystals dry thoroughly (for at least one day) before you begin any other kind of chemical cleaning.

, Whenever you are cleaning quartz crystals with oxalic acid, you need to do it in a highly ventilated area. These fumes can be very harmful to you if you inhale them. Acidic fumes can be poisonous to animals and humans., In addition to being harmful if inhaled, acid can burn you if it comes into direct contact with your skin. Be sure to wear rubber gloves when handling oxalic acid and while cleaning quartz crystals.Make sure to wear rubber gloves and not fabric gloves. The acidic residue could remain on the fabric gloves or seep through to your skin.

, Since oxalic acid waste is considered a hazardous material, you need to neutralize it first before you can dispose of it. At the end of the cleaning process, the oxalic acid will be in a liquid form. You need to add garden lime (CaO) to the liquid until there is no longer any visible reaction.You can do this outside on the ground and wash away the remnants with a hose. Or you can do it by using a funnel to pour the spent oxalic acid into a gallon jug and add the lime in there. Then simply throw away the jug and its contents in a trashcan or dumpster.

Take the end out of the solution and gently scrub it with a soft toothbrush, and rinse the end under warm tap water.,
Dry the end and inspect again.,
Use toothpicks and pipe cleaners to really give a shine between stones.

",How to Clean Old Jewelry and Bring Back the Sparkle and Shine," No matter what kind of stone it has, you need to make sure it is not loose before you clean the piece. Take your finger or a hairpin (any small pointy object) and try to see if you can wiggle each stone around in its setting. If it does wiggle, then you can stick in thin paper inside it for a while.;
, If there is, DO NOT immerse in water. It will lose its foil.

, If your piece has small, foil-backed stones, you have to carefully wipe the tops of the stones with a damp cloth, being careful that no water seeps onto the mounting.

, Assuming that there are no foil-backs and the stones are all secure, you must still proceed with caution at this stage. Test the smallest end of the piece by immersing it in a solution of 1/2 cup of warm water, 2-3 drops of dishwashing soap, and 2 drops of household ammonia.

, Be careful not to let the water fly onto the rest of the piece.

, Is it shinier? Do the stones look all right? If so, you can immerse the entire piece and use a toothbrush to loosen the grime and rinse the piece under warm water. Repeat as needed and dry.

Store your jewelry properly.",How to Clean Fake Jewelry," There’s no hard and fast rule as to when it should be cleaned. Generally, the rule of thumb is the more you wear it, the more frequently you need to clean it. Clean it about once every few months or when it starts to look dull.


Remember that fake jewelry is not genuine gold or sterling silver and does not have precious gemstones. Even though sterling silver does tarnish, it should not be cleaned the way you would clean fake jewelry or costume jewelry. ""Real"" gold does not tarnish at all.
If you are having trouble deciding what is classified as fake jewelry and what is real, keep in mind that plated jewelry is considered ""authentic."" Since the top layer of metal is authentic silver or gold, it is considered ""real"" jewelry, even though it is not solid gold or silver all the way through. So, you can use regular jewelry cleaner to clean gold- and silver-plated jewelry instead of the methods provided.If you’re not sure if a piece of jewelry is real or fake, have a jeweler test the metal and the gems for authenticity.;
, Notice if it has any gemstones on it. If it does, then you need to be careful how much liquid you apply around that area.


The liquid might get underneath the gemstones and loosen the glue under the gemstones, which might make them fall off later. Also, too much water could ruin the foil backing that makes fake gemstones appear sparkly.
Don’t let any water pool and slide under them so the glue holding them down doesn’t loosen., These common products most people have in their homes work well to get at tough-to-clean crevices or around gemstones. You could also try a magic eraser.


Your Q-Tip should start to show signs of dirt and grime removal. The end of it should start to get dirty.
Make sure the toothbrush is new, and that it hasn't been used before. You don't want to transfer material on an old toothbrush onto the jewelry. Obviously, don't use the toothbrush again after you use it to clean jewelry.Rub the dry soft toothbrush or Q-Tip on the jewelry to remove verdigris. Verdigris is the green gunk that builds up on some costume jewelry. Q-Tips and soft toothbrushes are a bit more abrasive when they’re dry, so they may do a better job of scraping off the gunk. If you still can’t get it off, try using a toothpick., Lemon has been used for a long time to rid jewelry of the oxide layer that forms on metals with the passage of time. You might want to add a little baking soda to the lemon.Lemon is a natural acid and rubbing a half cut lemon on jewelry can hasten the process of cleaning. You can put the silver jewelry in a cup with lemonade with some salt for a night. Lemon works especially well on silver.You could juice a lemon in a small plate, and then rub this juice over the jewelry that you intend to clean, and then use a rough cloth (or scotch bright) to rub vigorously against the jewelry.

, Soak the jewelry in the solution, and then use soft toothbrush to get into corners and holes.Cleaning fake jewelry in vinegar can leave the chains shiny. The soft bristle tooth brush can help if the jewelry contains gems by getting in cracks. You can simply apply the vinegar to a sponge, and use it to clean the jewelry.
Another natural product that can be used to clean jewelry is olive oil. Olive oil will make it shine, but make sure to wash it off. You could also use a dental tablet and dissolve it in water. Then, let the jewelry soak for a bit and scrub gently with a toothbrush

, This not only increases the chances of making the jewelry look pretty, but it also makes it smell good. Put as little water on the jewelry as possible, though, and limit your jewelry's exposure to the water. Water can tarnish and rust costume jewelry if it sits for too long.


Use a wash cloth to gently clean the jewelry. It’s usually not a good idea to let fake jewelry soak in water for a long time as it can ruin the look or finish of the jewelry. This approach can work well on gold jewelry with gem stones.
Or, pour hot water into bowl. Place salt, soda, and dish-washing liquid into bowl. Place the jewelry on top of foil, and let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse the jewelry in cool water, and dry the jewelry completely with soft cloth.

, Baby shampoo is a milder shampoo, so it can be a good cleaning agent for fake jewelry. Shampoo can be a good approach to cleaning pearls, especially.Mix together one drop each of baby shampoo and water. Use a soft toothbrush or Q-Tip to clean hard-to-reach spots. Mix it until it is about the consistency of a thick soup. If the mixture is too thick, add a few additional drops of water.Rinse the baby shampoo off quickly in cool water, and dry with a clean, soft hand towel or microfiber cloth.

, There are many different cleaning products around the house that people often use to clean fake jewelry. Lens cleaner and toothpaste can be effective on some costume jewelry.


But be very careful! Read the instructions and cautions labels. Don't use lens cleaner on precious metals, and be aware that paint or finish may come off. Also don't use if you have sensitive skin or on earrings.
Toothpaste is less problematic when it comes to cleaning jewelry. Just apply the toothpaste to a brush, and rub it on the piece of jewelry. This method can be used on different forms of fake jewelry, such as bracelets.

, Fake or impure metals will deteriorate quickly if not using the correct polish.


You can buy polish for either gold or silver items in many jewelry or department stores. Keep in mind that some regular jewelry cleaners, usually meant for the real deal, are too harsh to use on costume pieces.
Simply soak the piece of jewelry in the polish for no longer than 30 seconds, then remove and wipe it gently to avoid scraping or bruising the jewelry. You might want to use a toothbrush after dipping it into the solution.

, Then take a small bowl, and pour the alcohol into it. Soak the jewelry in it for half an hour.


Then take the jewelry out, and wipe off any excess alcohol on it. Leave it out to dry for 15 minutes.
If every part isn’t clean, wipe it with an alcohol wipe or repeat the process. You could put your earrings in peroxide, and let them soak at least 2 to 3 minutes. The peroxide might bubble or fizz, which means your earrings are really dirty, and you should probably leave them in longer.
If it looks like you are rubbing off more of the finish than the gunk, then stop. You may be scrubbing too hard. Rub gently so you don’t mess up the finish.

, After applying the mixture and cleaning everything off, immediately rinse the piece off in cool water. Rinse just enough to get the soapy water solution off of the jewelry.


Dry it with a blow dryer. Immediately after you rinse off your jewelry, place it on a towel to soak up any excess water. Blot away excess water with the towel. Then, set your blow dryer to a cool setting, and use your blow dryer to quickly dry the jewelry.
Move your blow dryer around the piece to distribute the air. Drying it quickly makes it less likely to rust and develop water spots. Continue drying the jewelry with the blow dryer until it is completely dry.Try not to hold the blow dryer directly above areas with gemstones for long periods of time especially if you decide to use a warmer setting. You don’t want the heat from blow dryer to melt the glue holding them down.

, Since anything water-based can potentially tarnish your costume jewelry, even perfume and lotions can tarnish the finish.If you spray your perfume and put on your lotions first, you will reduce the chances they will coat the jewelry. Wait until your body is dry. Then, put on your costume jewelry.
This should prevent some of the build-up on fake jewelry that makes it look dull and requires that you do frequent cleaning.

, If you wipe your jewelry down with a clean microfiber cloth after each use, you won’t have to clean it as often.


It also will continue to look like new for longer periods of time.
Wiping it down daily also limits your jewelry exposure to water or anything that it might have been exposed to when you were wearing it that day.

, You might try storing the jewelry in ziplock bags. Designate one piece per bag. Put the jewelry in. Squeeze all the air out of the bag. Then close it.


With the air removed, the metal cannot oxidize or turn green from exposure to the air.So, it will look cleaner and newer for a longer period of time.
Keeping your jewelry in a jewelry box that has a closing lid and a velvet lining limits your jewelry’s expose to air as well and also keeps it from being scratched. "

Use a soap and water solution.,
Use a cleaning machine.,
Have your gold polished.",How to Clean Jewelry1," Gold jewelry is most easily cleaned using a simple solution of soap and water. Fill a bowl with warm water and a few squirts of mild dishwashing liquid. Place your gold jewelry in the bowl and let it soak for about 15 minutes, then use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently scrub away the grime. Dry your jewelry with a soft cloth to restore its shine.









Avoid using strong detergent, a toothbrush with hard bristles, or a course towel when handling your gold. Even a paper towel is too rough for gold jewelry. Gold is a soft metal that is easily scratched and bent. The higher your jewelry's karat, the more careful you must be not to damage it.
Don't let your jewelry soak for too long, since the cleaning agents in the soap might damage it over time.;
, Ionic cleaners and steam cleaners may be used to clean gold jewelry that doesn't respond to the soapy water treatment. Jewelry is inserted into a slot or box in the machine, and the machine works to clean it over the course of a few minutes.









Jewelry cleaning machines are available at drugstores and home goods stores.
If you'd rather not buy your own machine, you can take your jewelry to a jeweler and ask that it be treated with an ionic or steam cleaning.

, Gold jewelry that is very old and tarnished doesn't respond to steam or ionic treatments. Take it to a jeweler and have it professionally polished. This process is done in stages with lightly abrasive papers that are rubbed over the surface of the jewelry. The polished gold should look good as new.









Don't attempt to polish your own gold jewelry. Jewelers work with special papers that are made specifically for polishing gold, and using a different type of paper could cause damage.
When jewelry is polished, the surface layer of gold is removed, and your gold will be worth a little less afterward.

All you need is a toothbrush, but pick one with soft bristles. Make sure you don’t use a wire brush or a brush with harsh bristles, as this could damage the setting.
A child’s toothbrush would be a good choice because the bristles are really soft. You can also buy brushes specially designed for cleaning jewelry online or in stores.
Don't fall for the tip that you should use toothbrush to clean the jewelry, though. It can be too abrasive. There are better household products to use. Use a microfiber hand towel to dry the earrings. These are softer and will help you clean the earrings gently.
You also want to make sure you only use soft bristles on earrings with gold settings. If your diamond has a fragile setting or is an antique, you might want to skip the brush completely. , You don’t want to clean diamond earrings near the sink or chances are pretty good your earrings could end up in the drain. You think it won't happen, but ask any plumber: It often does!


Choose a table instead or any flat surface that is not near a sink. You need enough space for a bowl and towel.

Try water and mild soap.,
Use baby shampoo.,
Apply baking soda and water.,
Use beer or club soda.,
Do not use vinegar or ammonia.",How to Clean Fragile Jewelry1," Most fragile jewelry can be cleaned with a simple solution of mild dish soap and water. Use a soft brush, such as a soft-bristled toothbrush, or a soft lint-free cloth to wash the jewelry with the soap and water.

Polish your amber with olive oil.",How to Clean Amber Jewelry3," There are many contradicting opinions regarding water and amber. While some jewelers recommend using soapy water to clean amber, others strongly advise against it.


If your piece is particularly dirty and you wish to try this method, you may consider performing a test on an inconspicuous area of the amber, or on a bead in the back of the necklace.

, The bowls should be large enough to fit the piece you will be cleaning. One bowl will be used to wash the amber, and the other bowl will be used to rinse it.

, Stir the soap and water so that it is mixed, but not so much that the solution begins to froth.If you do not have any liquid hand soap, you can use a liquid dish soap, but avoid any harsh detergents, such as dishwasher fluid. If you would not put your hand in it, do not use it.

, Gently run the necklace through your fingers to remove any dirt and grime.

, Do not put the olive oil on the jewelry directly. Instead, place a few drops of olive oil into the palm of your hand and rub your hands together. Then, run the amber necklace between your hands. This helps restore the amber's luster and shine. Wipe the olive oil off your amber using the soft cloth.


If you do not have any olive oil, another light oil may be used instead, such as an almond oil.

Put a few drops of liquid dish detergent in a bowl of lukewarm (not hot) water.,
Soak the gold jewelry in the solution.,
Gently scrub the jewelry with a soft-bristled toothbrush.,
Rinse each piece in warm running water.,
Blot dry with a soft cloth.",How to Clean Gold Jewelry1," Mix gently. Though ordinary tap water will work fine, for even better results, you can use sodium-free seltzer water or club soda. The carbonation in these liquids can help loosen accumulated dirt and debris.


Don't use hot or boiling water, especially if your jewelry contains fragile precious stones. Some precious stones, like opals, can crack if subjected to rapid and drastic temperature changes. Similarly, don't use freezing cold water because the grime will contract and get tougher.;
, Allow the jewelry to sit in the water for about 15-30 minutes. As it soaks, warm soapy water will work its way into the cracks and crevices, loosening hard-to-reach buildups of dirt.







, Scrub each piece of jewelry individually, paying special attention to nooks and crannies where dirt may be hidden. Use a very soft brush - the softer the better. Stiff bristles can scratch the surface of your jewelry. If your jewelry is gold-plated (as opposed to solid gold), especially, stiff bristles can even remove the gold layer entirely! However, if there is any crevice that is not cleaning up, take a Q-Tip and rub it softly along the fissure.









Special brushes designed for this purpose are best, but most small, soft brushes (like, for instance, eyebrow brushes) will also work.

, A good rinsing will help remove lingering dirt that's been loosened by the action of your brush. Again, make sure the water isn't hot , especially if your jewelry contains fragile stones. Don't let the water flow in a very powerful stream either as it pours a lot of strength on the jewel.









If you're rinsing your jewelry in a sink, plug or cover the drain so that you don't accidentally lose your jewelry if it slips out of your hands. Alternatively, rinse your jewelry in a pasta strainer or metal coffee filter.

, Then, let the jewelry sit out on a towel to air dry completely before wearing it again. If your jewelry is still wet, wearing it can trap moisture against your skin, leading to minor skin irritation.

Order oysters.,
Know what to look for.,
Don't bite down.,
Purchase pearl oysters.",How to Find Pearls1," One way to find pearls is to eat oysters in restaurants. It is unusual to find a pearl in a restaurant oyster, especially one of high value. The odds are definitely stacked against you with this method, though it can be done.In fact, edible varieties of oysters generally produce a different type of ""pearl"" than pearl oysters,but true pearls have very occasionally been found by diners.


You don't just have to order oysters on the half shell. Any dish with oysters in it is fair game.
You can also try buying oysters to eat at home from a fish market. To shuck an oyster at home, place the slit face up. Insert a table knife in one end of the slit, pushing downward slightly and moving across the opening. Pull the oyster open to look for a pearl. If it doesn't have one, you can still enjoy the oyster.;
, Most pearls found in edible oysters aren't worth much or anything. They are usually misshapen and especially hard. However, be on the lookout for round pearls. If it is colorful, such as purple or orange, it can be worth a lot more.Pearls can come in all sorts of colors, such as blue, purple, orange, white, pink, green, and black. They can be round, oblong, egg-shaped, or irregularly shaped.However, most edible oysters will produce something closer to a pebble than a pearl., If you feel something hard when eating oysters, try not to chomp down on it. For one, as noted, most pearls found in edible oysters are especially hard and could crack one of your teeth. In addition, you don't want to swallow it. Pull it out of your mouth immediately. If it looks round, smooth, and lustrous, have it appraised at a jeweler's., Some companies sell pearl oysters that can be shipped directly to your home. These companies generally guarantee that you will have an oyster with a pearl in it."

Be creative and make use of household objects that aren't doing much else.,
Last but not least, get a mesh garbage can from the dollar store.",How to Store Jewelry," If you're buying one, make sure it's good quality and will work for the main type of jewelry you own. If you're making a jewelry tree, customize it as needed and decorate beautifully––making your own provides you with the perfect opportunity to emboss your style all over it.;
, This method is very simple and doesn't take up much room. It is easy to find specific jewelry hanging from the board and when placed well, it can add some style to your room. To make a cork board jewelry display:


Buy a picture frame that the cork board will fit inside. Remove the glass screen and either discard it or save it for something else. Most people use this style of hanging up jewelry for necklaces and bracelets, so be sure to choose a frame that's tall enough to hold your longer necklaces.






Buy a cork board that's either the exact same size or larger than the frame. If it's larger, then you'll need to trim it down to the right size using an X-Acto or any craft knife.






Cover the cork board with some decorative paper that's either the exact same size as the board, or larger. Cut it to the dimensions of the cork board and then use double-sided tape to attach it neatly. Take care to avoid making creases or bumps.






Once the decorative paper is secured to the cork board, try putting the cork board into the frame to make sure it fits exactly right. If it doesn't, it'll need to be trimmed it a bit smaller. Don't trim off too much at a time–– its better to be safe than sorry. Once it fits in just right, go on to the next sub-step.






Heat up a hot glue gun, then put hot glue all around the edge of the frame where the cork board will be attached. Before the hot glue cools, carefully put in the cork board with the decorative paper on top and press gently to ensure it makes a good contact. You're now done.






To use, tack the thumbtacks into the cork board, and then hang jewelry off them. If you want your tacks to be more decorative, then hot glue a decorative button or fake gem onto the top of each thumbtack.







, A much simpler variation of the cork board option, this one involves just hanging up a decorative frame on the wall, and then putting thumbtacks into the wall. To use, just hang your jewelry on the tacks.

, Both are classy, and are easy to use (simply hang the earrings over the outside rim of the glass or bowl). You can also do this with items like coffee mugs, etc. Select whatever will look good in the area you're going to display the jewelry.

, These are easy to use, organize, and customize. Drawer organizers can be purchased from storage, craft and dollar stores. They can be as small or large as you need.

, Simple, large, and with good organization, this also works well if you're moving. Note that this may not be the best way to store fragile jewelry, unless you line each part of the box with felt or a similar fabric able to protect the jewelry item.

, You can get these in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they generally include a small mirror. There are lots of ways of obtaining such a box, such as through jewelry and department stores, online sales and even through inheritance. If you like vintage items, look for an older jewelry box from an era that matches your décor theme.

, This is a particularly effective look for those who don't mind a mannequin sharing your personal space––favorite vintage or designer clothing can also be worn by the mannequin, with the jewelry draped over the clothing. You can buy mannequins in different types, although the type that works best are the full-size head and shoulder mannequins or the miniature full body ones. Look in antique stores and online for mannequins.

, You can find these easily at thrift stores for next to nothing. To use, just lean them up against something, providing that it is stable enough to stay upright and not damage your collection. An artsy idea for this storage method is to place the metal basket on a miniature art easel. The only thing to watch for is humidity or dampness causing rust on the cheap wire basket, which might transfer to your earrings. A simple solution is to paint the basket before use with a metal protecting paint and to check regularly to ensure the basket is in good condition.

, Either the hang-in-the-closet or the standard wall type, tie rack works quite well for long pieces that need plenty of space, such as beaded necklaces. Just be careful not to hang this anywhere near fabrics that might catch on the jewelry and snag. You don't want your clothes to be at the mercy of your jewels!

, These items are cheap to buy, and fit the purpose in a neat and interesting way. Check for balance when hanging jewelry items, so as not to cause the holder to lean over and fall.

, There aren't any rules for how to store jewelry (apart from certain gems needing special care), so feel free to create storage items out of almost anything. Always bear in mind the fragility of items when choosing storage––anything that is fragile will require soft, delicate surfaces and in some cases, an opaque cover to prevent light damage. All jewelry should be stored away from heat and damp, regardless of value.

, All the holes are perfect for earrings and if you want to be able to spin the garbage can, put it on a lazy susan."

Mix a mild dishwashing detergent with water.,
Soak the pearls in the detergent mixture.,
Wipe the pearls with a damp cloth.,
Rub the pearls with a smooth towel, and lay them flat to dry.,
Put your pearls on last when dressing.,
Wipe the pearls with a soft cloth after taking them off.,
Wear your pearls regularly.,
Fasten clasps and pins before storing your pearls.,
Keep your pearls in a jewelry box with compartments.,
Use a cotton pouch for travel storage.",How to Clean Pearls," You can wash pearls in warm, soapy water, but it’s important to use a mild detergent. Add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of soap to 1 quart (946 ml) of warm water to dilute it, and mix well to create a soapy solution. Ensure that the water is warm and not hot because it can damage the pearls, especially if they are real.A gentle dishwashing liquid or a laundry detergent meant for delicates works well for washing pearls.
You can also use a cleaning product meant specifically for jewelry. However, be sure to check the label to ensure that it’s safe for pearls. Consult you jeweler for further confirmation.
Don’t use an abrasive detergent because it may scratch your pearls and rub off the nacre, which is their outer coating. Also don't use a home ingredient like lemon or vinegar, since they have a pretty high pH range, and can cause long-term destruction to the pearl.;
, Once you’ve mixed the detergent and water together, submerge the pearls in the solution. Allow the jewelry to sit in the soapy water for 10 to 15 seconds.If you’re not comfortable soaking the pearls, dampen a cloth with the soapy water and use it to wipe over the jewelry.

, After you’ve removed the pearls from the soapy water, wet a clean towel or cloth with warm water. Rub the cloth gently over the jewelry to rinse away the dirt and soap that's left.Use a cotton towel or cloth to wipe the pearls to ensure that the fabric isn’t too abrasive like a dried towel.

, When you’ve rinsed the pearls with a damp cloth, use a clean, dry cotton towel to carefully dry the jewelry. Next, lay the pearls on a flat and soft surface and allow them to dry completely.If you’re cleaning a pearl necklace, bracelet, or other strung variety, make sure that the string is completely dry before wearing the jewelry. Moisture can weaken the string.
It helps to lay your pearls on a towel to dry. Once the towel feels dry, your pearls are most likely dry too.

, Residue from makeup, perfume, hairspray, and other cosmetics can make your pearls look dull. To keep them clean and unscratched, always put your jewelry on as the last step when you’re getting ready to go out.If you accidentally get any cosmetics on your pearls, wipe them down with a clean cloth dampened with warm soapy water. Immediately follow up with a cloth dampened with plain water to rinse them.

, Cosmetics aren’t the only thing that can take some of the luster of your pearls -- perspiration can dull your jewelry as well. Make sure that your pearls keep their glow by wiping them down with a soft, cotton cloth after each time that you wear them.If you forget to wipe your pearls clean after wearing them, just be sure to do it before you store them again.

, Leaving pearls in storage for a prolonged period of time may seem like a good way to keep them clean and safe, but it can actually dehydrate them. That can leave them dull and more prone to scratching. Try to wear your pearls often so they’re exposed to moisture on a regular basis and can maintain their luster., If you just throw your pearl jewelry into your jewelry box after you take them off, it can wind up scratched, which makes it easier for them to get dirty. Instead, be sure to fasten all of the clasps and pins before storing it so the hardware won’t damage the nacre.Take the time to untangle necklaces and bracelets before storing them too.

, While it’s important to keep your pearls free of dust, you don’t just want to throw them in any jewelry box. Look for one that has compartments, so you separate each pearl piece and lay them out flat. That way, they won’t wind up scratched by other items in the box., If you’re traveling with your pearl jewelry, it’s important to keep them in some type of case so they’re protected from dirt, dust, and scratches. However, don’t keep your pearls in a plastic pouch, which may damage them. Instead, use a cotton pouch, which is soft enough not to scratch the jewelry.When traveling, be sure to separate your pearls from other jewelry in your travel pouches as well.

Know when to clean with ammonia.,
Add one part ammonia to six parts water.,
Soak the jewelry in the mixture for no more than one minute.,
Rinse the jewelry thoroughly under running water.,
Gently dry the jewelry with a soft polishing cloth.",How to Clean Gold Jewelry2," Ammonia is a powerful cleaner, but, chemically, it can be somewhat caustic. Avoid doing using ammonia to clean gold jewelry too often to prevent wear on your jewelry - ammonia is a good candidate for occasional (but not frequent) ""deep cleans.""


Ammonia can damage certain materials often used in jewelry. Don't use ammonia when cleaning gold jewelry pieces that contain platinum or pearls.

, Stir gently to ensure an even mixture.








, Don't let jewelry sit in the ammonia mixture for too long - as a strong base, ammonia can be slightly corrosive.









To quickly remove all of the jewelry at once, use a kitchen strainer like you might use when cooking pasta. Either fish the jewelry out with a hand-held strainer or upend the bowl into a larger strainer in the sink.

, Plug or cover the drain of the sink to prevent losing any precious jewelry that slips out of your hand. Alternatively, simply use the strainer you used to get your jewelry out of the ammonia.

, Allow jewelry to air dry on a towel completely before wearing it.

Know which types of jewelry should be kept dry.,
Wipe the jewelry with a wet, soapy cloth.,
""Rinse"" the jewelry with a cloth dampened with plain water.,
Lay or hang the pieces upside down after cleaning.",How to Clean Gold Jewelry3," Pieces of jewelry with gemstones that are glued into their setting (like many earrings) should not be submerged in water. Warm water can loosen the glue, which can cause your gemstones to fall out, especially when subjected to a thorough brushing. For these types of jewelry, use a special cleaning method that avoids total submersion in water.

, Make a small quantity of dish soap solution as in Method One. Dip a soft, delicate towel in the solution and gently scrub your jewelry.








, Gently dab a wet cloth onto the jewelry, taking care to soak up any leftover soap suds.








, Allow your jewelry to dry in this way. By letting your jewelry dry upside down, you allow any remaining moisture to drip out, ensuring it won't soak into the setting.

"
"
Use this method with care.,
Mix a small quantity of toothpaste and water.,
Scrub with a (soft-bristled) toothbrush.,
Rinse generously in clean water.",How to Clean Gold Jewelry4," It may scratch gold and silver. Also the chemicals that clean your teeth may leave a film on stones and gold. If in doubt, try one of the alternative, gentler methods instead.

, Squeeze about an inch of toothpaste into a bowl (or your palm!) and mix with a tablespoon or two of water to make a light paste. As a mild abrasive, toothpaste is good for loosening up grime that's accumulated on your favorite pieces of gold jewelry without scratching the jewelry.









You can use this method for frequently-worn gold items that need a quick clean or when you don't have access to other cleaning materials (like when you're traveling.)

, Use an old, soft-bristled toothbrush and toothpaste to gently scrub off grime. The toothpaste can be applied to a cloth to hand polish an item as well. If you're seeing scratches on your jewelry, it's probably the toothbrush, not the toothpaste - use as soft of brush as possible.









Alternatively, simply scrub with undiluted toothpaste. This, however, can be harder to rinse out of small crevices in your jewelry.

, Just like when you rinse after brushing your teeth, you should rinse your jewelry to remove any loosened dirt or grime!








"
"
Know when boiling is appropriate.,
Bring water to a boil.,
Carefully pour the water over your jewelry.,
Wait for the water to cool.",How to Clean Gold Jewelry5," Gold itself can be boiled with no problems. However, boiling delicate gemstones (like opals, pearls, coral, and moonstones) can cause them to crack or become damaged - especially if the jewelry is cold before boiling. Boiling is also a bad idea for jewelry with glued-in gemstones, as it can loosen the glue. However, if you're looking to clean heavily-soiled jewelry made entirely out of gold or gold jewelry that contains ""strong"" gemstones (like diamonds), boiling is a great choice.

, You don't need to boil much water - just enough to submerge all of the jewelry in. As you're waiting for the water to boil, set your gold jewelry in a sturdy bowl or another vessel that won't be damaged by boiling water. Pyrex or metal cooking bowls/dishes are good choices.


Arrange jewelry in the dish or bowl so that no piece of jewelry is covering up another piece - water should be able to reach every piece of jewelry.

, Be very careful not to spill or splash by pouring too rapidly - boiling water can cause serious burns. When all of the jewelry is completely submerged, you've added enough water.








, When you can comfortably put your hands in the water, you can remove the jewelry. Follow a good boiling by scrubbing each piece of jewelry with a soft brush, then dabbing it dry with a soft towel and allowing it to sit and air-dry completely.


Don't be afraid if the water appears dirty - this is good! As boiling water loosens the dirt, wax, grime, etc. that's built up on your jewelry, it may float to the surface of the water. The dirtier your water looks, the more dirt you've removed from your jewelry!

Find a guided diving tour.,
Be a good swimmer.,
Wear the proper attire.,
Take a dive.,
Shuck the oysters.",How to Find Pearls2," If you've never gone pearl diving before, it's best to use a guided tour. You can find one online or through a travel agency.Some pearl diving companies let you dive for naturally grown pearls. Others are part of a farming operation. You'll have better luck finding pearls with farming operations, but you likely won't get as much diving time.In fact, some companies guarantee you will find a pearl, or they will give you one., To go pearl diving, you will need to be able to swim well. While you may have the aid of scuba gear, in some places you won't. Either way, you need to be able to swim.If you don't already know how to swim, consider taking swimming lessons from your local parks and recreation department or YMCA.

, The proper attire will depend on where you are. For instance, in Dubai, they have you wear long flowing white pants and a matching top, provided by the company. In that case, the idea is to protect you from jellyfish. Ask the company you are diving with what would be most appropriate., A boat will take you to the diving area. In most cases, you will need to be able to dive 10 to 15 fifteen feet. Sometimes, the company will provide you with a weight to help you sink more quickly. You may be gathering loose oysters,or untying strings of oysters from a farm., At the end, a trained technician will help you shuck the oysters. In some cases, they may use a machine to help gently pry the oyster open. In that case, the oyster will go back in the ocean after the pearl has been removed."

Visit a state with natural pearls.,
Pay the fee.,
Employ a diver's down flag.,
Dive for pearls.,
Shuck your mussels.,
Follow local regulations.",How to Find Pearls3," In the United States, your main options are Kentucky Lake and Tennessee River in Tennessee and San Angelo for freshwater pearls. For saltwater pearls, your main option is Hawaii.While you can find mussels that produce pearls in other areas, these are the main states for commercially viable pearls.

, In most areas, you will need to pay a fee for a permit. In Tennessee, for example, license fees are based on whether you are a commercial in-state resident ($200 in 2016) or commercial out-of-state resident ($1,000 in 2016). You may also get a license as a wholesaler ($500 in 2016)., When you are in the water, you usually must use a diver's flag. The flag shows that there is someone under the water. In Tennessee, for instance, the law specifies that no boat can go within 50 feet of the flag nor cause wakes withing 200 feet of the flag. The only boat that can be within 50 feet is the boat used to dive from., Like with a guided tour, you will likely need to take a boat to the diving area, especially if you are diving for saltwater pearls. However, many freshwater mussels are found in stream beds. So when hunting for freshwater pearls, you only need to walk along areas of the river. Mussels can be difficult to find because they are camouflaged to blend in with the sand and silt at the bottom of the river.Check for mussels in shallow water. Generally, sandy areas are best, and you'll be able to find them in rivers, lakes, and streams.Many fisherman use waders to wade into the river and gather mussels. Essentially, you wade into the middle of shallow water and feel around in the bottom of the steam for mussels.In lakes, you can employ similar methods of feeling for mussels, but you may need basic diving equipment.If the water is not murky, you'll be able to see mussels sticking up out of the sand at the bottom., Use a dull knife to shuck your oyster. Place it on a hard surface with the opening up before inserting the knife on one side into the slit on top. Push across the slit, slanting down as you go. Once you've done this step, you should be able to pull it open and look for your pearl.Burnish your pearl with table salt and a soft cloth that's a little damp., Usually, the mussels you take will need to be of a certain size. In Tennessee, for instance, they lay out the size for each species.The easiest way to measure your mussels is to use a ring with an interior that is the specified size. Then you just see whether the mussel passes through or not.For pink heelsplitters and washboards, the mussels need to be 4 inches in diameter. River pigtoes, lake pigtoes, maple leafs, southerns, three ridges, and elephant ears need to be 2 5/8 inches in diameter, while ebonies and monkey faces need to be 2 3/8 inches in diameter."

Look for rings around the drill hole.,

Notice the shape of the pearl.",How to Identify Pearls in Vintage Jewelry1," A fake pearl will not have any rings or or ridges around a drill hole. Put the pearls under a light and use a magnifying glass to inspect the drill hole. If the holes are smooth, then the pearls are likely fake., A string of fake pearls is usually uniform in color and size. Real pearls are formed by nature, so there will be differences in each pearl. Look at the pearls for variation in and size and color. The differences may not be dramatic, but they should ne noticeable., A perfectly round pearl is very rare and will sell at a very high price. A typical pearl may still be real, but it won’t be perfectly round. It may be shaped like an oval, or there may be a bump in an otherwise round pearl. A string of pearls is likely fake if every pearl appears like a tiny ball."

Hold the pearls in your hand.,
Rub your fingers over the pearls.,
Feel the pearls texture with your teeth.,
Feel for a sense of coolness.",How to Identify Pearls in Vintage Jewelry2," Depending on the type of vintage jewelry, you may not be able to hold the pearls alone. One thing you can do to determine if a pearl is real or fake is to detect the weight. A set of real pearls should feel hefty in your hand. A set of fake pearls will feel quite light., Along with deviations in size and shape, real pearls will have texture. Fake pearls will feel perfectly smooth when rubbed between your fingers. Real pearls will have small bumps and imperfections., An easy and old method to identify a real pearl is to use the “tooth-test.” Put the pearls up against your mouth and rub the pearls over the bottom edge of your tooth. A real pearl will have a light grit to it. A pearl made of plastic or glass will feel smooth.A fake pearl will feel similar to the feeling of rubbing polished nails across your teeth.

, No matter the temperature, a set of real pearls will have a coolness to them. They may not necessarily feel cold, but they should feel cool. A set of fake pearls will have a sticky feeling when you roll them around in your hand."
"
Shine a light on the pearl.,
Look for onion-skin-type layers.,
Have the pearls x-rayed.",How to Identify Pearls in Vintage Jewelry3," Real pearls have depth and luster. Fake pearls do not reflect light as well. The fake pearls may look shiny, but they will appear shallow. Take the pearls to a well-lit room or shine a flashlight on them. They are most likely real if they reflect the light well., A real pearl has onion-skin-type layers inside of it. If the pearl has a hole from where it has been drilled, use a flashlight and 10x loupe and shine it inside of the hole. Look for the layers. If it is fake, there won’t be any layers at all.You can also use a regular magnifying glass.

, If you’re having trouble identifying the pearls on your own, a sure way to identify them is to have them x-rayed. An x-ray will show if the pearls has the onion-like layers that it should have. Although it may be a strange request, you can ask your personal physician, veterinarian, or dentist to do the x-ray for a fee.The x-ray will also identify if the pearl is natural or cultured. A an x-ray will reveal a bead inside of a coating.

Use a soft bag/pouch to store them.,
Put them after you do make-up.,
Salt water, chlorine, ammonia, vinegar = DANGEROUS!,
Restring your pearls.,
Clean Your Pearls.,
Avoid direct sunlight.",How to Protect Your Pearls," Okay, so pearls can get scratched really easily. So, to store them use a soft bag or small but soft pouch. You can also use a clean soft cloth. What we are basically doing here is avoiding the pearls to get scratched.;
, You love makeup, so do we but just make sure that whenever you are going to wear some pearl jewelry, wear it after you do makeup, or apply hairspray etc. because they are harmful for the pearls. They can create spots on them, or cause disintegration.

, Your beautiful pearls can get holes and get dissolved. Yep, that's true. Remove them if you are going for a shower/bath or if you are going swimming.

, Restring your pearls at least once a year. Tie knots after each pearl, because they avoid pearls from rubbing with each other and if the string is ever broken then loss of pearls will be less. Nice idea, right?

, Everything is great when it is clean. So how do we clean pearls? Well, it is simple. Take a dry, soft cloth for wiping the pearls. Do it gently. This will prevent oil, dirt etc. to increase. Don't use any rough/abrasive material to clean them.

, Don't store your pearls or wear them where there is direct sunlight. The acid in your perspiration can cause pearls for the luster to fade away. Discoloration of pearls also happens.

Look for minor imperfections.,
Check for a sharp, healthy luster.,
Check for an overtone.,
Look for clues around the drill hole.,
Look in the hole for a line between the nacre and nucleus.",How to Tell if a Pearl Is Real1," As noted above, real pearls are only rarely ""perfect"". Usually, they'll have small blemishes or irregularities in their shape.Their outer nacre layer may also reflect light differently on different parts of the pearl. Imitation pearls are almost always ""too perfect"" — they look perfectly spherical, they have the same amount of luster on every part of the surface, and show no indents or imperfections.


While perfectly round real pearls are rare but possible, a necklace will almost never be made only from these types of pearls. A necklace made from pearls that all seem to be exactly the same smooth, round shape is almost certainly a fake.;
, Luster is a way that jewelers describe the type of light reflected from a precious stone. A pearl's luster is part of what makes it so beautiful. Good-quality pearls should have a bright, clear luster that makes them shine when light hits them. If you look closely, you should be able to see your own reflection on the pearl's surface.One problem with this test is that low-quality real pearls (which generally have a dull, ""chalky"" luster) can look similar to fake pearls. Check your results with a few of the other tests in this article., Good-quality pearls are often prized for their overtones — the subtle color that is visible on their outer surface when light hits them. Fake pearls will usually not have this overtone effect, which is tricky to duplicate. Thus, if your pearl seems very slightly shaded with color when light hits is, there is a good chance it's real. Rose and ivory are two of the most desired overtones for white pearls, though a wide variety of colors are possible, especially for dark pearls.Since some real pearls don't have a visible overtone, not seeing an overtone on your pearl isn't necessarily a sure sign that it's fake.

, Pearls on a strand or necklace will usually have holes drilled in them for the string to pass through. Examining this hole carefully can help you tell whether your pearl is real or not. Specific things you'll want to look for include:


Well-defined edges to the hole. Real pearls usually have drill holes with sharp edges (like a hollow cylinder). Fakes often have rough or rounded edges. However, old and well-worn real pearls may also have rounded edges to their holes. Fake pearls may also bow outward at the surface of the pearl, rather than being perfectly cylindrical.
Chipped paint or coating around the hole. As fake pearls rub against each other with repeated use, their artificial coating can wear away around the holes. You may be able to see slivers of glass or plastic underneath. This is a sure sign of a fake.

, A real pearl almost always has a clear outer nacre layer, while fake pearls have thin layers of artificial nacre or lack them entirely. If your pearl has a drill hole, you can check for nacre by peering in with a magnifying glass. Real pearls will usually (but not always) have a noticeable line that separates the nacre from the nucleus (the inside part of the pearl).

"
"
Beware of using just one test to verify pearls.,
Avoid the ""burn"" test.,
Don't fall for imitation pearls sold with exotic names.,
Don't ignore common sense instincts about a pearl's price.",How to Tell if a Pearl Is Real2," This bears repeating: any single one of the tests above can sometimes produce false results. To be sure of your results, perform many different tests.


As just one example of how isolated tests can be misleading, one source found that real pearls that have been specially polished can feel very smooth in the tooth and friction tests.

, Some sources may recommend holding pearls in an open flame to determine whether they are fake or not. According to this rumor, fake pearls will burn or melt, while real pearls will be unaffected. The truth is more complicated. While most fake pearls will be damaged by fire, so will some real ones. Real pearls that have been processed with an artificial outer coating are especially vulnerable to flame and can suffer from blemishes, deformed drill holes, and ruined luster after just a few seconds in a flame.


In addition, it's worth noting that pearls conduct heat well and can become very hot when heated over an open flame. If you do attempt this test, take all necessary precautions to avoid bad burns.

, If a seller is trying to sell you on a pearl's name rather than its physical qualities, you may be getting ripped off. For example, ""Mallorca"" (or ""Majorca"") pearls, which are named after the exotic Mediterranean island of Mallorca but are entirely man-made, are sometimes sold to unsuspecting costumers.

, The price of a real pearl will vary greatly based on its size, shape, overtone, and other features. However, they will never be outright cheap. For instance, a necklace made from freshwater pearls (the cheapest variety of real pearls) can easily retail for several hundred dollars. If a seller is giving you a deal on a set of real pearls that seems too good to be true, it probably is.


As a general rule, you'll only want to buy pearls from licensed, certified jewelers and pearl retailers. Buying pearls from street vendors or pawn shops can be a risky proposition. See our pearl-buying guide for specific tips.

Check for ""scaly"" surface patterning with a microscope.,
Compare your pearls to certified real pearls.,
Get your pearls appraised by an expert.,
Try ordering an X-radiograph test.,
Try ordering a refractometer test.",How to Tell if a Pearl Is Real3," You can use a 30x jeweler's loupe, but microscopes with 64-power magnification or more work best for this. The surfaces of real pearls have a maze-like, scaled pattern. This patterning looks a little like a topographical map.It's this microscopic scaling that give real pearls their ""gritty"" texture.


By contrast, fake pearls will often have a surface covered with grainy, fairly regular bumps (a little like the cratered surface of the moon)., All of the tests above are easier if you have some pearls that you know are real for comparison purposes. Try contacting a jeweler about the possibility of comparing your pearls to a set of ones that are certified real. Alternatively, borrow a friend or relative's real pearls to make your comparisons.


Use common sense about the sorts of tests you do with the certified real pearls. For example, you won't want to try the tooth test or the friction test with someone else's precious stones.

, If you are having a hard time determining your pearl’s authenticity, you can always take your pearl to a reputable jeweler or gemologist. These professionals have the tools, training, and expert eyes to tell whether your pearl is real (and, if it is real, how high its quality is). However, these options often don't come cheap — a basic appraisal can easily cost more than $100., This test, which an expert may do to determine whether your pearls are real or not uses an X-ray machine. Real pearls will show up as a semitransparent grey color on the X-ray. Fakes will be solid white on the negative and solid black on the positive print.

, This advanced test measures how much light passes through the pearl to determine its authenticity. Pearls usually have a refractometer reading (called a ""refractive index"") of between 1.530 and 1.685. The difference between these two values (0.155) is called the pearl's birefringence, which affects the way the pearl looks in the light. These qualities tell an expert that the pearl is most likely a real one.

Rub the pearls against your front teeth.,
Rub the pearls against each other.,
Check whether the pearls are perfectly round.,
Feel for coolness to the touch.,
Feel the weight of the pearl in your hand.",How to Tell if a Pearl Is Real4," Hold one or two pearls between your thumb and forefinger and press them gently into the biting edge of your front teeth. Rub them against your teeth with a side-to-side motion. A real pearl will usually have a slightly rough or gritty texture from tiny scale-like imperfections in its outer layers of nacre. Fake pearls made from glass or plastic will usually be almost perfectly smooth.You may want to brush your teeth before attempting this test to make sure they're clean. Food residue from a recent meal can give false results.

, Hold a few pearls in your fingers and gently rub them against each other. Feel for the slight sensation of friction. Real pearls will usually generate a little friction when they rub against each other because their outer layers of nacre are not perfectly smooth.Fake pearls, on the other hand, often have smooth coatings and will usually glide past each other when rubbed together.



Take a close look at your hands after this test. When two pearls rub against each other, their outer layers often erode a small amount. If you notice a fine, powdery, white residue after rubbing your pearls, this is probably powdered nacre — a sign that the pearls are real., Because they're products of nature, every real pearl is slightly different, just like snowflakes or fingerprints. Most pearls won't be perfect spheres — they'll usually be slightly oblong or have minor defects. If your pearls look perfectly round to you, there's a good chance they're artificial.


It is possible for real pearls to be perfectly round. However, examples of these are very rare and usually fetch a high price.Not sure whether a pearl is perfectly round or not? Try carefully rolling it on a flat surface. Imperfect pearls won't consistently roll in a straight line., For this test, you'll need a few pearls that have been sitting out — not ones you've been wearing. Hold the pearls in your hand and concentrate on the way they feel against your skin. Real pearls should feel noticeably cool for a few seconds before they warm up.The feeling is similar to what you'd get from stepping barefoot onto a marble floor.


Plastic pearls, on the other hand, will be about room temperature and will warm up more quickly.Note: Good-quality fake glass pearls may still give the ""cool"" sensation. Verify your results with other tests if this is the first one you've attempted.

, Carefully bounce one or two pearls in your hand to get an idea of how much they weigh. Most real pearls feel somewhat heavy for their size. On the other hand, fakes (especially plastic pearls) will have a light, insubstantial feel.


For obvious reasons, this test isn't perfect — judging the weight of a few small pearls can be tricky. For best results, you may want to compare your pearls with a set you know are real or fake. Always verify with another test no matter how sure you are of a pearl's weight.

Find a very soft cloth.,
Wipe pearl jewelry gently before putting your pearl necklace away each time, to remove body oils and perspiration.,
For every fifth wash of the pearls, they'll need something a little stronger than simply a dampened cloth.,
If the clasp has to be cleaned as well, use a Q tip (cotton bud) dipped in either jewelry cleaner (make sure it is compatible with the metal of the clasp) or if it a hard metal (not gold) without gemstones, you can use a bit of toothpaste.,
Finished.

",How to Clean a Pearl Necklace," Choose either a jewelry cloth or a clean rag, preferably one made from cotton or bamboo fabric. Velvet works well too. Avoid linen, georgette, net and jersey.


Never use anything abrasive to clean pearls with, such as toothbrushes or plastic sponges. A soft cloth is the only item that should touch pearls.;
, Put a few drops of water onto the cloth, enough to dampen it and no more. Begin wiping the pearls one by one.


Never use a commercial jewelry cleaner on pearls. Usually such cleaners contain way too much ammonia, which can damage the pearls.

, Dip the soft cloth in warm, mildly soapy water. Do not use washing up liquid; use a very mild soap, such as castille soap without fragrance or color additives.


Wipe with a clean dampened cloth to remove any soapy residue from the pearls.

, Whatever you use, do not allow it to come into contact with any of the pearls as it can potentially harm them.


Toothpaste is good on tarnished silver.

The oyster then coats the deposit with a glossy secretion called nacre. Over time, the nacre builds layers to form a pearl. Originally, pearls could be found in abundance in oysters throughout the oceans, but now they can be grown in laboratories. Therefore, there are two types of pearl growth: natural and cultured.


Natural pearls are rare and expensive. They look the same as cultured pearls, the only difference is that they were grown cultivated in a wild oyster.
Cultured pearls are made by implanting a piece of sand in an oyster and waiting for the pearl to grow. The majority of bought pearls are cultured. These look identical to natural pearls, but are man-made.;
, Freshwater pearls are different from saltwater pearls. Freshwater pearls are cultured in mussels, while saltwater pearls grow in oysters. Freshwater pearls come in diverse shapes, colors, and lustres, but are most often found in the ‘baroque’ shape – lumpy and natural looking, and are no larger than 7mm. Saltwater pearls also come in many shapes, but can grow large. Saltwater pearls are classified based on where they were grown/type of oyster they were grown in.


Freshwater pearls can be round, but these are more expensive than their baroque counterparts.
Both freshwater and saltwater are available in nearly any color.

, Akoya pearls, named after the Akoya oyster in Japan which they are grown in, are the epitome of the classic pearl. Akoya pearls are milky white or rose in color, with silver or gold overtones. However, they are also available in cream, minty green, and light blue. Akoya pearls range in size from 3mm to 10mm, and exist in the classic round shape.

, South Sea black pearls are grown in black-lipped oysters off the coast of Tahiti. Pearls from this region are renowned for their rich black hue and large size. South Sea pearls start at 8mm, and get even larger. The most sought-after color of this type of pearl is black with a peacock green undertone. These pearls are also available in rich navy blue, silver and slate, deep plum, and dark green, and may have overtones of pink and blue.

, Grown in the silver-lipped oyster, South Sea white pearls are found off the shores of Australia, Indonesia, Burma and Okinawa. Similar to black pearls grown in the region, South Sea white pearls are large and have a high luster. These aren’t harvested until they are at least 9mm, making them more expensive than small white Akoya pearls. They are found primarily in creamy white and silver hues, but they may have a rose overtone.

, The rarest of all pearl varieties is the South Sea gold pearl. These are only grown in gold lipped oysters near the waters of Tahiti and surrounding tropical areas. These pearls are large – starting at 9mm – and valued for their unique color. These range in hues from light champagne to bright gold, the latter being more sought after. The gold-lipped oyster also produces white and cream pearls, but these look similar to those made by the silver-lipped oyster., Cortez pearls are a rare variety, grown in rainbow-lipped oysters off the coast of the Sea of Cortez in Mexico. They are classified as black pearls, but also come in a variety of colors. The most beautiful of the Cortez pearls (and most iconic) is dark pistachio green with bright rainbow overtones (primarily rose and gold). These pearls begin at 8mm, growing to 12 mm in size., Conch pearls (pronounced ‘Konk’) are not traditional pearls, as they are non-nacreal (the saliva-like liquid in oysters) and are formed inside a conch shell. Conches are large mollusks in a spiral shell, found in the Caribbean and South Pacific Seas. Conch pearls are incredibly unique in appearance. They are found in bright pink and peach shades, with a flame-like pattern on the exterior. The flame, similar to that seen in an opal, determines the value of the pearl. They come in various sizes and shapes, but few are round., The color is the first thing you notice about a pearl. While the color will vary widely depending on the type of pearl you’re looking at, pay attention to two things: the body color, and the overtone color. The body color is the primary hue of the pearl, while the overtone color is the sheen or the color that ‘pools’ on the surface of the pearl. For example, a pearl might be white with rose overtones, or black with green overtones.


Always examine a pearl’s color against a white backdrop, such as a piece of white velvet or a similarly glare-free fabric.
Use diffused full-spectrum light when examining the pearl’s color.
If you’re buying a strand of pearls, always examine the colors of each of the pearls in contrast to the ones next to it.

, Similar to looking at the color of a pearl, the luster refers to how much shine/reflection a pearl has. The shinier a pearl, the more valuable it is. When examining the luster of a pearl, see how closely the reflection resembles a mirror, and how much light it reflects. The more of a mirror-image the pearl is able to provide, the higher the value.


Luster is easy to examine in a round pearl, while it is more difficult to examine in a baroque pearl because of the many contours.
Check the whole pearl to make sure the luster is the same the whole way around.

, Entirely round pearls are very rare; most are a bit off-round or lumpy, with minor surface imperfections. You should examine each pearl on a strand, looking at the surface (im)perfection. There may be small marks, grooves, or lumps on the surface of the pearl. These are the result of other foreign bodies inside the oyster brushing against the pearl while it is being made. On the flip side, you want to make sure that imperfections on the pearl have not been removed. Sometimes pearls are ‘worked’ - sanded down - to reduce blemishes on the surface, but this lowers the value. You can see if a pearl has been worked if there is a change in luster or obvious texture difference on a certain part.

, The size of a pearl will vary depending on the type of conditions it was grown in, and the size of the original bit of debris at the center. Larger pearls are obviously more valuable than smaller ones, because they are much more rare. The bigger a pearl, the larger the original bit of sediment, and the longer it was left to ‘cure’ in the oyster. The size of any particular pearl will range from 3mm to 12mm, although you may find some that are smaller or larger than this. When examining a strand of pearls, it is ideal if they are all the same (or very close in) size.

, There are many different possible shapes that pearls are available in, with round typically being the most valuable because they are the most difficult to form. However, the shape of a pearl is generally dependent on personal preference, as some shape styles are more appropriate for certain settings than others. Possible pearl shapes include:Round: perfectly spherical with no surface blemishes.
Off-round: slightly wider on one side of the pearl, but not elliptical. Off-round pearls can be easily passed off as round pearls in a strand.
Oval: rounded with a significant difference between the length and the width. A step further than an off-round pearl.
Drop: egg-shaped with one end that’s rounded, and one end that’s slightly pointed.
Button: a mostly round pearl, with one or two asymmetrical curves.
Mabe: a round pearl that is flat on one side, creating a half circle.
Baroque: a ‘natural’ pearl with lots of lumps and asymmetrical curves.

, The nacre is the substance excreted by the oyster that creates the pearl, when built up over the nucleus object. The longer a pearl is left inside an oyster, the more nacre it builds over time. As a result, highly nacreous pearls are more sought-after than low or non-nacreous pearls. A high amount of nacre increases the luster of a pearl. You can tell if a pearl has thin or medium nacre if you can see the nucleus reflecting inside, or if the exterior scratches away easily. The more nacre a pearl has, the stronger it is.


Pearls grown in clams and conches are non-nacreous.

, If you are purchasing a strand of pearls that is staying together as a set, it is important that you find a strand with pearls nearly identical to each other. The more similar each of the pearls is in a strand, the more cohesive the overall look is. Compare and contrast each pearl up close,and look at them next to each other from a bit of distance away. Pay attention to the overall color, size, shape, luster, and nacre qualities of each of the pearls as your compare and contrast.


The exception to this rule is a strand of baroque pearls; pay attention to color and luster, rather than shape.

, Loose strands of pearls are those that have been drilled to form beads, but are not yet strung into a necklace. As a result, loose strands of pearls are the cheapest form, but they require work on your part to make them into a piece of jewelry. You can also buy un-drilled loose pearls for use in settings for rings and earrings, keeping the same concept in mind.

, A choker is the shortest pearl necklace strand available. It is designed so that it sits close to the base of the neck (so close it’s as if it’s choking you). Chokers are generally 10–14 inches (25.4–35.6 cm), depending on the person wearing it.

, A princess necklace is typically the favorite of pear-wearers. It is associated with the classic and sophisticated look of the 1940’s, with a draping strand of pearls that lands just below the hollow of the neck. A princess necklace is generally 16–19 inches (40.6–48.3 cm) long.

, The matinee generally ranges from 20–24 inches (50.8–61.0 cm) long.

, The opera style of pearl strands is reserved for formal occasions, as a result of it’s long length (and associated high price). The opera length of necklace ranges from 30–36 inches (76.2–91.4 cm) long, draping just below the bust line.

, A rope strand of pearls is the longest available, starting at a length of 36-inches and longer. Rope strands are worn doubled over or knotted, giving the appearance of multiple strands of pearls.

, A bib style necklace refers to multiple strands of pearls of differing lengths, attached to the same clasp. As a result of the layering, they give the appearance of a bib. Bib necklaces are generally used for semi-formal and formal occasions, because they tend to be on the showier side."

Try to sell to jewelry stores.,
Avoid selling to pawn shops.,
Stay away from gold buyers.,
Shop around.,
Know what affects the price you get.,
Know what you have in your collection.,
Always check with the BBB before you sell.",How to Sell Gold Jewelry1," You should always try to sell your gold to jewelry stores first. Especially if they are major jewelry stores, they are less invested in ripping you off, since their major source of income is elsewhere.;
, Pawn shops are in the business of paying the least amount of money possible for something that they can sell, so it's best to avoid going to a pawn shop if at all possible. Not only are they less likely to recognize high quality pieces, but they are also manipulative by nature.

, Many gold buying companies have popped up in recent years and most are either scams or at least highly likely to take advantage of you. Some, like GoldLine, are well known for unsavory practices. If you can, avoid these gold buyers altogether.

, Always get multiple quotes before selling your jewelry. Different stores may offer lower prices than others, depending on how much of a cut they take and whether they can recognize special pieces.

, Don't be swayed by the price of gold by the ounce that you see on the news. Only 24 carat gold gets full price. 18 gets 75%, GP means it's just plated in gold and probably can't be sold, etc.The weight you should be working with when you make your own estimates should also factor in stones or other settings, since these don't count towards the weight of the gold.

, Most of the pieces that you sell will be melted down, so don't expect something to be worth more just because it's a wedding ring. However, if you have pieces in your collection that are from well-known designers, then that may increase the value. Always do your research.

, Before making your final decision about where to sell, always check the company's reputation with the Better Business Bureau or your country's equivalent. There are many companies with terrible reputations when it comes to treating people fairly, so be careful.

Before you visit a gold dealer you want to organize your gold.,
Sort the gold.,
Go measure the weight for each type of gold you have.,
Get quotes from the buyers.,
Do your research.",How to Sell Gold Jewelry2," By organizing your gold before your visit, you will save the gold dealer time. Since time is money, the gold dealer will be more likely to pay you more if you don't waste his time. Begin by removing as many of your items in your collection that are imitation gold. The best way to start this process is with a strong magnet. Anything that sticks to the magnet is very, very likely not solid gold. If anything besides the clasps stick, it's probably best to leave those items at home.

, Use a magnifier to check the little labels on the gold for ""10k,"" 14k,"" etcetera. Put all the like kinds of gold in the same Ziploc bag. While you are looking at the gold stamp, if you see ""GF"" or ""GP"" that stamp indicates the item is only gold on the surface. These ones should be put in a separate bag (most gold dealers only buy solid gold, so they won't buy these).

, It is best to measure in grams, though many gold buyers will use a special weight system called a Troy ounce, so don't be surprised or put off. If you do not have a scale, you may be able to use one at your local post office.

, Now that your items have been sorted and weighed, it is time to get quotes. You should get at least three quotes. Start off with phone quotes. Any place that won't give you a phone quote, if you're able to provide an adequate description of what you have, is probably hiding their prices because their payouts are terrible. If a place does give you a phone quote, ask them if there are fees they are not disclosing over the phone (many times there are).


While you are getting quotes, make sure and get a quote from a refinery. According to Gold Refinery of San Diego, 99% of the gold that jewelers and pawn shops buy, is resold to a refinery. So, if you want the most money, get a quote from a refinery that is open to the public like Gold Refinery of San Diego.

, Before you go to the place that gave you the best phone quote, check them out on yelp.com and bbb.org. In the past few years many ""cash for gold"" shops have popped up out of nowhere. Take the steps we have covered here to protect yourself from being ripped off by some unscrupulous gold buyer, and to ensure you are getting a fair deal.

Look at the aesthetics objectively.,
Consider the condition.,





If you know the piece is valuable, based on research and family history, it may make sense to have the jewelry appraised.,
Give the jewelry a good cleaning.,





Gauge the worth of gold by looking at the karat stamp, but be aware that many places can buy stamps and put incorrect stamps on jewelry.,
Brush up on gem value.",How to Sell Antique Jewelry1," Ask yourself if someone unrelated to you would genuinely be interested in wearing the piece of jewelry. Look through fashion magazines; many of them have upscale antique and current antique style jewelry. This will give you an idea if the jewelry you have is currently in style. If it is, selling it will be much easier. Be aware that when jewelry holds sentimental value for you it can often affect how much you want to sell it for, and it's much harder to take into consideration how others would impartially value it. While the ""Antique"" style is currently in, it is only in to a certain degree. If your pieces are not in vogue you may be better off selling them for their metal or gemstones.;
, Simply put, jewelry that is less worn will sell better than jewelry that has been worn frequently or is damaged. Pieces that have issues can be restored, which may improve the likelihood of selling them, but the restoration costs for major repairs can actually be higher than the money you will make from selling the piece once the repairs are complete. Plus, serious collectors often do not like pieces that have been restored, so restoration often reduces the value of the piece. If you are only replacing missing gemstones, by all means repair it, provided they are easy to replace and the stones from that period are readily available. The good part is that it's unusual to be able to tell if a stone has been replaced if it was restored correctly.

, Appraisals, especially written ones, are never free, especially from an organization such as the GIA (The Gemological Institute of America, formed in 1931) or even a local jewelry store, and can run in the hundreds of dollars for items worth thousands, so keep that in mind. And an appraisal for insurance purposes is always higher than what your jewelry is worth on a retail basis. Expect it to be less than half it's replacement value when you're trying to sell it. You are closer to a tenth of the insurance value. And remember, even when a piece is valuable people seldom want to pay what it's worth. Older appraisals can tell someone what stones are in the setting, the gold/platinum or silver content and design as well as age, but not current value. It's always a good idea to keep all of your appraisals to show how the value has increased. And a good rule of thumb is to count on it's doubling in value approximately every 7 years or so, based on how the fine metal markets are doing., Unless otherwise instructed by an antique collector or an appraiser, you should clean the jewelry to make it look as appealing as possible. If you do not know how to clean a piece properly, though, you could end up damaging it. Taking the jewelry to a jeweler or other professional is your best option unless you are absolutely certain that you can clean the piece without harming it. However, be very cautious with using a jeweler to clean stones; if the stone has any inclusions, cleaning with a sonic machine or steam could destroy the stone-literally breaking it into pieces, especially diamonds.

The safest way to clean most jewelry is to gently scrub it with mild soap and warm water, using a soft toothbrush. Toothpaste can work on hard gemstones but it can scratch gold and softer gemstones such as opals. Even a toothbrush can cause marks on very soft high gold content jewelry and soft stones.
Never use chlorine to clean gold or gemstones. Ammonia is safe to use on hard gemstones but is too abrasive for many gemstones. If you are not sure what the stones are, since many look alike, such as aquamarines and topaz, you are better off using a soft cloth and dish soap with warm, not hot or cold, water. Rinse very well. The very safest way to clean antique jewelry is by using a microfiber cloth without any liquids at all.

, The karat stamp reveals how pure the gold is. A 24-karat gold piece is pure gold and will be worth approximately the current running price of gold per ounce, at the selling cost, not buying, which is always higher. Most jewelry, especially antique pieces, are only 9-karat pieces, meaning that they are only about 37.5 percent pure. As such, you will only receive, at most, one third the price of scrap gold. Other pieces can be as high as 23 karat gold and those pieces will be malleable to the touch and you can actually make marks in the jewelry itself. Finding 23k gold is unusual in the USA and Europe and much more common in Asia and India. It has a reddish look, compared to the yellow gold the USA and Europe is more used to seeing.Some very old gold does not have a karat stamp so you may want to test it to make sure that it is actually gold. Often when a piece is sized, or worn often the karat stamp may have been cut off or worn off making it impossible to tell the purity of the gold. Also, given the propensity for some makers to incorrectly mark gold you almost always want to chemical test to check the purity. Another quick way to test the jewelry is to expose it to a magnet. If it sticks, then it is not real gold. This test does not work on all metals, including platinum, which may or may not have a recognizable stamp.

, Knowing how valuable certain gemstones are can give you a good idea of how valuable your jewelry is. Of course , without official certification, you have no way of knowing just how valuable or high-quality a specific gem is, or even if it is real. That is where a jeweler comes in. They can tell you what stones are in your jewelry and if they are real. Even if you don't get an actual appraisal you will have an idea of the jewelry's value based on the stones. The types of stones used in your jewelry can also often help you date pieces so that you have more information for the buyers.

Sell the jewelry to a jewelry shop.,
List the jewelry online.,
Sell your jewelry for parts.,
Take the jewelry into a pawn shop.",How to Sell Antique Jewelry2," Almost any jewelry shop that buys jewelry will be willing to purchase yours, provided it's in fairly decent condition. The jeweler will usually pay you up to 40 percent of the gold's current scrap price for gold jewelry, and if the piece itself is signed by a maker such as Tiffany's or another designer, they may pay you more for the jewelry itself instead of only paying you for the metal and the gems. It is best to talk to several jewelers before making a final sale, however, to ensure that you get the best offer. Be aware that most jewelry stores buy jewelry based on scrap prices, not the selling price of gold, so you will likely get approximately 1/10th to 1/7th the selling value of the item. Unless it has a tremendous provenance or value do not expect a very high return when selling vintage jewelry., Create a listing for your jewelry on an auction website, free online classifieds website, or on a website that specializes in the sale of vintage or antique goods. Be sure to include plenty of pictures and to mention any certification that the jewelry has. Also make sure to sell a piece for a cost that is comparable with other similar pieces being sold on the same website.


Set up shop on your own if you have a lot of jewelry to sell. You can create your own webpage fairly easily, and it might be a better option for you if you have a large supply of antique jewelry that you plan on selling on a long-term basis.

, If you are unable to find a buyer interested in your jewelry as a wearable piece, you may need to sell it as scrap. Mail-away gold-buying operations allow you to send your gold in and will send a check back to you in return, but while this is convenient, it pays the least of any of your options. So only do a ""Gold Party"" or Mail Order envelope as a last resort. Meanwhile, many coin shops are willing to purchase gold jewelry if it is pure enough, though, and will usually pay a higher price.


If your jewelry is in bad shape but the gems are in good condition, a jeweler may be interested in acquiring the piece so that the gems can be removed and reused in another piece, but this does not often happen.

, Pawn shops will test the jewelry to make sure that its metals and gemstones are real, and if everything is valuable, they are usually willing to buy the piece at fraction of it's value, it's how they make money, by buying pieces of jewelry for as little as possible. It is a quick way to make a little money, and as an added benefit, if you change your mind a day or two later, you can return to the pawn shop and buy it back (with interest).

Look for the gram weight.,
Determine the Karat weight of the item (10K, 14K, 18K, etc).,
Obtain the current market price of gold in ounces.,
Find your favorite gold chain.",How to Price a Gold Chain by the Gram," The first step of evaluating whether a gold chain necklace is priced accurately, is to check the gold chain for the listed ""gram weight"" of the chain. The amount of grams in a chain is the measure of the gold content in the item. Knowing the gram weight of a chain will allow you to compare the amount of gold in the chain with other items from other stores, giving you the perfect tool to ""comparison shop"".


If you are shopping from a traditional jeweler, they should have a jeweler's scale and be able to obtain the weight of the item for you, right then and there.
If you are shopping online, the gram weight ought to be listed in the necklace's description, i.e. ""This chain weighs approx. 34.0 grams"".;
, Once you have done so, you can compare ""apples to apples"". A 14K gold chain will weigh more than a 10K gold chain of the same style and size because 14k has more gold content than 10K. Likewise, an 18K gold chain will weigh more than a 14K gold chain.

, You can do so from a gold site, such as kitco.com.


For example, as of the writing of this article, the spot price for gold is approx. $1,200 per ounce. Using, the below simple formula, you will need to convert ounces of gold to grams of gold (since gold jewelry is often listed in grams, not ounces. Grams are more manageable when dealing with the average weight of most gold jewelry items):

Price of gold per ounce / 31.1 / 24 x KARAT of your item = Base price of gold content per gram of gold.


In the below example, plug $1,200 per ounce (today's gold price) into the formula for determining the base price per gram of a 14K gold chain. Other numbers in the formula represent 31.1 grams per ounce of gold. 24 represents 24K which is pure gold and what the gold market value uses, since they are representing the value of 24K gold per ounce. 

Example: $1,200 / 31.1 / 24 X 14 = $22.50 per gram. What does this tell you? That each 1 gram of 14k gold is worth $22.50 as far as the raw precious metals of gold are concerned. Still following? Go to the last step to find out how it all comes together.



, In the article example, the gold will be priced at $1,000 and weight 29.0 grams. To determine how much the gold chain is being sold per gram, divide $1,000 by 29.0 grams. The answer is: $34.48 per gram of gold. Using your information from Step 3, you know that the raw price of 14k gold was $22.50. This means that the gold chain is being sold at $11.98 above the price of gold. That is actually not bad at all, considering that there is both labor involved in manufacturing the chain and a modest mark up from both the wholesale and the retailer. Knowing all of this will arm you with the knowledge to determine how much your gold chain is worth and how much above the ""scrap value"" or ""precious metals"" value the chain is being marked up. Now you have the tools to compare chain for chain and jeweler to jeweler!

Check out the following list for some idea of which watches or watch brands currently resell well.",How to Sell a Watch," There is no point trying to get a good price on a watch you only paid $50.00 for. Watches made to last a short time, from cheap plastic, with gimmicks on them or using fake designer labels are not worth your effort in trying to sell them, at least not for a decent return. On the other hand, an expensive Swiss watch made of metal, with fine workings, from a reputable designer brand and targeted at the luxury market, may well be worth your time selling.The watch should be currently desirable, one of the sought-after brands. For some people, this means only Swiss, but for others, it generally means high-end brands or specific editions.A list of watches that appear to hold their resale value is found at the end of this article.


This is not to say you can't sell a cheap watch; it simply means you need to expect next-to-nothing for it and sell it through a method that won't chew up the sale in commission and opportunity cost.;
, There are some features that those in the watch resale industry consider help ensure that the watch keeps sufficient value for resale. These include:The watch is made from stainless steel
Complexity of the watch; it will be worth more if it took many months to create by hand
Conservative - it has hours, minutes, seconds and date; no other features (too faddish, too garish and the watch is less likely to hold its value well)
It is of an average size (although this depends on the trends of the time and brand influence)
It uses automatic Swiss movement
The brand is recognizable and sells well when new
The watch is rarer than other watches; if it was sold in limited supply or as a limited edition (perhaps for an anniversary celebration of the watchmaker), it will often be more attractive as a resale item (but see ""conservative"" above).

, Even if your watch is desirable, is it in good shape? Some things to consider include:


The watch should be in very good condition, close to as good as new if possible. Get a professional clean from an expert if it needs a clean and polish up; do not attempt this yourself in case you devalue the watch.
The watch should be in working condition. If not, can you get it fixed and still make it a worthwhile sale? Be aware that replacement pieces can immediately devalue its worth.The watch should be original. As noted, replacement pieces can alter the value, as can aftermarket add-ons.Does the watch come with its original packaging and perhaps even with the sales receipt? These ""peripheral"" items can increase the value because they help to authenticate both the source and the original purchase price. Plus, some people like to have the original packaging if it was well made.

, Be aware that the after-market price will be very different from the profit-inclusive retail price. In most cases your watch will be worth quite a lot less than what you paid for it. However, in some cases, it may have increased in value due to its rarity, collectible status, or in some cases, because it was owned by someone famous, notorious or noteworthy.

, You can find out through various sources whether or not the watch has value. Begin with the brand's own website and retailer sites, to see whether the watch in question is still being sold and for what price. Most useful of all, especially for older, vintage watches, are the auction sites. If you find watches of the same brand, style and date selling on these sites, you will get a good idea of current market value (what buyers are likely to pay for it).


Be sure to do a comparison with quite a few different sellers and auctions sites, just in case nobody is buying and the sellers are just valuing off each other!
Additional research can be done by checking out books about watches from the library or online ebook sources. Look for information about what makes your watch unique and desirable (or what it lacks by way of those essentials).

, If you start veering too far away from the age, style and condition of your watch, your appraisal won't be realistic. It must be like-with-like unless you know something about the watch that sets it apart, such as a famous actor or singer having once owned it (in which case you'll need proof).


Be aware that even within the same range of watches, some may have been made better than others, in order to capture two different price markets. Always be sure of which one you have before assuming it is worth a good amount.

, Get a professional appraisal and be sure to obtain a certificate from the appraiser. Knowing the exact value of your watch is the best way to get as much money as possible for it.

,, The best way to sell a watch will depend on its value and whether you're happy to sell it direct or you'd rather sell through someone. Selling direct requires more effort on your behalf but you will likely get more for the sale, as selling through someone else usually entails a high commission.

, There are various ways that you can do this, including:


Consider whether anyone you know has expressed an interest in your watch before. This might be a friend, a family member or a coworker. Of course, you'll need to be polite and make it clear that there is absolutely no pressure; don't let anyone feel they have to buy your watch. Try offering the watch to this person at a fair price, before trying one of the other ways of selling it.
Sell via an auction site. Auction sites such as eBay will allow buyers from all around the world to find your watch. If it's something that a person is after, no matter where they are, they can bid on it. However, you will need to have a good track record of sales, as the trust factor is very important when selling a collectible or valuable item. If you haven't established this yet, this option may not be the best one for you. To reassure bidders, have the official valuation done and included as part of the sale.
If online auctions aren't for you, try a watch swap-and-sell online forum. Many watch enthusiast websites have forums where people within the community trade and sell watches. While finding, joining, and building an element of trust within these communities takes time, it can be rewarding to be involved in a community where people have interests that are similar to your own. On the other hand, there is a certain amount of risk associated with working within systems like these, so use extreme caution if you choose to try your luck with a forum.

, If you aren't keen to do the groundwork yourself, there are other options open to you for selling your watch through a qualified seller:


A safe and often easy way to sell your watch is to take it to a professional jeweler or watch shop, perhaps the same one that appraised your watch, and ask whether they would be willing to buy your watch from you or place it on consignment on your behalf. You can sometimes ask for store credit, something that will probably appeal to the owner. The pitfall here is that most jewelry stores and watch specialists have high overhead and need to maximize profits, so though you're likely to get less in the end than you would with other methods.
As an alternative to auction sites where you list items and market them on your own, consider an auction site that specializes in high-value items, marketing them only to qualified buyers.
Sell through an auction house. Call local auction houses and set up a meeting for assessing the worth of auctioning off your watch. If there are specific jewelry and watch auctions run by the auction house, you'll be able to get your watch both appraised and allotted to a specific auction that will attract people expecting watches. However, this option is only recommended if your watch is worth a great deal, such as $100,000, or if the auction house is small and doesn't take huge commissions.For any less, you may find fees and commissions are just too prohibitive. (There is also the risk of using a small auction house not being able to get you the return on the watch that you're seeking.)
Pawnshops are always looking for watches to buy, but in most cases, they should be considered as a last resort. Most pawnshop staffers have no special knowledge of watches and unfortunately, low-balling prices as a means of staying on the safe side and maximizing profits is universal throughout the pawnshop business. If you'd like to get a short term loan and use your watch as collateral, you may find the idea of working with a pawnshop appealing; otherwise, it's best to avoid pawnshops if at all possible.

, If you have an old watch or various old watches that are still in good condition but aren't valuable, keep the price low, around $2 to $10 for really ordinary watches and up to $100 or so for fashionable, low-end designer watches. Look for a watch category on an online site, or check out the costume jewelry categories, to see whether these include watch sales too. If getting something is better than nothing, then you will probably find a buyer who is happy with the bargain and you can always keep adjusting the price downward until someone nibbles. Bear in mind costs of the site's commission, packaging and your time before settling on the final price to list cheap watches at.


Another alternative way is to sell if at a yard or garage sale, a car boot sale or on a market stall. However, you'll also need to be selling a whole lot of other stuff to make this effort worthwhile.
Some people like to do craft with old watches. If you have a bundle of watch faces and workings that you no longer want, consider listing these in a craft section of an auction site or some type of craft supplies exchange.

, Once your watch has sold, get paid in the safest and most appropriate way relevant to the method of selling you've used. In a nutshell:


With online auction sites such as eBay, you may have to wait for your money if you don't have a well-established seller profile. The more money you make on the transaction, the longer you may have to wait for your cash.You can accept payments by cash on collection, through bank account or by credit. If the watch is really valuable, you may also wish to use an escrow service offered by the auction site, in which a third party handles the transaction to ensure it is authentic and above board.
When working with most online retail sites, payment happens immediately, usually with funds being sent directly to your bank account.
If you decide to sell your watch via forum, payment varies. As such, it's vital that you work with a trusted buyer and do not send the watch until payment is confirmed.
When working with jewelry stores and watch sellers, you may be paid immediately for a sale, although in some cases you may be forced to wait until your watch actually sells to a local buyer. There may be other reasons for payment delays too; discuss this with the retailer before going ahead with the sale.
With pawnshops, you get cash in hand immediately, but you are likely to be less than pleased with the way the overall transaction went.

Find an expert appraiser in your area by contacting a national appraisal association. Some associations to try are the Accredited Gemologists Association (AGA), American Gem Society, or National Association of Jewelry Appraisers.You can find an association online or in your local phone book.
Some associations are active only in certain countries. For example, the Accredited Gemologists Association is only available in the United States.
You may need to pay an appraisal fee.
There is no set fee structure for appraisals so make sure you ask how much you will be charged before consenting to the appraisal.The appraiser will need to see the jewelry in person.
It takes 15-20 minutes to examine the jewelry but can take 1-2 weeks for the appraisal documentation to be prepared as the appraiser will research comparable jewelry and check the current prices of diamonds and precious metals.;
, There are many factors that go into valuing a diamond. These factors are known as the Four C’s.Clarity refers to how clear a diamond is.Diamonds with no flaws are more valuable.Cut refers to the diamond's shape, proportions, symmetry and polish.The cut, along with the other factors, impacts the value of the diamond.Color can drastically influence the price of a diamond.Some colored diamonds (pink, blue, yellow) are highly valued but a white diamond with a yellow tint will be less valuable than one that is colorless.Carat refers to the size of the diamond.Larger diamonds, especially those over 1 carat, are more expensive., Certification will give the buyer peace of mind that they are getting what is being advertised.


GIA (Gemological Institute of America) is a non-profit research institute that offers unbiased gem evaluations. They are highly regarded in the industry.AGS (American Gem Society) is also highly regarded and may offer a higher valuation than GIA.EGL (European Gemological Laboratory) is a for-profit organization that evaluates diamonds in Europe as well as the United States.Because the EGL is for-profit, some industry professionals question the validity of their valuations.You will need to send the jewelry via mail to one of these organizations.
Be sure to fill out any online forms the organization requires.The cost of certification is based on size of diamond. Larger diamonds will cost more to certify.Be aware that it can take up to 2 weeks to receive the certification report., Be sure to protect yourself from fraud.Use a secure computer to set up the online account. Do not use the free WiFi at a public place such as a coffee shop as it is easy to hack into your computer at these places.Chose a reputable site, such as eBay, that provides some protections against fraud.
Consider using a service such as PayPal for added protection. Use a company that specializes in buying diamonds and diamond jewelry online such as Worthy.comor W.P. Diamonds.Research any company you are considering by contacting the Better Business Bureau and looking at online reviews.
Avoid any company that offers only vague information about their business or that you cannot find information about (such as reviews) online.
If you have a negative feeling about a potential buyer, do not sell to them.

, You can sell to a jeweler, diamond dealer or pawnbroker.This is the best option for those who want to sell diamonds quickly without much hassle.
The downside to selling to an industry insider is that you will probably make only a small percentage of the value of the diamond.
Professionals will want to resell and make profit from your stone.
Professionals also have access to wholesale diamond dealers who can offer low priced diamonds, making them less likely to pay top dollar for yours.
Pawnbrokers, dealers and jewelers in your area can easily be found online and in the phone book.
Be sure to check out their reputation by contacting the Better Business Bureau.
You may also find reviews of their company online or ask family and friends if they have any recommendations.

, You may be able to get a higher price from the general public than an industry professional.The general public is more likely to pay a higher price as they are not worried about making a profit on resale.
It can be difficult to find a reputable buyer online.
To make sure a buyer is reputable and serious, you may want to speak to them on the phone before confirming the sale or sending the jewelry.Selling to someone in your area, who you will meet in person, is a good way to avoid being scammed. However, use common sense and do not meet the person alone or in your home.Use a company such as Worthy.com which will help you market and auction your jewelry to the public.Know whether a site will take a percentage of the sale price.

, Receive payment and ship the jewelry.


Remember that the main reason for someone to purchase ""used"" jewelry is to pay less. You should not expect to get what you paid for the jewelry.
Comparable jewelry sold online will tell you how much you can expect to charge. Use the comparables when negotiating.
Make sure you receive payment before shipping the jewelry.
There are many options for receiving payment, including PayPal, Google Wallet and Amazon Payments.Be aware that online payment companies charge a fee, which varies by company.

, Securely send the jewelry to the buyer.


Use the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) to ship the jewelry. Send via First Class Mail with Insurance for protection against damage or loss.Another option is to use the Federal Express Jewelry Shipping Program for security and speed of delivery.Use a nondescript box for shipping that does not reveal the contents.
Use packaging materials such as bubble wrap to cushion the jewelry.

Therefore, you don’t want to pawn more jewelry than you have to, especially if you’re unable to repay the loan.Knowing how much money you need on loan will help you figure out the minimal amount of jewelry you need to choose from your collection for pawning.;
, Try to choose jewelry to pawn that you know you can live without. Pawning family heirloom jewelry might be something you regret later on, but an engagement ring from an old relationship might be easier to part with.

, Pawn shops are usually only interested in pure metals, like gold and silver, and diamonds. They often turn down gold-plated items, as well as costume jewelry. Take your jewelry to an appraiser or jeweler for a free assessment to find out what your jewelry contains and what it’s worth.You can find appraisers and jewelers near you by doing an online search.
Remember that a pawn shop won’t typically offer the true value of your jewelry, but it’s good to get an idea of what it’s worth, so you know what to expect at a pawn shop (about 60% to 70% of its true value).

, If possible, don’t pawn all your jewelry at once. Keep at least one or two valuable pieces with you in case you aren’t able to pay back the loan on time. That way, you can pawn again if you need to buy some more time so that you don’t lose ownership of your jewelry.

, Pawn shops will allot you a certain amount of time to repay your loan. If you do not pay in time, the pawn shop is allowed to keep your jewelry. To ensure the highest chances of reclaiming your valuables, be sure to make an accurate assessment on how long it will take you to repay.


Be sure to factor in some “wiggle room” into your time frame. Perhaps add an extra couple weeks into your projected time frame in case something comes up and you aren’t able to produce the money as quickly as planned.

, Not all pawn shops are equal. Some will offer more money for less jewelry and others will have better interest rates or offer longer periods of time to pay back the loan. Do an online search ahead of time to find out which pawn shops offer the best terms based on your needs.Online pawn shops may be able to offer you a better loan and a longer time to pay it off, but they will be harder to negotiate with, especially if you are trying to pawn rare jewelry.

, Pawn shops try to remain competitive with each other, so if you decide to pawn locally, visit a few different shops to be sure you are getting the best value for your jewelry.

, Pawn shops can swap your jewelry for cheaper items when you aren’t looking so never let your jewelry out of your sight. If you didn’t get an appraisal done, bring your own scale to showcase the weight of your jewelry. Don’t trust a pawn shop scale.


Don’t let a pawn shop talk your jewelry down or appraise it for you.

, When you’ve found a pawn shop with the right terms for your needs, don’t be afraid to negotiate for the best deal. The pawn shop staff can always decline your offer or offer a counter, so you have nothing to lose by trying.When you negotiate, allow the shop to make the first offer.
You can negotiate the value of the jewelry, the interest rate of the loan, and the time it will take you to pay it back.Be prepared to walk away if the shop staff isn't willing to give you the terms that you want.

, Don’t trust a pawn shop that doesn’t offer some sort of contract or agreement that documents the loan. Make sure the terms of the loan, the interest rate, and the timing of loan payback are clearly outlined. Be sure there is also a description of the jewelry included.Take photos of your jewelry laying next to the contract at the pawn shop in case there are any future disputes about the terms or the jewelry pawned.

, It’s really important to pay back the loan on time so that you can recover your jewelry safely. Pawn shops can’t resell everything that gets pawned so they will often melt down jewelry into pure metals and sell it at a market price. They can do this as soon as the jewelry is officially theirs.


Therefore, your best chance of recovering your jewelry is by repaying the loan by the date and time listed on the contract.

Keep a ""recipe book"" to record what you spent on each design.,
Record the time you spent on each design.,
Calculate labor costs.,
Calculate wholesale prices.,
Calculate retail price.,
Don’t sell yourself short.,
Perform market research.,
Reevaluate your design.,
Increase your prices.",How to Price Your Jewelry Designs," Price every item used in your designs. For example, if you pay $1.50 for a dozen sterling crimp beads, and you used 2 crimps beads in your design, you would divide $1.50 by 12. The more meticulous you are about calculating expenses, the better your pricing will be. Keep track of packing materials and the shipping costs.


Keep receipts. This will make it easier to keep track of costs. You can use them when calculating tax deductions.
If you do not keep meticulous track of costs, you should round up when estimating costs. You don’t want to short yourself.
You should be purchasing supplies at wholesale prices (i.e. bulk prices). If you purchase them at retail price these calculations will be off, and it is probable that you will have trouble turning a profit.;
, The time you spent on each design is important in calculating your labor costs. It is also important for establishing your profitability. If it takes you 30 minutes to recreate a design, you would charge differently than you would for a design that takes 4-5 hours to create. Write your time spent in your recipe book.

, To determine your labor costs, divide the time you spent working into 15 minute segments. It makes it easier to calculate price. If you spend a little over an hour making a certain piece, round it up to an hour and 15 minutes. You can charge more for custom made pieces. Keep in mind, this is only the cost of your time, this is not your actual salary. You charge whatever you believe your time is worth. Do not, however, charge ridiculously high labor costs if you're just starting out. If you already have a reputation, as jewelry maker or other, you can charge higher prices.


If, for example, you have priced your labor at $20 per hour and worked for 30 minutes on the design, you would multiple 20 X .5 = $10 or divide in half.
When deciding how much to pay yourself hourly, consider your experience. How long have you been designing jewelry? If you have a long track record, vast expertise, and a portfolio of unique designs, you may find that you can charge more. You may also have particular advantages, including contacts and unique designs, that allow you to charge more., Wholesale prices are lower prices that you offer to retailers who purchase approximately 10 items at a time.. Formula’s vary, but a good model is to add your material and packing costs and multiply those by 10% (to account for overhead) and add that to material costs. Then add your labor costs (rate X time) Multiply this by your profit margin, which varies, but should be around 20%. .For example, if the item cost you $10 in supplies and $1 in packaging, multiply 11 X .10=1.1+11=12.1. Add to your material costs (12.1) the price of labor. If you spent one hour and thirty minutes at a rate of $25 per hour that would be 25 X 1.5= 37.5. Add labor plus materials 12.1 + 37.5 = 39.6. Multiply by your profit margin 39.6 X .2= 7.92+39.6=$47.52. Round up to $48
Whole prices are lower to account for all of the money you save selling items in bulk. Selling in bulk means that you need to spend less time interacting with customers and less money shipping items or setting up stands. When you want to start selling at wholesale prices is up to you, but usually a purchase of anywhere from 6 to 12 items will justify whole sale prices.Overhead costs are how you factor in long term costs for your operation. This might include the price of a digital camera to take pictures, the cost of maintaining a website, or the price of space to make your jewelry. The best way to account for this to multiple your material costs by 10%., The retail price is the larger price you charge for an average customer buying one or two items at a time. Because this sort of exchange is more labor and price intensive on your part, you want to charge anywhere from 1.4 - 2 times your wholesale price. Thus, if your whole sale price was $48 you want to charge anywhere from $67 (48 X 1.4) to 96 (48 X 2).

, You should be slow to decrease your prices. People often take low prices as a sign of shoddy workmanship. Furthermore, underselling your competitors makes it difficult for anyone to make a living in the business. Be willing to wait for your items to begin selling and never sell below the price of supplies.

, Check your price calculations against comparable items. Review online jewelry sites or brick and mortar stores to see what things are selling for. If you can talk to an experienced designer, ask them for price estimates. Most importantly, ask yourself if you are selling enough items or, conversely, if you are selling them quickly enough to justify a price increase.


Have people offered to buy any of your jewelry designs? This is a good indication of the marketability of your designs.

, If your items are not selling, it is typically better to change your design than lower your prices. This can mean reducing material or labor costs. I could also mean starting over with a completely new design that more people are interested in purchasing.


Assess your materials. If you aren’t purchasing in bulk and getting wholesale prices, the materials will be too expensive for you to turn a profit.
It can be hard to sell labor intensive items that require a lot of time, because consumers do not necessarily understand how much time is required to make them and are not willing to pay commensurate prices. Sometimes adapting these labor intensive products into smaller designs is a good way to reduce the amount of time you put into them and begin selling them at rates the market will bear., If your items are selling well and you have committed customers, you can increase your price. Consider developing two price ranges. Continuing making the products that have been successful, but also begin making higher quality products that you can charge more for. With this two tier pricing system, you can continue to attract new customers with cheap products, while pulling in larger margins in the upscale market."

Basic Latin will also usually have an accusative, or the object of the sentence.,
Find out what the person in the nominative is doing.,
Work out the other words.,
Learn common exclamation phrases that the Romans used.,
Learn how to pronounce the Latin words.

,
Know that in the Latin you are likely to be reading, punctuation is used the same as English.

,
Practice.",How to Understand Basic Latin," In basic Latin there are five main cases: nominative(subject), accusative (object), genitive (possession), dative (to or for someone/something), or ablative (by, with or from someone/something). The nominative is the subject of the sentence, and the person or thing doing the action. For each noun, you will need to look up what declension and gender it is, and then work out its case.;
, This is the person or object that the action is being done to. For example, ""puella poetam amat"" Both puella and poetam belong to the 1st declension. The nominative singular ending for the first declension is -a, and the accusative singular ending is -am. This means that puella is nominative, poetam is accusative, and so the sentence reads ""The girl loves the poet.""

, For this you need to find the verb.




Verbs have many different tenses, Present, Perfect, Imperfect, Future, Pluperfect, and Future-Perfect. Present tense is in the now(someone IS doing something). Perfect is past tense that is a completed action(someone HAS/HAVE done something). Imperfect is past tense of a verb that didn't finish(someone WAS doing something). Future is an action that will occur or hasn't occurred yet(someone WILL do something). Pluperfect tense is a form of past tense that occurred before another action (someone DID something BEFORE he/she did something ELSE). Future-perfect is an action that will happen in the future and be completed (someone WILL HAVE done something) (not used very often but still may come across it)..
Verbs ending in ""-o"" ""-s"" ""-t"" ""-mus"" ""-tis"" ""-nt"" are usually in present tense.
Verbs ending in ""-bam"" ""-bas"" ""-bat"" ""-bamus"" ""-batis"" ""-bant"" are usually in imperfect tense.
""-i"" ""-is"" ""-it"" ""-imus"" ""-istis"" ""-erunt"" are in the perfect tense.
Verbs you are likely to come across are (in the infinitive ):



Dicere: to say (like dire in French)
Exire: to go out (like exit)
Facere: to make/do (like faire in French)
Narrare: to tell (like narrate)
Portare: to carry
Rogare: to ask (like interROGate)
Videre: to see (like video)
Est: He/She is (irregular)
Potest: He/She is able (irregular)
Vult: He/She wants (irregular)
Iit: He/She went (irregular)







, This is the hardest part, because this article can't explain all the nouns you are likely to come across. However, think about other European languages you know because there are many similarities. Take the context into account as well. A Latin dictionary would be very useful or you could do an Internet search for the many websites with vocabulary lists. Use the same principle of nominative and accusative.

Salve: Hello
Vale: Goodbye, farewell
Vah!: Ugh!
Tace!: Be silent!
Nonne?: Surely?
Minime: No
Ita Vero: Yes
Gratia: Thanks
Cur?: Why?

Mix and match your materials.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Choose a shade of white.,
Wear the right underwear.",How to Match Clothes With White Pants1," Playing with a variety of materials of different textures will help make your outfit look more visually appealing. You can try wearing a smooth satin or silk blouse with a plain white jean or a ribbed sweater with a smoother polyester-blend slack.


If your top is the exact same material as your white pants, then you'll need to make sure that the colors contrast a bit, or that you're wearing a belt, jacket, or other accessories to break up the monochromatic look.





;
, You can think of a pair of white pants as a blank canvas -- you can put almost anything on it and make it work as long as you have some forethought. When you consider a color scheme for your white pants, you can think of the following options:


Go with all white. Create the ultimate clean, crisp appearance by pairing a simple white blouse with your white pants.






Add some contrasting neutrals, such as black, gray, tan, or brown. Wearing other neutrals can give your style a sophisticated edge.
Give your outfit a boost of color. Bright colors will give you a bolder and more fun look, while paler shades will create a softer, more feminine appearance.







, There are a variety of colors that fall under the category of ""white,"" though most shades can either be considered a bright white or an off-white. Bright white is more like a piece of paper, and off-white is a softer, less bright color. Here are some things you can try as you think about the shade of your white pants:


Match bright, “pure” white pants with cooler tones. For neutrals, go with black, gray, and silver. For colors, choose blues, purples, and blue-tinted greens like turquoise.
Match cream or off-white pants with warmer tones. Tan, brown, and gold make the best options for neutrals. For colors, go with reds, oranges, yellow-tinted greens, and red-tinted purples like magenta.

, Even if your pants are made of a thicker material, you still run the risk of having your underwear show through. Wear flesh-toned undergarments. Avoid black and bright colors and be cautious about white since white can still be visible under white.If you're wearing a thong, take a look to make sure you're really covered up before you step out of the house. Avoiding panty lines is important, but so is covering your assets.

You'll still be able to show off your curves about the waist while covering your legs a bit more.


A cute belt can add some flavor to this outfit. Since your waist may be visible or somewhat visible because of your tight top, you can think about wearing a simple black belt.

, This will create a more formal look. You can match this outfit with a pair of stilettos or even some strappy heels. Any color of shirt will do: a darker color will create more contrast, and a softer light shade such as pink or light purple will create a more subtle, flowing look.

, This is a great look for the cooler months. You can wear a regular v-neck sweater, a turtleneck, or any other kind of sweater that doesn't hang too loosely. Remember that since the wide-pants are more loose, a tighter top will create the most balance for this look.


You can rock this look with a pair of ankle boots with a narrow heel. For a more casual look, a cute pair of clogs will do the trick if it's not too cold.

To show off your legs even more, throw on some strappy heels. The higher they are, the more they'll do the trick.







, Choose a tunic in a solid color or a simple pattern, and tie a sash or belt around your natural waist. If the tunic doesn't have a pattern around the neck, wear a long, fun necklace. If it does, try a simple pair of earrings to accentuate your look.


Wrap the look together with a pair of narrow heels.







, Choose a blouse in a solid neutral color to create an elegant look. Accessorize with silver or gold jewelry, depending on the shade of white pant and on the color of your blouse. Wear it with a nice pair of simple close-toed heels.

, The white camisole can be more cream-colored or off white and will will still look great with a pair of white jeans. Just put it all together by wearing an open button-down brown or black sweater that falls at mid-thigh. Pair this look with close-toed heels that are the same color as the sweater.

, This will create a more casual approach for your look. You can have more fun with this look by choosing a vibrant pattern for your blouse and tucking it into your jeans. Wear loud or chunky accessories and even think about wearing a cute scarf or beaded bracelets with this look.

Depending on the colors, patterns, and even embellishments, the same shirt can look cute, chic, or even sexy. This section will give you a few tips and ideas on how to find cute pieces for your outfit.;
, Jeans are a must in any closet, as they tend to go well with just about anything. However, there are other pieces you add to your cute outfit. Here are some basic ideas to get you started:Skirts and dresses that are flirty and girly. They are not too short and not too tight. Most are going to be mid-thigh of longer.
Blouses and shirts are modest. Great options are loose, flowing blouses, button-up shirts, scoop-neck fitted tees, and even printed or graphic tees.
Boot-cut and skinny jeans aren't the only pants that can be cute. Shorts (especially with lace insets), baggy boyfriend jeans, and culottes can also be quite cute., Some people associate certain colors with ""cute"" more so than other colors. Light colors, such as pinks, light blues, and whites are youthful and feminine. Clothes with these colors are often quite cute. You can branch out to other colors too. For example:


Neutrals, such as browns and creams are great for the fall and winter months.
A flash of a bright color, such as red, can also be cute, but try to stay away from too many dark colors. These can look more mature, sexy, or chic than cute.

, Almost any pattern works here, but you might want to focus on delicate patterns and prints, such as florals, roses, and other flowers. These can soften up pieces that might be otherwise considered sexy or chic. Patterns are also great for adding texture and variety to your outfit.

, Instead of just focusing on denim pants, jersey fitted tees, and cotton blouses, try adding some other textures to your wardrobe as well. They can help the final outfit look all the more cute. Here are some ideas:


Knits, especially chunky knits, can help make a winter outfit look cozier. Think cardigans and over-sized sweaters.
Flannel will usually come in the form of a plaid, button-up shirt. They are great for layering.
Leather and fake leather can add a touch of smoothness to any outfit.
Pieces with chiffon or lace overlays are a great way of adding texture to any outfit.

, Much like floral patterns, some white eyelet lace or ribbon can also soften any clothing piece and make it look more cute. Jewelry can also make any plain outfit into an outfit that pops.

, Modesty is often associated with cuteness, so you might want to consider softer shapes rather than pointier ones. Here are some examples:


Consider a softer neckline, such as a scoop or sweetheart instead of a sharp point.
When choosing skirts, consider a flirty, loose-fitting skirt that goes past your mid-thigh over a short or tight fitting skirt. The later would be considered more sexy or chic.
Loose fitting blouses, oversized sweaters, and full-circle skirts can all look super cute.

, Full-circle skirts from the 1950s can look not only cute, but also flirty and chic. They are also super fun to twirl in. Hippie shirts and boho blouses from the 1970s can also be very cute when paired with the right accessories.


You can find lots of cute vintage pieces in vintage clothing shops, consignment shops, online, or even secondhand clothing shops.

, Most people might associate ""cute"" with ""feminine,"" so you might want to consider this when picking out your shoes. This does not mean that you have to wear pink heels, however. There are many other shoes that can also count as ""cute."" Here are some ideas to get you started:Ballet flats and moccasins are great because they can work with almost any outfit.
Shoes with embellishments, such as lace and bows, are always a great start.
Wedges are perfect for the summertime, especially if they come with long, ballerina-style laces.
Heeled, chunky boots are a mixture of the feminine and the outdoors. They can be quite cute, especially if paired with skinny jeans.
If you like to wear canvas sneakers or clunky boots, consider getting a pair that has a colorful lining on the inside. You can also switch out the shoelaces for something more colorful or patterned.

, A simple pair of jeans and a white blouse can look casual and plain, but the right accessory can complete the outfit and make it look super cute. This section will give you a few tips and ideas for accessories and jewelry.

, Find something that looks girlish and flirty. You can also use jewelry to show off your personality and interests. For example:


If you like to keep things simple, choose a silver chain with a pink heart-shaped pendent. This will compliment a V-neck shirt. You could also go for some simple post or dangle earrings.
If you like to make a statement, don't shy away from chunky bracelets, large earrings, or a flashy statement necklace. Make your jewelry the focal point of your outfit, and keep the rest simple.
Take advantage of trinkets you got while traveling, especially if you cannot get any in your hometown. Your friends will see it as both unique and cute.

, Even if the rest of your outfit is plain, a cute-looking hat or scarf can make the rest of it look cute. You can wear hats and scarves year round. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Newsboy hats can look both chic and cute. They are usually made out of fabric, so you can easily add a brooch or pin onto the band.
Barrettes and slouching beanies are great for the cooler months.
A wide brimmed felt hat can look both chic and cute in the summer, especially if paired with over-sized sunglasses and red lipstick.
Big, chunky scarves are perfect for the winter. Fabric scarves and shawls are great for the spring and fall, when the weather is chilly but not yet freezing.

, They are large enough to hold your phone, wallet, key's and lip gloss. At the same time, they are small enough not to take away from the rest of your outfit. Consider picking up a clutch with a pattern on it, or a simple embellishment, such as a bow.

, Even if the rest of your outfit looks plain, a flower tucked into your braid can make it look super cute. If you don't like to wear flowers, you can also try a rhinestone or leather hair clip instead.


If it is the summertime, consider tucking a silk hibiscus flower into your hair.
You can also make your own clips by buying some blank hair clips from an arts and crafts store, and hot gluing buttons, tiny bows, or silk flowers to the top.

, Most outfits will benefit from some jewelry or a scarf or hat, but too many accessories will make your outfit look too busy and cluttered.

, If you are wearing two large accessories together, such as a hat and scarf, pay attention to the colors and patterns so that they don't clash with each other.

, If you have an outfit composed of neutral colors, such as whites, blacks, or navies, you can add a burst of color with an accessory. Here are some ideas:


If you are wearing white pants and a white-and-navy striped shirt, add a splash of color with a pair of red chic sunglasses and a red belt.
You can also match your accessories with your outfit. For example, if you are wearing a purple shirt with white flowers on it, choose a white scarf.

, Part of what makes a cute outfit a cute outfit is the time, effort, and thoughtfulness that was put into it. This section will give you a few tips on how to put together an outfit that not only looks fashionable, but also cute.

, This will be the main attraction for your outfit. This means that the rest of your outfit should be kept toned down so that it doesn't take the spotlight away. For example:


If you have a pair over over-sized sunglasses, consider pairing them with a simple white blouse, a midi skirt, and red lipstick. Keep your hair loose.If you got a new pair of shoes that you just love, pair them with a simple dress, then wear a belt or scarf that matches those shoes.
Draw attention to colorful patterned scarf by pairing it with plain jeans and a solid-colored shirt.
If you get stuck, you can always close your eyes, reach into your closet, and pull something out. Base the rest of your outfit around that item.This can be a great way to get out of a creativity block when you don't know what to wear for the day.

, Ideally, you'd want two to three layers on the top. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Wear a lacey tank top under a low-cut shirt. The lace will peep out from under the neckline and hemline of your shirt.
Cinch a peasant blouse with a wide belt around your waist.
Pair a simple shirt with a long sweater cardigan. Cinch the sweater around your waist with a wide belt.

, Matching colors, such as a white or pink blouse to a pair of light blue jeans, is always safe, but adding a pop of color can also make your outfit more interesting.For example:


If you have a vintage 1950s dress in navy blue with white trim, consider wearing a wide, red belt around your waist. The pop of color will tie your outfit together.
If your outfit is mostly one color, such as light blue or white, try adding a brown scarf or belt. The extra color will make your outfit look more interesting.

, Solid-colored pieces go well with patterned pieces, especially if they share a similar color. For example, many patterned pieces have a background color. You should take this background color into consideration when putting your outfit together. Here are some examples:


If you have a skirt with pink flowers on a blue background with some white detailing, choose a white shirt to bring out the white details.
If you have a white-and-navy stripped shirt, consider pairing it with a pair of dark-blue jeans or white jeans. You can add a bit of color with accessories, such as a pair of red sunglasses or a red bracelet.
Avoid wearing two or more different patterns together. Too many patterns will make your outfit look too busy and detract from its cuteness.

, Some contrasting outfits and accessories go well together, such as jeans, basic shirts, lace, and pearls. On the other hand, some contrasting outfits and accessories do not go well together, such as sneakers and a classy black dress with elegant jewelry. Here are some other pairings to avoid:


If your whole outfit is carefully selected to look classy, and then you put on tennis shoes, the shoes will stand out and people will notice them rather than your cute outfit.
If most of your outfit is punk or grunge, a collard shirt will stick out strangely.

, You can make new outfits by wearing some old pieces in your closet in new ways. Here are some ideas:


A colorful, patterned, light-weight scarf can be tied around the waist of a plain dress to add some spice.
Move things like belts up and down - anywhere from you waist to just under your chest is a good place for a belt. Try combos that you’ve never thought would work and see if you can add other pieces that draw them together.

, Some colors and prints look better depending on what time of the year it is. For example, bright, tropical prints look better in the summertime when the sun is bright. Dark, neutral colors look better in the wintertime because they give off an air of coziness. Here are some outfit ideas to get you started:


In the springtime, consider wearing more florals and pastels. For example, you could pair a pastel, floral-print blouse with a pink ruffled skirt. Add some girlish flats, a little clutch, and you are good to go.In the summertime, you can get away with more whites, bright colors, and bold patterns. Now's the time to bring out those linen maxi gowns, wide-brimmed hats, statement jewelry, and over-sized glasses. Wedges and heeled sandals are prefect for those warm, sunny days.
Start wearing more neutral colors in the fall. Depending on how cold it is, you can also start wearing some knits and flannels. For example, on a chilly day, you could pair a long, chunky sweater with a pair of solid-colored leggings and some ridding boots.Wear darker colors in the winter, and less white. If you like to wear light colors, consider wearing something ivory or cream. Trench coats and heeled boots are always great, fashionable options for the winter.

, In general, you want to keep your outfit simple. This does not mean that you should skip out on all the accessories, however. The fabrics and colors you choose can make a huge difference in how dressy or casual your outfit looks. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Keep your makeup simple in the daytime. Use light or neutral colors, such as pastels or earth tones.
Keep the fabrics simple. Leave the sequins, glitter, and silk for the evening, and focus on jersey, knits, flannels, cotton, linen, denim, and so forth.
Wear lighter colors when in doubt. If you can't decide between two dresses, go for the lighter one; it will look more casual than the black or bright red one.
Don't pile on too much jewelry—unless you are going for a boho look. When you do wear jewelry, leave your expensive, ornate pieces at home. They will look too dressy with a casual outfit.

, Fancier clothes are great for evening events. This is the time when you want to pull out all the stops. Some good ideas to use for evening outfits:


Dresses or skirts are easy to dress up with some flashy jewelry and heeled shoes.
Heavier makeup looks great in the lower light of evening and night.
Darker colors such as navy, black, and dark red look more formal than light colors.
Sequins or satiny fabric are good choices for evening outings.

, There are a ton of different styles that are appropriate for school. Choose something that flatters you, but that you also feel comfortable in. You will be spending most of the day in this outfit, after all. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Heels and wedges can get painful to walk in after a while. They can also make running to class more difficult. Consider wearing shorter heels or flat-bottomed shoes, such as ballet flats, canvas sneakers, or boots.
Wear layers. Some classrooms get chilly while others get hot. Consider wearing a cardigan or flannel blouse over your shirt that you can easily take on/off.
Tone down the accessories. They can get in the way while you are taking notes or carrying your backpack around. If you do choose to wear jewelry, make sure that it does not get in the way. A statement necklace can work well, but make sure that it won't get tangled with your backpack strap.Consider styling your hair instead of leaving it down. Braids, ponytails, and updos will keep it out of the way while you study.
Consider getting a shoulder bag instead of a backpack. They are often large enough to keep a few books in, and can look a like cuter than an ordinary backpack.

, Work isn't the place to make a fashion statement, but that does not mean that you can't wear a cute outfit. Depending on where you work, there may be some dress codes or expectations. Business casual is appropriate for most places of work. Here are some things to keep in mind:


Keep your shirts modest. Fitted tees are fine, so long as they don't show too much cleavage or expose your midriff. Blouses and button-up shirts are great for work.
Leave the tight pants, skinny jeans, and shorter skirts at home. Consider some dress pants or boot-cut jeans instead.
Wear muted colors and less patterns. Bright colors and flashy patterns might look too casual for work.

, Because cute outfits are also well-put-together, you might want to consider giving your hair and makeup some extra attention in the morning when you get ready. You do not have to dress yourself up completely. A few extra touches here and there can go a long way. This section will give you a few tips on what you can do. You don't have to use all of them; choose a one or two that appear to you the most.

, This will give your face a softer look. Darker colors tend to look more mature, especially during the daytime. Here are some ideas to get your started:


For softer colors, consider pinks, light blues, soft greens, and light purples.
For neutral colors, consider creams, ivory, and browns.

, There are different styles of makeup, ranging from cute to classy to glamorous. There are also different styles of outfits. When putting on your makeup, make sure that it does not clash with your outfit. Here are some examples:


If you are wearing a simple outfit consisting of jeans and a t-shirt, wear simple makeup in neutral colors.
If you are wearing light, flowing, and pastel-colored clothes, then go for simple, light-colored makeup.
Classic styles generally go well with some basic, natural-looking makeup.

, Too much makeup can look out of place on some occasions—it can also detract from your outfit. At the same time, a little extra makeup can amp up the classiness of your outfit. Here are some examples:


During the day time, wear less makeup. Chose neutral colors or soft colors.
During the evening, wear more makeup. You can also use brighter or darker colors.

, Most hairstyles will go with most outfits, but different hairstyles add different flavors to what you’re wearing. You can always leave your hair down and parted off to one side. You can also braid it and add a cute flower clip to the base or end of the braid.


If your outfit has a specific fashion that it is based on, pairing it with a hair-style that goes with other styles can add an interesting twist.
Elaborate hairdos, such as braided crowns, are a fun way to make a simple outfit more interesting.

, You can use a nail polish color that matches your outfit, or that contrasts it. You can also add a splash of color to a neutral-colored outfit with brightly-colored nail polish. Here are some ideas:


If you are wearing a mostly-white outfit, pair it with some bright red nail polish.
If you are wearing lots of neutral, earth-tones, then put on some natural-looking nail polish, such as beige or pink. You can also wear a French manicure.
You can also add some nail art as well, such as a tiny rhinestone or a delicate flower.

Set reasonable expectations.,
Get the ring appraised.,
Research your selling options.",How to Sell Diamond Rings1," As with most objects, you will not get back nearly as much as you originally paid for most diamonds. The value of diamonds is based on an artificial scarcity, meaning that diamonds are neither genuinely rare nor intrinsically valuable.Most jewelers have no issue acquiring quality diamonds well below retail value, and thus will likely offer between thirty and seventy percent of the retail value, depending upon the diamond quality.Selling directly to a customer shopping for a ring might enable you to get more than a jeweler or diamond dealer would offer, but you are still unlikely to get the full value of the ring.
Set a reasonable expectation at around sixty percent of the ring’s retail value, and have that offer ready to present to jewelers.;
, Before you set out to sell your diamond ring, you should know exactly what you have. Have the ring appraised by a certified appraiser, ideally one who does not directly buy diamonds, so that you can get a better picture of the quality and value of your piece.Appraisal can also help you establish credibility for your ring. A ring that you thought was diamond may turn out to be a different stone, or the setting may be a different metal than you originally thought. An appraiser can let you know for sure, and provide you with documentation.
An appraiser can also help you establish the retail value of your ring, which you can use to adjust your resale value, remembering that you are unlikely to get full appraisal value when selling.If you think your diamond is likely not very valuable, spending money on an appraisal may not be necessary. If you paid less than $1,000 to $2,000 for the ring, a diamond dealer may be able to give you a reasonable value estimation for free.

, When you sell your diamonds, you have two general options. The first is to sell to a reseller such as a jewelry store, diamond dealer, or pawn shop, that will turn around and sell the ring again. The second option is to try to sell the ring directly to a customer online or through your personal network.Selling to a dealer or jeweler is often more immediate, as finding a buyer can take time. If you are looking to get your money quickly, or if you simply want to be rid of the piece, selling to a diamond buyer may be your best option.If you are not in a rush to get rid of your ring, selling directly to a buyer, either through an online marketplace or through your network of personal contacts, can sometimes allow you to get more money than you may have received working with a diamond buyer.You may also be able to sell to an online auction site that takes a commission from the sale, but allows you to sell directly to a customer, potentially still getting more than you could get from a jeweler.

"
"
Offer authentication.,
Include quality images.,
Post your online listing.,
Take out a print listing.,
Set up your delivery system.",How to Sell Diamond Rings2," Your diamond ring is going to be easier to sell when you can provide verification that the piece you're selling is a genuine diamond of the quality you are stating. Include the diamond certificate with the ring, if you have it, to establish the quality of your ring. Save a copy of the certificate for your records, but offer the original with the sale.


If you do not have the diamond certificate but are dealing with a potentially valuable stone, you may consider getting a grading report from an independent laboratory such as the Gemological Institute of America., Regardless of what you are selling, postings both online and in print get better responses when the lister includes high-quality images with the listing. Include at least one quality, color image of the face of the ring. If possible, post a few images including one of the band and one of the setting profile, as well.tIt is better to take a variety of images before you create your ad. If there is a cap on the number of images you can use, you can always select your best ones later on.
Try shooting the ring under natural lighting and with no visible clutter around it. You can use a white towel or sheet to create a neutral backdrop., Decide what marketplaces you want to use to advertise your ring, and create a listing. Write a clear description of the ring that includes appraisal details such as color, cut, and clarity, along with the ring size and the diamond carat size. Add your images, and post your ad.If you are using a specialty jewelry auction site such as I Do...Now I Don’t or Worthy, they may have you input pre-set values about your ring, and generate the auction page automatically.
If you are on a broad platform such as Craigslist or eBay, you will need to completely create your own ad.
Remember to make sure the contact information associated with your account is up-to-date. Typically, this will not be displayed directly to potential buyers. However, this is where the website will send you notifications that someone is interested in your piece.

, Newspaper classified ads can help you reach audiences that are not likely to shop online. Call your local paper and ask about the cost of running different sized ads. Take out an ad large enough for you to include details like the ring size and the diamond characteristics, as well as a photo of the ring.Let buyers know whether your price is firm or if you are open to negotiation. Many people who frequent classified ads like to be able to haggle.

, Shipping a diamond ring is not the same as shipping most items. The small size and high value of the object means that you want to look for a shipper that can offer you shipping insurance should your parcel get lost, damaged, or delivered to the wrong address. Insuring a package typically costs more, so don’t forget to roll that cost into the overall price for the ring.Avoid any conspicuous markings on the outside of the package to suggest that it contains a diamond ring. This may prompt package inspection or theft.
Package the ring in a hard box such as a formal ring box, avoiding materials such as cardboard. Then, package the ring box in a small cardboard box, using packing tissue or filler to ensure that the ring box does not move too much within the cardboard box.

"
"
Decide what type of dealer you want to work with.,
Bring your ring in for review.,
Establish your terms of sale.,
Get a signed deal.,
Check in on consignments regularly.",How to Sell Diamond Rings3," When you sell to a dealer, you have a few options. Pawn shops and diamond buyers can offer you money as soon as your piece is accepted, while jewelers may sell your piece on consignment, in which case you will get the money after the piece is sold. Auction houses can also help you sell a particularly valuable piece, and will get the money to you once the auction is complete.Selling on consignment often takes time, but can lead to a greater value for your ring, as the better the price the consignment seller gets for the ring, the more money they make for you as well as for themselves.
If you are selling a piece of considerable value, extending into five or six figures, consider selling with an established auction house such as Christie’s or Sotheby’s, or otherwise working with an established fine jeweler who specialized in high-value items., Regardless of whether you work with a pawn shop, jeweler, or diamond buyer, you will need to either take or send your ring in for inspection and verification. Take your ring into the potential buyer and bring any information you have regarding the piece including any certificates or appraisals.If your jeweler finds a number of flaws or issues with the diamond that were not mentioned by your appraiser, you may want to consider taking your piece elsewhere, as the jeweler may be trying to give you a low offer.
It is always advisable to check the reputation of your jeweler before you bring your ring into them. Look online and talk to others you know who have sold jewelry to a dealer to find one that you can trust.Do not be afraid to take your ring into a few jewelers or dealers to see what kind of sale they can offer you.

, Once you have found the jeweler or dealer with whom you want to work, talk to them about your terms of sale. If you are looking for them to buy the diamond that day, ask them, “Would you be willing to pay the price you quoted today to get this piece?” Otherwise, sit down with them and discuss the terms of the consignment or auction.When working with a jeweler, there is often room for negotiation. Do not feel the need to accept low-ball offers worth less than half the appraisal value of the ring.When working with a consignment seller, be sure to ask them in advance what percent of the sale they retain for their fee, as well as how long they will keep an object on consignment before returning it to you.

, Regardless of whether you are putting your piece on consignment or selling directly to a dealer, make sure you get a written agreement regarding the base price of the ring and your terms. Make sure to include documentation of your ring, such as a photograph, as well as a copy of the appraisal, so that you can establish your ownership of the ring until it sells.If providing a written agreement is not part of the standard practice for the jeweler you are working with, take your business elsewhere.

, You don’t need to call the dealer or jeweler daily, but check in once a week or so for updates on the sale. This can help you get a better idea of how hard they are working on moving your ring, and give you peace of mind that the ring is still on the market.

Determine what you mean by ""peace."",
Know which part of speech you're looking for!,
For the SINGULAR SUBJECT of a sentence...""Peace is nice."",
For a SINGULAR POSSESSIVE or describing a PART or PIECE... ""Peace's place in the world,"" or ""We all want a piece of peace."",
For when you would use the word ""TO"" WITH A SINGULAR NOUN (that is, AN INDIRECT OBJECT) (not with a verb!),
For the SINGULAR DIRECT OBJECT of a sentence (that is, something that is directly acted upon, recognized in English as the word that usually comes directly after the verb)... ""He loves peace."",
For when a SINGULAR noun is BEING USED TO DO SOMETHING... ""We saved the world with (using) peace."",
For the PLURAL SUBJECT of a sentence... ""Peaces are nice."",
For a PLURAL POSSESSIVE or describing a PART or PIECE of a group... ""Various peaces' place in the world,"" or ""We all want a piece of the peaces."",
For when you would use the word ""TO"" WITH A PLURAL NOUN (that is, PLURAL INDIRECT OBJECTS) (again, not with a verb!),
For PLURAL DIRECT OBJECTS of a sentence... ""He loves peaces."",
For when a PLURAL noun is BEING USED TO DO SOMETHING... ""We saved the world with (using) peaces"" (the implication that the world was saved using different forms of peace).",How to Say Peace in Latin," Latin, as the language that dominated European thought and culture for over a thousand years, has a wide vocabulary. The word usually given is ""pax,"" but if you are looking to express the idea of tranquil, tranquility, or calm, then it would be better to go with tranquillitas (the noun quietness, stillness, or calm). In a political or religious context, pax is the word you ought to use.;
, Just like with some English words, such as ""who"" and ""whom,"" the form a word takes in Latin demonstrates the role it plays in a sentence. Latin words, however, can take many more forms that English words can in showing nuances of meaning that English can't. In English, we usually just show whether a word is singular or plural (if there is one or if there is more than one). Latin does not rely on word order the way English does, but instead reveals information through the form it takes. Because this isn't a Latin grammar, the following explanations are overly simplified but should suit basic requirements.

, --> PAX.

, --> PACIS.

, in English... ""I offer my life to peace."" --> PACI.

, --> PACEM.

, --> PACE. Note that when we use the word ""with"" in English to mean ""along with"" or ""accompanying,"" the form PACE is also used--but you will also need to use the word cum to show that it is meant in that sense. This is why we see the -cum ending in the vobiscum of ""pax vobisbum."" Latin is a funny language that does not care about word order as much as English does! The exact same sentence could be written: ""Pax cum vobis.""

, --> PACES. To be honest, I don't know how often you would need to say something like this, because in English ""peace"" as a concept is usually only ever used in the singular. But if you find yourself needing to express the idea of different peaces as the subject of a sentence, you would do it with PACES.

, --> PACUM. Again, I'm not sure where you would use this form in a real-word context, but if you need it, there you have it!

, in English... ""I offer my life to the peaces."" --> PACIBUS.

, --> PACES. Again, not a form usually used with ""peace."" If you're having trouble grasping it, compare these two sentences: ""He loves the dog"" and ""He loves the dogs.""

, --> PACIBUS. The same tip about the wordcum applies here as well.

Original Latin texts used the letter V in place of the vowel U as well (since the letter U did not exist). Modern Latin textbooks typically update the text to use the letter U for the vowel, and V only as the consonant.;
, Latin did not originally have the letter j, but some modern writers use it to avoid confusion. If J does appear, it is always pronounced ""y"" as in ""you."" If you are reading Latin as it was originally spelled, the letter i is sometimes this consonant ""y,"" and sometimes a vowel.


For example, the name Iulius or ""Julius"" is pronounced ""Yoo-lee-us.""

, Unlike in English, each Latin letter is almost always pronounced in a consistent way:C is always hard, as in ""cat."" cum (with) = koom
G is always hard, as in ""goal."" ago (I drive) = ah-go
S is always a voiceless ""s"" sound as in ""snake."" spuma (foam) = spoo-ma
R is always rolled. This sound doesn't exist in most English dialects, so beginners can pronounce this as they would normally say ""R.""

, Don't get fooled by combinations like ""th"" or ""ch"" — they do not have any special meaning in Latin. Just pronounce the first consonant as you would normally.


If you want perfect pronunciation, try to include the h by making the following vowel breathier, as in ""hot house"" or ""uphill"", Apart from the exceptions above, you can pronounce consonants as you would in ""proper"" English (the form usually taught in schools).


Enunciate to keep the sounds distinct. For example, Classical Latin ""t"" is always pronounced clearly as a hard ""t,"" never softening to a sloppy ""d"" sound.There are a small number of corner cases which are not important for beginners. If you want to become a Latin pronunciation expert, these are covered in the extra rules later on.

, The easiest way to learn how to pronounce Latin vowels is to read texts designed for students. Each Latin vowel has a long and short pronunciation. Introductory textbooks often mark the long vowels with a macron (horizontal line) over the vowel, so a is always the short pronunciation and ā is the long one.


If your main goal is to speak Church Latin, now's a good time to skip down to that section, since the vowel pronunciations are quite different.
If you cannot find a text like this, speak with an advanced Latin student to get familiar with vowel pronunciation. Most students learn this best through practice and memorization, but you can look up the complex rules for identifying long and short vowels if you prefer that method., Beginner textbooks either leave short vowels unmarked or top them with a circumflex (˘). When short, these vowels are always pronounced as follows:


A as in alike
E as in let
I as in lick
O as in off
U as the ""oo"" in foot

, Textbooks mark long vowels with a macron (horizontal line). Long vowels are pronounced as follows:


Ā as in father (the same sound as short a, but held for a longer time)
Ē as the ""a"" in mate
Ī as the ""ee"" in beep
Ō as in only
Ū as the ""oo"" in boot

, A diphthong is a combination of two vowels pronounced as one syllable. Latin pronunciation is much more standardized than English, so you do not have to guess at a vowel sound. These combinations are always pronounced as diphthongs:AE as the word eye. saepe (often) = sai-peh
AU as the word ow. laudat (he praises) = low-daht
EI as in ray. eicio (I accomplish) = ay-kee-oh
OE as in oil. poeta (poet) = poi-ta
In all other vowel combinations, pronounce the vowels as separate syllables. tuus (your) = tu-us

, For example, the word Caesar ir pronounced KAI-sar. This holds true for all two-syllable words., Latin poets relied on this classification to build their meter. Most Latin students learn to recite poetry eventually, and learning it early helps you with pronunciation as well:If a syllable has a long vowel or a diphthong, it is heavy.
If a syllable is followed by a double consonant, it is heavy. The letter x counts as a double consonant (ks).
If neither of those is true, the syllable is light.
(Some teachers refer to this as ""long"" and ""short"" syllables, but it's important not to confuse them with long and short vowels.)

, The second-to-last syllable of a word is called the penult. If this syllable is heavy, stress it.



Abutor (I squander) is pronounced ah-BOO-tor because the penult has a long vowel.

Occaeco (I make blind) is pronounced ok-KAI-ko because the penult has a diphthong (ae).

Recusandus (that which must be rejected) is pronounced reh-koo-SAN-dus because the penult is followed by a double consonant (nd).

, If the penult is a light syllable (meaning it has a short vowel and is not followed by a double consonant), it is unstressed. Stress the third-to-last syllable instead, called the antepenult.



Praesidium (guard) is pronounced prai-SI-di-um. The penult is light, so the accent falls on the syllable before it.

, These are rare or low priority corner cases that many Latin students never learn. If you plan to time travel back to ancient Rome, you can impress Caesar with these signs of an excellent accent:


Double consonants are pronounced twice: reddit (she gives back) is ""red-dit,"" not ""re-dit"".
""bt"" and ""bs"" are pronounced ""pt"" and ""ps.""""gn"" was pronounced ""ngn"" as in ""wing nut.""Some scholars think the letter ""m"" at the end of a word nasalized the final vowel, as in modern French, and that the combinations ""ns"" and ""nf"" had a similar effect.""br"", ""pl"", and similar double consonants that ""flow"" into an l or r do not count as double consonants for syllable stress., Church Latin, also called Ecclesiastical Latin, has been used in Catholic ritual, song, and church pronouncements for many centuries. Its pronunciation has changed in some respects to match modern Italian, which, after all, is a form of Latin filtered through millennia of change. One of the most noticeable differences from Classical Latin is the appearance of these sounds:If C appears before ae, e, oe, and i, pronounce it ch as in chain (instead of a hard c as in cat).
In the same context, G is soft as in gem instead of hard as in goat.
SC becomes sh as in sheep instead of sc as in scold.
CC becomes tch as in catchy instead of cc as in accord.
XC becomes ksh instead of ksk.

, Church Latin vowels tend to have less difference between the long and short forms than Classical Latin. The exact pronunciation can vary by congregation, so if you follow someone's lead or go with your instincts, you'll probably be fine. Singers especially tend to holding the same sound for a longer or shorter time instead of changing the quality of the vowel. When in doubt, use the following system:A as in father.
E as in red.
I or Y as the ""ee"" in sleep.
O as in for (not as in go).
U as the ""oo"" in boot.

,, In Church Latin, these sounds are closer to modern Romance languages:GN is always pronounced as the ""ni"" in onion.
TI followed by any additional vowel is pronounced as the ""tsy"" in patsy.
Exception: TI is still pronounced ""tee"" if it is at the start of a word, or if it follows s, x, or t.

, These two words are pronounced as though the h were a k: nikil and miki. H is silent in all other words., Church Latin still uses the diphthongs AE and OE, as pronounced in Classical Latin. For AU, EI, AU, and EU, make both vowel sounds distinct. If stressed in a song, hold the note on the first vowel sound, and move through the second for a moment at the end.EI is pronounced as a diphthong (one sound) only in the word Hei.

Familiarize yourself with the alphabet.,
Get the pronunciation down.,
Know where the emphasis goes.,
Know what you're in for.",How to Learn to Speak Latin1," If you already speak English or any language with a Latinate script, you may think you already have the alphabet down. But language is constantly evolving and while most things are the same, there are a few differences.J, V, and W don't exist. Well, not really at least. There were 23 letters in the classic Latin alphabet.
R is rolled, similar to the trill in Spanish.
Y is known as ""i Graeca"" (""Greek i"") and Z is ""zeta.""
I can sometimes be pronounced as the english Y sound and Y is pronounced like the French ""u.""

If you know the IPA, that means the letter I is sometimes pronounced as /j/ and the letter Y is sometimes pronounced as /y/. See the reasoning?


U is sometimes similar to a W -- in fact, that's where the letter comes from. It's written as ""v."";
, While pronouncing Latin doesn't offer near as many trip ups as English does (generally, each letter sticks to a sound), there are a couple of things to keep in mind: length and combinations.


An apex (´) or acute accent (like the accent aigu in French) is used to denote long vowels. With one, ""a"" becomes like the sound in ""father"" instead of the sound in ""hat."" ""E"" alone is ""bed,"" but with the apex it's more like the sound in ""café.""

Unfortunately, modern Latin spelling has made this very confusing by using the macron (¯) to denote length of vowels, too, when it's normally used to denote long syllables. Now it seems noting syllable and vowel length is a free-for-all and most dictionaries don't do it sufficiently. And to make matters worse, Spanish uses the same symbol to denote accented syllables. But if you find yourself in Italy and you squint a little bit, you should notice the apexes on Roman inscriptions (at least from classical and postclassical times) in all their rightful glory.Different vowel/consonant combinations can change the sound of the letters. ""Ae"" becomes the sound in ""kite"" (or /ai/); ""ch"" makes a ""k"" sound; ""ei"" makes the sound in ""day"" (/ei/); ""eu"" sounds like ""ee-ooo""; ""oe"" is the same as the sound in ""toy.""

If you know the IPA, this all becomes a lot easier -- there are tons of similarities. Needless to say, the IPA is Latin-derived., English has a lot of Latin roots and therefore shares some of the same emphasis patterns. However, it'd be ridiculous to say anything applies 100% in the current Lingua Franca. For Latin, keep these rules in mind:


For one syllable words, well, emphasis isn't an issue.
For two syllable words, emphasize the first syllable (pos-co: I demand)
For polysyllabic words, emphasis goes on the penultimate syllable if it's heavy or long (mentiuntur: they lie).
For polysyllabic words that have a light or short syllable penultimately, the emphasis goes on the antipenultimate syllable (imperator: commander).

All these rules are similar to this day in English. In fact, English long considered Latin's rules as the ""right"" way to speak and changed Germanic roots to fit in this box. It's the same reason your English teacher tells you to not split infinitives (did you catch that?). The reasoning is Latin (and now archaic).



, If you don't already have a sense of this, Latin is a very complicated language. You're about to embark upon a long, uphill battle. Here's an example: verbs have to consider a few things, right? Maybe plurality, person, and tense? Nope. Way more. But you can handle it, right? The Latin verbs must take the following things into consideration:Three persons -- first, second, and third
Two aspects -- perfect (finished) and imperfect (unfinished)
Two numbers -- singular and plural
Three moods -- indicative, subjunctive, and imperative
Six tenses -- present, imperfect, future, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect
Two voices -- active and passive.
Four non-finite forms -- infinitive, gerund, participle, and supine

Have we mentioned yet that there are 7 cases and 3 genders for nouns?

Decide if you want a noun or a verb.,
If the choice is a noun, then you will need to determine the gender that you need.,
The noun forms for ""love"" are: amor, caritas, pietas.,
As to the verb, know that it is a first conjugation verb that has both active and passive voice.

,
Then decide if you need the indicative mood or the subjunctive or imperative form of the verb.

,
Next decide which of the six tenses that you need.,
By memorization of vocabulary, the student must know the principal parts of a particular verb which are: present indicative; present infinitive; perfect indicative; and perfect passive

,
Decide the numerical reference to one person as ""I"", or ""you"" or ""it"".,
Know what the present tense is derived from both the present indicative ""amo"" as well as the Latin Infinitive which is ""amare."",
Next, know your conjugations - conjugating a verb means in a sense to conform it to the speaker.,amo = ""I love"" amamus = ""we love""

,amas = ""you love"" amátis = ""you love"" (plural)

,amat = ""he loves"" amant = ""they love""

"
Use your present knowledge.,
Know how verbs work.,
Study up on your declensions.,
Nail down the cases.,
Forget about word order.",How to Learn to Speak Latin2," Alright, so you might be feeling the weight of this endeavor you've planned to embark upon right now -- after all, this is a language that certainly has a lot to take in. But if you're a speaker of any Romance language and even English, you're pretty set, at least lexically.


All the Romance languages stem from Vulgar Latin -- vulgar here meaning common, not disgusting or objectionable. But English, too, though it's of Germanic origin, has a vocabulary that is 58% Latin-influenced.That includes French (if you were cocking a brow), which is a Romance language and thus heavily Latin.

English is full of Germanic/Latin doublets. That basically means it has two words for everything; generally, the Germanic one is seen as more common (and you can hear the difference, too). With ""begin"" and ""commence,"" which one do you think is Germanic and which one is Latinate? How about ""ask"" and ""inquire?"" ""Aware"" and ""cognizant?""You'll find plenty of Latin words in English's fancier alternatives.
English's root words that are from Latin are practically innumerable. Once you see the Latin word, your mind will fill with words that all of a sudden make sense. Brev- is the Latin word for ""brief"" or ""short.""So now, ""brevity,"" ""brief,"" and ""abbreviation"" make sense, don't they? Neat! This will make the vocabulary a piece of cake (and up your English one, too).



, Latin is a fusional language which, by definition, makes it heavily inflected.If you have any experience with European languages, this won't come as a surprise to you. Though Latin puts Spanish, French, and German to shame with its complexities.


Verb inflection in Latin can be defined in four conjugation patterns. However, it must be noted that the grouping is only based on how the verb behaves in the present tense; how it behaves in others cannot be inferred through its grouping. Unfortunately, you'll need several forms of the verb to know just how it acts and to form it in all the possible contexts. While most verbs belong to one of the four patterns, some (like esse (""to be"")) do not. It's always the most common verbs that don't -- I am, you were? Je suis, tu es? Yo soy, tu eres? Same thing.If you found that slightly confusing, just know that there are 4 verb families and most verbs fall into one and follow the pattern of that particular grouping.


All tenses use personal endings. In the active voice, they are all the same, minus the perfect tense, which has chosen to be a nuisance. Here's the pattern the 5 tenses follow:

Present tense, etc.:SingularFirst person –ō, –mSecond person –sThird person –tPluralFirst Person –musSecond person –tisThird person –nt
Perfect:SingularFirst person –īSecond person –istīThird person –itPluralFirst person –musSecond person –istisThird person –ērunt



, That's a fancy term for noun conjugation (and pronouns and adjectives while we're at it). In Latin, there are five declensions. This is just like verb conjugation in a way -- each noun fits into a category and its endings fit the patterns of that specific family of nouns.


Declension gets a bit tricky because nouns (and adjectives and pronouns...) come in not only singular and plural, but also masculine, feminine, and neuter. Each noun can fit into 7 different cases, giving them all different endings. Water (aqua, -ae) is feminine, can be singular or plural, and thus has 14 different possible endings.

In case you're curious, aqua is a first declension noun (those generally end in -a).Latin borrowed a few Greek words that are quite common and they often decline to the beat of their own drum. However, some have been regularized.On the upside, first and second pronouns can only be masculine or feminine. That's good, right? On the downside, adjectives' gender is determined by the noun they describe, so they have endings for all cases and all genders. But there are only three declensions of adjectives, thank our lucky stars., There are seven cases (five major ones) and, if you're not nauseated just yet, the same ending is often used for more than one case. You just like a good challenge, don't you? When you're studying you'll find that they are often abbreviated to the first three letters.


You know how in English it's ""book"" and ""books"" but ""child"" and ""children?"" What's that all about? English used to have cases, too, but has vastly gotten rid of them. In case (haha!) you're a bit scruffy on your terminology, cases are seen on endings put on a word (nouns and adjectives, namely) that mark its grammatical function. Here's the list:

The nominative case: This marks the subject of a statement. It is used to denote the person or object that is performing the verb in the sentence.

The accusative case: This marks the direct object of the verb. It does have other functions, but that's generally it. Certain prepositions can determine it.

The genitive case: This expresses possession, measurement, or source. In English, its equivalent would be ""of."" In Old English, nouns in the genitive used to be marked with ""-es"" in the genitive. Wonder how that evolved....The dative case: This one marks the indirect object, or the receiver of an action. In English, ""to"" and ""for"" would mark this case, at least in some contexts (they are very common words).

The ablative case: This case indicates separation, indirection, or the means by which an action is performed. In English, the closest indicator of this would be the prepositions ""by,"" ""with,"" ""from,"" ""in"" and ""on.""

The vocative case: This is used in direct speech to address someone or something. In the sentence, ""Jane, are you coming? Jane!"" Jane is vocative.

The locative case: This is used unsurprisingly and a little ridiculously (who needs to know this?) to express where an action takes place. In early Latin this was used frequently, but in Classical Latin they finalized realized this was superfluous information and it eventually died out, only being applied to the names of cities, small islands and a few other isolated, probably unimportant, words., Because English lacks adequate conjugation and declension, word order is absolutely imperative. But in Latin, for example, the sentence ""The boy loves the girl"" does not have to be written ""Puer amat puellam"" -- literally translating to ""the boy (puer) loves (amat) the girl (puellam)."" In fact, ""Puellam amat puer"" means the same thing -- it's all in the endings.


Even though it looks like the second example says ""the girl loves the boy,"" it doesn't. ""The girl loves the boy"" would be ""Puella amat puerum."" See how the the endings change places? That's the beauty of cases!

In fact, in Latin, the verbs generally drift toward the end of the sentence. It doesn't follow SVO (subject-verb-object) order like English, though it may be tempting to do since the order doesn't matter. ""Puer puellam amat"" is an authentic replication.

Learn the noun “love.” Love is not only a verb of course, it is also a noun.",How to Say Love in Latin1," If you want to say love in Latin you need to get to grips with pronunciation in Latin. Key to this is recognising long and short vowel sounds. In Latin these variations are shown by the diacritic marks above the letters a, e, i, o, and u. Short vowels are indicated like this: ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ. Long vowels are indicated like this: ā, ē, ī, ō, ū.


These diacritical marks are not part of the spelling of the word, they just indicate long and short vowels for pronunciation.
If you were writing Latin you wouldn’t include these marks.
To say “love” in Latin you need to concentrate on pronouncing the long vowels correctly.
ā: as in the English father, not the in fat, or in apart.
ē: as in the English they, but longer. Not the as ""ey"" in they, or in apart, or in ecology.
ī: as in the English sheep. Not as .
ō: as in the Italian ó in amore.
ū: as in English root. Not as you, or French ""u"", German ""ü"".;
, Latin grammar can be quite tricky, with many different conjugations having a big impact on the word. Here are some of the main conjugations for the present tense to get you started:


First person singular: “amō.”
Second person singular: “amās.”
Third person singular: “amat.”
First person plural: “amāmus.”
Second person plural: “amātis.”
Third person plural: “amant.”, There are six tenses in Latin, and three of these (imperfect, perfect and pluperfect) concerns things that happened in the past. You can learn to say the verb “love” in these three past tenses. The imperfect tense describes actions continuing in the past. The perfect tense describes actions completed in the past. The pluperfect is used to describe something that happened before other actions in the past. Here is how you say “love” in the first person singular – second person singular – third person singular – first person plural in these tenses.


Imperfect: “amābam” – “amābās” – “amābat” – “amābāmus.”
Perfect: “amāvī” – “amāvistī” – “amāvit” – “amāvimus.”
Pluperfect: “amāveram” – “amāverās” – “amāverat” – amaveramus.”, Latin has two tenses for things happening in the future, the future tense and the future perfect tense. The future perfect is used to describe things which will be finished sometime in the future, whereas the future tense is used to describe actions taking place in the future. Here is how you say “love” in the first person singular – second person singular – third person singular – first person plural in these future tenses.


Future: “amābō” – “amābis” – “amābit” – “amābimus.”
Future Perfect: “amāverō” – “amāveris” – “amāverit” – “amaverimus.”, With Latin’s fairly complex system of grammar, there are still a great many other variations and conjugations of the verb “to love.” As well the six tenses, and the three persons (first (I), second (you) and third (he/she/it)), Latin verbs also have four “moods” and two “voices.” The “moods” are indicative, infinitive, subjunctive and imperative. The “voices” are active and passive.


If you want to study the grammar for Latin verbs in more detail, you will have to spend some time getting on top of all these variations.
The variations in verbs is at the heart of what makes Latin the language it is. To get to grips with Latin stylistics you will have to study verbal modifications., It is a masculine noun, and the nominative singular version is “amor” in Latin. As with the verbs, the noun has a number of variations that change depending on the case of the verb, and whether it is singular or plural. Here are the forms for the nominative – genitive – dative – accusative – ablative – and vocative:


Singular: “amor” – “amoris” – “amori” – “amorem” – amore” – “amor.”
Plural: “amores” – “amorum” – “amoribus” – “amores” – “amoribus” – “amores.”"

But in Latin, a verb can describe an action, the state of something, or any change in a person, place, or thing. Latin verbs are composed of a stem (the base word) and its appropriate ending (the part that makes a word functional), and are expressed using four qualifiers:the person of the verb (first person: I/we, second person: thou/you, or third person: he/she/it)
the tense or time of the verb (present, future, imperfect, perfect, pluperfect, and future perfect)
the voice of the verb (active or passive)
the mood of the verb (indicative, subjunctive, or imperative);
, Nouns are a bit less complex than verbs, but can still be challenging nonetheless. The ending of a noun describes its number (singular or plural), its gender (masculine/feminine/neuter), and case (nominative/genitive/dative/accusative/ablative/vocative)., In Latin, an adjective is inflected like a noun, usually either in accordance with the first and second declensions (for example, magnus, magna, and magnum are all forms of the adjective ""great""), or occasionally in the third declension (for example, acer, acris, and acre are all forms of ""sharp"").Adjectives in Latin are similar to English adjectives in that they fall into one of three categories (called ""degrees"") of comparison:


positive (such as long or short) is formed by adding ""-a"" or ""-um"" to the end of the wordcomparative (such as longer or shorter) is formed by adding ""-ior"" for male/female words or ""-ius"" for neuter words.
superlative (such as longest or shortest) is formed by adding ""-issimus"" to the end of the word

, Adverbs have comparative and superlative forms, just like adjectives. An adverb formed from regular inflections ends in ""-ius"" for the comparative form and ""-e"" for the superlative. Adverbs based on an adjective in the first and second declension end in ""-e,"" while those based on an adjective in the third declension end in ""-ter."", Conjunctions in Latin connect words, phrases, clauses, and sentences, just like conjunctions in English do (such as ""and,"" ""but,"" and ""if""). Conjunctions are fairly straightforward, and therefore should not be too difficult to learn and use.There are three basic types of conjunctions:


coordinating conjunctions (connect words/phrases/clauses of equal rank) - et, -que, atque
disjunctive conjunctions (showing opposition or choice) - aut, vel, -ve
adversative conjunctions (expressing contrast) - at, autem, sed, tamen

, The case gives a noun its distinct ""role,"" essentially dictating to the reader/listener how that noun functions within the sentence.The case of a given noun does not change the meaning of that word. It simply changes the way that word acts or conveys meaning in the sentence. Declensions are the set of endings that are tacked on to nouns, pronouns, and adjectives in Latin to form a given case, which is often called the ""case form"" of a word. There are six regular cases used in the Latin language: five for nouns, and one that is used for some pronouns and adjectives.Nominative is called the ""subject case,"" meaning it refers to the person or object that comes before the verb.Genitive shows one person's possession of an object.
Dative is the case used for an indirect object.
Accusative designates the direct object, usually after an action verb that has a receiver but occasionally used after a preposition.
Ablative is used as an adverb, or in conjunction with prepositions and verbs.
The special declension for pronouns and adjectives end in ""-ius"" in the genitive singular and usually end in ""-î"" in the dative singular., Mood is one of the qualifiers that determine the function of a verb. The mood of a verb may be thought of as that verb's ""conditions of reality"" for a given verb's action. The two most common moods that are used in Latin are indicative and subjunctive, though imperative is sometimes also used.


Indicative moods mean that the verb's action actually happened, is happening, or will happen. For example, in the sentence ""I went to the store,"" the verb ""went"" describes an action that has actually taken place.
Subjunctive moods mean that the verb's action takes some departure from reality, so to speak. An example of a subjunctive mood is a sentence in which you ask someone to imagine a hypothetical occurrence or set of circumstances. Those circumstances do not presently exist in reality, nor will they necessarily exist in the future, but they deal with potential or theoretical events.
Imperative moods can be thought of as either commands, requests/wishes/prayers, or negative imperatives (a command or request to stop or avoid some given activity)., Deponent verbs are one of the most difficult concepts to learn in Latin because there is no English language equivalent. Essentially a deponent verb is a verb that has a passive form with an active meaning. The closest example in English might be a scenario in which the sentence ""The car was driven by Julian"" would mean ""Julian drove the car,"" despite the way it is constructed on paper or in speech.


Deponent forms of verbs are very confusing to Latin students, but once you've memorized the tables of regular verbs you should develop an understanding of the passive forms in each conjugation. With practice and a firm understanding of passive verb conjugations, you will come to understand how a deponent verb form functions.

, If you're learning Latin through a class, you may have been assigned a textbook already. If you don't have a textbook, or if you'd like a secondary textbook to complement what you're learning in the first, you may want to buy Wheelock's Latin. Named after the author, Frederic M. Wheelock, Wheelock's Latin is generally considered the standard text for learning Latin, even if you're teaching yourself the language at home. It builds sequentially by first introducing you to grammar and vocabulary, then building into increasingly complex sentences and short readings., Having a dictionary of Latin words and their various cognates will be immensely helpful in learning the vocabulary.Any good Latin dictionary should suffice. If you're unsure which dictionaries are best for learning the language, consult user reviews online or ask others who have learned the language which dictionary they used.


Some scholars recommend Langenscheidt's Pocket Latin Dictionary, but which dictionary you choose is largely a matter of personal preference.
Latin uses the same letters as the English alphabet and many of the same basic language habits, which may make it easier to grasp a given word or phrase. Still, a dictionary will be necessary to distinguish between the various forms a word may take, and can help you when you need to check a word on the fly., Flash cards are an excellent way to learn vocabulary words in any language. To make flash cards, start with a blank pack of index cards. Write the word or phrase in Latin on one side of the card and its English translation on the back. Then quiz yourself, keeping a pile of words/terms you struggled with so that you can revisit those cards with further practice.You may be able to find pre-printed Latin index cards online or in a book store, but many experts recommend making your own. That's because the practice of writing out the words/terms of a foreign language will help you grow proficient and learn to think in that language., A mnemonic device is a learning technique that helps you remember something complex by associating that information with another word, a sentence, or an image.Acronyms (forming a word from the first letter of each word in a phrase) and rhymes are two of the most common types of mnemonic devices. There are numerous mnemonic devices for learning Latin that can be found online and in books, or you can invent your own to help you study.


A popular rhyme used to remember future-tense vowels is ""Conjugations one and two, in the future Bo Bi Bu; Conjugations four and three, in the future A then E."" Another rhyme for remembering feminine nouns in the fourth declension goes ""Domus = house and manus = hand, feminine will always stand.""One popular mnemonic device for remembering the i-stem adjectives that form their genitive using ""-ius"" and dative with ""-i"" goes ""Some Uncles' Umbrellas Are All Too Nice"" to memorize Solus, Unus, Ullus, Alter, Alius, Totus, Nullus.""
An easy way to remember the word endings for first declension Latin nons in the five primary cases is ""MariA, queen of reggAE, gave Fannie mAE some jAM for her bananā."" (nominitve: -a, genitive: -ae, dative: -ae, accusative: -am, abblative: -ā)

, Balancing your work life and your private life can be difficult, and setting aside an extra slice of your day for studying may seem impossible. However, if you budget your time right by keeping a regular schedule and designating time to study each day, it will definitely be manageable.Study every single day. Having an inconsistent or sporadic study schedule will make it more difficult for you find the time to study and to absorb what you learn.Set an alarm to remind you to study each day. Then make a to-do list of the lessons you'll be studying for each day. It may be helpful to make a list for the following day at the end of your study session. That way you'll know whether you've covered everything you wanted to study that day, and the information will be fresh enough that you'll know where to pick up again the following day.

, Some people are able to focus better at night. Others prefer to study first thing in the morning. While some people prefer to study in the comfort of their room, others find studying in a library to be less distracting. If you're studying Latin, you may need conditions that are just right for quiet, contemplative study, and that means you'll need to figure out how you study best.Try to study in a quiet place, and remove any potential distractions.
If at all possible, aim to study in the same place every day. This can help create a mindset that will allow you to sit down and get to work right when you need to.
If you're naturally a morning person, you may prefer to study early in the day. If you're a night owl, you may find it easier to study in the evening. Any time of day is fine, as long as it works well with your body. However, studying later than your usual bedtime can make you too tired to retain the information you learn.Take periodic breaks. If you start to feel fatigued or frustrated with studying, it's a good time to take a break. Stand up and stretch, walk around a bit, and have a nutritious snack if you're hungry. Breaking up your study sessions like this can help prevent your brain from feeling overloaded.

, Most people learning a language do not commit each word's form table to memory, but in Latin this is necessary in order to fully understand and use the language. The easiest way to memorize word forms is to write out the tables for each word you're studying. Then keep writing out each form until you have memorized it. Unfortunately there is no easier method to memorize something than to practice it over and over until you've committed it to memory.


Start with noun declensions and continue writing out each declension until you can instantly recall it. Then move on to adjectives. Then regular verbs in the indicative active, passive, and subjunctive forms. If you do this, you will eventually commit each word form to memory, and with continued practice you will never lose this knowledge.
Try repeating the declension or conjugation you're studying that day during your spare moments. It can help speed up the time it takes to learn these word forms by memory.

, A cognate is the most closely-related word(s) related to a given word or phrase. Identifying English cognates of a Latin word/phrase can help you get a better sense of how the word functions and what it means.Cognates rarely ever mean the exact same thing as the original term. Often the cognate will have a similar meaning but a different part of speech. For example, the Latin word ""fidelis"" is an adjective, but its English cognate is fidelity (which is a noun).

, The best way to put your Latin skills to use is by learning to read a piece of text completely in Latin. This may seem like a daunting task, but it is the most efficient way to master the Latin language. Some scholars and educators recommend Lingua Latina (available online and in some campus bookstores) as a good introductory Latin text. It introduces grammatical concepts at a manageable pace and builds to tell a complex story completely in Latin, giving you all the skills you need to fluently read Latin along the way.


Read slowly. It's important that you resist the urge to rush through the text, as you may miss the grammatical functions of words if you do not take your time. Take note of each noun's case and each verb's tense and mood.
Try to get through an entire passage without looking up any words or forms the first time through. This is where intelligent guessing - the practice of using a word's context to understand that word - will be helpful. Then go back through the passage a second time and underline any words you absolutely cannot form a guess about. Look up those words, make flash cards of them, and practice them at length. Then go back and re-read the passage a third time until you can understand the entire passage., Latin may be an archaic language, but that doesn't mean it can't be fun. Many Latin scholars have found ways to incorporate learning/studying Latin into contemporary popular culture. This may help reinforce what you've learned by applying your Latin studies to everyday pursuits.


If you have a study partner, you can play a Latin version of Scrabble online to help reinforce your understanding of Latin grammar and spelling.Read contemporary books in Latin. Harry Potter has been translated into Latin, and you can purchase the book at an online retailer or read excerpts for free online.You can also read The Hobbit in Latin, or opt for some complex wordplay by reading The Cat in the Hat in Latin.Watch films in Latin. You can find a partial list of films with Latin dialogue on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) by searching for ""Movies in Latin language."""

Write down Latin words alongside their English meanings.,
Memorize the words and their meanings.,
Test yourself.,
Use techniques to aid in memorization.",How to Learn Latin Vocabulary1," Take a blank piece of paper and draw a line down the middle. On one side of the line, write down the vocabulary word. On the other side of the line, write the English meaning. Go though your list of words one by one, familiarizing yourself with each word and its meaning.;
, Cover the English meaning and practice saying what the Latin form of the word is English. When you're comfortable stating the English definitions, switch things up and cover the words in the Latin column so you an state the Latin terms for the English definitions.Repeat the exercise until you can confidently give English definitions for Latin terms, and Latin terms for English definitions.
Scramble up the list of words and continue to alternate with covering up each word and its meaning. This will help you focus more on memorizing the word and less on memorizing the order of your vocabulary words.

, Repeat each word without looking at its meaning. If you get the answers incorrect, go back and look at the word and its meaning again without covering anything. Read the word without looking at the answer again and repeat it multiple times until you got it down.

, Keep a notebook in which you write down the vocabulary words and English meanings. Writing down each word can help you remember what the words look like.


Draw pictures next to the vocabulary words if you want to learn them even better. This is especially helpful if you are a visual learner.
Regularly incorporate different words onto your desired vocabulary list. Revisit the vocabulary words that you’ve already learned whenever revising your list. Test yourself on how well you’ve mastered those words before moving onto a new set of words.

Create Latin vocabulary flashcards.,
Create a flashcard box.,
Conduct a practice round with the flashcards.,
Conduct a memorization round with the flashcards.",How to Learn Latin Vocabulary2," Write the Latin vocabulary onto one side of an index card. On the other side, write their English meanings. You can make the flashcards as simple or as fancy as you'd like.Drawing pictures to illustrate the English meanings can help with memorization.
The backs of the flashcards should all look the same.

, Separate a small box into three sections using cardboard dividers. Put the stack of flashcards into the first section of the box. Cards that you've practiced will be moved to the second section, and those you've mastered will be moved to the third.

, One by one, take the cards out and read both sides of the card. Say the vocab words and their English definitions aloud. When you’re done reading both sides, place the cards into the second section of the box. Now you're ready for the memorization round.

, Go through the cards again, this time trying to guess the English definitions of the vocabulary terms. When you correctly state the definition of a term, you can move the card to the third section in the box. If you don't correctly state it, the card gets moved back to the first section.


This will allow you to keep track of the words you know and the words that you still need to work on learning.
Repeat twice a day. Revise your cards with new words every month while. If you’re still having difficulty with learning words, keep them in the box and practice reciting them until you’ve learned all of your words.

Incorporate vocabulary words into English sentences.,
Label the items around you.,
Teach friends and family.",How to Learn Latin Vocabulary3," Inserting foreign words into English sentences helps with quickly learning the meaning of each word. This technique is known as diglot weave . Come up with different sentences and replace one word at a time with a Latin vocabulary word leaving the rest of the sentence in English. Repeat this, replacing different words within the sentence, until you’ve mastered each word.

, Place a label on the things that are around (wall, window, chair, computer, etc.) with a Post-It note of the word and its meaning on opposite sides. Read both sides of the label until you’ve committed it to memory.


When you’ve memorized the word, remove and gather the Post-It notes. Match each vocabulary word with its item.
Practice daily and revise your labeled notes with different items. Whenever you walk past a Post-It note, test yourself.

, The easiest way to remember what you’ve learned is by teaching and sharing with others. Strike up conversations with those around you. Insert the words that you’ve learned into those conversations. Use the diglot weave technique if you’re still working on forming complete sentences.

A note about textbooks.,
You may choose the method that best suits you.,
Once you've finished the textbook, you need to get your hands on some easy reading.,
Now that you've built a basic vocabulary and mastered the rudiments of Latin grammar, the next step is to achieve a certain level of fluency.,
Speaking Latin is not so common nowadays, but you can improve greatly your fluency doing that.,
As you read, make your own personal Latin dictionary.,
To entice you into reading lots of Latin without getting bored, you can try reading some famous novels in translation.,
You can move on to classical Latin texts when you feel comfortable doing so.",How to Learn Latin on Your Own," The answer key is particularly important because you won't have a teacher to check your answers.



Wheelock's Latin is a well-known textbook with the answers in the back. It is arguably the best choice for independent study, as there is a lot of study material available, as well as online study groups.
There are also a number of textbooks with an answer key available in the public domain:

B.L. D'Ooge, Latin for Beginners + answer key

J.G. Adler, A Practical Grammar of the Latin Language + answer key (with audio and other resources)

C.G. Gepp, Henry's First Latin Book + answer key

A.H. Monteith, Ahn's Method First Course + answer key, Ahn's Method Second Course + answer key.

;
, It will take at least a few months to work your way through the book, perhaps years. In schools, Wheelock's Latin is used in several consecutive introductory courses spanning a few semesters.

, There are two schools of thought in teaching Latin which differ in their methods. The first method focuses on a disciplined and organized exposition of grammar and vocabulary, and is heavily dependent on memorization. Wheelock's Latin and most older textbooks like D'Ooge's Latin for Beginners belong to this category. The second method focuses on reading, is heavily dependent on the teacher, and puts slightly less emphasis on memorization. The Cambridge Latin Course is an example of a textbook that belongs to this category, like the Athenaze series in Greek and Lingua Latina per se Illustrata. This is more similar to the mediaeval and renaissance teaching methodology.

, The advantages of the first method are that you should be able to progress without a teacher, and there are textbooks available in the public domain which use this method. The disadvantage is the amount of effort required and the potential for getting discouraged.
The second method is useful if you want to start reading soon, learning only the grammar and vocabulary that is necessary to read selected texts. A teacher's intervention is highly recommended in order to guide the student when certain principles of grammar have not been covered. It is unlikely that answer keys will be readily available, and textbooks using this method are not generally to be found in the public domain.

, Here are some good choices:


Jacob's Latin Reader Part I and Part II.

Ritchie's Fabulae Faciles (easy stories)
Lhomond's De Viris Illustribus (used by generations of school children to learn Latin)
The Latin Vulgate Bible


, This is the most important and most difficult step. You must move beyond translating sentences in your head to instinctively understanding them. In other words, you need to learn to think in Latin. The way to achieve this is by immersion. Since Latin is pretty much a dead language, the closest thing to immersion you'll find is reading and understanding large quantities of Latin text. There is available an Assimil course for Latin that uses immersion and is good if you study alone. But, this book is no longer available to purchase new, you can buy it used or search for the book and the audio in the internet (only available in French and Italian).



Schola Latina Universalis (distance learning with translations in English and Spanish using the Assimil course)

, Speak a language is the best fluency exercise.



Schola (follow first link) (chat and forum)

, Only add words and phrases that are new to you. It can be useful to make separate entries for words with multiple meanings and idiomatic phrases that have their own peculiar meaning.

, If you get through all these novels, you'll be well on your way to becoming reasonably fluent in Latin:



Insula Thesauraria (Treasure Island); also here, and here.


Rebilius Crusoe (Robinson Crusoe)

Pericla Navarchi Magonis (Les Aventures du Capitaine Magon)

Mysterium Arcae Boulé (The Mystery of the Boulé cabinet)
Harrius Potter et Philosophi Lapis (Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone)
Harrius Potter et Camera Secretorum (Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)

, Some authors are easier to read than others. You could start out with Caesar's De Bello Gallico and Cicero's Orations.

Two-thousand for each: Bina milia
Three-thousand for each: Trena milia
hundred-thousand for each: Centena milia
And a million for each: Decies centena milia (actually ten-times of hundred-thousand for each).

Once you know the larger numbers, knowing small numbers is easy in Latin.

In Latin , in contrast to English, they say seven and forty not forty-seven.,
This goes until we get to one-hundred where order of words becomes like English.",How to Count in Latin5,",,,,, Hence,


Forty-seven for each: Septeni et quadrageni
Fifty-six for each: Seni et quinquageni
Eighty-five for each: Quini et octogeni

Hundred and forty-seven for each: Centeni septeni et quadrageni
Three-hundred and fifty-six for each: Centeni seni et quinquageni

Start with a large shirt.,
Mark the shirt with your measurements.,
Trim the sleeves (optional).,
Cut the sides 2 inches (5 cm) beyond your measurements.,
Cut horizontal lines into the dress sides.,
Tie the two pieces of fabric together.,
Trim.",How to Make a No Sew Dress1," Begin with a T-shirt several sizes too large for you. If you want the bottom of the dress to flare out, choose a shirt much too long for you.;
, Take your measurements using measuring tape, including your bust, waist, and hips. Lay the T-shirt flat and measure it at each of the appropriate areas. Measure half the distance of your measurements (since you are only measuring one side), add at least ½ inch (1.25 cm), and mark it in chalk. Connect these measurements with straight lines. Measure the length from your shoulders to the desired length of your dress, and use this measurement to outline the end of the dress. Finally, repeat these steps for the opposite side of the shirt.


Add up to 2 inches (5 cm) for a looser fit. Add extra width at the base if you want the dress to flare.






Curved lines do not work well for this project. Stick with straight diagonals.







, If you want a sleeveless dress, trim off the sleeves, or trim off the entire upper edge of the shirt. This will only work on a tight-fitting dress, so it may not be wise for your first no-sew project.


Trimming knit fabrics will cause the material to ""roll.""







, You'll need this extra fabric to tie the dress together and adjust the size. Cut out the extra-large outlines on both sides of the shirt. Discard the fabric strips you just removed in between them.

, Make one straight cut about every ½ inch (1.25 cm), all the way up and down the left and right side of the dress. Make these cuts on the undersides of the sleeves as well, if you kept them. Repeat for the other half of the dress, making the same number of cuts in the same places.

, Lay one half of the dress over the other, with matching strips of fabric along the edges. Tie together each pair of strips. Test this partway through to make sure the dress fits. Adjust the location of the knots to change the dress size.


Double-knot flimsy or knit fabrics, but stick to single knots for 100% cotton shirts.







, Once you've tied the dress together, trim the hanging fabric to about a ¼ inch (6 mm) length, just enough to hold the knots together. Optionally, cut the neckline to the desired shape, and trim the base of the dress. Now you're ready to try on your latest threads!


To make your dress more shapely, clinch it around the waist with a tight belt.

Use fabric glue instead of knots.,
Adjust a dress shirt.,
Wear a long elastic skirt as a dress.,
Wear a sarong.,
Make a poncho dress.",How to Make a No Sew Dress2," If you have strong fabric glue, you can follow the process above, but cut out the dress directly on the outlines. Cover the outline with glue where the two sides will attach, and press the two sides together until dry. Give this plenty of time to cure, then test the strength by pulling on the dress edge.

, Take a button-up shirt and put it on without putting your arms through the sleeves. Button it until it fits your chest snugly enough to stay on. Take the dangling sleeves and tie a bow or another decorative knot in the front of the dress.


To turn this into a halter top, cross the sleeves in an X shape over your chest and tie them behind your neck. Tuck dangling ends under your bra clasp.







, An elastic skirt is the easiest option of all. Pull it up to make it into a strapless top. Add some structure and shape with a belt.


If you use a tulle skirt or another light material, you can pick up the lower edges and cross them over to the opposite shoulders. Tuck them in to the elastic band at the back. Hold the dangling material in place with a lace belt.







, One common no-sew dress is really a sarong, or a large, wide piece of fabric that can be folded and tied in many different styles. With some practice, you can completely change the style of your sarong dress without dealing with stitches or wrinkles. This great benefit is also its main downfall, as the lack of stitches can make it difficult to keep the sarong in place. Be confident in your knot work or pin placement before you leave the house in one of these.


You can use a length of cloth about 6.5 feet (2 meters) long as a sarong.







, Cut a circle of cloth with a diameter equal to the length of your body (neck to thighs). Cut a hole in the center for your head, and two holes for your arms. Wear a belt to give this more shape.

Consider sandals.",How to Make a Blazer Casual1," A plain white t-shirt is the most versatile option, but color t-shirts can have a vibrant effect. Graphic t-shirts create a super-casual look and give you the opportunity to express more of your personality. This look goes great when paired with the right jeans.;
, You need a looser fitting blazer for this look. Wear a cardigan over a simple t-shirt, then layer your blazer over your cardigan. Wearing this ensemble with khakis can make it borderline business casual, but wearing it with jeans brings it down to a strictly casual level.

, This extremely casual style also requires a looser fitting blazer. Throw a pull-over hoodie over your t-shirt and shrug your blazer on over the hoodie. Make sure that the hood hangs over the back of your blazer and the drawstrings hang down in front.

, This creates a dressier appearance than a t-shirt does, but when paired with jeans or shorts, it still looks fairly casual. Moreover, pairing your polo shirt and blazer with khaki cargo shorts gives the look a nautical ambiance.Image:Make a Blazer Casual Step 4.jpg
, Tucking in your shirt makes you look a little well put together, which works great for business casual settings and luncheons. For an everyday casual appearance, however, let your shirt hang out.

, A dark wash jean may give your blazer business casual appeal, but medium or light wash jeans can work just as well for a day out with friends. Either way, your jeans should fit properly and must not sag or look sloppy. You should look casual without looking frumpy.Image:Make a Blazer Casual Step 6.jpg
, Both khaki and denim shorts can work, but just like jeans, they must fit properly at your waist without sagging.

, Oxfords, loafers, and other dress shoes may make your ensemble too formal or professional. Stick with a clean pair of sneakers. White sneakers look clean-cut and leave a nice impression, but colorful sneakers may help achieve a more casual look.

Finish off with the right shoes.",How to Make a Blazer Casual2," Think tunic dresses and sundresses, but avoid cocktail dresses or professional dresses. The more casual the dress, the more casual your blazer will look with it., A fitted shirt in a plain color creates the most versatile option, and you can either dress it up with accessories or leave it plain. Graphic t-shirts also work well and look even more casual than plain shirts.

, For a flirty, feminine twist, wear your blazer with nothing but a camisole on underneath. A plain camisole creates an especially casual ambiance, but a camisole with lace or bead detailing can add personality while still keeping the look casual. Match your top with a casual bottom, like jeans or shorts.

, A soft, flowing blouse in a bold print or color creates a chic contrast against a rigid, structured blazer. Just make sure to keep your bottom casual. Khakis and dress pants can easily make this style look too formal or professional.

,

A dark wash in a classic cut can work well with a blazer to create a business casual look, but for an everyday casual option, go for a lighter wash.






Skinny jeans can look especially chic, but boot-cut jeans and flares can still work well if they flatter your body shape better.






Distressed washes and trendy embellishments also bring out the blazer's casual potential.Image:Make a Blazer Casual Step 14Bullet3.jpg


, Denim shorts look especially casual, but designer shorts and Bermuda shorts may have a slightly more sophisticated air. Shorts work especially when you wear your blazer with camisoles, tank tops, and t-shirts.Image:Make a Blazer Casual Step 15.jpg
, If you have the legs for it, then a mini-skirt makes a highly stylish alternative. Play with a variety of styles, from faded denim and cargo to pleats and ruffles. To keep things casual, try pairing it with a plain tank top or graphic t-shirt.Image:Make a Blazer Casual Step 16.jpg
, Black and patterned leggings can have an edgy sense of style, but you should avoid sheer pantyhose, since these will likely detract from the sense of casualness. Wear your leggings beneath long knit sweaters, tunic dresses, and skirts before topping it all off with your blazer.

Spray new boots with silicone polymer spray.,
Apply another coat after 30 minutes.,
Apply waterproofing spray every few months.",How to Maintain Your Cowboy Boots1," When you purchase your boots, you need to protect them against damage from the elements. Lay out the boots on newspaper in a well ventilated area, hold the silicone polymer spray about a foot (30.48 cm) from the boots and spray evenly.You can find silicone polymer spray at department stores and some shoe stores.
This type of spray is generally safe on all leather, including suede, but check the packaging to make sure.;
, After spraying both boots, let the boots dry for about 30 minutes. Then apply another coat for extra protection and let it dry for 30 more minutes. After the second coat dries, the boots will be ready to wear.

, It’s important to apply waterproofing spray consistently, especially if you are in a wet climate. If you wear your boots in a dry climate or mostly indoors, apply spray to clean boots every few months, otherwise apply the spray every month or so to protect your boots."

Brush off mud or dirt.,
Use a damp sponge to remove dust.,
Use soap and water.,
Scrub seams with a toothbrush.,
Let the boots dry.",How to Maintain Your Cowboy Boots2," If your boots are very dirty and have caked up mud or dirt on them, it’s a good idea to remove this debris before cleaning the boots with soap. Use a soft bristled boot brush to target problem areas and remove dirt. You can even use a plastic spoon if you are trying to remove thick layers of hardened dirt., To remove any thin layers of dirt or dust on your cowboy boots, dampen a sponge and use it to wipe the entire surface of the boot, focusing on any problem areas.If your boots are made of suede, they should not be exposed to water of any kind. Instead of using a damp sponge to clean, use a nylon brush to target dirt and dust.

, If your boots don’t look completely clean after using a damp sponge, get the sponge completely wet and use gentle soap or soap designed for leather to wipe down the boot and develop a lather. Then gently rub over dirty areas with the sponge. Once the dirt is removed, use a damp cloth to wipe off the suds., If the boot is relatively clean but there is still some dirt in the nooks and crannies or around the seams of the boot, use a damp toothbrush to gently scrub these areas., Use a clean cloth to wipe the boots after you have finished cleaning them. Then set the boots aside and let them sit until they are dry to the touch, about thirty minutes."

Spot test with a leather conditioner.,
Apply a thin layer of leather conditioner to the boot.,
Wipe the conditioner away after 12-24 hours.,
Use oil on oil impregnated boots.",How to Maintain Your Cowboy Boots3," Buy a lanolin-based leather conditioner and spot test it on an inconspicuous place on your boot by dabbing it on with a cloth and rubbing it in. Leave it on the boot for a couple hours and then check. If the spot on your boot is only slightly darker, the conditioner is okay to use. If the spot is markedly darker or has turned the patch a different color, purchase and spot test a different leather conditioner.You should condition your boots at least every six months or when you notice that the leather is creasing, cracking or discoloring, as this can indicate that it is dry and needs conditioning.

, Add a small dollop of leather conditioner to a white terrycloth or chamois towel, then begin to gently rub the conditioner onto the surface of the boot. Apply the conditioner to the entire boot in a thin layer, and repeat on the other boot. Don’t use too much conditioner, as too much will clog the pores of the leather.Leather conditioner adds moisture to leather, which often becomes dry over time especially if you are living in a dry or desert climate. It also helps to repair water damage, as water often saps moisture from the boot when it dries.
It’s normal for the boots to appear a little darker after adding conditioner; they should lighten up after a few days.
Do not use conditioner on suede, naked or nude finish leather, patent leather or micro suede. If you have exotic leather boots such as alligator or snakeskin, use a conditioner formulated specifically for exotic leather.

, Let the boots sit for 12-24 hours, then use a clean cloth to wipe away any excess conditioner. If your boots seem dry still you can repeat the process of adding a thin layer of conditioner., If you have oil impregnated boots, you may want to use a layer of oil after conditioning your boots. Add mink oil, specialized leather oil, mineral oil or neatsfoot oil to a clean cloth and apply it in the same way as you did with the conditioner. After 12-24 hours, wipe the oil off your boots.The leather of oil-impregnated boots is infused with extra oil, which in time can dry up or get removed by water damage. Replenishing this oil every 6 months or so ensures that your boots stay healthy and don’t get too dry.

Find a cream polish the same color as your boot.,
Add a thin layer of polish to your boots.,
Clean off the polish.",How to Maintain Your Cowboy Boots4," There are several types of polishes, but cream polishes work best to moisturize and add shine to your boots. Find a leather cream polish in the same color as your boot, or a neutral polish that isn’t colored.Only cowboy boots with a finish should be polished. Don’t polish suede, naked or nude finished leather, patent or micro suede leather.
The advantage of using a colored polish is that it can restore color to faded boots.

, Just like with the conditioner, add a dollop of polish to a clean white cloth and rub it into your boots. Add another thin layer if you want more shine., Follow the directions on the package to either wipe away excess polish or let it set into the boot. Don’t wear the boots until your boots are dry to the touch."

If you want something complicated and extravagant, go for it! You can buy a plain black notebook and make your own title page. Review the clothing in your wardrobe.;
, Create complete outfits using the clothing and accessories you own. Remember to include shoes, jewelry and bags. Some items may be used multiple times. Be creative and try paring different items up. You may be surprised by some of the outfits you are able to put together.

, You can cut out clothes that you like and stick them on the cover, or draw your own designs on it. You could just put something simple on the cover, such as, ""My Fashion Book"".

, You can take photographs of yourself wearing the outfits, have a friend take photos for you, take pictures of individual clothing items or style outfits onto a mannequin and take photos. Print the photos. If taking pictures of individual items, create complete outfits using the individual photos.

, You'll need lots of magazines for this project. You'll specifically want to have style and fashion magazines, such as 'InStyle' or 'Elle'. You could also use gossip magazines such as 'Seventeen' or 'M' and use the outfits that the celebrities are wearing.

, Organize by theme and appropriate location (casual weekend, work clothing, party, wear at home or workout), as well as by season. For outfits that fit more than one category, consider making a duplicate copy of the photo and placing one in each section.

, Cut out pictures from the magazines. Cut out the clothes, accessories, and shoes that you like. Cut out things that celebrities are wearing (if you like them). Once you've cut out everything you want, move on to the next step.

, Divide the book up using tabs, page markers or dividers and label them to make it easy to find outfits for specific themes or seasons.

, A glue stick is the best thing to use for this step, but white glue works too. Glue the outfits onto the pages of your Fashion Book. You can combine pants, shirts, and hats from different people and make them into one outfit, or simply display each article of clothing on its own. It's best to only have 5-8 articles of clothing per page, and have them spaced out, rather than filling the whole page with outfits and making it look cramped and busy. However, this is your fashion book, so feel free to do whatever you want.Add notes to the book to include important details about outfits.

Shoes: If you think you can manage, try 2- or 3-inch heels.",How to Look Like a Girl for a Prank (for Boys)," Even if you've seen girls with short hair, it's harder to convince someone you're a girl without the stereotypical traits. A medium to long wig in a color close to your natural hair would work best.;
, Look up tutorials for applying all these things on other wikiHows.


Fake lashes. You can get them at any drugstore, and they should come with instructions. If you know any girls that have used them before, ask them for help. If you don't want to go for fake lashes, try mascara instead. It's not safe to share eye makeup, so you'll have to buy it. Avoid ""spider lashes"" by sticking to mascara colors closer to your own lash color and being conservative with the mascara.






Lipstick. Again, most drugstores sell lipstick. Be careful not to get a color that is too outrageous if you are trying to be realistic. If you are fair-haired, aim for lighter colors, and if you are dark-haired, aim for muted berry colors.
Concealer, possibly foundation. You can buy both at the same place you buy lipstick and fake lashes. The concealer can help cover up blemishes (or some stubble!), and the foundation gives an overall smoother, more even complexion.
Tweezers. It might look weird if you have big man eyebrows. Ask a girl to help you pluck them, or look up tutorials. But it's really optional.

, You can use virtually anything from hairbands, to handbags, but the most basic ones are:


Earrings. If you don't have your ears pierced, you can buy or borrow someone's clip-ons. Just get simple little, but obvious earrings. Don't get enormous fluorescent hoop earrings.
Necklace or a bracelet. You could use both but, don't pile it on. Keep it natural and simple. Try to coordinate it with the earrings.

, This is important if you're older than 13.


Squeeze the skin on your chest together to make it look like the line in between two breasts. Then tape all around them so that they stay in place. This is only necessary if you are using a low-cut shirt.
Put on a bra that you should buy or borrow, and stuff it with socks. If you can get a padded bra, it will help round out the lumpy shape from the socks.







, If you do, you should definitively shave. But for a guy your best option is skinny jeans. White or colored skinny jeans work best. Black is to gender-neutral, and we want to make sure you stay far away from boys clothes. If you have a rounded rear-end, you can go for boot-cut jeans instead, as these can help give you a curvy look. Boot-cut means that it has a slight flare.

, But at the same time it shouldn't be to tight and it should cover your manly arms. Try shirts that have fluttery sleeves so that they won't cling.

, If not, just go for flats or sandals. Strappy shoes look girlier. If you have very boney or hairy feet, aim for flats that cover more of the foot.

Go to the closest shopping mall with a few friends and try on all the clothes you want.,
Don't focus on the price tag.,
Choose the style that you like.,

Choose accessories that add to the outfit.,

Get a boost from friends.",How to Look Stylish While Being Overweight," Don't be afraid to test out different styles, patterns, and colors. Even when something looks ugly on the rack, you may be surprised what it looks like when you try it on, as it may be flattering and a lot more tasteful when worn.;
, You could try on a $2,000 dollar designer dress with a cute Cherokee pattern, and just as easily go to Target and try on a similar dress for $20. This isn't about the money, it's about finding your look.

, Everyone has their own style, so don't be insecure if you don't look the same as everyone else! Having your own style makes you original, and unless you want to be 100% mainstream, you shouldn't be afraid to be unique. If you're afraid that you are sticking out, check out what is trending on sites such as Wanelo or Pinterest.

, These can cause people to focus more on the pattern and not on your weight. A new in-style look is wearing chevron and Aztec print leggings with over-sized shirts and boots (Ugg-styled fluffy boots or knee-high brown leather boots) can be a simple stylish look, with not too much effort.

, Long skirts are really in style and can accentuate your curves and your butt. Skinny jeans can also help make you look a bit slimmer, while showing off your gorgeous body. Leggings shouldn't be worn without something longer, especially if they are a thinner material. But when worn with the perfect shirt or dress, they look flawless.


As for footwear: shoes, boots, vans, Converse, and heels all add a cute touch without making yourself too flashy. Vans and Converse can both be worn with practically anything, even if you're going for a fancy look. Boots (knee-highs and Uggs) can cover up some extra skin while still making you look fabulous. They practically go with any look, and look especially outstanding with leggings. Heels are the perfect choice for the fancier-side of clothing, and they really thin out your legs.

, These smooth out your body while still adding a stylish touch.


Cardigans go with nearly anything, whether it's a solid colored undershirt or a regular t-shirt. When wearing shirts, never go sleeveless unless you wear a cardigan with it.
Crop tops are in style, but may not be the perfect fit for your body.
Dresses are a great choice, especially when sleeveless. You may have to search around for the style of dress you enjoy, but you won't regret the decision you make. If you're scared to show that extra skin, grab a cardigan or an overthrow to go with it. Or just simply buy a dress with sleeves!

,


A simple necklace is a great choice to wear with lower-cut shirts and dresses. Never let it fall into your cleavage, that can give people the wrong impression and there is no point of having a necklace you can't see.
Chokers are not really in either, so just get something in the middle. Peach and turquoise colors are particularly favored.
As for bracelets, don't put on too many. Fake pearls or five to six silver ring bracelets spice up the outfit a little bit, and even wearing a couple loom bracelets can add some color. However, never have them all the way up and down both of your arms, as that can create a bad impression.

, A little foundation, mascara, nude eyeshadow, and a nude lipstick can be a great natural look. If you want to style out, add some deeper colors to that eyeshadow/lipstick and put on a bit of eyeliner. You don't want to look caked, but you want to add a little shine into your features. Believe it or not, YouTube is a great place to explore different makeup tutorials according to your face, your size, the season, your emotion, and more. Just search up _____ Makeup Tutorial and the possibilities are endless!

, In the end, it doesn't matter what you look like, it just matters what you think. Take five minutes to look at yourself in the mirror, don't give criticisms, give compliments. You are perfect in any way shape and form, and whether or not you're in style doesn't determine your personality.

, If you're not feeling confident about your style, ask your friends' opinions and see what they think about your current style and what would be best. Don't be embarrassed about your clothes/look or your weight. Just wear what you feel best in and if someone doesn't like it, they can deal with it.

Look for the right shade of gray for your skin tone.,
Don’t be afraid of bold color if you have a neutral skin tone.",How to Know What to Wear1," There are many terms used to describe skin tone, from light or dark, to pale or olive. The most accurate way to figure out what colors look good on you is to figure out the undertone of your skin. There are three types: warm, cool, and neutral. Because you’re looking for the undertones in your skin, you can’t simply look in the mirror and confirm them. Follow these steps to determine your skin tone:Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. Do they appear blue or green? If they look blue or purple, you’re cool-toned. If they look green, you’re warm-toned. If you can’t tell what color they are, you’re probably neutral toned.
Put on your favorite pieces of jewelry, or the ones you think look the best on you. Are they made of gold or silver? If they’re gold, you’re warm toned. If they’re silver, you’re cool-toned. If you look equally good in both gold and silver, you’re neutral toned.
Think about whether you burn or tan in the sun. If you burn easily or turn pink, you’re cool-toned. If you tan, you’re warm toned.
Look at your eye color and hair color. If you have blue, grey, or green eyes and blonde, brown, or black hair, you’re likely cool-toned. If you have brown, amber, or hazel eyes with strawberry blonde, auburn, or black hair, you are most likely warm-toned.
If you dye your hair and the name of your hair color has the word ash or platinum in it, it's a cool-toned color. If the name has golden or mahogany in it, it’s a warm-toned color.;
, Look for dark blues, dark purples, and emerald-greens. Opt for an emerald dress or a purple dress shirt with neutral pants., A baby blue sweater or a long camel coat look great against a cool skin tone. Other pastels like light yellow, light pink, and mint green also complement a cool skin tone., Metallic colored fabrics like silver or copper work well with warm skin tones, especially when paired with a bright red lip color or gold jewellery.Men can integrate metallics into their wardrobe with their jewellery. But they should avoid metallic shirts or pants.

, Don’t fear bright hues, especially if you have a warm skin tone that will make these colors really pop on you. Neon green, pink, or yellow will highlight the warmer tones of your skin, but be sure to keep your accessories simple and subtle so the neon color can be the star of your outfit.Other bright colors like cobalt blue and teal can also look great against a warm skin tone.

, These bright, warm colors will really sing against your warm skin tone, and help you sidestep a washed out or ashy look., Technically white and black are neutral colors, so they can arguably look good on any skin tone. But the right shade of gray can create a whole new spin on your look. Warm skin tones should go for a dove gray, while cool skin tones should go for a more charcoal gray or a very pale gray., Neutral skin tones are unique in that you can wear almost any colors, from jewel tones to neon. But a neutral skin tone really pops when you wear bold warm or cool colors like cobalt or camel."

Use measuring tape.,
Determine your female body shape.,
Go for an empire dress if you are a rectangle shape or a triangle shape.,
Look for a t-shirt shaped, collared dress if you are an hourglass shape.,
Opt for wrap dresses or surplice dresses, no matter your shape.,
Choose cargo pants if you are an inverted triangle shape.,
Look for a men’s trouser cut if you are a triangle shape or have a shorter frame.,
Choose skinny jeans if you have an hourglass shape.,
Go for boot cut pants or jeans, no matter your shape.",How to Know What to Wear2," To properly determine your body shape, you will need to measure your shoulders, your bust, your waist, and your hips with measuring tape.To measure your shoulders: place the measuring tape at the tip of one shoulder and wrap it all the way around you like a shawl until it meets back at the same shoulder. The tape should skim the top of your shoulder, almost as if it is going to slip off. This is the widest circumference of your shoulders. Write this measurement down.
To measure your bust: stand up straight and wrap the measuring tape around your back and across the fullest part of your bust, usually the middle of area of your bust. Pull the measuring tape as taut as you can without changing the shape of your breasts. Don’t squish them! Write this measurement down.
To measure your waist: wrap the measuring tape around your torso, at the smallest part of your waist. It should wrap flat around your back without buckling and meet just above your belly button. Write this measurement down.
To measure your hips: Hold the measuring tape at one hip, below your hip bone, at the fullest part of your hip. Keeping the tape flat, wrap it around the largest part of your butt and your other hip and bring it back to the meeting point. Write this measurement down.

, Using the measurements you took, figure out what your body shape is:You are an inverted triangle shape if: your shoulders or bust are larger than your hips. Your shoulder or bust measurements should be more than 5 percent bigger than your hip measurement. So, if your shoulders measure 36 inches (91.4 cm), your hips will be 34 ¼ inches or smaller.
You are a rectangle shape if: your shoulders, bust, and hips are around the same size. You may have no defined waistline. Your shoulder, bust, and hip measurements should be within 5 percent of each other. Your waist should be less than 25 percent smaller than your shoulder or bust measurements. So, if your shoulders measure 36 inches (91.4 cm), your waist will be 27 inches or more.
You are a triangle shape if: your hips are wider than your shoulders. Your hip measurement will be more than 5 percent bigger than your shoulder or bust measurements. So, if your shoulders measure 36 inches (91.4 cm), your hips will be 37 ¾ inches or larger.
You are hourglass shaped if: your shoulders and hips are around the same size and you have a very defined waistline. Your shoulder and hip measurements should be within 5 percent of each other. Your waist should be at least 25 percent smaller than your shoulder, hip, and bust measurements. So, if your shoulders and hips measure 36 inches (91.4 cm), your waist will be 27 inches (68.6 cm) or smaller.

, Empire dresses hit just below your bustline and taper out at the hem. So if you are a rectangle shape, look for an empire dress that fits snugly around your chest and flares out to give the illusion of a defined waistline.If you are a triangle shape, empire dresses will also look great on you. They will make your legs look long and lean.

, The simple lines of a collared dress will put the focus on your shoulders and neck. You can also wear the top two or three buttons open to create a V-neck to flatter your top half., The wrap dress is created by cross-wrapping fabric and securing it with a tie or bow in the front or side. It also has a nice V-shaped neckline, which looks great on every shape.The surplice is a permanent version of a wrap dress, where the fabric is cross-wrapped in the front and sewn to create a V-shaped neckline.
Surplice tops or wrap tops are also great for any body shape and create a flattering neckline. They can be paired with skinny jeans or cargo pants for a casual look., This style was originally created to hold gear for the military, so they have numerous pockets on the outside of the pants. Cargo pants add weight to your bottom half, so they’re good for an inverted triangle shape and can compliment an already-balanced shape like an hourglass.


If you are a rectangle shape, choose a pair with pockets at the hips to add curves below your waist and make your waist appear smaller than your hips.

, Traditional men’s trousers are cut to fall straight from the hip with slanted side pockets and cuffs. A high-waisted trouser will make your thighs appear long and lean.

, This style of jeans is tight fitted in the waist, hips and thighs. It then tapers down, hugging the calves and ankles, so it makes your legs look long and lean., The cut of this style runs straight from the hip to the knee, and then flares slightly from the knee to the ankle. It’s a great cut for all body shapes, as it creates a long leg and balances your hips."
"
Determine your body shape.,
Go for the newest trends, cuts, and colors if you are a trapezoid shape.,
Look for clothing that creates a balance between your top and bottom halves if you are an inverted trapezoid shape.,
Avoid structured jackets with shoulder padding or wide lapels if you are an inverted triangle shape.,
Layer shirts and knitwear if you are a rectangle shape.,
Avoid double breast suits or sleeveless tops if you are a rectangle shape.,
Wear well fitting clothing if you are a triangle shape.,
Avoid wearing horizontal stripes across your stomach area if you are a triangle shape.,
Go for vertical stripes and pinstripes if you are oval shaped.,
Add points of interest to your outfits with color or prints if you are oval shaped.,
Avoid cowl necks, wide crew necks, or polo necks if you are oval shaped.",How to Know What to Wear3," For men, body shape is based more on the length of your torso and your ability to gain muscle on your chest and shoulder area. There are five main body shapes for men:The trapezoid body shape: You have broad shoulders and a broad chest with narrow waist and hips. Because your upper body and lower body will be pretty proportional, you can fit most styles and fits.
The inverted trapezoid body shape: You have broad shoulders and chest, but your hips and waist are narrower. So your upper torso is much wider than your lower torso, and the lower half of your body. This body shape is common in athletes and men who regularly weight lift or do body building.
The rectangle body shape: You have shoulders that are the same width as your waist and hips. So, when dressing, your aim should be to widen your shoulders and make your lower torso appear more narrow.
The triangle body shape: Your chest and shoulders are narrower than your waist and hips, and you appear larger on the bottom half of your torso. So the lower half of your body may appear wider than your upper body.
The oval body shape: Your chest and stomach will create a long oval shape. You may also have narrow looking shoulders and skinnier legs.

, Because you are well proportioned, you can experiment with the latest trends and cuts with a certain amount of freedom.Try bold vertical or horizontal stripes on a collared shirt, a navy or cargo green cotton blazer, and long sleeve shirts in a bold print. Go for slim cut khakis or blue jeans.
Look for tops and pants that are not too tight, but don’t hang off you or are too baggy. Your body shape suits form fitting clothes and cuts.

, The idea is to give your look some balance and proportion.Try straight or relaxed slim cuts (rather than slim or skinny) for legwear as they will help balance your proportions and broad shoulders.
Wear belts and go for pants with pockets. This will help to break up an outfit and draw attention to your narrow waist.
Go for v-neck knits and tees as they will narrow your chest area. Breton striped tees are great for this body shape, especially stripes that go across the stomach area rather than the chest area.
Graphic prints and logos on your shirts as well as your pants can give you a leaner look. Just don’t wear them both at the same time. If you’re wearing a graphic print or logo on a top, keep your pants simple and subtle.
Look for unstructured double-breasted that widen your torso, but don’t add width to your shoulders or upper chest area.

, This will only emphasize the width area on your body, rather than slim it down.


Say no to tops with wide scoop necklines, or three quarter length sleeves. Stick to shorter sleeves for anything but formal shirts., Layering smartly, with a v-neck sweater over a collared shirt, can help to widen your chest and shoulders and narrow your hips.You can also wear scarves and circular necklines to widen your upper torso.
A structured blazer or jacket, preferably customized by a tailor, will give your upper body a more slim look.

, Double breasted suits will only give you a more rectangular shape, rather than a proportioned shape.


Probably a good idea to also avoid geometric prints on tops as they draw attention to your wide chest. Sleeveless tops will also emphasize your bulky arms, so if you do like to wear them, layer them.

, Go for single breasted and button down styles, as they will streamline your torso, like collared shirts and coats.Straight leg trousers and chinos are also great for this shape, as well as structured tailored blazers and jackets.
Go for darker colors on top as they will instantly flatter you. Layer a bright shirt or a tee with a bold print underneath a darker collared shirt.

, They will only emphasize your round shape. Instead, look for tops with vertical stripes.Polo necks or narrow crew-necks on shirts will decrease your shoulder width. So go for regular cut t-shirts instead.
Instead of tapered trousers or skinny jeans, look for regular cut pants.

, They will instantly lengthen your body and give it a more lean look. Avoid horizontal stripes as they will make your body appear rounder.Make sure your pants are the correct length, falling just below your ankle, as baggy pants will shorten your legs and give you less definition in your bottom half.
Tapered trousers will lengthen your legs, and give you more shape.

, Combine a print or textured shirt with a darker colored pair of pants or a jacket to keep your look interesting and flattering.

, They will only make your upper look rounder, rather than slimmer.Statement or colored belts will only attract attention to your waist area and highlight your widest points. So keep your belts simple or avoid them altogether.

Be wary of any product that doesn't specifically claim to be real leather.,
Check the surface grain, the little ""pebbles"" and pores, for imperfections and uniqueness that signal genuine leather.,
Press into the leather, looking for creases and wrinkles.,
Smell the leather, searching for a natural, musty smell instead of plastic-like or chemical-y.,
Use the fire test, recognizing that it will likely ruin part of the good.,
Note the edges, as real leather has rough edges where faux has even, perfect edges.,
Bend the leather, looking for it to change color slightly in real leather.,
Drop a small amount of water on the good, as real leather absorbs moisture.,
Know that real leather goods are rarely ever cheap.,
Ignore color, as even colored leathers can be genuine.",How to Identify Genuine Leather1," If it is labeled as ‘manmade material,’ it is definitely synthetic leather. But if it doesn't say anything at all, chances are good the manufacturer wants to conceal the fact that it isn't real leather.Of course, used goods may have lost their tags. But most manufacturers are proud of the fact that they use real leather, and will note it as following:


Real leather
Genuine leather
Top/Full grain leather
Made with animal products;
, Imperfections, in leather, are actually a good thing. Remember, real leather is made from animal skin, and thus each piece is as random and unique as the animal it came from. Very regular, even, and similar grains often indicate a machine-made piece.


Real leather might have scratches, creases, and wrinkles -- this is a good thing!
Note that, as manufacturers get more skilled, their designs are better mimicking real leather. This makes buying online, where you only have a picture, very difficult to do.

, Real leather will wrinkly under the tough, just like real skin. Synthetic materials usually just depress down under your finger, retaining rigidity and shape., If you're completely unsure of the smell you're looking for, head into a store that you know sells genuine leather and test out a few bags and shoes. Ask if they have any synthetic pieces and smell those as well. Once you know what you're looking for, the smell differences will be unmistakable.


Remember, leather is just worked animal skin. Faux leather is made of plastic. It seems obvious, but real leather will smell like skin and fake will smell like plastic.

, While there are few circumstances where burning a good is preferable to leaving it alone, this experiment works if you have a small, hard-to-see area that you can test, like the underside of a couch. Hold a flame up to the area for 5-10 seconds to test it out:


Real leather will only char slightly, and smell a bit like burnt hair.
Faux leather will actually catch flame, and smells like burning plastic., Machine made leather looks machine cut. Real leather is made of many strands, which naturally fray around the edges. Faux leather made from plastic has no such strands, meaning the edges are cleanly cut., Similar to the ""wrinkle test,"" real leather has a unique elasticity when bent, changing color and wrinkling up naturally. Faux leather is much more rigid and regular, and will usually be difficult to bend by comparison., If the good is fake, the water will simply puddle up on top. But real leather will absorb a small drop of water in only a few seconds , telling you quickly if it is genuine., A product completely made of real leather will be quite expensive. They usually sell at fixed prices. Shop around and get a feel for the price of real leather, semi leather, and synthetic leather products to understand the differences between them. Among leathers, cow leather price is the highest due to its durability and easy tanning property. Split leather, which is an under layer split from the surface layer, is less expensive than top grain or belting leather.


If a deal seems too good to be true, it likely is. Real leather is expensive.
While all real leather goods are much more expensive than fake, there are actually different types of real leather as well, all with widely different pricing.


, A bright blue piece of leather furniture may not look natural, but this doesn't mean it isn't made of real leather. Colors and dyes can be added to both synthetics and natural leathers, so ignore color and stick to feel, smell, and texture when searching for real or faux leather.

Be creative but professional when dressing for a job interview.,
Ask the host about the dress code for their dinner party.,
Go for a dressy casual look if you’re heading to a cocktail party.,
Keep your look professional but not too formal for a work function or office party.,
Don’t wear white to a wedding, unless you are the bride or the groom.,
Look for simple, tasteful pieces if you’re attending a funeral or wake.",How to Know What to Wear4," The old rules still apply: no jeans, no revealing clothing, and no running shoes. Men should wear a suit or a collared shirt, nice shoes, and a tie. But women have more freedom with the “suit only” approach for job interviews.Pair a silk blouse with a pencil skirt, a cropped jacket, and heels, or a graphic collared shirt with fitted dress pants and dressy flats. You could also wear a sheath dress with a belt and a cardigan to keep your look professional and unique.

, It can be tricky to not underdress or overdress for a dinner party. So go straight to the source and casually ask your host what they would suggest wearing for the party.If you aren’t sure about the dress code but don’t want to bother the host, women can stash a pretty scarf and dangly earrings in their bags to dress up an outfit. Men can carry a blazer with them or put a tie in their pocket to spruce up their look if need be.

, Dressy casual could be a top with interesting details and a skirt or tailored pants for women. Or it could be trousers and a dress shirt for men.


Women can wear heels or fancy flats. Men can wear a leather loafer, oxfords, or a slip-on shoe.Finish your outfit with a blazer or sports coat for men, and a fitted jacket for women.

, Think about the culture of your office. Is it conservative? Or more laid back? No matter how relaxed your office environment is or the occasion, avoid wearing anything too provocative.A too-revealing outfit can prevent you from being taken seriously in the office.
Women can go for fitted trousers with a nice top or blouse and a blazer. A wrap dress and simple jewelry is a great way to look evening-appropriate and still professional.
Men can wear a patterned or textured tie and a collared shirt in a print or with interesting pocket detailing. Go for fitted pants, instead of jeans.

, You can wear other hues like black or red, but white is still reserved for the wedding party. Consider the season and setting of the wedding when deciding what to wear.A backyard summer wedding means you could wear a simple silk dress in a bold color for women or print, or a simple collared shirt and cotton pants for men.
A fall or winter wedding may call for a form fitting sweater dress and boots for women, or a v-neck sweater over a collared shirt for men.

, Your outfit doesn’t have to be black but it does have to be respectful. Clothing in dark neutral colors like navy, brown, or forest green are all good options. Skip any clothing or accessories that are too festive, unless you’ve been told otherwise by the grieving party."

Understand that ""Genuine Leather"" is only one kind of real, legitimate leather on the market.,
Purchase ""full grain"" leather for only for the most high-end products.,
Search for ""top grain leather"" to get high-quality goods at a much more reasonable price.,
Know that ""genuine leather"" usually has a suede side or feeling to it.,
Stay away from ""bonded leather,"" which is made from ground up and glued leather shavings.",How to Identify Genuine Leather2," Most people are more concerned about differentiating real leather from faux, or fake leather. But serious connoisseurs know that there are actually multiple grades of real leather, of which ""Genuine Leather"" is actually the second lowest grade. From most luxurious to least, the other types of real leather are:


Full Grain Leather
Top Grain Leather
Genuine Leather
Bonded Leather

, Full grain leather only uses the very highest (closest to the air) layer of skin, which is the toughest, most durable, and most beloved. It is left unfinished, meaning it has completely unique characteristics, creases, and coloring. Because of the smaller amount of leather on the surface of each animal and the difficulty of working with full grain toughness, the price is understandably high.


Be aware that some manufacturers will report something is ""made with full grain leather"" even if only parts of the chair or sofa are full grain. This is another reason why buying without seeing the good is rarely recommended.

, The most common ""luxury"" leather is top grain, which takes the layer of skin just below full grain and works it lightly to remove imperfections. It is smoother and more consistent than full grain, but easier to work as well, keeping the price down.


While note as durable as full grain, it is still a strong, well-crafted leather.

, Genuine leather is made by stripping off the harder, more expensive grains from the top, then using the softer, easier to work leather underneath. It is not as durable as full or top grain, but it is much cheaper since it can be manufactured into a variety of goods with ease.


Remember -- genuine leather is a specific grade, not the phrase for real leather. If you request genuine leather in a leather shop, they will have a specific type of product in mind.

, While bonded leather is still leather, it isn't an unbroken or regular piece of animal skin. Instead, the shavings from all the other leather grades are collected, ground up, and mixed with an adhesive liquid to make a piece of leather. Though cheap, the quality is severely lacking.


Because the quality is less impressive, bonded leather is often used for book covers and other smaller, less worn items."

Show your freckles!,
Use makeup to enhance your red hair, fair skin and freckles.,
Your body is important.,
Embrace your natural beauty!",How to Look Beautiful As a Redhead," Freckles signify beauty, and are commonly found on redheads. They look beautiful with your red hair and fair skin, so keep them! Don't try to get rid of them, just because people make nasty comments - freckles are beautiful and that is that!


Only use a light powder or even a little dusting of mineral foundation to enhance your freckles and show them off to the world.;
, There are many makeup tips for redheads, and many of them are unknown. These makeup tips will make you look flawless and beautiful. Here are all the makeup tips for redheads:


Wear brown eyeliner. It depends on what shade your red hair is - if your hair is the brighter, lighter shade, wear dark brown and if you have the classic red hair, wear light brown eyeliner.
Choose peach and brown shades for your eyeshadow. Peach eyeshadow brings out your red hair and freckles - true fact! Brown looks truly flawless on blue eyes, and peach looks nice with green, but you can use any and look flawless!
Have plum shades in your eyeshadow and eyeliner collection. It looks amazing with green eyes, but still looks good with any eye colour, as it brings out your red hair! Plum is an essential colour in your makeup collection, so buy plum-coloured makeup.
Mineral foundation is a must. Make sure it matches your skin tone! Mineral foundation is awesome because it doesn't clog your pores as it doesn't contain oil and chemicals, plus it doesn't cover up your freckles and actually makes them more noticeable!
Deep blushes look great on redheads. Try a brick-red or a crimson, but don't put too much on so it covers your lovely freckles! Just a light dusting, remember! Also, don't have your tones too deep!
Only put a small amount of mascara on your lashes. Don't put lots of it on. Have two coats of mascara on your top lashes, and two coats on your bottom lashes. Anyway, caked on makeup isn't a good look on anyone!
Coral colours look amazing on redheads. Try coral coloured lipstick or blush. It looks amazing. Also, a red-coral or pink-coral lipstick looks awesome too! Don't overload the coral, though. Too much coral doesn't look good!
Earthy tones are one of your best friends. Greens, browns and deep tones suit you really good. Earthy colours highlight your red hair and freckles, and earthy tones look beautiful with green eyes! Don't make all your makeup earthy tones, unless you want to look like an eco freak!
Opt for lip glosses all the way! They make your lips look beautiful. Soft pinks and bright pinks are for you, especially with an extra-glossy sheen. Instead of lip glosses, you can also have a tinted lip balm.
Pink lipsticks are one of your best friends. Pink lips are not only in this year, they also suit redheads greatly! Any shade will look good on you - hot pink, baby pink, bright pink...even a deep pink. Hot pink looks the best on redheads, but you can pick any shade!
Light concealer under your eyes. Have a concealer one shade lighter than your real skin tone. It makes you look more awake and fresh-faced, plus it zaps the baggy, purple bits under your eyes. Never get a concealer darker than your skin tone!
Avoid heavy foundation. It looks so cakey and fake. Heavy foundation looks bad on everyone, but for some reason it looks worse on redheads...any pale skinned girls, in fact. Stick to tinted moisturizer or even just a light dusting of foundation.
Cat eyes are so for redheads! Use jet black eyeliner and jet black mascara for this look. If you dislike putting eyeliner on your waterline, put it on your top lash line and bottom lash line. Put on three coats on each lash, bottom and top. Look at a wikiHow article or YouTube video for tutorials.
Black mascara is a must for you! People say that ginger mascara looks good on you, but that's a no-no! Black mascara should be in your makeup bag. It can be used for everyday wear or to add a dramatic look to your eyes.
Red lipstick is for you! It looks good with red hair. It won't clash with your red hair! A bright red looks amazing on you, as long as you apply it properly. Don't make a lipstick mishap or it'll ruin it! Along with pink lippy, red lippy is your bestie!
Even better, don't wear any makeup at all! Let your skin breathe and show your freckles even more! The best type of beauty is natural beauty, and that's the type of beauty you show with zero makeup. Look more gorgeous without any makeup - makeup is for phonies!

, You can have any body type, but an hourglass figure particularly looks good on a redhead. The hourglass figure that looks good on redheads is actually a mixture of curvy-slim. Eat healthy, drink plenty of water and exercise 5 days a week for a good figure. Remember, you can have any body type at all, but a curvy-slim hourglass figure looks amazing on a redhead, especially if you have long hair cascading down your shoulders and back.


Having chubby cheeks looks cute and amazing on redheads. It looks cute and sweet with anyone, but particularly on redheads.
Remember, you can have any body and face type.

, Red hair, fair skin and freckles look beautiful - more beautiful than straight blonde hair and tanned skin, which looks totally fake. Be a beautiful girl with lovely red hair, an English rose complexion and a dusting of brown freckles! Don't dye your hair bleached blonde, bright pink or any colour for that matter! Don't use fake tan! Don't get rid of your freckles! Be you...and be beautiful! You're best beautiful, after all...

E.g., 95, 23, 54, and 33 are written ""nittiofem"", ""tjugotre"" (""twenty""=""tjugo"" and ""three""=""tre""), ""femtiofyra"" (""fifty""=""femtio"" and ""four""=""fyra"") and ""trettiotre"" (""thirty""=""trettio"" and ""three""=""tre"").

, 100 is said ""hundra"" (pronunciation: hɵndra), 1000 is ""tusen"" (pronunciation: tʉːsɛn) and 10000 is ""tiotusen"" (see pronunciation for ""tio"", ten, and ""tusen"", thousand). It is quite easy; you just add the larger number before the rest, as in English. If there is not just one larger number, such as 2000, then you add that number first, as in English. The same applies if there are many ""huge numbers"". You do never say ""och"" (""and"") between the numbers, and you never put a ""-"" there either. If you want to say 3502, then you say ""tretusenfemhundratvå"" (if you have trouble reading it, then try this: ""tre-tusen-fem-hundra-två"", ""three-thousand-five-hundred-two""; however, you should not write with ""-""-marks).

Place an order in a restaurant.,
A more polite option is to use the construction ""Skulle jag kunna få ..."" possibly in addition to the final ""tack"".,
Ask someone to do something for you.,
Invite someone to do something, or offer to let them do something, for their own sake.,
Accept an offer.,
Request someone to do something.,
Beg for something.,
Write signs.,
Write official instructions.",How to Say Please in Swedish," A simple but slightly informal option is to use ""tack"" (the same word that also means ""thanks""). It basically offers your thanks in advance, and as such it can also be used after other instructions.



En kaffe, tack. (""A coffee, please."")

Stäng dörren. Tack! (""Close the door. Thanks!"");
, This might for example be used to request something a little out of the ordinary, like changing parts of a restaurant order.



Skulle jag kunna få prova de där skorna också innan jag bestämmer mig? (""Could I please try those shoes on too, before I make up my mind?"")

Skulle vi kunna få ris istället för potatis till varmrätten? (""Could we please have rice instead of potatoes with the entrée?"")

, Use ""kan du..."" (or ""kan ni..."", if you're talking to more than one person), followed by the infinitive of the verb.


""Kan du skicka saltet."" (""Please send the salt"" or ""Could you please pass the salt."".)
A second option, which sounds either quite a bit more formal, or as if you were asking something major, is to use the expression ""Skulle du kunna..."" (followed by an infinitive. Replace ""du"" with ""ni"" when you're talking to more than one person).

, Use Var så god och..."" followed by the imperative.


""Var så god och sitt"" (""Please, have a seat"", speaking to one person.)
If you're speaking to more than one person, replace ""god"" with ""goda"".
In English, this construction would translate roughly as, ""be so good as to sit down"", but the Swedish expression is fairly idiomatic.
""Var så god"" is often used as English would use ""feel free"" or ""help yourself"".

, When one in English says ""Yes, please"", one would in Swedish say either ""Ja, tack"" or ""Ja, gärna"". The second is more emphatic, and used if you're genuinely happy about it. Something on the lines of ""Yes, please, I'd love that!""

, This is for when you're not really asking them if they would like to do something, but telling them to do it. In this case, use ""Var snäll och ..."" followed by the imperative. Or, if you talk to more than one person, use ""Var snälla och ..."" .



Var snäll och ta ner fötterna från bordet. (""Kindly get your feet off the table."")

, Do you want to borrow mum's car, and need to convince her to let you? The begging or pleading ""please"" in contexts such as ""Please, let me do ..."" would be translated as ""snälla"", as in ""Snälla, låt mig låna bilen."" (""Please, let me borrow the car"").

, Usually, the language on signs is more formal, and more importantly, more distant. ""Vänligen"" (followed by an imperative) is quite common here.



Vänligen gå ej på gräset. (""Please don't walk on the grass."")
You will more frequently encounter it in writing, than in speech.
The word ""vänligen"" occasionally appears in some dictionaries (including Google translate) as the translation of ""please"". Do not take that as an excuse to use it as a catch-all translation — it most emphatically is not. In fact, you'll most likely never use it in speech. Also, be careful with it in writing, as it is likely to make the text appear machine-translated if it's used in the wrong spot.

, The expression ""Var god"" (followed by an imperative) is basically only used in a few constructions, all quite formal.


You may hear ""Var god dröj"" (""Please hold"") if you're being put on hold on the telephone.
""Var god vänd."" (or abbreviated ""V.G.V.""; ""Please turn over"") appears on forms to draw your attention to the fact that there is more to fill in on the back of the sheet.

Say ""tá."",
Say ""grá."",
Say ""agam."",
Say ""duit."",
Put it all together.",How to Say I Love You in Irish1," This word means ""there"" or ""yes."" It is pronounced ""tah"" (it rhymes with the English word ""raw"").;
, This word means ""love."" It is pronounced ""grah"" (it also rhymes with the English word ""raw"").


This word is sometimes spelled ""ghrá,"" but the pronunciation is the same.

, This word means ""I."" It is pronounced ""UH-gum."" The first syllable uses a vowel sound that's a little like a combination of the long a in ""raw"" and the short u in ""hug."" The second syllable sounds very similar to the English word ""gum.""


Be sure to put the stress on the first syllable here. The word is pronounced ""UH-gum,"" not ""uh-GUM."" Reversing the stresses will make it hard for others to understand you. This would be like pronouncing the English word ""aided"" as ""ay-DUD"" rather than ""AY-dud.""
This word can sometimes be spelled ""again,"" which can be confusing because of the English word spelled the same way.However, the pronunciation is never the same.

, This means ""you."" It is pronounced similarly to the English word ""ditch."" Use a short i sound (as in ""hit"") and a ch sound (as in ""cheese"") at the end of the word.


Depending on the region of Ireland, this word can also sometimes be pronounced as ""dit.""Some speakers even add a w sound for a pronunciation that resembles ""dwitch.""

, Once you've mastered the pronunciation for each word in the phrase, just say them in order to get ""I love you."" ""Tá grá agam duit"" is pronounced (roughly) ""Tah grah UH-gum ditch.""


Though this phrase literally means ""There love I you,"" Irish speakers will understand it as ""I love you."" However, this isn't always the most common way that this is said in Ireland. In the section below, you'll learn a few more ways to say that you love someone. Depending on the region, one of these may be the ""normal"" way to say it.

"
"
Remember that almost everything you read in Tagalog or Filipino is phonetic.,
Learn a little of the language before you visit.,
Learn how to say the equivalent of good morning, good afternoon, and good evening.,
Try English if all else fails.,
Greet a group of friends.,
Speak differently to elders.",How to Greet People from the Philippines1," This means that words can be sounded out. Try to sound it out the way you see it and you will most likely be close to the correct pronunciation.


Vowels are harder than in American English, but softer than in a British accent. Also, all the vowels are unrounded, except for /o/.There are exceptions though: ng is pronounced 'nang' and mga is pronounced 'muhNGA'. The '-ng', which is a single letter, is pronounced as in 'bang' or 'song'.;
, You can learn Filipino or Tagalog by reading books, viewing television, listening to music, or watching videos. Just like other languages, it is still best if you practice by conversing with someone who knows the language.


If you have a limited amount of time, focus your studying on common greetings that you are likely to use. Don't try to learn all the grammar and structure of the language if you are visiting in the near future.

, There is no literal translation for these phrases. Instead, Filipinos greet each other by saying ""beautiful"" before day, afternoon, or evening.To say good morning, say ""Magandang umaga"" (ma-gan-dang u-ma-ga), which means beautiful morning.
To say good afternoon, say ""Magandang hapon"" (ma-gan-dang ha-pon), which means beautiful afternoon.
To say good evening, say ""Magandang gabi"" (ma-gan-dang ga-bi), which means beautiful evening.

, Filipinos are generally accustomed to English, so you can simply say ""Hi,"" ""Hello,"" 'Good Morning,' etc. The person you are greeting will probably understand your basic greeting in English.If you get stuck and don't know what to say, just speak in English. It is better to say something in English than nothing at all.
However, if you want to impress those you interact with, then go ahead and study the language so you are prepared!

, If you are trying to impress a new group of friends, say ""Kumusta kayó"" when you approach them. This is the plural form of ""How are you?""It is pronounced /kah - mu:s - ta: ka: - yo:/.

, If you are talking to someone who is older or of higher social rank than you, always add po to your sentences. Po is usually added at the end of a sentence, for example ""Salamat po"" means ""thank you.""


Also, use opo to say ""yes."" This is basically the equivalent of saying ""yes, ma'am"" or ""yes sir.""

"
"
Use ""Mo grá thú."",
Try ""Gráim thú."",
Say ""Is breá liom tú."",
Alternatively, use ""Is aoibhinn liom tú.""",How to Say I Love You in Irish2," This is roughly pronounced ""mow grah hoo."" The first word rhymes with ""low."" Don't be fooled by the th in the last word — ""thú"" should sound like the noise an owl makes. Some regional accents pronounce it a little more like ""huh,"" but the important point is that you should use an h sound for the word.Literally, this means ""my love you,"" but the meaning is essentially ""I love you.""

, This is pronounced ""GRAH-im hoo."" Notice that the first word is actually two syllables even though it looks like it might be just one. Also note that the first syllable is stressed, rather than the second.


This is a shorter, easier version of the phrase above. The meaning is more or less the same.

, This is pronounced ""Iss brah lum too."" Use a hard s sound (as in ""sass"") for the first word. It should not sound like the English word ""is."" Note that ""breá"" rhymes with ""raw"" and that the second word rhymes with ""strum"" regardless of how they look like they would be pronounced in English.

, This phrase should sound like ""Iss even lum too."" Notice that the only word that is different between this phrase and the one above is ""aoibhinn."" Despite how it looks, this word is pronounced almost exactly like the English word ""even.""The rest of the words are pronounced the same way as in the step above.
While the phrase above means ""I love you,"" the literal meaning here is closer to ""you delight me."" The meaning is less romantic and more affectionate. You can also use this phrase for objects (see below).

"
"
If you are madly in love with someone, say ""Tá mo chroí istigh ionat."",
To call someone ""darling,"" say ""Mo chuisle."",
To call someone your chosen one, say ""Is tú mo rogha."",
If you love an idea or object, say ""Is aoibhinn liom ______.""",How to Say I Love You in Irish3," The pronunciation here is ""tah mow KHree iss-tee on-ud."" Literally, this means ""my heart is in in you,"" but the actual meaning is similar to ""you are very dear to my heart."" There are two difficult pronunciations here:


""Chroí"" is probably the hardest word to pronounce. You want to use a guttural h/ch sound from your throat that doesn't exist in English. It's basically the same sound used in a few common Hebrew words like ""Chanukah.""
""Istigh"" sounds roughly like ""iss-tee"" or ""ish-tig"" depending on the regional accent. Use a hard s (as in ""sass"") or an sh sound (as in ""shoot""), not a soft s/z sound (as in ""glaze"")., This is pronounced ""Moe KHoosh-leh."" ""Mo"" is easy — it rhymes with ""blow."" ""Chuisle"" is a little harder. You need to use a guttural h/ch sound (as in ""Chanukah"") to start the word. The ""oosh"" part rhymes with ""push."" The ""le"" at the end uses the short e sound (as in ""red"").


Literally, this means ""my pulse."" It's a common expression taken from the original phrase ""A chuisle mo chroí"" (""pulse of my heart"").

, This is pronounced ""Iss too moe raow-uh."" ""Rogha"" is the most difficult word here. The first syllable rhymes with ""plow,"" not ""blow."" The gh combination makes a w sound (as in ""wet""). Note also that ""is"" is pronounced with a hard s sound as mentioned above.


Literally, ""rogha"" means ""choice"" or ""favorite."" It can also mean ""flower,"" which gives this phrase a flattering double meaning.

, This phrase is pronounced ""Iss even lum ____,"" where the blank is the object or idea that you love. This phrase is used for when you love something, but you're not romantically in love with it. For example, if you really like your grandmother's pasta, you might say ""Is aoibhinn liom pasta.""


Note that this phrase is identical to ""Is aoibhinn liom tú"" from the section above except that you're substituting a different word for tú (""you"").

Shake people's hands.,
Consider using a ""mano"" greeting with elders.,
Keep the conversation light and friendly.",How to Greet People from the Philippines2," In Filipino culture it is generally best to shake hands with someone that you are meeting for the first time. This is usually a soft hand shake, not an overly firm one.Greeting someone you just met with a kiss on the cheek or a hug is not usually done. This is most often reserved for once you have developed a relationship.If you are in a Muslim area of the Philippines, then the rules for touching, especially between men and women, may be different. Shaking hands may still be appropriate but men may need to initiate. Notice what others are doing around you and follow their lead., Filipino elders are often greeted by taking their right hand and bringing it up to touch your forehead. This is called ""mano."" This is especially important to do with ones own family members and with those that are extremely elderly.If an elderly person holds out their hand in front of their body with the palm facing down, this may be a sign that they are expecting a ""mano"" greeting.
This greeting is about you respecting your elders but it is also about the elder blessing you when they touch your forehead., As with many people all over the world, Filipinos don't necessarily want to talk about politics or serious topics with strangers. Instead, focus your conversations on the joys of life: family, food, and fun. This will make getting to know this new person more enjoyable.


In general, Filipinos love to laugh. They do it genuinely but they also laugh to move away from uncomfortable topics or to break tension. Be aware of this and be willing to change the subject if you notice this cue."

,


Me/I: Meiney';'Mai';'Mere'

You: Tum'Tumhae';tumharae';'Tumnae';'Tumsae';
He/She/It/That: Vo;'Usnae';'Uskee';

, Each of these pronouns below has a plural equivalent, which is used when there are more than one of the things referred to by the pronouns, or also when the pronoun refers to someone you respect or who is of higher stature, or just to be polite or formal:


We: Hum;'Humarae';'Humsae';'Humsab';
You (as in ""you lot"" - plural): Aap;'Aapsabh';'AapSabhee';
Them/Those: Vo;'Unhee';'Inhee';'Unko';

, ""To Be"" has the following conjugations:


To Be: Hona (infinitive)
I am: Mein hoon

You are: Tum ho

S/he/it/that is: Vo hai

Just to recap, ""Mein hoon"" means ""I am"" because ""mein"" means ""I"" and is the subject, ""hoon"" means ""am"" and is the verb, and the Urdu sentence order is Subject, Object (none in this case), Verb.
We are: Hum hain

You (pl) are: Aap hain

They/those are: Vo hain

Like English, the plurals all take the same conjugation.

, ""Hona"" - ""To Be"" - and ""Dekhna"" - ""To See"". Of the verbs that are regular, such as Dekhna (but not Hona), there is a simple rule for conjugating them in the present tense. This is to remove the ""na"" and add on the following instead. Note that in the first three cases, the underlined syllables are used only if the subject of the sentence is masculine (e.g. ""John""). If the subject is feminine (e.g. ""Jane"") then those syllables are replaced by ""i"".


I (Mein): ta

You (Tum): te

S/he/it (Vo): ta

We (Hum): tain

You (pl) (Aap): tain

Them (Vo): tain

Thus, as an example, the verb Dekhna (to see) would conjugate for me (I'm male) as ""Dekhta"" or for you (if you're female) as ""Dekhti"".

, Thus whereas in English we say ""I see"", in Urdu the translated equivalent would be ""I am see"" - or with the correct order, ""I see am"". Thus in Urdu, saying ""I see"" is like saying ""I am, and see."" Without the qualification that you are while you see, the verb of seeing would not be in the present tense. Thus:


""I see"": ""Mein dekhti hoon""
""It sees"": ""Vo dekhta hai""
You will recall that ""mein"" is ""I"", ""hoon"" is ""am"" (conjugated for ""I"") and ""dekhti"" is the verb ""To See"" (""Dekhna"") when conjugated for a female ""I"".

, When nouns are used as objects, they are appended by ""ko"" to show this change. e.g. ""John"" is fine as a subject, but ""John ko"" is the object.


I (Mein): Mujhe

You (Tum): Tumhe

S/he (Vo): Usse

We (Hum): Humhe

You (pl) (Aap): Aapko

Them (Vo): Unhe


, To say ""I see John"" in Urdu, we say something like ""I John see am"" - ""I am, and see John"".


""I see John"": Mein John ko dekhta hoon

""Jane sees John"": Jane John ko dekhti hai

To deconstruct: ""Jane John ko dekhti hai ""
""I see you"": Mein tumhe dekhta hoon

""You see us"": Tum humhe dekhti ho

""They see Jane"": Vo Jane ko dekhtain hain

",How to Have Fashionable Clothes to Wear to Work," It's important to choose clothes that reflect the best of your own assets. Whether you have a great waist, a toned body, a beautiful silhouette, a fulsome chest, a 'bootylicious' backside, etc., focus on clothes that fit.;
, Since this is for work, consider getting at least one or two suits or jackets tailored specifically to your shape. Such an item can last and last, so spending good money on it is a worthwhile investment in your work wardrobe.


Choose a classic cut; the ""fashion"" side can be achieved through use of colors in shirts, t-shirts, belts, ties, skirts, shoes, etc.

, Before even considering fashionable clothing, be sure you know what is expected in your workplace. Some places are very conservative, while others aren't fussed about dress-down, casual-as every day of the week. Don't push the boundaries in a conservative environment––you can be individual with splashes of color, a special item of jewelry or such but avoid being too casual. And no matter what your workplace, here are some things to avoid:


Transparent or sheer clothing that exposes your lingerie
Low-plunging tops, anything that reveals too much cleavage
Panty lines (too tight!)
Flip flops or bare feet (unless you're in a very casual place)
Clothing with offensive logos, images or messages.

, It's a good idea to have a range of suits to cycle through during the week. Also, have suits in winter and summer weights, to ensure that you're warm or cool enough as needed. At a minimum, two to four suits would be a good wardrobe amount.


For shirts, have a minimum of five, preferably 10 shirts to be rotated around each two weeks. Some men prefer basic white all the time, while others prefer a range of fashionable colors.
Have three pairs of shoes in excellent shape; update your seasons each new season if they're not in good condition.
A range of fashionable silk ties in different colors and patterns. Purchase a tie hanger to make it easier to see them each day when matching.
Socks - at least 5 pairs for the week, more if you change for evening events. Quirky, colorful socks with logos are okay if your workplace is casual, otherwise, keep the colors conservative.

, There are lots of possibilities for a work wardrobe but here are some basic suggestions:


An A-line dress and perhaps a tunic dress for mixing and matching
A pencil skirt
A ruffled skirt
Pants/trousers
Two or more tailored suits - at least one trouser suit and one skirt suit
Trousers
Nude pantyhose; colored if they match the clothing and are low-key
Shoes – heels if you wear them, flats (ballet flats are good) or kitten heels, and no need to tell you how many––that's up to you
Scarves, bags, jewelry, as needed
For winter, add in some turtlenecks, sweaters and boots.

, Fashion is easily kept up with by reading magazines, browsing your favorite clothing stores and seeing what your peers are wearing. However, there is no need to throw out your wardrobe every season. What you can do is update it by adding in some new shirts, t-shirts, ties, jewelry, shoes, and other less expensive items and changing around your clothing to form different looks. Suit jackets, tailored pants and skirts, should be in classic styles to allow you to continue wearing them until they wear out, spruced up by the cheaper additions.


Sometimes it's a good idea to have a tailor make changes to existing clothing to increase their currency; for expensive clothing, this can be cheaper than replacing them.
Keep your old clothes. They often come around again in fashion but mixing and matching them can change them anyway and make them appear fashionable again!

, Avoid being a total clone, even in conservative workplaces. Find items that really express who you are and try to keep these as a usual addition to your wardrobe so that people treat it as your signature. For example, it might be silk scarves, a certain shape of glasses, particular ties, etc.

Know what scene is.,

Your clothes are next.,
Start going to concerts.,
Don't be rude!,
Don't label your music incorrectly either.,
Next is the hair.,

Play a sport.,
Read manga.",How to Go from Goth to Scene," Scene is a 2009 style which consists of brightly coloured skinny jeans, graphic band shirts, converse, wrist bands of all kinds and accessories of scarves, net gloves, comedy glasses, hair bands and so on. Scene is also an umbrella of genres such as metalcore, dubstep, deathcore, some alternative metal, and crunkcore.;
, You probably was listening to Bauhaus, Siouxsie and the Banshees, The Cure and other Goth bands before. If you want to be scene, a good portion of your music taste should be scenecore or fashioncore type bands. It is important to like this type of music. Some musical recommendations are Blood On The Dance Floor, Dot Dot Curve, Millionaires and any band that dresses in bright colours and generally makes a scene of themselves.

, If you use to wear black or red lipstick wear lip gloss or nothing at all. If your eye make up use to be black or grey start using pink eye shadow and black eyeliner. Blusher to make your cheeks a rosy colour is good too. Don't over load on the make-up.

, If you were wearing all black one minute and all bright colours then you're going to look like a poseur. This is not something you turn in to overnight. Black to bright colours is a big jump. Start buying some criminal damage jeans they could be green leopard print or pink leopard print with a black band shirt, you can also find new bands during this and buy a band shirt to go with it.

, You'll get to go to some concerts as you will have access to bands that are near you and more popular. The majority of Goth bands are underground or have broken up except for the odd few like The Cure, but when are they going to be touring around yours next? Don't be afraid to go to concerts that aren't scene. It just means you'll have a wider music taste and a more open mind.

, If you're rude people are going to get the impression that you're a wannabe or that all scenes are like that. It's bad enough if you make the transformation too soon and people see you as a poseur.

, Metalcore / Deathcore bands are not screamo and just because a band screams does not make them screamo.

, The hair is a big jump because it is your identity to scene. If your hair was a dark colour such as black or brown consider getting pink, red, green or blue streaks in it. If it was already a usual colour like turquoise or pink then great. It's your choice if you want to leave it like that. Don't go all full on rainbow back combed hair. In the next few months or so get it cut in to layers, start back combing and using hair spray. In the next few months you can start experimenting with different colours.

, Scene love social networking and socializing. Creative an account on Myspace and Facebook. Post pictures of yourself online. Don't edit them because then that's not you.

, If you don't want to do something, don't do it. Don't become scene because you want to meet ""hot scene guys"" either. This is entirely for your benefit so don't take advantage of this.

, There are a few things to understand. You may grow out of it. You will not be scene forever and a lot of people think that scene shows immaturity. Just as long as you're not typing or acting like a typical scene you'll be fine. Emo has nothing to do with scene. Emo is a set type of music called emotive hardcore which is a sub genre of hardcore punk and a fashion style of messenger bags and thick rimmed glasses. Don't let anyone call you emo.

, Some scenes enjoy a lot of sport. Try horse riding or archery.

, If you were reading Gothic novels like Dracula before then start reading manga and watching anime. If you don't like anime then don't. You don't have to stop reading Gothic literature either.

Remember, black is always in style.",How to Dress With Style," Dressing with style is about more than the clothing; it is about how you carry yourself. If you carry yourself with confidence, your fashion statement will be heard loud and clear. If you're uncomfortable in what you're wearing, it will show. After all, confidence is the best accessory one can wear., You can create a memorable trademark by accentuating the parts of your body or personality traits that you love about yourself. We all want to be remembered by something great, and creating your personal trademark is a great way to define yourself.


For example, if you're quirky and outgoing, make bright and unique jewelry your trademark.
If you love your naturally beautiful dark hair and tan skin, accentuate these features by making your trademark a deep red lip color.

, Your choice of clothing is a reflection of who you are, including what you're interested in, your inspirations, and your aspirations. The more connected you are to your personal style, the more confident you'll appear. Incorporating your favorite music, hobbies, and goals will help you truly connect with your style.


Say you're interested in metal bands. Incorporate your favorite band t-shirts into your wardrobe. Dress up your metal tee with your favorite jeans and heels for a stylish look that's completely you.
If you aspire to be a corporate CEO, dress the part! Incorporate power suits or sleek dresses into your weekly wardrobe. Dressing to your goals will bring our your inner confidence., Fashion is all around you, so look at how other people dress. Study what clothing they're wearing, what colors they're mixing, what shoes they pair with which accessories. When you see an outfit that you like, figure out why you like it. Is it the overall vibe of the look (e.g. preppy, hippy bohemian, rockstar inspired), is it the general color scheme of the outfit, or is it a specific piece (e.g. a great cut jacket, the perfect pair of jeans)?

, After all, imitation is the greatest form of flattery! Yes, developing a unique sense of style is important, but if you're a complete beginner, imitating others can be a extremely helpful. Find an outfit you love and copy it, then keep the parts of the outfit that work for you, and change the aspects of the outfit that don't.


If you've found an outfit you love, but the colors don't look good on you, find similar pieces in a more flattering color scheme.

, Create a Pinterest board of your ideal style, and pin your favorite looks to it. Study your board, and look for patterns of what you see as stylish, then figure out how to add that style to your look.


If you find yourself pinning a lot of preppy, nautical themed looks, it's evident that you're drawn to that style. Find your favorite pieces on your Pinterest board, and add them to your wardrobe. Study your Pinterest board for ideas how to style your new wardrobe.

, Read a variety of magazines, from Vogue to Cosmopolitan, to get a variety of looks and outfit concepts. Getting inspiration from high fashion and street fashion will help you discover what style means to you.


Spend some time scrolling through Instagram to find a few fashion bloggers you connect with. Once you've found a few bloggers you admire, study how they build outfits and where they shop to help you recreate their looks.

, Your style doesn't always have to follow trends, but paying attention to them will keep you knowledgeable about new fashion, and could give you some new ideas to revamp your wardrobe. Some trends you'll love, and others you'll hate. Don't feel pressured to follow any trends you don't like, but allow yourself to be inspired by the trends that you admire. Use trends as a tool to refresh your existing wardrobe.

, Discovering your personal style takes some experimenting; finding what you like, and what you don't like. Research by seeking out new styles, colors, and silhouettes that are outside your comfort zone. Once you've experimented, you'll be able to create your personal style based on what you've learned about your fashion likes and dislikes., We all have surface tones and undertones. Surface tones are how we typically describe our own complexions, and can be ivory, light, medium, tan, dark, etc. Your skin’s undertone is the color beneath the surface. The three different undertones are: Cool (pink, red or bluish undertones), Warm (yellow, peachy, golden undertones), Neutral (a mix of warm and cool undertones). There are a few different ways to determine your skin's undertone.


Check your veins to discover your undertone. Look at the veins on the inside of your wrist. If they're more blue, you likely have cool undertones. If they look greenish, you have warm undertones.
Use the jewelry trick to learn your undertone. Do you look more radiant in silver or gold? If you typically look better in silver, you have a cool undertone, whereas gold usually looks best on a warm undertone.
Determine how your skin reacts to the sun. Do you get a golden brown tan, or turn pinkish and burn in the sun? If you fit into the former, you’re warm-toned, while cool undertones tend to burn (fair-skin will simply burn, while medium-skinned undertones will burn, then tan.)

, If you have a warm undertone, you should lean toward yellows, oranges, browns, yellow-greens, ivories , and warm reds. If you have cool undertones, you should wear blues, greens, pinks, purples, blue-greens, magentas, and other blue-based reds., It is important to dress for your body type! Every body is different, and what looks great on one person may not look as good on another. Flattering your shape is a crucial part of looking and feeling confident with your personal style.


Triangle/Pear body shape: You have a slim upper body and waist, with curvy hips and legs. Wear bright colors, layers, and accessories on top to attract attention. Wear slimming, lengthening bottoms, such as skinny jeans or bootcut pants in darker colors. This will balance out your body beautifully.
Circle body shape: You have slim legs and shoulders, and a soft, round middle area. Covering your body in layers can make you look bigger. Instead, create a slimming effect by adding angles and lines across your figure with wrap dresses or asymmetrical hemlines. You should also try dresses with rushing in the middle to hide your tummy and create an hourglass effect. Try a straight leg or bootcut pant, and wear a heel to show off your legs.
Hourglass body shape: You have curvy breasts and hips, and a slim waist. Embrace your silhouette with snug fitting tops and bottoms. Wear tiny belts to accentuate your waist, and avoid excessive layering and draping. Skinny leg pants and pencil skirts are especially flattering, and show off your figure.
Athletic body shape: You have a naturally sporty shape, and appear more fit than curvy. Your body type can appear boxy with the wrong clothing, so try wearing delicate, feminine fabrics and shapes to compliment your figure. Tops with thin straps, light fabrics such as silk and lace, and high waisted or wide legged pants are flattering on you.
Inverted triangle shape: You have broad shoulders, a trim waist and hips, and nice legs. Amplify your lower body to match the fullness of your shoulders; wide-leg pants or long skirts can create balance. Simple and soft tops feminize your strong upper body.Men's fashion caters to a variety of body types as well. Like women's fashion, it is all about the balance. For example, If you have a smaller upper body, layer with sweaters or blazers.

, Once you find colors and shapes that work well for you, multiply! There's no need to question what works for you, just go with it. For example, if a particular dress looks amazing on you, buy it in a few colors. If you found your perfect pair of jeans, buy a few pairs., Though there are no set guidelines, certain styles are more appropriate for certain ages.


Your 20s are all about self-discovery. Whether you're a party animal, a business entrepreneur, or a free spirit, it's important to experiment with fashion to discover what style fits you best. Your 20s are the time to have fun with short dresses and bold jewelry, or wild bow-ties and ripped jeans.
In your 30s, your life is finally starting to fall into place. You're becoming comfortable being yourself, and aren't as worried about following the hottest new trends. Your 30s are the years of adding your touch of flair to wardrobe staples and classic pieces. You should have a few nice suits or dresses in your closet, and be able to dress them up with unique cuff links or one-of-a-kind pumps.
When you've reached your 40s, it's time to start pampering yourself. Spoil your closet with a beautiful gown or a nice cashmere sweater. As you mature, allow your closet to do the same.
You've made it to your 50s, meaning you've reached the age of fun and eccentric fashion! You've lived, you've learned, and now it's time to let your confidence shine through. Keep it comfortable with practical pieces, while accessorizing with bright sunglasses and costume jewelry.
You've experimented with fashion, and in your 60s you know what you love. It's time to let your statement pieces shine: a fur coat, a phenomenal handbag, and all of your diamonds., Whether you're into signature black pumps, a fun pair of flats, or a classic and simple sneaker, your go-to shoe should be well-designed, versatile, and timeless. Your classic shoe should go with almost everything, and always give you that sense of comfort and confidence.

, The little things are what make us unique. You don't need to wear your favorite lip color everyday, but a signature color can be the perfect accent to your personal style. Find a lip color that works for you and keep it constant in your makeup rotation.

, Invest in a handbag that will go with everything, but will never go out of style. Of course it's great to have multiple bags for different occasions, but a signature bag is your go-to. For men, find yourself a signature watch or wallet.

, Accessories and accents make the outfit, no matter how big or small. Whether it's a small charm bracelet you never take off, or a show-stopping pair of diamond earrings for special occasions, the right accessories will go a long way.


Don't over accessorize. Allow your accent pieces to shine, there's no need to load up on a lot of accessories.
The right necklace will transform a simple dress into a stylish look. The perfect hat will bring your t-shirt and jeans to life.

, Even if you're not a perfume girl, find a lotion or body wash that you absolutely love. If you're not big on cologne, choose a go-to deodorant or aftershave. This may seem insignificant, but a nice scent isn't a bad way to be remembered., Trends come and go, but the classic little black dress will never fade. When in doubt about colors, patterns, and/or prints, go with a gorgeous solid black. It looks good on everyone, but you can always make it your own."

You decide. Once you have a general idea of the clothes you like, give it a name. It doesn't have to simply be 'prep' or 'goth'. Those labels are limiting. You could go with 'feminine preppy grunge' or 'chic rocker'. Whatever fits you. You could even go with 'mod hippie gothic glam'. Whatever works!;
, Regardless of the style of each of these pieces, every girl needs...


At least 5 pairs of jeans (one light, two dark, and two ripped.)
Three skirts (one long, two short.)
One or two good pairs of leggings (can be lacy, striped with skulls, whatever you want! Solid black can help you attain the eye-catching style you're looking for!)
Many shirts (some casual t-shirts, two or three long-sleeved shirts, a few camis, and a tunic (cowl neck) or even a tube top - again - for that eye-catching look.)
One or two basic belts (either to trim down the appearance of your waist or... to keep your pants up! Sequenced or a piano pattern might look cool. Experiment!)
Lots of shoes (1 pair of converse, 1 or 2 pairs of boots (suede, leather, short, long), around 3 pairs of flip flops for the summer, and maybe 2 pairs of flats.)
A sweater (in a neutral color like black or gray or a color that goes with most everything in your wardrobe.)
A winter coat (a darker color - dark green, brown or black, can be long or short.)
A signature hat (optional.)
A cute dress to top it all off, for parties and special events!

, Forget expensive stores that charge more for the logo than the actual clothes. Ross and even thrift shops like Goodwill have tons of awesome clothes. Without searching for them, you can't find anything! You never know when you may end up with a fantastic deal. Don't forget these simple laws of fashion: You don't want to end up with tons of cute clothes that are completely incompatible with each other! So here they are:


Jeans go with everything except other jean pieces. Somehow, mixing jean vests with skinny jeans just doesn't look right.
A basic rule is matching a solid with a pattern. Nowadays you can wear two patterns together and pull it off. Just remember to keep the same color scheme going, with the patterns a different scale (small little flowers and small little skulls do not mix.)
Use neutral colors to balance out the bolder ones. Neutral colors are: black, white, brown, beige and navy.
Do not wear extremely baggy clothing (unless it's being balanced out by a tighter fitting piece), and do not wear so much clothing that you can hardly move! Make it comfy and it will work.
Do not wear the same outfit over and over again. That's why you've got the basics that were laid out to you earlier. Mix and match!
Accessories should be uniform and contain a piece (color, texture, pattern etc) uniting it all.

, You now know what your personal style is, you know what you need to get there and you know some fashion do's and don'ts. Soon enough you'll be the best dressed person in the room and everyone will be asking you where you got your stellar fashion sense from!

Consider getting your basics tailored.,
Add a jacket to dress up a shirt.,
Put on a cardigan for a more sophisticated look.,
Use a belt.",How to Dress Up Your Basics1," If you have a limited wardrobe, making sure your clothes fit really well can make them seem dressier. It can be cheaper to take well-made clothes you already have to a local tailor than to buy a higher class, better fitting wardrobe., One simple way to dress up a shirt is to pair it with a suit jacket. This simple step makes a plain button-up shirt or even a nice t-shirt into a dressed-up outfit that you can wear to work or even for a night out on the town.Similarly, adding a skirt or nice pants to a blouse will create a dressier look.

, A cardigan won't solve all your wardrobe problems. However, adding a cardigan over a classic black tank, for instance, can make the look much dressier. Button at least a few of the buttons for a classier look., A belt can act solely as an accessory, but it can also help you change up the look of your wardrobe. For instance, you can wear a skinny belt over a tight-fitting suit jacket or add one on top of a dress to create a waistline. Doing so can make your look more polished and put-together.For guys, a belt can help tie a look together, so pick one that is classic and sophisticated, such as a leather belt in black or brown.

Get a short cut.,
Go for a medium-length cut.,
Grow your hair long.",How to Get the Right Haircut1," If you have a round face and want to go short, you should go very short. Get a pixie cut with spikey layers. This will downplay the roundness of your face by adding height and emphasizing your eyes. If you have straight, fine hair this will work wonders. Stay away from it if you have curly hair.;
, If you want a medium cut, go for a long bob. It should reach down to your collarbone and finish off with wispy layers. This length is a great cut to give you a face-slimming effect. If you plan on wearing it curly, cut it a few inches longer than your collarbone., If you prefer longer hair, you can easily make your hair seem fuller which makes your face seem slimmer. For this look, use layers that begin at the jawline. Use long layers to bring focus to the ends of your hair. This is a great hair cut fine hair because it helps it look voluminous rather than stringy.


Use a center part. For girls with a round face, a center part is always a good idea. Paired with your long layers and soft curls, your eyes will become the immediate focus for anyone who looks your way."

Specifically, the catalogs that come out from January through March are specifically tailored for Spring fashion.;
, Magazines like GQ, Vogue, and Cosmo are generally considered ""taste makers."" They are in touch with the big clothing designers and often feature reviews of runway shows.

Choose statement jewelry.,
Pick a scarf to add pizzazz.,
Add a well-made handbag.,
Wear a classy shoe.,
Don't go overboard.",How to Dress Up Your Basics2," One easy way to dress up basic pieces is to choose jewelry that adds a pop of color to your outfit. You could try a big chunky necklace in a bright color, for instance, to dress up a plain top. Alternatively, you could pick some sparkly earrings to make a statement with a dress.Bangle bracelets or dainty metallic bracelets can also elevate an outfit, depending on the occasion.For a guy, consider adding a snazzy tie clip or a fancy watch.

, In the winter, a thick blanket scarf can turn a boring outfit into something much more interesting and sophisticated. Try plaid with neutrals or a soft grey to break up a black outfit. In the summer, a lightweight shimmery scarf can add a touch of interest.In the winter, you can also add fancy gloves for a dressier outdoor outfit.For guys, a well-made classic wool scarf can add sophistication, while a tie in a subtle pattern can add a bit of flair.

, A well-made handbag can make any outfit dressier. If you pick something that fits the style of what you're wearing, it can elevate the outfit. The opposite is also true. If you wear the same sloppy handbag with every outfit, it can bring it down. You don't need hundreds of bags, but try having two or three nice bags that go with most of your outfits.You don't have to spend a fortune on a name-brand bag. However, spending a little bit more than you normally would will give you a bag that will last longer. Look for good materials, a nice lining, and well-made seams.
Choose at least one bag that can add some color to your wardrobe, and pick another for its ability to blend in well (think: neutral or black).
For a guy, pick a stylish bag that will go with most of your looks. Leather is a classic choice, and you can get an upscale messenger bag or more classic briefcase.

, Having a few stylish shoes on hand is a great way to dress up your wardrobe. For instance, a pair of classy heels (such as black stilettos) can take a suit up a level. Similarly, a pair of leather boots can turn an average dress into something dressier and edgier. A pair of wing-tipped shoes can turn an average suit into something much snazzier.Once you find shoes you love (that are of decent quality), consider getting them resoled when they wear out. You'll give them a new life!

, While it can be tempting to add a big necklace, big sparkly earrings, a large scarf, and a bright watch, adding too much can push your outfit over the edge. Aim for one large statement piece, and keep your other accessories more subdued.The same goes for guys. If you wear a flashy tie, lighten up on the fancy jewelry and vice versa.

Keep it short.,
Add some length.,
Style it long.",How to Get the Right Haircut2," With a long or oval face, go for an angular bob. You should have short, chin-hugging layers to emphasize your face shape. Use graphic angles in your bob with choppy layers to add fun to your style.If you have very curly hair, you can still pull off this look very well. Simply make sure you cut it a bit longer so that the curls have some weight to keep the shape of your cut.

, If you aren’t comfortable with the bob, go for a sleek look. Use subtle layers and end your haircut at your shoulders. If you have thin hair, cut some uneven shorter layers around your face so that your hair looks as full as possible.


Create body on the sides of your face with curls and waves. Avoid excess volume on the top., If you want long hair and have a long or oval shaped face, keep it as long as you’d like but add some side-swept bangs. Long strains paired with this retro texture will shorten your long face. When you get this haircut, be prepared to blow dry your bangs to keep the right shape."
"
Cut it short.,
Keep it in the middle.,
Grow it out.",How to Get the Right Haircut3," A short, layered bob is a great cut for a square face. This will emphasize your cheekbones, rather than your jawline. Use subtle side bangs to help pull the focus up.Use a flat iron to style this look if you have thick hair.

, Cut your hair just below your shoulders. Use light layers all around the ends to camouflage your strong chin. Part your hair on the side to offset a square face and cut some sweeping bangs that flow to the side.

, If you want long hair that complements your square face, go for a look with collarbone-skimming strands and bangs that hit at the cheekbones. You don’t want a long style with harsh ends if you have a square face. Scattering your layers will soften your face.If you have fine hair, keep the layers to a minimum, but still start them near your collarbone.

Be bright and bold with your colors.,
Try out vibrant patterns, like stripes or floral designs.,
Show a little skin.,
Mix up your accessories.,
Keep it retro.",How to Find Spring Fashion Trends2," Spring is when the sun comes back out and the flowers are in bloom, and spring fashion follows nature. Bright colors like yellow, pink, green, and blue usually burst onto the scene in spring.Pastels, which are soft but bright colors frequently found around Easter, are good picks for spring fashion.

, Floral prints are huge during the spring, but so are stripes and seersucker for guys. A bold, stand-out pattern draws eyes to you and feels like a breath of fresh air after the muted, subtle colors of winter.

, Half the fun of warmer weather is getting to peal off winter layers. Bare shoulders, shorts, and bare arms are all signs that spring is on the way, and they frequently work their way into spring fashion.

, Flowers, straw hats, and bright jewelry are big in the spring. While there are not a whole lot of specific accessories that work, you should play around with combinations that feel fun, sunny, and light.

, Every season, a specific decade comes back around to become the big fashion hit. For 2015, that decade is the 1970s, so try incorporating some disco era into your outfit. Try out subtle touches like big, retro lapels, bright color combos, denim, and big, almost-but-not-quite bell bottoms."

Take inventory of all the clothing you currently have.,
Examine the clothing you like.,
Examine the clothing you do not like.,
Examine the remaining clothing.,
Donate clothing you do not want if it is in good shape.,
Throw away clothes that have seen better days.,
Take inventory of your jewelry.",How to Enjoy Fashion1," Separate the clothes you like from the clothes you do not like.;
, Look for similarities and ask yourself why you like each piece. You may like the way it flatters your shape, or maybe you like it because of the material or pattern. Mark these reasons down on a list so you know what to look for later on.

, Ask yourself if there are any pieces that have unfulfilled potential, like a tailor-fit blazer in a bland color or dress trousers that need to be hemmed up. Return these pieces to your closet or dresser.

, Theoretically, you should be left with clothes that do not flatter you and clothes that follow tired trends. Make a second list of all the attributes you do not like so you know what not to look for when you go shopping.

, You can give it away to a relative or close friend, or you can take it to a secondhand shop or charity.

, If your garments have stains or rips, toss them out.

, Keep pieces that you like and, depending on the quality, either donate or dispose of pieces you hate.

"
"
Buy a little at a time.,
Build a sturdy fashion foundation.,
Limit your trends.,
Add some inexpensive flair with accessories.",How to Enjoy Fashion2," Instead of redoing your entire wardrobe in one weekend, slowly introduce one or two new pieces with each shopping trip. Doing so will be easier on both your budget and your patience.

, Stock up on denim jeans, button-down shirts, fitted t-shirts, dress trousers, basic skirts, and any other wardrobe essential you can think of. Look for neutral colors like white, black, gray, brown, and beige. While these pieces look bland on their own, you can easily build on them to create fun, fashionable outfits.

, Fads change every season, and if you stock up on too many, you may find yourself needing to clear out your wardrobe again by next year.

, Updating your accessory wardrobe often proves easier and less costly than updating your clothes. Accessories can also be a lot of fun to pick out and match together. Look for jewelry, hats, scarves, belts, purses, and shoes. Never buy more than you could ever use, but do not shy away from variety, either.

Wear clothes that fit right.,
Know your body shape.,
Mask your problem areas.,
Take advantage of flatness.,
Highlight your positive features.,
Work with your height.,
Wear hues that suit your coloring.,
Keep things lively but not busy.,
Understand the effect of patterns and embellishments.",How to Enjoy Fashion3," Avoid baggy clothes, since these tend to look frumpy and may make you look unnecessarily heavy. Also avoid clingy clothes, since these tend to hug your body in the wrong places and may accentuate extra weight.

, Once you know your body shape, you can focus on finding pieces that flatter your figure best. The five general body shapes are hourglass, pear, inverted triangle, apple, and rectangle.


Hourglass figures have a narrow waist and equally large hips and bust.
Pear figures have a flat chest and stomach but large hips and thighs.
Inverted triangle shapes have a large bust and shoulders with a flat midsection and narrow hips.
Apple shapes have a large midsection and may have a moderate to large bust, but they generally have smaller hips and thighs.
Rectangle figures have relatively equal, flat proportions all throughout their body.

, If you have a large midsection, hide it beneath a free-flowing tunic shirt. If you have wide hips, balance them out with an A-line skirt that flares out at the knee. Look for pieces that draw the eye away from your wider portions.

, You may think that a small bust or narrow hips make you look childish and not womanly, but these attributes allow you a little more freedom than women who are better endowed in these areas. Dress up flat portions of your body with ruffles and embellishments. Play with deep necklines or high hemlines, depending on where your flatness lies.

, Show off slender legs with a short skirt or a narrow waist with a thick fashion belt. By drawing the eye to portions of your body that please you, you can keep the eye off any problem areas.

, Women of petite or average height may want to make themselves taller by wearing high heels and vertical details, but tall women who are self-conscious about their height should avoid styles that create the illusion of extra height. Generally, any detail that draws the eye up and down, rather than side to side, will add height.

, Your skin tone has the biggest impact on your coloring. Women with pink or blue undertones usually have ""cool"" coloring, while women with yellow undertones usually have ""warm"" coloring.


If you have cool coloring, look for silver, white, black, grays, blues, deep violets, blue-greens, and pinks.
If you have warm coloring, look for gold, cream, tan, browns, reds, magenta purples, yellow-greens, and oranges.
Note that eye color and hair color also have some impact on your coloring. You may have a warm skin tone, but if you have black hair and ice blue eyes, you may have cool coloring overall. Play with color when you go out shopping to determine which hues liven up your appearance best.

, A few patterns and embellishments can turn an outfit from “blah” to “fantastic,” but too much will look mismatched. Stick with one pattern or heavily embellished piece at a time, and pair it with basic neutrals.

, These elements draw the eye to them, highlighting the part of your body they cover. As such, if you feel self-conscious about a portion of your body, such as your hips, you should keep patterns and detailing off this portion.

Think about theme.,
Find a pattern you love.,
Pick a favorite color.,
Gravitate toward a flattering garment.,
Walk proudly with the right footwear.,
Consider your accessory style.",How to Enjoy Fashion4," For instance, you may find vintage styles appealing. In that case, look for vintage accessories like brooches and hats, and dig through thrift stores and online auction websites for trendy vintage-inspired pieces. Incorporate a few pieces of your chosen theme into your modern wardrobe to put a personalized twist on your style.

, Perhaps you’ve always nursed a secret fondness for polka dots. As long as the pattern flatters your figure, look for dresses, tops, and skirts in various polka dot prints. Throw in a few accessories with the print as well, like a purse or belt. Do not over-saturate your wardrobe with your chosen pattern, but use it more than you use any other print. Just make sure you have a strong stock of solid colored pieces to make a bold print with.

, If you have beautiful green eyes, for example, gravitate towards greens that really bring out the color of your eyes, or reds that act as a complement to your shade of green. Look for tops, bottoms, and accessories in this color. Again, you should avoid over-saturating your entire wardrobe with one color, but do not be afraid of favoring one color a little more than any other.

, If empire-waisted sundresses create a flattering silhouette and you love the way they look and feel, stock up on them. You may not be able to wear your chosen garment for every occasion, but you can likely take full advantage of it in your casual weekend clothes.

, Some women love heels, while others prefer flats, boots, or sandals. Maybe you feel especially confident in brightly colored, two-inch stiletto heels. Whatever your favorite footwear is, wear it as often as you can get away with. Some styles may not work depending on the season—for instance, boots do not usually work for summer, and sandals do not usually work for winter—and others may not be appropriate for work or formal occasions. For casual dress, however, feel free to have a little fun with your footwear.

, Accessories can be an easy way to incorporate a trademark. You can choose a general accessory trademark, such as dangling hoop earrings, faux pearls, or a certain colored gemstone. Alternatively, you can opt for something more specific, like a special flower that holds personal significance to you. If you love roses, for example, look for rose stud earrings, rose pendants, and rose print scarves.

Research the company’s “dress code.” Finding out what employees in the company wear before your job interview will show that you researched the job.,
Wear something conservative.,
Wear something that makes you feel confident.,
Make sure that your shoes match the outfit.,
Make sure you’re neatly groomed.,
Have at least two different outfits.",How to Dress to Impress1," It will also make you appear as if you'll fit into the work environment.You can check with the human resources department. They can let you know if there is a dress code and if there isn't ask them what people typically wear to work.
One of the best things you can do is meet an employee from the company. Not only can you get a sense of the work environment and not just what people wear. It will give you an edge when you're at the interview.;
, You want to show that you take the job interview seriously. Even if the workplace tends towards jeans and t-shirts, you still want to dress up. You don't have to wear a suit, but should go for something conservative.For example: if you're interviewing for an office job you should probably dress up in a pantsuit or dress suit.
If you're interviewing for something a little more unusual, wear something a little nicer than you normally would. For example: if you're a woman interviewing for a job at a coffee shop, wear a skirt and a nice top (like a sweater); if you're a guy you might wear a pair of nice slacks and a sweater or button down shirt.

, It's important that you boost your confidence when you're going to an interview because this will make you come across better in the interview. Of course make sure that you strike a balance between something that makes you feel confident and what looks professional.


Check that you don’t have to adjust your clothing (like tugging at your skirt, etc.) and that your clothes don’t ride up inappropriately when you sit down.
You should definitely have worn this outfit before, if only to get comfortable in it. Wearing it for the first time when you go to get interviewed will mean that you'll feel and look ill at ease.

, While your interviewer might not notice if your shoes work with the outfit, they will definitely notice if the shoes look out of place or scruffy. Make sure that your shoes are cleaned and shined and match what you're wearing.Shoes that are scuffed or scruffy-looking, or dirty are a definite don't. You also want to make sure that your shoes aren't massively uncomfortable, because that will translate into discomfort during the interview.
For women, some good ideas for interview shoes are power flats (something clean and professional looking; nothing sparkly or out there), or low, comfortable heels. You don't want heels that make you tower over everyone or that you might wear for a night out clubbing. It makes you look irresponsible.
For men, you should go for a pair of loafers or dress shoes as your interview shoes. Make sure, of course, that they aren't scruffy looking and that they are clean and match what you're wearing (no brown with black, for example).

, When you look like you've just tumbled out of bed, or haven't washed in over a week, you're signalling to the interviewer that you're careless (even if you aren't).


Grooming shows that you care about your professional appearance, which tells the interviewer that you are going to care how you appear as a member of their organization.
Make sure that your hair and make-up is appropriate for company. It's best for an interview to keep it subtle. Don't slather on a ton of make-up (the ""natural"" look is best, unless it's for an interview at a department or make-up store). Make sure your hair looks clean and tamed, as much as possible.

, This is one that a lot of people forget to do. You might be called back for a second interview and you don't want to have to wear the same outfit. Even if the base is the same for both outfits, you want to distinguish them from each other.


For example, you might wear the same black dress slacks and dress shoes, but a different button-down shirt and tie.

Go for a casual but feminine look.,

Pick the right shoes.,
Add chic accessories.,
Prep your skin.,
See if you want to shave or remove body hair.,

Pick out underwear to go with your outfit.",How to Dress up Like a Girl," Most girls don’t get up every day and spend two hours dressing up. There are plenty of options for those casual days when you want to be comfortable but still look fresh and put together. Now’s the time to break out your layering skills and try out some of the trendy accessories you have in the back of your closet.


A great basic look for everyday wear is a dressier take on your classic jeans and a t-shirt look. Put on some dark wash skinny jeans, a well-made top, and a leather jacket or blazer. Slip on some wedges, bangles and dangly earrings. If it’s a windy day, accent the look with a scarf.
In a cold day, try the New York girl outfit. Let your hair down or curl it, put on a stylish fitted jacket, and wear a skirt with some brown or black boots.;
, For the days when you just want to look as girly as possible, nothing but pastel clothes and sparkly accessories will do. Pick out a dress or top in pastel tones, and accent with a pair of sparkly flats. Just remember not to go overboard by wearing all of the cute accessories you own at once. Choose a few items that will make you look feminine, but not babyish.


Try a simple flower print or pastel or bright colored dress that falls just above the knee. Wear it with flats and a sunhat.
Wearing hair accessories is a great way to add some girliness to your look. Try a barrette in the shape of a bow, or a headband with a flower accent on top.

, If your style is sleek and urban, look for muted colors that create a streamlined look. Look for comfortable fabrics in interesting cuts, and pair your clothes with sunglasses and simple, understated accessories. This style is perfect for the office or just walking around town with your girlfriends.


You can’t go wrong with a little black dress, riding boots and a wool cardigan on chilly days that require an elegant look. A tunic over leggings is another great look that’s elegant but comfortable at the same time.
In the summer, try maxi dresses and skirts paired with wayfarer-style sunglasses and hoop earrings.

, Girls have more options than guys when it comes to dressing to the nines for a big event like a wedding or cocktail party. Now’s the time to break out that dress with sequins you’ve been waiting to wear, spend extra time on your hair and makeup, and wear your classiest accessories. Go for a look that’s stunning, yet appropriate for the event you’re attending.


For special occasions, you might consider getting your hair done at a salon. A classic updo is a nice touch for a wedding. In summertime, you might opt to decorate your hair with a flower as well.
To accessorize for a special occasion, choose your best jewelry and make sure it matches. For example, you could wear diamond stud earrings and a diamond necklace.

, There’s no one way to dress up like a girl - it’s all about finding the style that works best for you. Experiment with different cuts, colors, and combinations and start picking out clothes that make you look good and feel comfortable at the same time. If you need inspiration, look in fashion magazines and read style blogs. Decide which outfits speak to you, and work on recreating them in your own wardrobe.


Start with a good set of basics. Fill your closet with dresses, skirts, pants and tops that you know you’ll enjoy wearing. Every item you buy should match at least three items in your closet.
Make sure your clothes fit well. Buy clothes in your size, rather than aspirationally sizing down or getting baggy clothes to try to hide something. You’ll look your best if your clothes fit your figure. And don’t be afraid to buy clothes that show off your body, like a cute crop top or a pair of tight-fitting jeans.
When you’re trying to decide what to wear, try picking just one item to be your muse, and work from there. For example, maybe you have a beautiful pencil skirt and you’re not sure what to do with it. Add a cotton tee and a set of pearls, and you have the perfect outfit for an afternoon lunch. Switch out the tee for a silk blouse and blazer, and you’re ready for a business meeting. Work with your favorite items in your closet to create amazing outfits.
Wear outfits that make you feel confident. Take a look in the mirror and think about the occasion. What is best outfit in your closet to convey confidence for this occasion?

, Layering clothes is a way to look chic and polished every time you dress up. You can mix and match different items from your wardrobe and come up with endless new outfits using just a few pieces. Layering adds interest and depth to an outfit, preventing it from looking too boring. Try these layering techniques to dress up your basic outfits:


Wear a jacket or blazer over a t-shirt or blouse with jeans, or wear it over a dress.
Wear a vest over a long-sleeved shirt, or wear it over a cap-sleeved blouse.
Layer a miniskirt over tights or leggings.
Layer a button-down shirt over a tank or t-shirt. Roll up the sleeves and knot the front.

, When you’re picking out colors to wear, go beyond the basic matching techniques you learned as a child. Sure, a red dress and red heels seem to go together, but there’s nothing very interesting about a basic matching outfit. Be a little bold and pick colors that heighten each other and make your outfit look interesting instead of bland.


Wear colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel. For example, try wearing orange and blue together, or purple and yellow. These complementary colors will make your outfit pop.
Wear colors that are on trend for the season. Every season, a new palette of colors hits the stores. If you’re not sure what they are, go to the mall and check out the new colors from this season’s clothing and see which colors are styled together. Incorporate a few trendy new colors in your wardrobe.
Mix prints with like colors. For example, you could wear a lavender-striped top with a skirt that has a floral pattern including lavender and other colors. Use one print to play up the colors in another print.
Go monochrome when you’re feeling bold. Wearing an all-black or all-red outfit will make a bold statement. When you do this, try wearing nude accessories, like camel-colored shoes and a nude lipstick.

, The shoes you wear can make or break your outfit, so put a little time into choosing the right pair. A girl can’t go wrong with heels to complement a dress or add extra style to a casual outfit like jeans and a t-shirt. But just because you want to dress up like a girl doesn’t mean you have to wear heels! Try wedges or classy flats, which go well with almost any outfit.


Wear shoes that match the season, like close-toed suede pumps for winter and open-toed canvas wedges for summer. Cute wedges go with any outfit, especially if they're denim or floral print or a solid black or white color.
If you prefer a more casual look, wear a cute pair of plain white tennis shoes with shorts, skirts and even dresses.
Don’t sacrifice comfort for style. Practice walking in new shoes, especially heels, before you wear them out. If you can’t walk around in those four-inch heels, don’t wear them! You won’t look stylish if you’re falling down.

, Accessorizing adds an important feminine touch to any outfit. Once you know what you’re going to wear, figure out how to make it look even more stylish by adding a few perfect accessories, like a pair of brilliant earrings or a thin belt around your waist. It’s a chance to show off your personality and have a little fun. Knowing a few basic rules for accessorizing will help you look your best:


Don’t wear too many at once. Choose just a few pretty accessories that really enhance your outfit instead of making it look cluttered. If you're wearing a plain top, try wearing some flashy earrings, a big statement necklace, or bright bangles. Do not wear all three!
Wear accessories that accent a color in your outfit. For example, if your dress has flecks of red in the pattern, wear red earrings or a red bracelet.
Use accessories to add personality to a plain outfit. You could dress up a plain blouse with an interesting scarf, several loose necklaces, or long beaded earrings and a chunky bracelet.
A belt around the midsection has a thinning effect that makes even the tiniest of girls look like they have some curve.
Spend your money on classic accessories that never go out of style, like sterling silver hoops. Trendier accessories like cat-eye glasses or wide belts should be purchased on sale, since they might be out of style by next season.
Nail polish, tattoos, an umbrella, glasses, bags and other items can all act as unexpected accessories.

, You’ll feel better in your clothes and more dressed up if you take time to make your skin look clean and fresh. Wash your face with the right cleanser for your skin type, be it oily or dry, first thing in the morning. A few times a week, do a deep-cleaning routine that will give your skin a healthy glow, an essential part of any girl’s dressed-up look. Here’s what to try:


Exfoliate your skin. On your face, use a gentle exfoliating cleanser. You can use a body scrub on your arms and legs as well.
Use a facial mask to give your skin a healthy glow before you even put makeup on. Masks draw oils from the skin and tighten pores.
Moisturize your skin. Use a moisturizing cream on your face and slather lotion on the rest of your body to keep your skin smooth.

, There’s no rule saying that girls have to remove hair from their bodies. Some girls do it, and others don’t; you can dress up like a girl either way. Hair removal gives a smooth appearance to legs, armpits and other parts of the body, but it takes time and the process isn’t always comfortable. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Lots of girls shave their legs, armpits, and other areas using a razor. Doing it several times a week makes upkeep easier than just doing it every once in a while, giving the hair a chance to fully grow back.
You can remove hair from your face by plucking with tweezers, shaving, or bleach it instead so it doesn’t appear as dark.
There are other options aside from shaving, like waxing or getting electrolysis.

, While plenty of girls go natural, preferring the look of bare skin, experimenting with makeup can be a fun part of dressing like a girl. Choose from a rainbow of colors to highlight your eyes, play up your cheekbones and add a pout to your lips. No matter what outfit you put on, you’ll look instantly dressed up with makeup on.


Start with foundation that matches the tone of your skin. You can use it to hide blemishes and create a smooth appearance.
Make your eyes pop with eyeliner, mascara and eyeshadow. If your color of eyes is a very electric blue or a chocolatey brown, try bringing out its color with the right shades of blush. For blue eyes, try a light shade of blue with gray and some blue on your water line. For brown eyes, try a warm smokey eye.
Brighten your cheeks and lips with blush and lipstick that don’t clash.
For a subtle, natural look, keep your makeup not-too-showy without eyeliner and wear a nude lipstick in a sophisticated shades.
If your skin tends to look a little dull, try illuminator under the eyes to help it look less matte in appearance.
If you do not know how to apply makeup, go to the makeup counter at a department store and let a makeup artist show you. They will speak with you about your skin type and coloring, as well as how to give yourself daytime, evening, extreme, and even ""no makeup"" looks, and the service is free.

, If you like to smell good wherever you go, like many girls do, pick out a few different perfumes or just one signature scent to put on when want to get dressed up. Dab it behind your ears, on your neck and on your wrists so it gently trails behind you as you go about your day, adding a little flair to your outfit. Just be careful not to use too much, since perfumes can be overpowering.


Don’t wear too many different scents at once. If you have a strong-smelling deodorant, lotion, ‘’and’’ perfume on all at the same time, you might not smell as good as you think.
Perfume can be really expensive, so try making your own by mixing a few essential oils such as rose, lily or cedarwood with water. Pour it into a spray bottle and you’ve got your own eau de toilette.

, Whether your hair is long or short, curly or straight, spend some time styling it when you want to dress up. Use products that work well with your hair texture and make it look healthy and shiny. You can try a unique style or simple comb it, add a few curls and set the style with some hairspray. If you want to try something a little fancier, consider the following:



Braid it. Try a fishtail or French braid if you want a pretty updo you can wear to a special event.

Straighten it or curl it, depending on which look you like best.
Use barrettes, headbands, ribbons, clips or bows to add some color and interest to your hair.
Extensions and wigs are fun to try if you want a look completely different from your natural hair.

, When you’re getting dressed up, what you wear under your clothes can make your outfit look more pulled together. Comfort is important, but you should also pick out underwear that will enhance your shape and be invisible through your clothes. For example, if you’re wearing a strapless dress, you’ll need a bra without straps as well. Here are a few things to keep in mind:


Wear a bra that fits well and helps your clothes look better, too. For example, if you want to wear a cute fitted t-shirt, pick out a bra made from smooth material so the seams won’t show through the t-shirt fabric.
Wear underwear in a color that can’t be seen through your clothes. For example, if you’re wearing a white skirt, choose underwear in nude.
Other undergarments can also enhance an outfit. Consider wearing panty hose, shapewear, fancy lingerie or anything else you want to feel more dressed up.

Casual tailored clothing, like you find at The Gap, J Crew or Banana Republic is a good place to start looking. Better yet, find some small designer fashion shops in your local urban neighborhood.;
, V-necks are popular. This is common to both the hipster and yuppie styles; however, yuppies usually wear softer, more expensive brands.

, Men should choose tailored, slim fit jeans, while women opt for skinny jeans in crops or full-length. Jeans are some of the most expensive items in the wardrobe, from brands where they are hand-dyed and made with high-quality denim.

, They will be valuable in your professional life. Start collecting, and don’t be afraid to try some contrasting colored lapels or new designs, since they will get you noticed in the office.

, Male yuppies will find a lot of value in one or two slim fit suits. Consider adding in a waistcoat, cufflinks, a bow tie or a skinny tie to be even more stylish.

, Female yuppies look stylish in pencil skirts, peplum tops, shirtdresses and other classic styles. Tapered skirts are preferred to A-line varieties.

, A yuppie stops buying low quality and aims to invest in pairs of boots or shoes that can be worn and cared for. Although leather is the most common investment, vegan leather shoes in high quality brands are also an option.

, The bedhead look of the early 20s is over, and regular stylish haircuts are essential for both men and women. This attention to appearance is as important at the office as it is on the social scene.

, Borrowing from the hipster scene, men and women alike wear scarves over simple shirts, thermals, and button downs. Women can use them for dresses as well.

, Leather coats are back in style, although they should be short and lack shoulder pads. Winter coats in felt and down and spring jackets in tweed are also popular.


If you enjoy the outdoors, invest in coats from Pendleton, Patagonia or Woolriches, which are known as western high-class, but practical brands.

, A $100 to $200 pair of sunglasses shows off success in the same way a watch used to.

, Yuppies today stay on top of the newest technological trends. Headphones and Bluetooth accessories are also common to the yuppie crowd.

, Men can go with a leather or canvas messenger bag. Women often choose a designer brand, like coach, Sophie Hulmes, Michael Kors or Chloe show off wealth, although they might cost as much as a whole paycheck.

, Fancy coffees and teas indicate disposable income. If you are able to buy one in the morning and afternoon, you show your desire to invest in artisan food."

Dress for the occasion.,
Wear something you feel comfortable in.,
Flatter your best features.,
Enhance your normal style.,
Avoid some outfit blunders.",How to Dress to Impress2," There's no ""one first date outfit fits all"" unfortunately. You'll need to consider what you're doing for the first date. What you might wear for dinner at a fancy restaurant is going to be quite different from what you might wear for a hike and picnic.For men, if it's a more casual date (going for coffee, or something) you might wear clean jeans that are in good repair (no holes) and a nice button-down or sweater. For a more formal occasion, you might wear dress slacks in black or charcoal and a dress shirt. You could also add a tie or vest.
For women, good casual date apparel would be your nicest pair of jeans and a nice shirt, or a skirt and nice sweater. For a more formal date you might wear a nice black dress, with nice shoes, and some jewelry. It's good to check the more formal place to see what their dress code is so that you don't over or under dress.

, No, this doesn't mean, wear your rattiest t-shirt and sweatpants. You are trying to impress your date. What it means is that you wear things that you feel comfortable in, because if you don't your uncomfortableness will translate to your date.


Avoid wearing something you've never worn before, especially if it's a new trend you're trying. You might end up fixing your dress the entire night, or really wishing you hadn't worn those new shoes.
It's a good idea to wear something that you'd normally wear (even if it is a little dressier than usual) so your date doesn't expect you to keep wearing something that isn't you if you date for a while.

, This may seem like a no-brainer, but it's very important. You want to make sure that your date sees the best parts of you. Your clothes should hide and enhance. If you need to, get help from a friend.Your best features could be your eyes, in which case you would want to wear something to bring them out. For example: if you have beautiful green eyes, wear a sweater in the same shade to make them more obvious.
It's a good idea to stick to one thing, rather than trying to show off all your assets. For example: you might wear a skirt that shows off your lovely legs while wearing a sweater on top to cover up your chest.

, It's important that you don't completely change your style when you're going on a date and looking to impress. You're going to create expectations that it's going to be hard to fulfill, which will disappoint the other person and could ultimately hurt you.


For example: if you're typical outfit is jeans and a t-shirt, you're going to want to wear something along those lines. Opt for a long-sleeved shirt, or a button down and sweater and make sure that the trousers you pick (even if they're jeans) are hole-free and fit well.
Obviously, this doesn't apply to more formal occasions since most people don't typically dress who they dress for a formal occasion. Still, even then you want to preserve your natural style (so don't wear heels if you never wear heels, for example).

, There are some things you just shouldn't do when you're trying to impress someone in a date. Avoiding these things will go a long ways towards impressing your date.Khakis are a big no. They're perfectly fine for day-to-day use, but they simply don't appear dressy enough for impressing your date.
Flipflops are too casual for a date and they won't impress. Sandals are fine if it's hot, or if you're having a date at the beach, but ditch the flipflops.
Overloading on scent is not going to win you any favors, whether it's perfume, cologne, or body spray. A couple spritzes are really all you need. You're not trying to overwhelm your date with scent.

Find out how formal the event is.,
Familiarize yourself with the different terms.,
Have the right footwear.,
Break out the accessories.",How to Dress to Impress3," There are lots of different terminology for formal occasions and you'll need to know where the event falls to know how to dress. Check with the party organizers, because being overdressed typically won't impress people.Formal and semi-formal are quite different. For a more formal occasion you'd need to wear a tuxedo whereas semi-formal would allow a dark suit instead.
An event that's at night is going to be different than an event that happens in the day. For example: if it's a semi-formal during the day cocktail dresses, or a light-colored suit and tie combination will be what you'd wear.

, There are a variety of different formal and semi-formal occasions where you'll need to know what the best outfit might be, if you want to impress. Evening drinks parties, weddings, even birthdays can be a formal event!Formal events require that men sport a complete suit. This means tie, cufflinks. Some of the trendier cities have formal events where it's allowable to come wearing a suit bit no tie. For women, formal events can be a little vague. You can do a cocktail dress, a stylish suit, or a full-on evening gown.
Black tie for men means black tailcoat, black trousers with two satin seams on the outside legs, a white bow tie, with black or gold cull links and studs. Again, for women you can vary it between cocktail dress, suit, or evening gown.
A cocktail party (like an early evening drinks party) means for men a dark suit. Since this is less formal you have more room for creativity (different colored dress shirts and ties and so on). For women it means cocktail dresses (these are less formal than full length evening gowns).

, You want your footwear to go with your outfit and to enhance your outfit. Fortunately for formal occasions unlike, say, interviews, this is when you can break out the more exciting and fun types of shoes.


Heels are always appropriate for dress occasions, as long as you can walk in them. Shoes that are sparkly can be a lot of fun and give you a bit of a sparkle.
In most formal occasions dress shoes for guys are a must. Make sure that they aren't scuffed or dirty and that they go with your outfit.

, Accessories were made to enliven and individualize your outfit. Make sure that you're not overloading your outfit. The right balance is different for everyone and for different occasions, but you'll need to avoid too many accessories.


Purses and jewelry can be great additions to your outfit. Make sure that they match what you're wearing. For example: if you're wearing a red dress, you can match it with gold jewelry and a gold purse, or black jewelry and a black purse, and so on.
Make-up can also enhance an outfit. For evening, or formal wear you may want to try out something a little more dramatic than the typical smokey eye or natural make-up.
Cuff-links and tie pins can be great additions to a man's outfit. If you have a date, try to match their color scheme with your accessories.

Lay the wristwatch on a table.,
Hold the watch face up in your left hand.,
Pull out the watch’s stem.,
Wind the watch’s stem.,
Return the watch to its normal state.",How to Wind a Watch1," Remove the wristwatch from your arm or storage. If you wind a watch while it is on the arm, with the watch tight against the skin, the winding motion may not be effective.









Winding a watch while attached to your arm places strain on the mechanics in the watch because of the angle on your arm and the stem.
Locate the stem, which will be pulled out to wind the watch. The stem is a small dial on the side of the watch.;
, Reverse the position, if you are left-handed. The stem may have several settings, including settings for time, calendar, alarm, or time zone. The settings are located at little ""clicks"" as you pull the stem out or push it in. Use trial and error to feel the clicks and identify the winding position.








, Use your thumb and index finger to carefully pull out the watch stem by the stem's top or ""crown."" This can be difficult because you do not want to over-wind the mechanism.







, You should wind the watch clockwise until you feel resistance. Be conservative and don’t keep turning once you feel resistance. You can damage the watch if you continue to wind the stem past resistance. In time, you will develop a feel for the resistance.









If the watch runs down sooner than you like, you know you did not quite hit the maximum tension.
Depending on the size of the watch, 20 to 40 forward turns should lead to resistance; over-winding will strain or break the mechanism., Press the crown to return stem to its place. Be careful to put the watch’s components back exactly as you started. Never shove or force parts when handling the stem and crown of a watch.








"
"
Keep your arm moving.,
Take the watch off your wrist.,
Locate the crown.,
Turn the crown clockwise.,
Always set the time by moving forward.,
Make sure the crown is pushed all the way in.,
Compare your watch’s timekeeping with another watch.,
Wind the watch fully if it hasn’t been worn in a while.",How to Wind an Automatic Watch1," The automatic watch is built with an oscillating metal weight, or rotor, that tracks movement. The oscillating rotor is attached to gears inside the watch that are in turn attached to the mainspring. When the rotor moves, it moves the gears which, in turn, winds the mainspring. This stores energy in the mainspring so that the watch continues ticking. If the watch is not being moved in regular, everyday motion, the mainspring’s energy winds down. If you wear your watch and keep your arm in regular movement, this should be enough to keep the rotor moving and winding up the mainspring. This doesn’t mean, however, that your arm needs to be in constant motion. Automatic watches are built to respond to average, everyday movement in order to keep them working.Typically, automatic watches store energy for up to 48 hours so that they continue working without needing additional winding.
People who are not very active, such as elderly people or those confined to bed, may need to wind their automatic watches with more frequency. If you are sick and laid up in bed, your watch may wind down since it’s not getting regular everyday movement.Avoid wearing watch when playing sports that require continuous hand or arm movement, such as tennis, squash or basketball. This will interfere with the automatic winding mechanisms, which are built for regular, everyday arm movement.;
, While an automatic watch is intended to restore its energy by the rotor winding the mainspring through the motion of your arm, it does also require periodic manual winding to keep the mainspring tight. In order to ensure that the crown is not overly strained when you pull it out and wind it, you should take it off your wrist. Then you will be able to have the right leverage and angle to carefully pull the crown out., The crown is the little dial knob usually on the right side of the watch. This knob can be pulled out to set the time and date on the watch. It does not need to be pulled out, however, in order to engage the winding mechanism. The crown usually has three positions or settings that engage certain functions. The first position is when it is pushed all the way in and the watch operates normally. The second position is when the crown is pulled out halfway; this is the position for setting the time or date (depending on your watch). The third position is when the crown is pulled out all the way; this is the position for setting the time or date (depending on your watch).If the watch is waterproof, the crown may be screwed down to provide added waterproofing. You may need to unscrew this crown by turning carefully 4 to 5 times. When you wind the watch, you will push down on the crown at the same time, which will screw it back into place. , Gripping the crown with your forefinger and thumb, twist it gently in a clockwise manner (moving it from bottom to top towards the 12 on the watch face if you are looking directly at the watch). Turn it approximately 30-40 times or until the second hand starts moving in order to fully wind the watch.Winding keeps the mainspring tight and at full energy reserve, which is also supplemented by keeping your watch in motion.


Contrary to popular belief, you cannot typically over-wind an automatic watch. Modern automatic watches are constructed to protect against this possibility.You should still be very gentle when turning the crown and stop winding when you feel resistance.

, When winding your watch, you may accidentally move the watch hands if you pull the crown out at all. If this happens, reset the time by moving the watch hands forward in time to reach the correct time again. Your watch is built to move its hands forward, not backward, so it is better to keep the gears and interior mechanisms working in their intended manner., Gently push on the crown to ensure that it is pushed all the way back in. If you have a waterproof watch, you may need to double check to make sure that the crown has been screwed into place. Pinch the crown with your forefinger and thumb and tighten it while pushing it in.

, If your watch has been properly wound, it should keep time that is consistent with other timepieces. If you think the watch is still not performing up to standard, you might ask a watch repair shop to test your watch on a timing machine. This instrument will measure its timekeeping and speed in order to determine if it is slow or fast., Automatic watches rely upon motion to keep working, and they may run down if they have been sitting in their box or in a drawer for more than a few days. Turning the crown on a watch 30-40 times will wind it fully and ensure it is ready to wear. Turn the crown until the second hand starts moving so you know that the watch has started keeping time. You will also likely need to reset the time and date.

Research your watch.,
Prepare your watch.,
Locate the crown.,
Wind the crown.,
Put the watch back together.",How to Wind a Watch2," Sometimes manual movement watches can last up to five days with one wind. This doesn’t mean your watch operates on automatic movement. Check the packaging details or research the serial code online to find out more info. You can always wait to see how long your watch lasts from one wind.


If it is an automatic movement watch, the watch will operate for a long time. The automatic movement will lose wind if it is not worn regularly., Take the watch off your wrist to properly set the wind. It is important that you be cautious when handling the stem of the watch. The stem is connected to several important mechanisms inside your watch that you don't want to break.









Fiddling with the stem of your watch while it's attached to your arm could bend or damage it.

, Automatic movement is similar to a manual movement watch, except that it is powered by a rotor which maintains the watches energy. The crown should also set the time, date, or other function on your watch. Like a manual movement watch, you’ll need to pull the crown out to expose the stem.









A good way to test what each level of the stem does is to test each one. The level that winds the watch shouldn’t appear differently on the outside.

, Once you’ve determined which level of the stem affects the wind, you’re ready to set your watch. Twist the crown clockwise until you feel resistance. It’s important not to go past the point of resistance on your stem.








You can break mechanical bits in your watch if you twist too far. Go to a watch specialist if you’ve twisted the stem too far.

, Once you’ve wound the watch, you can set the time and other functions. Check the face of your watch to be certain which components you’re affecting. Use a digital watch to set an accurate time and date.








"
"
Wind the watch daily.,
Clean your watch.,
Store your watch properly.",How to Wind a Watch3," A wound watch will run accurately from 18 to 36 hours - depending on the mechanism. Larger watches have larger mechanisms. Smaller watches have smaller, more delicate mechanisms.









Mechanical watches should be wound at least weekly, even if they are in storage.
It might become routine if you wind the watch when dressing in the morning or before bed.

, You don’t need to purchase specialty oils or cleaners to care for your watch. Clean your watch with a toothbrush and warm water. Dip the toothbrush in the warm water and wipe off the bristles to remove excess water. Scrub the exterior and inside the stem with the toothbrush.








Don’t use too much force when cleaning inside the stem and crown.
Don’t remove the screws and attempt to clean the gears, unless you know how to. Consult a watch specialist about cleaning the inside of your wristwatch.

, Watches are delicate instruments and you should be cautious when putting one away in storage. The best way to protect your watch is by wrapping it in a protective coating. This could be bubble wrap or another packaging protective fabric.


You should store the watch in an environment that is cool, clean, and dust free. Keep the watch out of direct sunlight.You should attempt to wind it every week while in storage.

Choose which kind of watch winder you need.,
Choose how many watches you want to wind at a time.,
Determine the direction of the watch winder rotation.",How to Wind an Automatic Watch2," A watch winder is a device that keeps automatic watches wound when they are not being worn by moving the watch in a circular pattern to mimic the movement of a human’s arm. These can range in price from $50 to $400, with top-of-the-line models costing up to $8,000. There are functional, elegant and extravagant models of watch winders.


Functional watch winders may be display-friendly, with nice designs; but their purpose is almost entirely functional. These are usually on the less expensive end of the scale. Cheap watch winders can be very unreliable and are not worth the price, even if it’s low.
Elegant watch winders have finer quality exteriors made of wood or leather, and they are more usually display-friendly, ready to sit on a shelf or dresser. They can still be small enough to fit in a drawer or safety deposit box.
Extravagant watch winders are at the top of the price range. These are usually constructed out of fine materials and made to hold multiple watches. They may have features such as temperature control, storage drawers, synchronized time displays, and USB connections.

, There are winders for single watches or for multiple watches. If you have a rotation of watches that you wear frequently, you may opt to get a watch winder that can hold several watches at once. If you have just one watch that you wear frequently, a single watch winder might be more useful.


If you have watches you wear only once in a while, such as for a special occasion, then you don’t really need to bother putting it in a watch winder. If you know you will be wearing a watch to a wedding, for example, you can take it out the day before and wind it on your own, rather than going to the trouble of setting it in the watch winder for 30 minutes every day.
Watch winders are good for collectors of automatic watches, especially if you have a large collection and want any one of your watches to be ready to go at a moment’s notice.

, Many automatic watches rely on clockwise motion, while others rely on counter-clockwise or bi-directional movement. Check with your watch’s manufacturer to figure out which motion your watch needs."

Keep your watch away from magnets.,
Keep your watch away from water.,
Check the temperature.,
Wipe down the wrist band frequently.,
Clean the watch every few months.,
Store your watch.,
Check seals on waterproof watches on a yearly basis.,
Get your watch maintained every five years.",How to Wind an Automatic Watch3," Inside the watch is a hairspring, a very delicate component that is responsible for keeping time. Exposure to magnets may cause the hairspring coils to stick together, resulting in a watch that runs too fast. While you can probably easily keep your watch away from traditional magnets, think about consumer electronics that have magnets, such as televisions, speakers and iPads. If your watch suddenly runs a lot faster or is five minutes ahead of where it ought to be, it’s possible that it was exposed to magnets and the hairspring was impacted. Take your watch to a reputable watch repair shop to have them fix the problem., Most watches are able to handle water depths of about 30 meters, so your watch won’t be ruined after an accidental dip in the lake. But for regular water exposure, you should choose a different watch such as a waterproof quartz watch that can handle being in water longer and at greater depths., Watches can be impacted by extremely cold or hot temperatures, which can affect how accurately they keep time. Most modern watches are constructed to accommodate changes in temperature, but if you are going to be somewhere with really hot or really cold temperatures, you may need to take special care with your watch., Watch straps can be made of various kinds of material, from leather to metal to rubber. This will depend on the aesthetic design and intended use of the watch. Rubber watch straps, for example, are typical for waterproof watches that will be used when swimming, diving or boating. Check rubber straps for cracks and tears, and replace them when they show signs of weakening. Leather straps don’t respond well to water, cologne, perfume, sunscreen, and other liquids. Rub in leather oil occasionally to improve the look and longevity of the leather. For metal straps, polish them up with a soft cloth., Your watch, especially if you wear it every day or every few days, will gather dirt, dead skin, and other grime that needs to be cleaned away. Use an old toothbrush and warm water to scrub the watch, especially around the connection point between the watch and the straps. If you have a metal band, use your toothbrush to clean it.

, If you are not planning to wear your watch frequently, you should store it carefully in order to protect it from dust, moisture and theft. It will also help keep the watch’s lubricating oils from deteriorating or clogging. Store it in the manufacturer’s box or in an airtight container. If it is a particularly expensive watch, you may choose to store it in a safe deposit box. You can also store it on a watch winder.

, Waterproof watches can get loosened up with regular wear and exposure to the elements or sand. Check the seals around the face, crown and back of the watch to make sure that it is still going to keep water out. If there are signs of wear, replace the seals. It’s best to take the watch to a watch repair shop to accomplish this, since they will have the expertise to properly replace seals.

, Expensive watches in particular should be maintained every few years just like a car. Their gears have lubricating oil that can get clogged, and gear teeth can be worn down. Take the watch to a reputable watch repair shop to get it relubricated. The watch repair professional will also repair or replace worn gear teeth and jewels. This maintenance can be expensive, from $250 to several thousand dollars depending on the watch. But this maintenance will prolong the life of the watch, which is important particularly if it is an heirloom watch that you want to last."

, The crown is located on the side of your watch by the 3 o'clock marking. Turn the crown counterclockwise until you feel it release from the last thread. It will pop out slightly from the side of the watch.








, With your thumb and index finger, slowly turn the crown clockwise 360 degrees, or a full rotation, at least 30 to 40 times. This fully winds the watch.









If you only rotate the crown clockwise a few times then the watch will not be fully wound.
Rolex designs its watches so it is impossible to over wind them. A device built into the watch will prevent you from over winding the Rolex.

, Return the crown to its normal position by gently pushing the crown towards the watch and screwing it back on to the threads by turning it clockwise. Your Rolex watch is now wound.








, If you've wound your watch and it doesn't immediately start working, leave it alone for a little while or rotate it back and forth on your wrist. It may take a little motion for the watch to be working properly.








, A Rolex watch that stays motionless for approximately 24 hours will usually not wind itself and will need to be manually wound. Keep your Rolex on if you don't want to repeatedly wind it.








, If your Rolex still doesn't work after winding it, you may have a more serious problem. Take your watch to a local certified and authorized dealer who can assess the watch. If it is broken, the dealer will ship your Rolex to a factory in Switzerland for repairs.

, Now that the Rolex is wound properly you will need to reset the date and time. Different models of Rolex have different methods for setting the date and time so it is important to use the appropriate method for your model.

Show it off.",How to Wear an Ear Cuff," Until you get used to the way a correctly positioned cuff sits on your ear, it will be easiest to put the cuff on while looking at your ear in a mirror.;
, Locate the thinnest section of cartilage along the upper portion of your ear and slip the opening of the cuff around it.One side of the cuff flange should be behind the ear. The other side should be on the front.

, Use one hand to hold the skin and cartilage of the ear taut. Doing so can make it easier to slide the cuff into place.


It is often easiest to use whichever hand is located on the same side of the body as the ear you're working on. When putting a cuff on your left ear, use your left hand to hold the ear taut. When working with the right ear, use your right hand.
Pinch the top of the ear just above the cuff in place using your index and middle fingers. Pinch the earlobe in place using your thumb and ring finger.
Gently tug the top and bottom of your ear in separate directions, causing the outer ridge of the ear to stretch just enough to become firm and taut.

, Use your other hand to carefully slide the ear cuff down the outer rim of cartilage. Rotate the cuff as you slide it down so that it leans in slightly toward the inner ear, eventually settling along inside the hollow portion at the outside of the ear canal.


Only the front flange should settle on this inner portion of the ear. The cuff itself needs to wrap around the rim of the ear, and the back flange should remain completely behind the ear.
Most ear cuffs should be positioned just midway along the outer rim of the ear, just above the top of the earlobe., The ear cuff should rest securely on the rim of the ear without pinching it.


The ear cuff should be comfortable. If it makes your ear sore, it's too tight. If it starts slipping off or slipping further down your ear, it's too loose.

, Most ear cuffs are delicate enough for you to adjust by hand. Squeeze the opening in between your fingers to make it tighter. If you want to make the cuff looser, pry the opening apart wider with your fingers.


Adjustments made with your fingers can be done while the ear cuff is on your ear, but you should work carefully and in slow increments to avoid misshaping the cuff or injuring your ear.
When working with ornate wire ear cuffs, you may also need to adjust the angle of the cuff's decorative wiring with your fingers so that it matches the natural curvature of your ear.

, Rigid ear cuffs should be adjusted with smooth needle nose pliers.


Since you'll be applying more pressure, you should remove the cuff from your ear before making any adjustments to it. Doing so will allow you to make more precise alterations and should reduce the risk of accidental injury.

, If you're working with ear cuffs that have a separate earring attached with a chain, you need to position the ear cuff portion normally before you can put in the earring portion.


If the ear cuff does not have an earring attached by a chain, this section can be skipped.

, Insert the earring post through the piercing in your earlobe as you would do with a normal earring. If the post has a backing, fit the backing onto it from behind your earlobe.

, Take a look at the ear cuff in a mirror. If the chain is too taut, slide the cuff further down the side of your ear.


Similarly, if the chain sags too much, you can adjust it by sliding the cuff further up along the outer ridge of the ear.
Make sure that the chain is not twisted around the earring and that it falls to the outside of the cuff and earring. Use your fingers to make any necessary adjustments.

, Ear cuffs come in a variety of styles, so you'll have plenty to choose from when you go shopping.The simplest ear cuffs are dainty hoops that wrap around the ridge of the ear without any further adornment. These hoops can be made of light wire, heavy wire, or solid metal.
Some hoop ear cuffs have a separate earring piece attached by a thin chain or series of chains. This earring should be placed into an earlobe piercing.
Other ear cuffs can be more ornate. The cuff itself rests in the hollow of the ear (as described in the ""Placing the Ear Cuff"" section), but the decorative part is meant to encircle the outer curve of the ear. This decorative portion can be made of dainty wire or solid metal. Some ear cuffs are even studded with gems or similar elements.

, Wear an ear cuff on one ear instead of wearing them on both. The look is supposed to be edgy and asymmetrical.Even small ear cuffs stand out, so weighing both ears down with cuffs can make your overall look seem heavy and cluttered.
You should only wear ear cuffs on one ear at a time, but the ear you choose does not matter.

, If you can't choose between your favorite pair of earrings and your favorite ear cuffs, you might be able to wear both.


When you take this option, though, it's best to keep one or both elements fairly subdued.
For instance, you could wear simple diamond stud earrings with a decorative cuff, especially if the cuff has an open space in its design to accommodate an earring. Another option would be to wear a pair of long dangling earrings with a simple wire hoop cuff.
You should not, however, wear an elaborately designed ear cuff with heavy dangling earrings. The two pieces will likely clash and create too much weight.

, Simple ear cuffs can be worn with other jewelry, but more elaborate cuffs often look best when they don't have to compete with other large statement pieces.


Like earrings, other jewelry you wear—necklaces, bracelets, rings—should balance out the ear cuff instead of competing with it. An ornate statement necklace can be worn when you have simple hoop ear cuffs, but when you have a more elaborate cuff, you should stick with things like small pendant necklaces or plain dangle bracelets when you choose anything at all.

, Ear cuffs are meant to be worn as statement jewelry, but in order for them to make a statement, they have to be visible.


Tie your hair back or arrange it in a messy bun.
Consider putting a deep side part in your hair so that the side with the cuff is more exposed.
If nothing else, you should at least expose the ear cuff by sweeping your hair behind your ear.

Start with what you have.,
Purchase a watch.,
Get a chain.,
Choose a look.",How to Wear a Pocket Watch1," Many pocket watches are heirlooms or keepsakes. If you have one of these, you have a distinctive statement that combines your family history with a design that probably can't be found for sale anywhere. Consider using this watch as a functional, stylish accessory, the way it was meant to be used when it was created.


Be careful. Remember that heirloom watches are usually irreplaceable. Be sure you're willing to take the risk of carrying it around with you before you decide to wear it.

Properly securing the watch to a chain and hooking it onto a button or loop will help ensure that it does not become lost. This process is explained in greater detail below.


Get it fixed. Heirloom watches may not always work, or may work erratically. There is no reason you shouldn't take your watch in to a respected watch repair person if it isn't working perfectly. Just ask around online first to find a repair shop that will take good care of your watch.

It is all right to send your watch to a repair person by mail if you are absolutely sure he or she will do a good job.
Broken or irregular pocket watches can still be worn as accessories, but you're likely to feel silly pulling them out of your pocket to “check the time.”


Clean it up. Consider buying some metal polish and gently cleaning and polishing your heirloom pocket watch. Many of them have tarnish and scuffing around the edges that will clean right out with a soft cloth, a safe polish, and a bit of elbow grease.

If your heirloom watch has etching or engraving on it, be sure to gently clean out the grooves as well. This will remove any grime built up in them and can sometimes make a dramatic difference in a watch's appearance.

;
, If you don't have an heirloom pocket watch, you'll have to buy one for yourself. Pocket watches come in many materials and finishes, so pick whichever look you like.


Pick a metal. Silver is often preferred by modern buyers, as it goes well with all color combinations and has a lustrous finish. Other common materials include brass, gold, and steel.
Consider the level of detail. Pocket watch designs range from simple, plain surfaces to ornately finished covers. Watches with carved or engraved covers often have patterns, monograms or woodland scenes on them, and can add a unique look to your outfit.
Decide between new and used. Each has its advantages.

New watches are likely to work for a long time without trouble, and represent the latest in pocket watch design. They are likely to be more expensive than used watches.
Used pocket watches offer a great variety of designs, motifs, and finishes. Most used watches cost less than new ones, but prices can vary widely based on how collectible a given watch is.

Don't buy a used pocket watch over the Internet. There is no way to tell how well it will work or what its relative size is, in most cases.





, The watch chain serves two purposes: first, it secures your pocket watch to your clothing so that you can't drop it on the ground or misplace it; second, it completes the look of the watch.


Start with the standard type. Ordinarily, you should pick a watch chain that has the same finish as your watch; thus, if your watch is steel, pick a steel chain, and so on.

Chain weight and weave are up to each individual to decide. Consider a fine, thin chain for dressing to the nines; lean towards a thick, durable chain for a look that will survive hard labor and adventuring.

Be careful to pick a chain that is durable enough to keep your watch secure if you expect to wear it somewhere it might get hit or yanked.




Add a strap or fob. If you plan to wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket instead of on your chest, consider attaching a leather strap or watch fob to it instead. They're generally sturdier than watch chains, and suggest a rugged, casual look.

You can also purchase a leather holder, which attaches to a belt loop and holds the watch outside your pants for a bolder statement.


Mix up your collection. At the very least, a few different chain weights and lengths are recommended so that you can wear your watch on different outfits.

Consider bucking tradition and mismatching your chain. Like a fob, the different color will offset the finish of your pocket watch and make it pop.

Be careful to pick combinations that look premeditated, rather than thrown together. Your watch and chain should still look good no matter what.





, Pocket watches are an old-fashioned accessory, but there are as many ways to wear them as there are ideas you can come up with. Here are a few general looks you might consider:


The classic: Wear your pocket watch in a suit vest pocket for an old-fashioned look. The watch chain should be hooked to a button on your vest, and the watch should go in the vest pocket with the watch face toward your body so that you can check the time as soon as you pull it out.

If you are right-handed, the watch should go in your left vest pocket, and vice versa. This allows you to draw the watch while leaving your dominant hand free.


The casual: Wear your pocket watch in a pants pocket for a bit of flash that will go unnoticed until you pull it out. Hook the strap to a belt loop, and leave the watch face-in inside your dominant front pocket as usual.

This look works better with a watch that has a larger face, since you won't be able to look at it as closely without unhooking it.


The laborer: Pocket watches were never just the domain of the rich. Although that is how we perceive them today, there was a time when anyone whose job required them to know the time carried a pocket watch. Try an unusual retro look by wearing overalls with a pocket watch in the front bib pocket.

This look works better with a rugged, heavy chain, as it is a working man's outfit designed to take a lot of abuse.
Complete your ensemble with a loose-fit collared work shirt, a newsboy cap, and chunky construction boots.


The theatrical: Because a pocket watch is such a bold statement, it can be a useful accessory for themed outfits, such as costumes or ensembles that reflect your membership in a subculture.

Consider buying an unusual fob or chain to offset the watch and make it a coordinated part of your outfit.
Since pocket watches are associated with wealth and conservatism, try wearing one in the jeans vest of a punk outfit to make a contrarian statement.
Pocket watches are a classy and impressive accessory for a steampunk ensemble. Again, keep the watch hooked to a vest or shirt pocket to accentuate its old-fashioned touch.

Wear a bright, chunky necklace with neutral colors.,
Pair less elaborate necklaces (such as a long silver or gold chain) with eye-catching clothes.,
Always wear a large pearl or diamond necklace with elegant clothing.,
Bib necklaces should be worn with high-cut but low-collared shirts and jackets.,
Don’t wear more than one big necklace at once.,
Be cautious of sloppily made, cheap-looking necklaces.",How to Wear Big Jewelry1," Try an abstract, 3-D design in crimson to compliment a simple black dress and tights or a thick turquoise necklace along with a white peasant shirt on top of jeans. Your outfit should be comfortable and simple, but the necklace will help to dress it up and draw attention to your excellent fashion sense.;
, If you’re wearing an animal print, for example, or a polka-dotted pattern on top, you’ll want to keep yourself from looking too “busy.”

, Such extravagant jewelry will look out of place when combined with everyday garb, so if you want to show off your brand-new gems, try making reservations at a fancy restaurant and slipping on your nicest heels before heading out.

, Otherwise there will be an inch or two of space between the bottom of your necklace and the top of your shirt. It’s cleaner looking and you won't feel the need to adjust your clothes all day.

, Several is unnecessary; a good, chunky necklace will attract compliments all by itself. Additionally, do not pair a big necklace with a scarf or any other variety of neck wear. Even if you’re trying to make a grand statement, that kind of over accessorizing is rarely a good idea.

, These are tacky and make you seem careless about how you present yourself. As a general rule, you should avoid large necklaces with words hanging from them (“love”, for example, or “best friends forever”) if you want to stay fashion-forward.

"
"
Wind your watch every day.,
Clean your watch on a regular basis.,
Polish your watch periodically.,
Don't lose your watch.",How to Wear a Pocket Watch2," All but the newest pocket watches will run on time for between 26 and 30 hours per wind at most. Even the latest models only last about 46 hours. Regardless of what type of pocket watch you own, plan to give it a full wind every day.


The best time to wind your watch is in the morning. You can make it part of your daily routine, and the watch almost always gets wound at the same time each day, ensuring reliability.

, A soft, dry chamois or microfiber cloth is suitable for gently lifting skin oil and dirt off of metal surfaces. Use a tiny bit of metal cleaner if needed. Clean your watch every time you are done wearing it.


If you wear your watch most days, clean it two to three times weekly, or as needed.
Don't forget to periodically wipe down the inside faces of the watch with your dry cloth.

, Use a polish designed for the metal of your watch to keep it shiny. Apply a bit of polish, per the directions on the package, every few months or as needed.


If you need to remove tarnish, avoid products that require submersion in liquid. This can damage or loosen the delicate inner pieces of a pocket watch.
Use the same polish on your chain, assuming it's made of a similar material.

, Always make sure the watch fob or chain is securely attached to the watch at one end, and an item of clothing at the other.


Attach your chain to an item of clothing you don't plan to remove. Avoid jackets and other such layered coverings.

Don't wear big bracelets when you know you'll be doing important tasks with your hands.,
If you're wearing long sleeves under your bracelet, try to arrange it so that the sleeve and your bracelet align at the edge of your wrist.,
For short sleeves, simply let the bracelet rest against your wrist.,
Experiment with wearing more than one big bracelet at a time.,
Wear the best quality of bracelet you can comfortably afford.",How to Wear Big Jewelry2," Big bracelets are best worn on days when you won’t be using your hands much, or if you don’t mind pushing bracelets up your arms or taking them off for important tasks. They may be cute, but they can be a hassle--even typing on a computer can be cumbersome when wearing a bracelet--so if you're planning on wearing any, get ready to commit.

, This detail can be a huge improvement to your outfits, helping you look more put together.

, If the inside of the bracelet irritates your skin, take a bottle of clear nail polish and apply several coats to the inner ring. If that doesn't ease the irritation, consider long sleeves.

, Unlike big necklaces, big bracelets can be worn fashionably several at a time. However, you should still be conscious of patterns, sizes, etc. Ask yourself questions like ""Do these colors complement one another?"" and ""Can I really keep holding my arm up all day with twelve giant bangle bracelets on it?"" If you find yourself uncertain, take off a bracelet or two, and always leave room in your bag in case you want to remove some more later on.

, Similar to big necklaces, big bracelets can look gimmicky if they aren't made from the right stuff, so watch out. A high-quality bracelet can be hard to find, but if you look in the jewelry sections of Macy's or JC Penney or even Target, you're bound to stumble upon something that appeals to you.

"
"
For big earrings you should try to coordinate with your outfit more so than with a necklace or bracelet.,
Wear large, expensive earrings only to formal events to accessorize formal attire.,
Wear feather earrings occasionally.,
If you have more than one hole in your ear, put studs in the uppermost holes and your big earrings in the bottom one.,
Be wary of your surroundings, since earrings that dangle tend to get caught on things.,
Stay mindful of the amount of pressure the earrings exert on your ears.",How to Wear Big Jewelry3," This is because big bracelets and necklaces usually overlap clothing, creating a sense of composition even if they don't match exactly. Earrings, on the other hand, are located further away from your clothes, so you'll want to have at least one corresponding color between the two of them.


This is the rule of thumb unless you're wearing a neutral color, in which case your earrings can be your statement piece. Want to spice up an old beige sweater or a gray pair of pants? Just put on some shoulder-length earrings and you've got a conversation starter right there.

, Emerald chandelier earrings, enormous sapphires--keep them out of your day-to-day life unless you're a princess or a daring debutante.

, Feather earrings can be difficult to manage and clean. Try to only wear them on sunny, windless days, so they don't get wet or fly up like an umbrella during an aggressive storm.

, This will prevent any overlap, and big earrings just look better when they have more room.

, If you're really worried, you should probably put up your hair and wear a tank top or other shirt that's unlikely to get snagged on an earring.

, If you start to feel pain or even discomfort, take out the earrings and check for redness. You also might want to clean the hook/pole with isopropyl rubbing alcohol from time to time (although this goes for all of your earrings, especially if they're hurting your ears). If cleaning them doesn't relieve your discomfort, you may be allergic to them--some people can only wear earrings with solid gold hooks/poles.

"
"
As with big bracelets, you shouldn't wear a bunch of chunky rings if you're planning on doing work with your hands or getting them dirty.,
Engagement and wedding rings, though typically not too big, are traditionally worn on the left hand.,
Costume jewelry rings and Ring Pops are fun, but they're not appropriate in professional settings.,
Paint your nails if you want your hands to look more polished when wearing big rings.",How to Wear Big Jewelry4," This is particularly true if you haven't had the ring fitted properly, and it either keeps sliding off your finger or it cuts off your circulation; if that is the case, find a jeweler or a jewelry-loving friend who can recommend someone to fix it as soon as possible.

, You shouldn't have trouble supporting the weight with your hand, and if you do, consult someone to have that changed.

, If you're going to wear big bijoux rings, save them for evenings out or when you're in more casual surroundings where a splash of creativity is accepted.

, Another tactic to employ if you're self-conscious of your hands is to get a tan--just be careful not to turn yourself orange and you should be perfectly fine.

Know that articles and verbs gets replaced with slang.,
Understand the common adjectives and names towards people.,
Don't forget the differences between similar words.,
Learn some Hawaiian phrases that are brought into Pidgin.,
""Th"" is not typically pronounced like ""th"" as in ""the"" in standard English when at the start of a word.,
If someone tells you there is ""no moa"" of something, they are saying that there is ""no more"", but that does not imply that there EVER WAS ANY in the first place (as would be implied in standard english).",How to Understand Hawaiian Pidgin," Da replaces ""The"", Fo' replaces ""To"", and Wen replaces ""When"". Other verbs can be replaced, for example, ""Braddah, you lik' go beach?"" is pidgin for ""You want to go to the beach?"";
, Lolo means idiot and Kolohe means troublemaker. In the islands, there is an ""ohana"" (family) slang towards others. Auntie and Uncle are used towards females and males that are older than you in a respectable way, for example your friend's parents, a supermarket cashier, or a bus driver. Brah or Braddah are used for laid-back conversations or to get someone's attention.

, Hapai means pregnant while Hapa means half. Talk story means chatting or casual conversation and Talk stink means talking bad about someone else.

, Puka means hole, usually found in shirts or other items. Hana Hoe means ""one more time"" and mostly said at concerts or gigs when the crowd wants to hear one more song. Another is ""Kannakattack"", which means ""eat till you sleep"".

, The ""h"" is silent meaning ""throw"" is pronounced ""trow"" and ""three"" is pronounced ""tree"". If the ""th"" is in the middle of the word, it is pronounced as a ""d"" (but usually spelled as ""dd"". ""Rather"" is pronounced ""raddah"", ""gather"" is ""gaddah"", ""father"" is ""faddah"".

, ""No moa"" means that there is none and there may have never been ANY.


i.e.(at a Home Depot): ""You guys carry leopard skinned panties?""
(Home Depot employee): ""No moa ANY kine panties...dis is Home Depot not Backseat Betty's""

Don’t wear a watch with a face that is too big.,
Decide on which wrist you want to wear your watch.,
Wear your watch beside your wrist bone.,
Wear a band that fits properly.",How to Wear a Watch1," Watch faces are measured in millimeters. Men’s watches average between 34mm-50mm, although they can be larger. You should never wear a watch bigger than 50mm, at most, but 34mm-40mm is standard and ideal for both men and women. , There is no “correct” side. Choose the wrist that is most comfortable and where your watch won't get in the way of your movements. This is typically the non-dominant hand, as it might be uncomfortable to write with a watch under your wrist.

, Make sure that the face sits right next to the bone on the outside of the wrist (the ulna). When standing, little or none of your watch should be visible beneath your shirt cuff. When wearing a long-sleeved shirt, your watch should only be fully visible when your arm is bent. Never wear your watch on top of your shirt cuff., A watch should appear comfortable, natural, and certainly not sloppy. It may be necessary to adjust it as needed, to accommodate natural fluctuations in wrist size.


Some watches, such as dress watches and sports watches, have a prong and notch system that allows you to easily move the prong up or down a notch to tighten or loosen.
Casual or formal watches can have a more complicated fastening system that requires you to adjust the size by adding or removing links. Consult the instruction manual, or ask your jeweler for help or advice on adjusting the length of your watch.
A man should never wear his wristwatch loose around his wrist. It should move about an inch up and down your wrist as you move. The face of the watch should not slip to the side of your wrist. As a general rule, you should be able to fit a finger snugly between your wrist and the watch band.
A wristwatch should not be worn too tightly. If the watch leaves an imprint on your wrist, it is too tight and should be loosened.
Women's watches may be worn snugly, or loose around the wrist like a bracelet.

Keep the rings a similar color.,
Combine different textures.,
Wear your knuckle ring on one finger.,
Use a triangle configuration for your knuckle rings.,
Stack your rings.,
Try wearing your rings however you want.,
Select the right sized ring.,
Select a ring within your budget.,
Choose a ring that matches your style.,
Stay relaxed and feel comfortable.,
Decide which hand you want to wear your ring.,
Slide on your knuckle ring.",How to Wear a Knuckle Ring," Decide which colors you want on each hand and try to stick to the same colored metals. Wearing the same color on one hand, will help keep your rings cohesive and will prevent them from visually clashing with one another. For instance, you could wear all gold rings on your left hand and all gold rings on your right hand.Keep rose gold with the golds and platinum with the silvers when wearing rings.;
, Different textured rings will allow you to show off your creativity and will make your rings appear more unique. Mixing up your knuckle rings with different kinds of rings, such as ones with gemstones, can help improve the look of your rings together.


Try different types of materials for your rings such as solid metal, leather, chain, beads, and jewels.Experiment with rings that have the traditional band as well as rings that have different forms.

, The simplest way to wear your knuckle ring is to keep your rings to a single finger per hand. You can put your ring on the middle finger, and you don't need to remove other rings. Put your ring on your middle, index finger, or ring finger above your middle knuckle to see how it looks., Rings on your middle, index, and ring finger with your knuckle ring on your middle finger will give you a triangle configuration on your hand. You can also create a triangle configuration by having three knuckle rings on your index, middle, and ring finger with a regular ring on your middle finger. Doing this brings attention to your knuckle ring and helps balance the look of your rings., Ring stacking occurs when you have multiple rings on one finger. Try stacking different rings to see if you can create a unique and pleasing style. Use traditional rings that rest lower on your fingers in unison with knuckle rings that lay above them.

, Feeling the most comfortable with your knuckle rings means wearing them however you want. Experiment with your regular rings and your knuckle rings in unison and determine a style that meets your personality. If you are artistic or eccentric, wearing more rings may be better for you.


Some rings are asymmetric so flipping the ring over on your finger will give a ring a different look.

, Your knuckle ring size will be the same as your traditional ring size. To determine your ring size, measure the circumference of your finger with measuring tape and compare it to a ring sizing chart. For instance, a 19.1 mm finger circumference would equate to a size 60 ring. A knuckle ring should fit comfortably on your pinky and should snugly fit on the phalanx of your middle finger. You can also get your ring size measured at most jewelry stores free of charge.


If you feel like the ring is slipping off you need a smaller ring size.
If the ring is cutting off the circulation to your fingertip, you should purchase a ring that has a larger ring size.Don't force a ring on because it may become stuck.

, Cheaper knuckle rings can range from $12 to $16.More expensive rings can be hundreds to thousands of dollars per ring. Determine how much you are going to wear your ring, how much money you have to spend, and how important the ring is to you. Choose a ring that you can afford and pay up front. Knuckle rings should enhance your existing jewelry and style, not replace it.

, Choose a ring that will enhance your current style. Determine whether you like to wear loud clothes that make a statement or whether you're more subdued and enjoy earth tones. If you like to make a statement, make sure that your rings also make a statement and are unique and colorful. If you don't enjoy the limelight, choose rings that are fashionable but not in your face. Choose rings that match your natural aesthetic and don't select rings that will clash with your style.


If you consider yourself eccentric or artistic, wearing multiple rings may fit your personality.
If you are quiet and subdued, having multiple rings may bring you unwanted attention.

, Knuckle rings should feel as secure as your other rings. Make sure that you feel comfortable and that your rings aren't interfering with work that you have to do. Knuckle rings should fit snugly around your finger and shouldn't slip off when using your hands.


If you have to do manual labor or are participating in physical activity, you should take off your jewelry.

, Some ring positions have a social significance. For instance, in the U.S. wearing a ring on the ring finger of your left hand signifies that you are married. For someone who practices the Eastern Orthodox religion, however, this is switched to the right hand.Take these social standards into consideration when deciding which hand or hands you want to wear your ring.

, When wearing a mixture of traditional and knuckle rings, you'll need to put on your regular rings first because they will be lower on your fingers. Slide your knuckle ring on and do not force it over your middle knuckle. Your knuckle ring should rest in between the middle and top joints in your finger. Make a fist and open your hand to make sure that the ring is comfortable.

Pick simple, clean pieces.,
Go bold with geometric pieces.,
Try a beaded effect.,
Pick delicate bracelets.,
Choose dainty earrings.",How to Wear Minimalist Jewelry1," When it comes to minimalist jewelry, you don't want to get too fussy. However, you don't want to make it so simple that it's boring. The key is picking pieces that make a statement while still being minimal, such as single stone in a clean setting dangling off a necklace or set in a ring. A single pearl on slim silver band can be this type of statement piece., If jewels or small stones aren't your style, try geometric pieces. This style creates clean lines with startling shapes. They're bold without being fussy or overbearing. For instance, try wearing a geometric bracelet as a statement piece with almost any short-sleeved shirt or dress.Often, geometric pieces are composed of thin materials. For instance, you may find a bangle that outlines an arrow or square instead of filling it in.

, Most of the minimalist jewelry tends to stick to mainly metal and chains with a small accent. However, you can still have a beaded effect and pull off a minimalist look. The key is to keep the beads small and somewhat muted in color. It can help to minimize how many you wear, such as just having beads on the center part of a chain., A simple chain bracelet with a small accent piece is a great way to incorporate minimalist jewelry into your wardrobe. For instance, a bar bracelet is a classic option that can be personalized with an inscription. It adds glamour and elegance to a simple outfit., Simple studs with a touch of shine can be the perfect minimalist jewelry. For instance, gold studs with a tiny diamond in the middle add shine but keep your jewelry to a minimum. You can also choose something with a little more whimsy, such as tiny flowers or bows. A pair of small dangle earrings is also a good option."

Watch your vowel pronunciation.",How to Learn Hawaiian," Being familiar with this creates a more understanding of the modernized Hawaiian language. Some Hawaiian words, such as ""pau"" (pronounced pow) meaning ""finished"", are included in Pidgin.;
, Contrary to the modern English alphabet that consists of 26 letters, the Hawaiian alphabet contains 12 letters. The seven consonants are h, k, l, m, n, p, and w and the five vowels are a, e, i, o, u.


Vowel pronunciation are ""ah"", ""ey"", ""ee"", ""oh"", and ""oo"".
When a long vowel is pronounced, the macron symbol (dash or hyphen) is used over the stressed letter.

, Some words are actually used worldwide in media and everyday communication.



Aloha (ah-low-ha): This is the universal word for hello and goodbye, as well as love.
Kama'aina (caw-ma-eye-na): Native born or Hawaii resident. Certain places and attractions, such as the Honolulu Zoo, provide kama'aina discounts.
Mahalo (ma-ha-low): Thank you. The phrase ""mahalo a nui loa"" (ah nu-wee low-ah) means thank you very much.
Ohana (oh-ha-na): Family. This could mean blood-related family and people that you feel close enough to call family.
Haole (how-li): Caucasian person. If a person is half Caucasian, they would be considered ""hapa haole"".

, Pronounced as wee-key, wiki means fast or quick. Some schools have included a ""wiki lunch"" in their schedules, which is a mix between a snack and lunch during the first recess.

Match your watch to your shoes.,
Choose a go-to, everyday watch that can be worn with casual clothing.,
Wear a formal watch to events that require formal wear.,
Wear a sports watch.,
Wear a dress watch for business dress or business casual.",How to Wear a Watch2," As a general rule, you are wearing dress shoes, a dress watch would be appropriate. If you are wearing sneakers, then a sports watch would be appropriate. If you are somewhere in between, such as boots, boat shoes, or flip-flops, an everyday casual watch is your best bet. , Your everyday watch should be neutral and durable, as it's meant to be worn throughout your daily activities, including work, casual social functions, and errands. Stainless steel is a popular choice as this makes for both neutral and sturdy watches, but options include basic watches made of all sorts of different materials, including plastic and rubber.

, This includes weddings, christenings, funerals, formal dinners, opera and theater performances, and other formal events. Formal watches add a finishing touch to a well-polished outfit.


Formal watches are usually made of a precious metal (silver, gold, or platinum), and can be incredibly expensive, depending on brand and materials. Many people prefer a formal watch that is made of the same metal tone as the rest of their jewelry or accessories. For example, a woman who's wearing a platinum necklace might prefer to wear a platinum, silver, or white gold watch, while a man who's wearing gold cufflinks will usually prefer to wear a gold watch. Formal watches can be incredibly expensive, and are seen as a status symbol among men. If an expensive formal watch is not in your budget, consider foregoing the formal watch altogether; a cheap watch can carry a negative perception, while there are no consequences for not wearing a watch during these occasions.

, You can wear it as an everyday watch, or as a functional tool for running or working out. Sports watches can be made with rubber, plastic, or even fabric bands that are meant to be durable, sweat-resistant, and often water-resistant. Pay close attention to the instructions that come with the watch—they will tell you how far under water your watch can safely go.


Wear your sports watch when you will need to keep time, measure depth or speed, consult a compass, or when you will use other special features included.
Outside of athletic endeavors, you can wear your sports watch with a long sleeve shirt or even a tie to casual events.
Never wear a sports watch with a suit—this is the fashion equivalent of wearing sneakers with a tuxedo! It is considered to be in poor taste., This would be appropriate with something slightly more dressed up than khakis and a polo, such as a shirt and jacket. Dress watches are usually more plain and simple than formal watches, and generally won’t have the same level of adornment that formal watches can have.Choose one with a thin black or brown leather band to wear at events that require semi-formal wear, business professional wear, or even business casual wear, including blazers with slacks or jeans, dresses, and trousers with a nice blouse or jacket.
Match your shoes and belt to your watch band. If your shoes are black, then don’t wear a watch with a brown band.
Buy multiple bands for your watch, so you can easily and inexpensively make your watch match your shoes and belt. Or, look for a band that is a mix of brown and black.

Choose a pocket watch if it fits your personal style.,
Wear a pocket watch with a waistcoat.,
Wear a pocket watch with khakis or jeans.,
Don't be afraid to wear a pocket watch as a woman.",How to Wear a Watch3," Pocket watches were once the norm, but have become more of a novelty. They appear distinctive and can add a lot of character to your look, if worn properly. Pocket watches are often passed down through families and inherited, so they can also carry sentimental value., You should put the watch in the pocket that's most convenient to you, then loop the watch chain through the waistcoat's buttonhole and put the fob in the pocket on the other side. This will give you a subtle look of sophistication, while remaining functional.

, Simply put your watch in the pocket that is most convenient, loop the watch chain through a belt loop and clip the watch to the belt loop, leaving the fob exposed. This will protect the watch and make it quick and easy to check. , Although they aren't commonly worn by women, pocket watches can give women a great vintage look. Wear it around your neck on a long chain or fastened on a broach or pin to be attached on your shirt. Keep other accessories minimal if your women's pocket watch is elaborate and highly decorative.

Limit what you wear.,
Keep your lines separate.,
Show off your earrings.",How to Wear Minimalist Jewelry2," If you're going to keep it minimalist, that means you need to stick to just one or two pieces of jewelry as your statement piece if possible, such as a necklace, bracelet, or earrings. If you want to wear earrings with a necklace, keep the earrings very minimal, such as basic studs., To keep your look simple, you need clean lines. That means that the lines you create shouldn't overlap. You're essentially using your skin as negative space or background, to give each piece room to breathe. For instance, don't let your necklace go over your shirt line or your bracelet clash with a shirt cuff., If all you're wearing is a pair of dainty earrings, you want people to see them. If you're wearing your hair down, tuck at least one side behind your hair or pull that side back with a clip. That way, people can actually see the jewelry you're wearing."

Wear a lariat backwards.,
Stack your statement pieces.,
Mix up your materials.,
Don't give up on charms.",How to Wear Minimalist Jewelry3," A lariat is a long necklace that ends in a single chain that drops down from the middle of the necklace. It usually has a small pendant on the end. While you can wear a lariat with any number of blouses, another way you can wear one is to turn the necklace around so that the pendant is in the back. This technique works best with shirts and dresses that are low-cut in the back., While you want simplicity and clean lines with minimalist jewelry, stacking a few minimalist pieces for a statement piece can create an interesting effect. For instance, you could wear a small choker with a delicate chain necklace, or stack several rings or bracelets for a statement. Just keep in mind that you really want just one big statement piece, so don't go overboard with necklaces, bracelets, AND big earrings., If you do wear stacked pieces or multiple pieces, mixing materials can add texture and interest to your look. For instance, you could have a choker made out of leather along with a dainty gold necklace., You may think charms are the exact opposite of minimalist, and if you're talking about a standard charm bracelet, you'd be right. However, wearing a small charm or two on a dainty chain necklace can bring meaning to your jewelry without adding too much bulk."

, You will want to get a small nail with a long tip and a high quality, precision flat head screwdriver. The head of the screwdriver will ideally be under 2mm wide. If you have a jeweler's screwdriver, it would be ideal.


You may also find it helpful to work over a soft, smooth, and clean surface. A white towel or tee shirt works well.That way if you drop your nail or any of the small parts of the watch they'll be safe and easy to find.

, Don't try to remove a link that doesn't have arrows on the underside. The links with arrows are removable links.You'll notice that the removable links aren't near the edges of the band. Also, remember that you want the watch to be centered on your wrist, so you'll need to take links from both sides of the band if you are taking more than one out.

Pull apart the knot with needles.,
Clean the necklace.",How to Untangle Necklaces1," Find a hard and flat surface, like a table, to work at while you untangle the knot.The flat and hard surface will provide stability when you begin working through the tangles and will prevent other tangles from forming during the process.


Be sure that your workspace has plenty of light so you can see the knots and tangles clearly.It helps to work on a black or white background, so the knots in the necklace stand out against the stark colors.;
, If you have one necklace that is tangled, unclasp the fasteners connecting the two ends of the necklace.If you have multiple necklaces tangled together, undo the clasp or latch for each one.


Undoing the clasp will separate the necklace strand, allowing the ends of the necklace to slide more easily through the knotted areas.

Lubricating oils like baby oil or olive oil are safe to add to necklaces, and can be easily washed off., Poke the sharp tips of two needles into the center of the knot. While in the middle of the knot, gently pull the needles away from each other to open and loosen the knot.Once you get an opening in the knot, use the needles to pull apart each strand of the necklace within the knot.Be very patient during this untangling step. It can be very easy to get frustrated working with such concentration on such a small scale.


Any fine needle such as a sewing needle, safety pin, or thumb tack will work for this untangling process., Once the necklace has been untangled, you can remove the oil or baby powder you previously added by dunking the soiled portion of the necklace into a mixture of mild detergent and water.Rinse off the necklace with clean water, and gently dry the necklace with a paper towel or a soft cloth.

The pendant will not be able to fit through the straw.
If your necklace has an immovable pendant, consider cutting the straw in half, threading one chain on the side of the pendant through the straw., Rather than keeping all of your necklaces in a jewelry box, consider using a necklace tree (the “tree’s” branches allow necklaces to hang) or create your own necklace hanger.You can use pins and a bulletin board to make a fun, unique jewelry hanger.


Keep in mind, heavy necklaces might not hang very securely on the pins.

, Insert your necklace into a small, snap closure bag (the kind buttons come in with new clothes) and leave the clasp closure outside of the bag.Snap as much of the small baggie as you can shut, except for the area where the clasp is hanging out.


The small baggie will keep the necklace contained without jumbling the chain together.

Check your warranty before beginning repairs or investing in tools.,

Fix stubborn dents using a buffing wheel or polishing lathe.,
Use a fine emery cloth to smooth out any marks.,
Give the ring a home cleaning.,
Take your ring in for a professional cleaning.",How to Fix a Bent Ring," Many jewelers offer free repair services, such as reshaping dents, resizing, and cleaning. Dig out your warranty, see what it covers, and determine whether its coverage is lifetime or has a time limit.


Poor fit is a common cause of bent rings, so consider having it professionally resized, especially if your warranty covers it.;
, If your ring’s shank has gem settings, having it professionally repaired is preferable to attempting to fix it yourself. A home repair would risk damaging the settings or knocking out small precious stones.In addition to any gem settings on the ring's sides, think about the hardness of its metal before attempting a home repair. Metals like copper, brass, nickel, silver, and gold are fairly malleable, while titanium, tungsten, and tungsten carbide are more difficult or even impossible to reshape.If you're not sure what your ring is made out of, consider consulting a jeweler for assistance before attempting to reshape it.

, A mandrel is a tapered dowel used for resizing and repairing rings. They’re made of either wood or metal, come in various sizes, and can be purchased online for around 5 to 15 US dollars.When choosing a mandrel, go for one made of a sturdy wood, such as maple. Using a metal mandrel can damage your ring if the tool is made of a harder material than your jewelry.
Most mandrels are graduated, which means they’re marked with ring sizes. When you search for one on either a specialty jewelry store or general online marketplace, check the product’s description to see if it’s the right fit for your ring size.

, Mallets used for shaping metal without damaging it are typically made out of rawhide, wood, or rubber. You can find a proper mallet by searching online for a jewelry tool store or running a search on any online marketplace, such as eBay or Amazon. You can purchase one for around 5 US dollars or less., If you have some experience working with jewelry, investing in a buffer or lathe can make manipulating and polishing rings much easier. Stubborn dents are easier to repair using a buffer, since the friction makes the metal more malleable.You can find buffing wheels online, but they are fairly expensive, costing 100 US dollars or more.

, After assembling your tools, place the bent ring onto the mandrel. Slip it down the cylinder’s shaft until it can’t go any further. Avoid forcefully pushing it down past the point on the shaft where it rests, or you’ll risk warping it even more., Use gentle but firm pressure by working your fingers around the ring’s surface. Do your best not to push the ring down the shaft, but to press and mold it to the mandrel’s circular shape. If your ring is only slightly bent and made of a soft metal, you might find that you can mold it to an acceptable level of roundness using only your fingers., If your ring needs a little more work, tap it with the mallet on all sides. Use a lighter touch at first, and gradually increase your tap strength as needed. Carefully check the ring’s shape and your progress throughout the process.Use a magnifying glass to check your progress if you have trouble seeing.
Focus on spots that are particularly dented with five or six strong taps. Check your progress, then repeat tapping as necessary.

, Sometimes, a home repair using a mandrel and mallet can’t remove stubborn dents. If you have trouble getting your ring to an acceptable shape, you might consider using a buffer to make the ring more malleable. You can invest in one for yourself, or ask crafty friends or acquaintances if they have the equipment on hand.If your attempt at a home fix can’t remove a dent, you’ll probably want to bring the ring to a professional, especially if you don’t have access to or experience using buffing equipment.

, If your ring has responded well to the mandrel and mallet technique, you can proceed to buff out any scratches or wear that might have resulted. Use a fine-grit emery board or cloth to smooth out any subtle marks, or consider using a fine sandpaper to remove deeper scratches.Be sure to move the buffing material steadily in one direction rather than use a back-and-forth motion.

, Apply your favorite jewelry cleaner or a polishing agent suitable for the ring’s material using a toothbrush, soft cotton cloth, or cotton swab.If your ring has a harder stone, like a diamond or sapphire, or no stone at all, you can use a solution of one part ammonia to four parts lukewarm water to give a cleaning and polish.If your ring has a softer stone, like pearl or opal, or is an antique or costume jewelry, use lukewarm water and a drop of very mild soap or baby shampoo. Avoid using harsher soaps like dish detergent., After finishing a home repair, you might want to get your ring professionally polished and cleaned instead of cleaning it yourself. If you purchased the ring with a jeweler, call them and ask if they offer free cleanings. Many shops offer free or inexpensive polishing and cleaning services, especially to customers with whom they’ve already done business."

Know what tone of blue you want.,
Take the hue into consideration.,
Look at the transparency of the stone.,
Consider a fancy color sapphire.,
Be aware of how origin affects the price.,
Pay attention to cut.,
Expect more inclusions with blue sapphires.,
Do not be afraid of picking out a treated sapphire.",How to Buy Sapphire1," Sapphires come in blues, with the lightest being Sweden princess blue and the darkest being navy or black. The most prized color is royal blue, which is in the middle of the scale. As the most prized, however, it is also the most expensive. Camelot and commodore blues, which are one shade lighter and darker, respectively, are similar in hue but slightly more affordable.;
, Blue sapphires can be pure blue, or they can be tinted by green or purple.By value, pure blue ranks highest with slight purple tints following shortly after. Strong purple hues and any green hue are generally considered undesirable.

, Transparency is often overlooked when buying sapphires, but the more transparent a stone is, the more brilliant it will look. Transparent stones can also be expensive, though. Fully transparent and semi-transparent stones allow the most light to pass through. Translucent sapphires allow light to pass through, but obscure objects, making it a good compromise between transparency quality and budget. Semi-opaque and opaque stones allow little to no light to pass through., While blue is the most common color for a sapphire, these gemstones also come in several other colors. Padparadscha sapphires, which are orange-pink, are rare and considered valuable. Pink sapphires are also popular. Colorless, yellow, and green sapphires are significantly less prized.

, Where a sapphire was mined can have a huge impact on its overall cost. Sapphires mined in Kashmir, Mogok, Burma, and Ceylon are usually more prized than those mined elsewhere.Typically, that is because the quality of sapphires coming from these mines is higher than those coming from most other locations. This is not always true, though, and paying for origin is a little like paying for a brand name. You can save money by purchasing quality sapphires from ""lesser"" mines.

, Cut does not refer to the shape of the stone. Rather, it refers to the facets on a gem's surface, which allow light and color to shine through at their best. A deep cut sapphire has better color, while shallow stones often look too big for their own weight and look lighter in tone. The cut of a sapphire is usually rated on a scale of excellent, very good, good, fair, and poor.


Look for ratings from an official gemstone organization, like the Gemological Institute of America. Jewelers may provide their own rating, but it is usually more generous than the official GIA rating.

, A sapphire's clarity grade refers to the number of inclusions or cracks inside a stone. The fewer cracks, the more expensive a stone will be. Look for an official rating from a gemstone association like the GIA.


VVS (slightly included), VS (slightly included), and SI1 (slightly included) stones have few inclusions, and the inclusions they have do not affect the brilliance of the stone.
SI2 stones have inclusions that are obvious under magnification but have a minor effect on the stone's brilliance.
I1, I2, and I3 have inclusions and surface blemishes that are obvious even without magnification.

, Most sapphires are heat-treated. Jewelers heat sapphires in an oven under high temperatures for several hours, thus enriching the color of the stone. Untreated stones that are free of inclusions and possess superior color are rare and expensive, but because heat treatment is so commonplace, a heat-treated sapphire can still be valuable.

Remember the Four C’s.,
Find out their Origin.,
See if it has a Return Policy.,
Know about the treatments.,
Find out the Product Details.,
If you are choosing sapphire and diamond jewelry, remember you can save some by choosing diamonds of a lower quality and tip the costs a little.

,
Pick the correct Metal.,
Build your own.",How to Buy a Sapphire Online," The Four C’s, as in diamonds, is applicable to sapphires as well. These are: Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat. Unlike in diamonds, color in sapphires is the most relevant feature. While we are here, remember that while blue is the mostly popular color of sapphires, they are found in colors like yellow, pink, purple, orange and the rare Padparadscha ..


Blue Sapphires are known to vary in hue and tone and saturation; three color qualities. An even tone, medium saturation and deep hue are the best. For variations in these qualities, prices are affected.
Clarity feature in sapphires refers to the inclusions or flaws in a sapphire. Sometimes invisible to the naked eye, these are the ‘fingerprints’ of a gemstone. Visible at certain degrees of magnification, they are widely accepted in the industry; though fewer would always mean higher cost.
Cut refers to how well a sapphire has been cut, to optimize its beauty. A very good sapphire can be marred by inexpertise of the cutter, so this is another vital C.
Carat is the weight of a sapphire, and naturally the larger a sapphire, the higher the cost. However, if the size is large, but other features like color and clarity are lower, even a larger sapphire may not cost the earth.;
, Sapphires are also valued by their place of origin. The best known sapphires in history have come from Ceylon. Some other sources of sapphires are Madagascar, Burma, Thailand and Africa.

, This is most relevant to you when buying a sapphire online. You don’t want to make an expensive error of buying a sapphire that looked otherwise in the catalog, and is a tad lower in your hands. Study the Return Policy of the Jeweler carefully before buying.

, Treatments have been a part of the gemstone industry for centuries together; and were it not for these, we wouldn’t know our gemstones as we do. However, now the jewelers are required to disclose treatments that a gemstone has undergone. Also known as enhancements, there are a range of these, and mostly permanently enhance the beauty of a gem.

, Read the product details and description carefully. Be sure this sapphire is exactly what you want.

,, Metal preference can also affect the cost. Usually, 10K gold is lower than 18K gold; both yellow gold finish, as well as white gold.

, A fun way to buy jewelry online is to build your own. Most sites offer to customize jewelry, and you can choose the sapphire according to your budget.

"
"
Set a budget.,
Choose a metal setting that complements the stone.,
Be aware of potential fakes.,
Only work with reputable dealers.,
Save by buying loose, wholesale sapphires.,
Shop online and in stores.,
Shop around at various jewelers.",How to Buy Sapphire2," Know how much you can afford to spend before falling in love with a sapphire out of your price range. Sapphires can range in price from $50 per carat to more than $10,000 per carat, with the most expensive sapphire sold on record costing $135,000 per carat.The price of a sapphire is determined mostly by quality, and a large, low-quality sapphire can be a lot cheaper than a small yet very high-quality sapphire. For sapphires, color is king. Cut has the biggest impact on a stone's brilliance (how much light comes to the eye). Transparency and clarity (the number of inclusions) are also important in determining value.

, Settings made of cool tones metals like silver and white gold usually complements blue sapphires best. Padparadscha sapphires can look great in yellow gold settings, though, and pink sapphires look good in both silver and gold settings.

, Less reputable sellers may try to sell unwitting buyers a cheaper stone that looks like sapphire instead of a sapphire. Tanzanite, blue spinel, and blue tourmaline are among the stones that some may try to pass off as being true sapphires.

, National chains are often a good place to start because their business practices are more closely scrutinized than those of individual stores. If you do look at the selection offered by local jewelers and individual sellers, make sure that you ask to see the official certification of any sapphire you consider buying. A legitimate jeweler will be able to present you with certification from the GIA or independent, official gemstone societies.

, Retailers drive the price of sapphires up, since they need to charge beyond the price they paid for the stones to make a profit. Retail wholesalers, however, can sell you loose stones at close to wholesale prices. Buying loose stones and having them set separately can also cost less than buying pre-set stones, and loose stones allow you more chance to customize the piece of jewelry.

, Both settings have pros and cons. Shopping for sapphires online often proves cheaper than buying sapphire jewelry in store. On the other hand, shopping for sapphires in person allows you to examine the quality of the stone and the validity of the certificate with your own eyes before making a purchase.

, Each jeweler will have a slightly different stock of sapphires. As a result, you may be able to find two similar designs at different prices. As with anything else, shopping at multiple stores—both online and in person—improves your odds of finding the best quality sapphire for your budget.

Ask to see official grading reports, such as a GIA report, before purchasing a diamond.",How to Choose a Diamond," While cut refers more to quality and level of brilliance, the shape is one aspect of the cut. Review the possible shapes available on the market, and choose the one you like best. If buying a diamond for someone else, ask his/her opinion before selecting a shape, or bring a trusted friend/family member.


Select a popular, classic shape if you have no one to ask. The most popular shapes are round brilliant, princess, and cushion cut.Consider a non-traditional shape if the receiver has a non-traditional personality. Also, note that less common shapes can be 30%, for the same karat weight and quality!Less common shapes that are still fairly popular include marquise, oval, pear, and heart.;
, A diamond's cut determines the vast majority of its brilliance, and many consider the cut to be the most important factor when choosing a diamond. Ask the jeweler to see the Gemological Institute of America's (GIA’s) diamond grading report for any diamond you consider purchasing. This report will give you a rough grade on cut:


Select an ""Ideal Cut"" diamond for the highest level of perfection.
Choose a ""Very Good"" or ""Excellent"" grade diamond for a slightly less expensive yet high-quality stone.
Consider a ""Good"" grade if you want to balance the other C's and still stick to a budget.
Never purchase a fair to poor quality diamond, especially for engagement rings and other gifts. Diamonds at these levels severely lack brilliance., The pavilion side is the lower side of a diamond, which isn’t visible enough and has no impact on its sparkling style. Chevrons are of particular importance when considering the princess cut diamonds. These are the facets at the pavilion side of the diamond surrounding the main pavilion. Most princess cuts have two, three or four chevrons. The more the chevrons, the more the light gets reflected upon.There is no ""right"" number of chevrons, just personal preference. More chevrons lead to a more multifaceted look, whereas less has a smoother look., Diamonds are dressed in a considerable amount of sparkle and brilliance, making a diamond’s inclusions less noticeable. The various clarity levels associated with diamonds are F to IF, VVS1 to VVS2, VS1 to VS2, SI1 to SI2, I1 to I3. A reputable jeweler will be honest about a stone's grade and will answer any questions about what that grade means.


Buy flawless, FL, or internally flawless, IF, for stones without any internal imperfections. These are very rare, though, and very expensive.
Consider VVS1 or VVS2 clarity grades for high-quality diamonds with very, very small inclusions that are invisible to the untrained eye, even with a 10-power magnifier.
Look at VS1 or VS2 grades for diamonds that are flawless to the naked eye with very minor inclusions.
Consider a diamond with an SI1 or SI2 rating for a stone with small inclusions that are still invisible to the naked eye, but easy to spot with a magnifier. These stones appear high quality to the vast majority of individuals looking at them, and are also less strenuous on your budget., Since most tints are extremely difficult to see, a higher grade for color does not make much difference in quality. It can, however, make a huge difference in price.


Select a D grade (blue white) for an absolutely colorless diamond only if the price is of no concern.
Look E or F diamonds (""ice white"" or ""fine white,"" respectively) if you cannot afford a D grade diamond but still want a stone that is colorless with any band, on any skin tone.
Diamonds rated H, I, and G are considered white, with H representing the top quality white. Note that, while these diamonds appear completely colorless, they do have a light yellow tint against a bright white background. That said, this tint disappears when set into a metal band, as no metal is solid white.
Though still white or colorless against most backgrounds, J - M diamonds run from ""top silver"" (J) to ""light cape"" (M), a cheaper silver coloring. When set on a colored band like gold, they appear colorless, though they may have a tint on whiter metals like platinum.

, Fluorescence appears when a diamond is exposed to ultraviolet light, but usually has no effect on a diamond in regular light conditions. On rare occasions, strong fluorescence can alter the appearance of a diamond's color, sometimes causing it to look milky or oily.


Consider a diamond with medium fluorescence or strong fluorescence if on a tight budget, since these diamonds are often discounted.

, This is for the high-rollers out there, as these diamonds are expensive. They will, however, stand out from the crowd. Red and pink fancy diamonds are rare, beautiful, and expensive -- and the most popular ""fancy"" diamond.

, This does not affect the quality of the stone in any way, so a heavier weight does not necessarily indicate a higher quality stone. Note, however, that this may not be possible on a budget. Do you want a slightly smaller stone at higher quality, or the opposite?, The most common sizes for engagement rings are 1/2 karat, 1 karat, and 2 karat. People often choose common karat weights, which are known in the industry as ‘magic weights’. Because they are common, the price of diamonds at these weights is usually disproportionately higher than diamonds just below the magic weight e.g. a 0.98 karat diamond may be significantly less expensive than a 1 karat diamond, with no visible difference in size.

, Not all women prefer many karats. Some may place quality over size while others may be willing to sacrifice a bit of quality for a more noticeable diamond.


Ask the recipient herself about her preference.
Ask close friends or family about the recipient's preference.

, Women with more petite hands may prefer the look of a smaller stone to larger stones that have a tendency to overwhelm. However, women with larger hands may drown out a small stone, making it appear smaller than it really is.

, Make a list of the precious and long-lasting metals. Here, it is important that the band material lasts just as long as the stone. Metals like gold, silver and platinum are not only beautiful but last long for years. Choosing among them is usually a balance of beauty and budget.



Gold is perhaps the most common band, as it looks great with any stone or skin tone. Look for gold and its variants like yellow, rose and white gold to further customize the ring to your hand.

Silver is yet another metal that is affordable and suits almost every skin tone. Out of the various variants of silver, sterling silver is the best comprising of 92.5 percent pure silver, and 7.5 percent mixed alloys. As such, it is the most affordable and a durable ring band option.
You can go for platinum bands if budget is not a problem for them. Platinum is considered as the most lustrous of all precious metals and is getting widespread popularity for diamond and engagement rings.

, Considering karat weight when making gold band selection is important. 24 karat gold has the highest amount of pure gold. Moreover, due to the higher amount of pure gold, 24 and 22 karat gold are softer than 18 or 14 karat gold. creating a greater chance for jewelry to scratch or bend.

, Assuming you're choosing a diamond for a ring, you will have a choice about what kind of setting to place it in. The cut you picked will be a big factor here. For example, on a princess cut diamond, you'll want to choose a setting that protects the stone's corners., You'll want to make sure you match the color and grade of any accent diamonds to the center stone since that is your focal point. These are usually smaller diamonds or even other colored jewels., Doing so will help you choose the highest quality diamond you can find for your money. Diamonds are expensive, and salespeople might try to upsell you if you're not prepared. Make a budget and stick with it.Do a little online research before heading to the mall to judge prices.
It is not terrible to shop over two days. Use the first to see prices across different jewelers, then come back the next day to make your purchase.

, Learn as much as you can about diamond quality and price to prevent yourself from getting cheated. This can also help you bargain a little bit, especially if you know the grades, ratings, and color information in the steps above.

, Visit several different jewelers for a wider selection and price range. Always ensure that you compare prices, and that a price that you are offered is fair. It’s a good idea to compare any price that you are quoted in a brick and mortar jeweler to the price of an identical diamond from a reputable online retailer, as can be up to 50% savings to be found on an identical diamond by buying online., While your personal preference is important, don't let yourself get scammed into paying more than you want. Once you know you like the diamond, check out the grades on the GIA report before plunking down a ton of money.

Look into buying loose wholesale gemstones.,
Only buy from trustworthy jewelers.,
Be wary of discounts when buying natural emeralds.",How to Shop for Emeralds," Hue refers to the purity of an emerald's color, and it is one of three points to consider regarding color quality. Most emeralds have a blue-green tint, while others may have a yellow-green tint. The most valuable have little to no tint, however, and are as pure green as possible.;
, Tonal color refers to the lightness or darkness of an emerald. Natural emeralds range from very light to very dark, and the most valuable emeralds generally fall on the darker end of the scale. High quality emeralds generally have a tonal color that falls between medium to very dark.

, Saturation refers to the strength of an emerald's color, and it is, perhaps, the most important aspect of color quality. A richer saturation means more brilliance, which means that the emerald reflects light better. Weak saturation will cause an emerald to look dull and flat.

, No one shape is inherently more valuable than another, but some cuts may reflect light more easily. The rectangular ""emerald"" cut is, unsurprisingly, the most common for emeralds. Round, oval, pear, teardrop, and cabochon cuts are also fairly common.


In addition to maintaining a high degree of brilliance, emerald cuts allow gem cutters to yield the most saleable product from the rough crystal.

, Emeralds are a Type III gemstone, as rated by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA). This means that nearly all emeralds will have some inclusions, due to the softness of the stone. Opt for emeralds with interior inclusions rather than surface or near-surface inclusions, since interior inclusions are less likely to cause the stone to break later on.

, The GIA rates emeralds from VVS to I3.


VVS (Very, Very Slightly Included) emeralds have inclusions that are identifiable under magnification but not to the naked eye.
VS (Very Slightly Included) emeralds have inclusions that are obvious with magnification and detectable by the naked eye.
Sl1 and Sl2 (Slightly Included) emeralds have prominent inclusions that are obvious to the naked eye.
I1, I2, and I3 (Included) emeralds have inclusions that are large enough to potentially affect the gemstone's appearance and durability in a negative manner.
Note that the American Gem Trade Association (AGTA) and American Gemological Laboratories (AGL) each have separate yet accepted grading systems. Familiarize yourself with these systems if the jeweler you visit adopts these, instead.

, Clarity enhancements help seal some of the fissures and inclusions in an emerald, and are considered perfectly acceptable.


Verify that a clear treatment is used, since green-tinted treatments may be used to cover up or disguise a problem with the emerald's color quality.
Traditional enhancements use cedar oil or other similar, clear oils. Emeralds treated with oil may need to be retreated once the oil dries out.
Man-made epoxies and resins are another acceptable emerald treatment. These treatments wear out less easily but can wear away if exposed to high temperatures.

, Larger emeralds have more carats, but they also cost a lot more because a large emerald is considerably more difficult to mine. Most individuals find it easier to spot the quality of a large emerald. As a result, a large high-quality may look even more beautiful than a small high-quality emerald, but the flaws of a large low-quality emerald will also be more obvious.

, The finest emeralds typically come from three Colombian mines: Muzo, Chivor, and Coscuez. Other high-quality emeralds are mined in Brazil, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Madagascar, Nigeria, Russia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. Ask each jeweler where his or her company gets its emeralds.

, In many cases, emeralds from a specific mine share similar qualities.


Emeralds from the Muzo mine are usually a deep green with a slight trace of yellow or blue. These emeralds often have mineral parasites that appear as yellow-brown or red-brown needles.
Emeralds from the Coscuez mine often have a faint hint of blue and have an intense saturation.
Emeralds from the Chivor mine have deep blue tints and often have two phase tubular inclusions.
Spiral inclusions are also common to all Colombian emeralds.

, Emeralds have a hardness that ranges from 7.5 to 8 on the Mohs scale, making them relatively hard stones that are still capable of breaking if handled poorly. To ensure longevity of your emerald, you should choose settings that surround the stone with metal and offer a high level of protection. Bezel settings and V-prong settings are especially good.

, Emeralds created in a lab share all the physical and chemical properties that natural emeralds have. Many consider these emeralds to be less valuable, but you can find a large carat emerald with high-quality color and clarity for an affordable price if you opt for a lab-created stone.

, Some companies buy large quantities of stones at cheap, wholesale prices and resell these stones individually with little markup. Instead of buying finished pieces of emerald jewelry, buy loose stones from trusted retail wholesalers online and have a piece custom made. This option often proves more affordable and may allow for greater customization.

, Look for large chain stores and individual sellers that offer certification from the GIA, AGTA, AGL, or other widely accepted and reliable gemological societies.

, Natural emeralds are fairly rare, so many jewelers hesitate to sell them at large discounts. If you run across a seller offering high discounts on natural emeralds, you may want to second guess their credibility.

Determine if you want to buy fine or costume vintage jewelry.,
Research a particular era of jewelry.,
Check with reputable jewelry associations.",How to Shop for Vintage Jewelry1," When shopping for vintage jewelry, there are two main categories: fine and costume jewelry. Before setting out to shop, you should determine whether or not you are looking for a fine piece of designer jewelry made using precious metals and gemstones, or a more reasonably priced piece of costume jewelry likely made from different types of glass, plastic, stones, and wood. For example, if you are looking for a vintage engagement ring, you will likely want to stay away from costume jewelry.Keep in mind that fine vintage jewelry is much more expensive than costume jewelry, so your budget may dictate which type of jewelry to shop for.
That being said, vintage costume jewelry is often made from better quality material than modern costume jewelry and as a result these pieces last a long time. Some are even dipped in gold making them less likely to turn green or tarnish over time.;
, The label “vintage jewelry” covers all jewelry that is over 20 years old. As a result, this is a massive category that incorporates a lot of very different styles, fashions, and time periods. Before you begin shopping, you may want to narrow down your search to a particular era or type of jewelry. This way you can focus your research and shopping on a smaller subset of vintage jewelry.For example, you may be interested in the geometric shapes associated with the Art Deco period, alternatively you may like the intricate etchings of the early Victorian era, or the nature-inspired jewelry of the Georgian era.
Research online to find out some of the common characteristics of jewelry made during the time period you are interested in.

, When researching into vintage jewelry a great place to check is reputable jewelry associations. For example, the National Association for the Study of Jewelry and the Related Arts can provide you with a number of resources on the history of jewelry and how to identify vintage pieces from different historical eras. The association also provides dates and locations of vintage jewelry exhibitions, which can help to put you in contact with jewelry collectors, appraisers, and enthusiasts."

Ask about the history of the piece.,
Look for a mark or the initials of the designer.,
Examine the condition of the piece.,
Obtain documentation and authentication.,
Consider the price.",How to Shop for Vintage Jewelry3," When you are shopping for vintage jewelry, one way to ensure that you are not buying fake vintage, is to ask the seller about the history of a particular item. If the piece is actually vintage the seller should be able to explain how they came across the item. For instance, it may have been passed down through the family, purchased at an estate sale or auction, or found while antique hunting., Most vintage jewelry was marked by the jewelry maker, either with initials or small emblems. Use a magnifying glass to examine the jewelry for marks before purchasing. If you notice any discrepancies between marks then the piece is likely a fake or replica.Search online for pictures of well-known vintage jewelers' marks.
There may be instances when some older items of jewelry were not marked. For example, early pieces of Chanel jewelry were unmarked and different markings were used during different periods.If you can’t locate any markings, then ask the seller about the history of the piece.

, It is also important to carefully examine the condition of an item of jewelry before purchasing it. Although most vintage jewelry will have some minor signs of wear and tear, you want to make sure they are minimal. For instance, check for broken clasps, missing gems or jewels, as well as major scratches. All of these blemishes will decrease the value of the piece. Try and find gently used pieces that only have minor signs of wear.Most importantly check for good craftsmanship, which includes straight lines, and the symmetrical placement of stones.
Be wary of any jewelry marketed as vintage but that appears in mint condition.
In these instances ask the seller if the piece has been recently restored. This can decrease the value of the jewelry.

, When buying vintage jewelry ask the retailer to provide you with documentation concerning the origin of the piece. This documentation can add value to the item, making it more authentic. This will also help to ensure that you are buying legitimate vintage jewelry, instead of mass produced new jewelry designed to look like vintage jewelry. Different types of documentation and authentication include:Certificate of authentication from a professional.
Original receipts from when the jewelry was purchased that include the purchasers name.
A photograph showing the piece being worn.
Handwritten notes from previous owners.
Other documents showing the items history.

, You should always consider the price when you are shopping for vintage jewelry. Items that contain real diamonds and are made of gold will be pricey. If an item is being sold as a designer piece of gold jewelry, but is priced reasonably, it is likely fake. That being said, you do not have to break the bank to buy vintage jewelry. You can find very unique and beautiful pieces of vintage and antique costume jewelry that is reasonable priced.


Take into consideration the type of piece you want and make sure that you truly love the piece before purchasing it.

Wear the jewelry with care.,
Store in soft pouches.,
Clean using a polishing cloth.,
Have the piece checked by a jeweler every 6 months.",How to Shop for Vintage Jewelry4," Once you have purchased a piece of vintage jewelry, especially if it is made with real gold, silver, and/or gemstones, you will want to care for and properly look after the item. Some vintage jewelry will get scratched and break if you wear it carelessly. For example, you should avoid wearing vintage pieces while gardening, cleaning, and exercising. Cleaning uses harsh chemicals that could damage the jewelry, and the vigorous nature of exercise may result in breaking the jewelry.Only wear vintage pieces when you are not performing any strenuous tasks or working with dirt and chemicals.

, You should also store your vintage pieces in a safe, dry, cool, and soft environment. A fabric lined jewelry box will help to prevent the piece from getting scratched. You can also use added protection by placing the jewelry in a soft pouch before putting it into your jewelry box. If you have an extremely valuable piece (either in terms of cost or sentimental value), you may want to keep it in a locked safe for additional protection from theft.While traveling with vintage jewelry, wrap it separately so that it does not rub up against other items. Also, keep it in your carry on so that you do not lose any valuable items.

, Do not use modern jewelry cleaners on vintage items. They can be too powerful leading to corrosion that may actually damage the piece. Instead, stick to polishing with a gentle cloth. You can also research online how to clean specific materials such as gold and silver.If you are unsure of how to remove tarnish from your jewelry, ask a local jeweler for cleaning advice and suggestions.

, Another way to care for valuable vintage jewelry is to have them looked over by a jeweler once every 6 months or so. The jeweler will examine the piece and can spot any potential issues before they occur. For example, if your ring has a gem that it starting to come loose, the jeweler may be able to catch this in advance before you actually losing the vintage gem. This type of preventative care is recommended.If you do lose a gemstone, make sure that you replace it with another stone from the same era. This will help to maintain the value of your vintage jewelry.

Most of these imitations are cast instead of being fabricated by the hand.







Vintage fashion jewelry: Vintage fashion jewelry is also making a comeback. In the segment of the vintage jewelry, the glamorous styles of the 1940s are definitely the rage.

Get as much knowledge as you can.,
Compare the prices.,
Operate with the reliable.,
Check the certificate issuance.,
Appraise yourself.,
Be always informed about the current Rappaport report.",How to Shop for a Diamond," Time spent on educating upon diamonds is always a time well spent and it will help you to avoid multiple threats and tricks. A good way of action may be to find an independent and respected appraiser and pay a visit to him or her. Hiring this professional may be a wise choice too, in case you are sure he will not get kickback from the vendor.;
, There are only several places on Earth, where diamonds are found, that is why there are only several wholesale companies on the market, like De Beers. You are unable to contact them directly, unless you are a millionaire, so you will have to buy from the vendors. The basic prices for the gems of the same grade is the same, but every one of the vendors has their revenue and some have smaller, because they are a bit fairer or have better shipment contracts. Comparing prices in several boutiques of different companies before making a purchase will allow you to cut your expenses significantly.

, Diamonds are a very serious matter and each and every of them should be appraised. After appraisal, every gem receives the quality certificate, which states the gem’s grade, quality, clarity, carat weight and other parameters. In case the reliable and well-known appraising authorities like the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) or AGL (American Gemological Laboratories) issued those, this vendor may gain a credit of trust from you. Local authorities most likely have a kickback from the vendor and cannot be trusted blindly.

, Every certificate has some contacts list, allowing you to get in touch with the issuer. Big and reliable authorities have databases of all issued certificates, so you can contact them and check if everything matches. It will cost you some time, but it is better to wait for a week than to spend money on a fake. The certificate should be recent and outdated.

, After deciding to purchase a gem, sign a contract with the vendor for appraisal. Leave a deposit, but make sure it is refundable (get the vendor’s written agreement) and pay for appraisal by one or two local authorities. This will still cost much less, than the diamond and only if their certificates will match the vendor’s certificate, you may pay the rest of the money.

, This list is public and you can get access to it. If you know even the basics about the “4 C’s”, you will be able to trace the price dynamics and will know the real price for 1 carat of weight for every grade of the diamonds.

Wait until you can afford it.,
Commemorate a milestone.,
Invest in a valuable commodity.,
Determine what you want out of a Rolex.,
Browse at a brick-and-mortar store.,
Choose a model.,
Decide between new and used.,
Research your watch(es).,
Decide where to shop.",How to Buy a Rolex," As a luxury item, expect Rolexes to cost quite a bit of money. As of 2016, anticipate a starting price in the $4000-5000 range for the cheapest models. Budget accordingly and only purchase your Rolex when you can comfortably afford such an expensive item.Also note that:


Rolexes are often perceived as a status symbol, indicating a certain level of achievement in one’s life. So if you wish to impress people by suggesting that you have personally achieved this level (whether or not you actually have), Rolexes are certainly an option.
However, be aware that there is also a stigma attached to flashing a Rolex as a sign of success.Expect true enthusiasts to have a much more intimate knowledge of their timepieces beyond the pricetag.;
, Buy a Rolex to honor a special occasion. Mark a significant turning point in your personal life, or treat yourself after a major achievement in your career. Give yourself a carrot to follow so you have more time to save more money, rather than limiting yourself to the cheapest models as soon as you can afford one. Such occasions could include:Weddings
Birthdays
Anniversaries
Promotions
Retirement

, Trust the resale value of a Rolex to remain relatively consistent over time.Buy a timepiece with an eye toward the future, should you ever need an easy way to get hold of a significant sum of money fairly quickly. However:


Be aware that, as with most investments, there are no guarantees. Although there is a heavy trade in used Rolexes, play it safe and assume that you won’t get all your money back if you buy a brand-new one., First, ask yourself how often you plan to wear it: every day, in certain situations, or only very special occasions? Then review your style of dress in those circumstances. Lastly, consider whether this Rolex will be your only one, or the beginning of a collection.If this is to be your only Rolex, stick to classic designs. Avoid trendy elements that may grow out of date or would be hard to match with multiple outfits, such as irregular-sized cases or colored dials.

, Visit dealers in person so you can try on different models. Deal directly with staff so they can answer any questions that you might have. Then take time to think about your options and preferences. With such a hefty price-tag, make sure you are buying the watch you want.Questions to ask include: What materials are the components made of? Where do I locate serial numbers? What other markers show that it is a genuine Rolex?

, Based on your intended use, choose a Rolex that will complement your fashion sense. Decide between models in three different categories of watches: sport, dress, and “showy.”Sport watches are ideal for everyday wear with casual attire. Models include the Daytona, Explorer I and II, GMT-Master II, Sea-Dweller Deepsea, Submariner, and Yachtmaster.
Dress watches are for more formal/business attire. These include the Air King, Datejust II, Day-Date II, and Oyster Perpetual.
“Showy” watches incorporate more flashy design elements to standard models, such as precious metals and gems. These are best reserved for very special occasions or as collectibles.

, If you are first time buyer, think about these two primary considerations. Shop a new Rolex to ensure a working watch.Or, purchase a used Rolex to (possibly) save money.Other considerations include:


With new watches, you are able to buy directly from Rolex dealers, minimizing the risk of fakes. Also, contemporary designs are guaranteed.
With vintage watches, prices may actually rise due to scarcity of a particular model. There is also an increased chance that some elements have been replaced with other parts, which lowers its value., Once you have decided on a watch (or narrowed your list down to a couple choices), learn as much as you can about the product. Especially make a point of this if you plan on purchasing it from a source other than an official dealer. Use resources like internet forums, trade publications, and books to find out identifying marks like:Logos, fonts, and sizes.Reference numbers and where to find them.
What engravings it should have, and where.
Materials used for luminescence.

, Now that you know more about what you want, choose where to make your purchase. For the easiest stress-free experience, buy directly from an official dealer for peace of mind.If you shop elsewhere:


Research dealers through customer reviews and similar sources to eliminate iffy sellers.
Beware dealers that offer no warranties, return policies, or other forms of buyer protection.For “showy” watches, prioritize official dealers, since the design elements of used watches may have been added after the fact by sources other than Rolex."

Ask: Is the design provided by the buyer or does it belong to the manufacturer?,
Ask: Why is the first piece priced high?,
Ask: Why does the price fall as the volume increases?,
Ask: Are gemstone options limited?,
Ask: Should silver jewelry be plated?,
Ask: Is the craftsmanship always bad?,
Ask: What are benefits of good metal weight?,
Ask: How big is a wholesale order?,
Remember that many buyers of sterling silver wholesale jewelry would like to make smaller lots of jewelry to test the market and large orders might not be suitable in such cases.

,
Ask: What is the minimum order quantity by design ?",How to Order Wholesale Silver Jewelry," This will have a direct impact on the final price quoted by the seller. There is an initial overhead to be borne for design and mould charges and this will be added to the price tag of the first piece. If the initial order for wholesale silver jewelry is a large one, this initial charge is spread over a large volume and therefore does not increase the price per piece significantly.;
, One of the main reasons is explained in (a) above and involves the initial design and mould charge. Subsequent orders for the same design will use the same mould and therefore be sold at a lower price. In many cases the buyer, would first order a single piece, then place a wholesale order after receiving the first piece. In such a case the seller would have to protect himself from a situation where the buyer buys only the first piece from him and then looks for another seller to place the final order. The seller would thus like to recover all initial overheads from the first piece itself.

, Large orders of wholesale silver jewelry provide the seller with the economies of scale. Production is much easier as the design and moulds can be reused to manufacture the jewelry. Craftsmen do the production of the same design . multiple times thus reducing the chances of breakages and other losses. In cases where the wholesale silver jewelry also includes gemstones or diamonds, the seller gets a better price when bulk purchases are made. All these factors combine to enable the seller provide a better price to the buyer as the volume of the order increases.

, If you buy your wholesale silver jewelry from a seller who is also the manufacturer, there is no reason why the gemstone options should be limited. However, there is a price range within which, most buyers would like their silver jewelry to remain and this might influence the gemstone selected. Wholesale sterling silver jewelry made with gemstones like aquamarine, tourmaline, ruby and sapphire would be quite expensive and have a limited market.

, Plating on silver can be done with rhodium, white gold, yellow gold and even platinum. Plated wholesale sterling silver jewelry will look awesome when new but the plating will wear off with time and the jewelry might look quite shabby. The plating wears off in patches and in many cases the jewelry becomes a piece of junk. All silver jewelry manufacturers will provide plating at a small additional charge.

, This need not necessarily be true but once again the market price point influences the decision. Wholesale 925 silver jewelry is produced by a mechanized process, however it is possible to provide good hand finishing in the final production phase and improve the quality of the jewelry. This adds to the price tag and is therefore avoided in most cases.

, Wholesale silver jewelry is normally made with a low silver weight to save costs. This causes the jewelry to bend and twist at the smallest impact. The gemstones and diamonds will also be loosely mounted and could drop off at any time. A good silver weight on the other hand adds to the long term durability of the jewelry and the final consumer need not keep spending money for frequent repairs and modifications.

, As the number of manufacturers for wholesale silver jewelry decreases, those remaining in business set higher volume requirements to confirm orders. This could pose a problem for buyers as they might be left with inventory of unsold stocks.

,, This answer depends of the factory principally, but an order can start from 10 to 15 pieces for the same design. This is the minimum acceptable. Under this quantity the price by piece is too high. I explain, one worker can produce 2 pieces of one design in 1-2 days (example) and this same worker can produce 25 pieces of this same design in just 5-6 days.

Consider the types.,
Discover the materials.,
Know movement types.,
Decide on a style.,
Choose a brand.,
Consider the features.,
Adjust the fit.",How to Pick a Watch1," When you are picking out a watch, you should understand the different types you can buy. There are three main types of watches: analog, digital, and analog/digital. An analog watch holds hour and minute hands with the hours depicted with numbers, marks, or roman numerals. Digital watches display time in numerical form on either an LCD or LED face. Analog/digital watches combine the two other types into one watch.


Analog watches are typically considered traditional and are good for business and formal occasions as well as dates. Digital watches are very casual. Analog/digital watches are practical because they can be worn everyday and are also good for work, but they aren't for formal occasions.;
, There are two elements on a watch where materials matter. The case and the band will change materials depending on the brand, style, type, and price of the watch. The case, or part that holds the face of the watch, typically can be made of plastic, resin, metal such as steel, brass, or titanium, as well as precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. The bands can be made in all of the materials as cases, with the addition of materials such as canvas, leather (real and fake), and exotic skins.


The price of these materials vary greatly. Plastic will obviously be the cheapest, cheap, synthetic materials will fall next, leather and other skins will be slightly more, typical metals will be next, while the precious metal watches are typically the most expensive. Those prices will vary depending on the quality of the precious materials. For example, metal ranges from the least expensive 10K metals to the more expensive 18K metals., Movement types are the power sources for the watches. Watches use three basic movement types: battery, quartz, and mechanical. Battery movement utilizes batteries as the only source of power. Quartz movement runs when the power of a battery is sent through the quartz on the inside of the watch. Mechanical movement relies on the wearer winding the elements, which is either manual or automatic.


Battery watches are the cheapest and least luxurious. Digital watches and watches bought at department or clothing stores are typically battery watches.
Quartz watches are slightly more expensive than traditional battery watches, but are the most accurate of all the different types. They require little maintenance aside from occasionally replacing the battery and are not prized by collectors due to the simplicity of their design.
Mechanical watches are either wound by hand (manual) or are wound throughout the day by the movements of the wearer (automatic, or self-winding). These watches are the most expensive, most luxurious, and are prized most by collectors due to the intricacy of their design., You can buy watch styles specifically designed for sports, work, formal events, going out, and casual outfits. Where you are going to be wearing your watch should be the main factor in deciding what style of watch to buy. If you are going to use it while running, swimming, or you want some extra features dealing with heart rate, you should go with a sports watch. If you need a watch to wear to work, formal events, or dates, your best bet would be to buy a dress watch. If you just need a day to day watch to wear with everything, buy a casual watch. If you need it for all kinds of occasions from work to everyday life, go with a dress watch. It looks better when you wear casual clothes with a dress watch than it does to wear a casual watch with office attire.The gadget watch is an emerging style that keeps gaining popularity every year, though they are still most popular with tech savvy individuals. They have features that include things such as calendars, digital cameras, and e-mail programs, just to name a few.The different styles can range anywhere from simple to luxurious, depending on the brand, designer, price, and functions., Keeping your budget in mind, look through the kinds of brands that make watches and decide your favorites. Many companies have been around for years, so picking a brand can be overwhelming. Research the company's history to see how long they have been making watches and what styles they have. Ask your family and friends who have bought watches in the past what brands they like and have worked best for them. You can even do some online investigation, reading reviews about certain companies and their watch models. You need to make sure that the brand you choose has the style that you decide you want., When you are picking out the ideal watch, you need to know what feature you need and want included on your watch. All watches have basic models and more elaborate models. You can buy anything from a dress watch that only tells time to a casual watch that has a computer in it to a sports watch that will tell you your heart rate, the distance you've traveled, and calories burned, just to name a few. The more impressive the gadgets, the more expensive the watch. It truly depends on what your need your watch for. For example, if you are going to be doing a lot of international travel for business, you might think of buying a dress watch that allows you to tell time across multiple time zones. The possibilities are vast and varied.One main feature you may want to consider is the level of water resistance. The level of resistance needed depends on the amount of water that you want to wear your watch in. Generic water resistance will handle spills and rainstorms. The upper levels of water resistance vary from 50 meter to 1000 meter resistance, which covers washing dishes to deep sea scuba diving and everything in between., When you have found all the elements on a watch that you like, you now need to take the last step, which is to make sure that the watch fits you. You want your watch band to be tight enough that it doesn't slide around your wrist but loose enough that it doesn't cut off your circulation. You want the watch case to be small or large enough to look proportionate on your arm but not go too much in the other direction either way.


A good size test for your watch is to try to shift your watch up and down your arm. If it can move, it is too small. If it doesn't and it leaves an imprint on your wrist when you remove it, it is too big. If it doesn't leave an imprint and you can't shift it up and down your arm, then your watch fits perfectly.
If you are a tall or husky guy, you need to ensure that the watch band is not going to be too small for you and that the watch face isn't too small for your proportions. If you have small wrists or a slight frame, you need a smaller watch band and face."

Buy for $750-2,000.,
Spend $2,000-$5,000.,
Shop with $5,000 or more.",How to Pick a Watch2," Some people are willing to spend more on a watch than others. When you first start looking into watches, decide what price range you are comfortable with. Ask yourself what you need to watch for, and then decide what price you are willing to pay to fulfill that need. Watches can be as low as $20 at a department store to over $25,000 from a designer company. The price varies depending on style, material, brand, and movement.Keep in mind that the kind of watch you want will factor in to the price. If you can, have a little bit of wiggle room in your price just in case you want or need an expensive feature., There are many types of watches that can be bought on a modest budget. You can expect materials such as cloth, leather, and stainless steel on the casing and bands. They have battery and solar quartz movement and low to moderate water resistance. Many sports watches come in this range, though some of the more technologically advanced options will cost more. If you buy from a major retailer, watches can be extremely cheap, but you will not likely find any with advanced features or long lasting materials unless you spend a little bit more. Most department stores carry watches in many price ranges, but you can find watches within this range from good brands that are good quality.


In you are looking at major retailers such as Target and Walmart, try brands such as Timex and Casio. These are typically under $100. For example, the Timex Expedition Dive Style Chronograph Watch has a stainless steel band and casing, battery quartz movement, analog display, and water resistance up to 200 meters. It also has the bonus feature of a night mode, which illuminates the screen even with no natural light.
Department stores like Macy's offer brands such as Guess, Tommy Hilfiger, and Fossil. They are typically between $250-300. For example, the Seiko SKS407 has a stainless steel case and band, analog display, quartz movement, and water resistance up to 100 meters. It also has three additional dials that measure minutes, seconds, and milliseconds as well as a date counter., You can still get features such as rubber, cloth, and leather bands, stainless steel casing, and quartz movement in this range, but there are better brands such as Bulova, Hugo Boss, and Armani, as well as better materials and more advanced features available at this level. Most major retailers will not carry watches this expensive, but department stores and stores for the specific brands do carry watches within this range.


Bulova is one of the best brands available at this level. Their watches look like high end watches but are in a price range that is affordable. They are also good if you want a sturdier material than stainless steel. Look for watches like the Bulova 96B133, which has a titanium band and case, quartz movement, and with a water resistance of 300 meters., Once you get over $750, you can start buying in some more high end department stores such as Nordstrom. You can also buy more high end watch brands such as Shinola and Movado. They come in leather, stainless steel, titanium, varying degrees of water resistance, and have analog faces with quartz movement.


Two major features that can make watch more expensive in this range is the Swiss construction and the PVD coating. The Swiss are known for their watch making abilities, making their watches higher end than others. The PVD coating is resistant to wear and tarnish.
Look for watches like a Movado Sapphire Synergy, which has a scratch resistant face, swiss quartz movement, and PVD stainless steel., At this level, you can now buy watches with manual movement and diamonds. You can also buy from high end designers such as Gucci and Givenchy. The quality of the watches also increase, with fine made materials and long lasting construction.


Look for watches like the Gucci G Chrono collection. It has stainless steel construction, a scratch resistant face, and 54 diamonds measuring almost a carrot around its face. , Once you get in this range, the watches can vary greatly depending on the material and designer. Watch designers such as Rolex, Cartier, Glashütte, Patek Philippe, and A. Lange & Söhne have watches that can range from $5,000 to $100,000 and beyond. The materials include all the precious metals, although some are still stainless steel. The movement is almost entirely manual. Rolex does does have a lower priced collection of Air Kings, which retail for under $6,000.If you want to be extremely extravagant, try the Audemars Grand Royal Oak Offshore Complications. They are self-winding, scratch resistant, water resistance up to 20 meters, analog, have four additional dials, and made of 18k pink and white gold. They run over $750,000.

Clean your stone with a toothbrush and dish soap.",How to Shop for Sapphires," Are you looking for a larger stone, or a certain shape? Would you like to buy a sapphire that is the traditional blue, or are you looking for a sapphire in a different color? Before you go shopping, decide what size, shape, and color sapphire you’re looking for.


If you are looking for an engagement or wedding ring, make sure you have a set budget before you go shopping. If you establish a budget prior to shopping, you might be more likely to keep to it and only look at stones in your price range.
Consider if you want a custom designed piece of jewelry, or if you want to buy a ready-made piece. Or, alternatively, you can purchase loose stones. If you want loose stones or a custom design, you may have to visit specific dealers that offer these services.
Also, consider the preferences and desires of the person you are buying the sapphire for. If it is an engagement ring, for example, make sure you pick a sapphire that your partner will enjoy and want to wear.;
, Like most precious gemstones, sapphires are priced based on color, cut, clarity, and carat size. The first measure for pricing a sapphire is its color. Lighter blue sapphires with violet or purple undertones will likely be priced the highest—around $1,000USD for a single carat stone.Sapphires come in many different colors, but each color will be accompanied by a different value and price. Sapphire value is based on the basic color of the gem as well as any secondary hues and tones that appear when light hits the stone. For example, a yellow sapphire that has green or gray undertones is less valuable than a yellow sapphire that is more pure, with white undertones, or flashes.Look for any brown or gray hues in the stone. These types of tones diminish the value of the gem. You want a sapphire that has a deep, rich saturation of one color., Sapphires traditionally come in a cushion, an oval, or rounded shape. There are a variety of other less common shapes, but you are most likely to find sapphires cut into these specific shapes while shopping.Pick a sapphire that has a cut that best shows off the luster and shine of the stone. A good cut will enhance these qualities, and appear more brilliant when it catches the light.The table of the stone, which is the flat surface across the top, should be level and smooth, and there should not be any dull areas on the stone when it moves and catches light.

, With sapphires, unlike other precious stones like diamonds, you can check the clarity with the naked eye. If you can look at the sapphire and confirm that there are no dark spots or discrepancies in the stone, it it likely very valuable.Because of the environment in which sapphires form, some “inclusions” or tiny specks from other minerals, are a normal occurrence. It’s the deep color of sapphires that helps cover or mask these slight imperfections, and still allows the stone to be considered very valuable.

, Most sapphires undergo certain treatments prior to being placed on the market. These treatments are designed to enhance color, shine, and overall appearance. Some treatments, though, can diminish the value of the stone, and undermine the integrity of the coloring and appearance.Most sapphires you buy from a jeweler likely underwent heat treatment, which is used to sharpen the color of the sapphire and eliminate blemishes and imperfections in the stone. It doesn’t substantially lower the value of the stone, though, and it is appropriate to assume that most of the stones you will find at a jewelry store underwent this process, unless it is otherwise noted.A treatment called irradiation is sometimes used on sapphires, particularly those that are yellow in color. This process can cause the stone to become easily diminished or damaged by further heat or light exposure, and it can dramatically devalue the stone. Make sure your chosen stone was not treated with irradiation. There is often a label on stones treated with this method, but even if there is not a label, ask the dealer or jeweler to provide you with that documentation., There are a good deal of synthetic sapphires on the market, and you don’t want to end up paying for a genuine stone and not receiving it. Make sure you pick a dealer that has a straightforward return and refund policy. That way, you can take the ring to be evaluated after you purchase it, and return it if it turns out to be synthetic.Ask around. If you know anyone who recently went ring or jewelry shopping, ask about their experiences with different jewelers in the area. You want to pick a jeweler you can trust and work well with, since purchasing precious gemstones is likely going to be a hefty financial investment.

, Well-known stores like Tiffany & Co. have beautiful stones and generally good reputations, but you will end up paying more just for the name and the buying experience at these stores. Try to go to a locally owned and operated jeweler to avoid these extra costs.Locally or family owned jewelers might also have more room to negotiate price with you than a big retailer. Negotiation is possible with any dealer, but with an independent dealer, you might be less likely to pay for the extra services and add-ons that name brands tack on.

, If you want something with a little more history and charm, try estate sales or auctions in the area. Make sure any sapphire you purchase from an estate sale comes with proper documentation as proof of authenticity.Even if the ring or stone comes with documentation, take it to be evaluated as a condition for purchasing it. Make sure an appraiser can verify its value before you buy it., Some jewelers are a bit slower with sales in the summer months, and might be more willing to negotiate on price at these slower times. Even if you are getting engaged and don’t plan to pop the question for a few more weeks, buying at the right time could save you a good amount on the ring of your choice.Keep an eye on sales in the area. If you plan to finance your sapphire, watch for financing specials that might include things like 0% interest, or lower monthly payments.

, Most synthetic sapphires have the same appearance and qualities of a genuine sapphire, but cost much less, and will be a lot easier to fit into a smaller budget.Rather than being naturally grown and mined, these sapphires are grown in a lab setting. They have the same basic atomic properties as a natural sapphire, but cost less and have less of an impact on the environment as a result of not requiring mining., Diamonds especially can cause some damage to the surface of your sapphire, so avoid wearing a diamond close to a sapphire, and storing them in the same pouch.To be safe, keep your sapphire in a soft, protective pouch or box when you are not using or wearing it. This will keep it away from other gemstones and environmental damage., Like many other types of precious stones, chlorinated water can be damaging to the color and surface of your sapphire. Make sure you take it off and store it in a safe place before swimming.Remove and store your ring before swimming in the ocean, as well. Getting into cold water can cause your fingers to shrink a bit, and you might be more prone to lose your ring in the water from it slipping off., Try not to use a soap that has any kind of scrubbing beads or abrasive element in it. Use the toothbrush, soap, and warm water to gently scrub the surface of your sapphire. If it is set in a ring, make sure to scrub gently around the setting.However your sapphire is set, be sure to consider that setting when cleaning. Certain metals, like gold and silver, react badly to things like ammonia. Make sure you aren’t accidentally damaging the setting of your gem."

Look at your gemstones in overhead lighting.,
Pick up the gemstone with tweezers.,
Use a magnifying glass.",How to Choose a Blue Gemstone1," Overhead lighting allows for the best viewing, and it will help you see the surface characteristics of the gem. A neutral-colored background will allow you to differentiate between the different shades and intensities of blue. By minimizing the visual “noise,” you can focus on the gemstone.Despite popular belief, natural light is not always the best light to examine gemstones. Natural lighting varies greatly depending on geographic location and time of day.However, holding gemstones up to natural lighting is still a good supplementary view to get an idea of the gem's clarity.;
, If you are going to be picking up the gemstone while examining it, it’s important to do so with tweezers. Using your fingers will cause smudging, which will certainly distract from the stone. Fingerprints will decrease the stone’s clarity and the color’s intensity.If you don't have tweezers on hand, try scooping the gem up with stiff card stock or something similar.
If you absolutely must pick it up with your hand, grasp it carefully and touch as little of the stone as possible.

, By examining the gemstone with a magnifying glass, you can see qualities of the stone not visible to the naked eye. This will help you look closer at the surface of the stone, noting all of the gemstone’s most intricate characteristics. Use the magnifying glass to really observe the intensity of color and ensure it is the stone you want.Inspect the tone and consistency of the color. Also look for internal flaws and inclusions."
"
Take measurements of your face.,
Determine the shape of your face.,
Match your face shape with the right jewelry.",How to Choose the Right Jewelry for Your Skin Tone and Face Shape2," These measurements are going to tell you what shape of face you have so you can match your face to the best jewelry that complements that shape. You will need a flexible tape measure and something to pull back your hair (like hair clips or a hair tie). It helps to look in a mirror while you are taking measurements.Tie back your hair so that it is out of your face. If you are using clips you can clip your hair to the back or top of your head.
Measure your hairline (in inches or centimeters). With your tape measure, place one end at your left front temple (just below the hairline), and the other end at your right temple. Write down that number.
Measure your cheekbones (in inches or centimeters). With your tape measure, place one end at the top of your left cheekbone (just above the apple of your cheek), and the other end at the top of your right cheekbone. Write down that number.
Measure your jawline (in inches or centimeters). With your tape measure, place one end at the left edge of your jawline (just below your earlobe), and the other edge of your right jawline. Write down that number.
Measure the vertical length of your face (in inches or centimeters). With your tape measure, place one end at the bottom of your chin (at the very tip), and the other end at the very top of your forehead (right at your hairline or widows peak). Write down that number.

, Now you can use the numbers from your measurements to figure out which shape best matches your face. Stand in front of a mirror, read the shape descriptions, and choose the one that best matches your shape and measurements.Round faces are close to a perfect circle. The face is symmetrical across all quadrants; it is not longer than it is wider, nor wider than it is longer. A celebrity example of someone with a round face is Penelope Cruz.Oval faces are one and a half times longer than they are wide. They are closer to a vertical circle.A celebrity example of someone with an oval face is Beyoncé Knowles.Square faces show their shape in the jawline. People with square faces have the same width jawline and hairline.A celebrity example of someone with a square face is Angelina Jolie.Heart shaped faces are widest at the cheekbone and have a narrow forehead and jawline.A celebrity example of someone with a heart-shaped face is Jennifer Garner.Diamond shaped faces have a narrow chin with a wider forehead and temples.A celebrity example of someone with a diamond-shaped face is Halle Berry., Now that you know the shape of your face and the different types of jewelry you can adorn your facial area with, you can match them together with confidence.Round faces match with jewelry that offsets the round shape of the face. Long necklaces that hang low on the chest are good options. Long, angled earrings will also complement the round face. Earrings shapes like rectangles and trapezoids are good options.Oval faces are versatile. This shape can wear almost any style of necklace or earrings. Hoop and chandelier earrings are particularly flattering.Square faces should wear necklaces with pendants or trinkets at the bottom of them to draw attention away from the angular jawline. Pendants with curved shapes are good options. Large hoop or chandelier earrings will complement the face shape.Heart shaped faces look best with a choker or short necklaces to add roundness to the narrow chin. Triangle or heart shaped dangled earrings will be flattering for this face shape.Diamond shaped faces should opt for choker necklaces and short hoops. They add length to the narrow chin."

Wear jewelry that compliments your body.,
Match your jewelry to your eye color.,
Match your jewelry to your personality.",How to Choose the Right Jewelry for Your Skin Tone and Face Shape3," You can choose jewelry that enhances or offsets your body type, depending on your goal. You can draw attention to, or away from, certain body parts, or balance proportions using strategically placed pieces. To draw attention to body parts you are proud of, wear jewelry with bold colors on or near those body parts.
If you are a larger person, wear larger jewelry. Petite people should buy smaller, daintier pieces. Scale your jewelry to your body’s size.

, Some people are proud of their eyes. The eyes are the doorways to our soul, right? Maybe. They are certainly one of the first places people look when they talk to us. It makes sense that you might want to match your adornments to your eye color. Blue eyes look best with blue gemstones like blue topaz and sapphire. If you want to contrast the blue of your eyes, wear gemstones that are pink sapphire or spinel.
Brown eyes match best with red gemstones like garnet and ruby. To contrast brown eyes wear deep blue gemstones like blue sapphire.
Hazel eyes go well with green gemstones like emerald and peridot.
Green eyes also look great with green gemstones like jade and emerald.

, Some people prefer to match their jewelry to something less tangible- their personality. Most people end up doing this naturally, why not get ahead of the curve and do it on purpose? Outgoing, bold people tend to wear large pieces like big, bold rings or many bracelets on one wrist.
Reserved people are more likely to be wearing one small gemstone, or a pair of earrings, maybe with a ring to match it. Usually a favorite piece.
Eccentric people tend to go after vintage pieces. Something that is one of a kind, not worn by anyone else.

Determine which shade of blue you desire.,
Check out deep blue gemstones.,
Look at softer blue gemstones like aquamarine.,
Peruse bright blue gemstones, like turquoise and topaz.",How to Choose a Blue Gemstone2," There are actually dozens of gemstones that fall under the “blue” umbrella. One of the first things you should do is decide what shade of blue you want. Do you want a very soft baby blue? Maybe you want a medium blue with hints of green. You may want a bold, royal blue to add to your collection.


Once you determine which shade of blue you want, you will narrow down your options and make this process easier.

, You may be looking for an eye-catching royal or deep blue gemstone. Sapphire, the most popular blue stone in the United States, is a bold, royal blue color. It is a hard stone that works well in jewelry. Though the most common, it is not the only deep blue stone.Similar to sapphire is the tanzanite stone, a gem discovered in the 1960s that has hints of purple.
Iolite is another deep violet-blue stone that is perfect for anyone seeking to make a statement.Unlike the other gemstones, lapis lazuli is a rock rather than a mineral. Lapis is a royal blue gemstone that is used for a variety of purposes.The gemstones alexandrite and benitoite are also a dark, royal blue hue. These are extremely rare, and will make a huge dent in your bank account., You may prefer a softer, more pastel-colored stone. If you’re looking for a light blue stone, aquamarine (a semi-precious gem) may be perfect for you. The word aquamarine actually means “water of the sea,” and the gem’s color ranges from very light blue to medium blue, with hints of green., Turquoise is an opaque gemstone in a bright blue-green color.It is a unique and bright blue gemstone. Topaz is a semi-precious gem that comes in a variety of colors, from yellow to pink, as well as a bright, lustrous blue shade.Topaz receives a heat treatment to bring out an intense and eye-catching color."
"
Determine your budget.,
Check out the most affordable options.,
Understand what gem qualities affect the price.,
Learn about the more costly gemstones.",How to Choose a Blue Gemstone3," Blue gemstones range greatly in price. Before you zero in on your favorite stone, it’s helpful to get an idea of what your dollar can get you. Some stones are more rare and will cost you much more, while others are less rare, equally as beautiful, and more affordable. Get an idea about how much different blue gemstones cost so you can be a knowledgeable consumer.


Semi-precious gems, such as aquamarine and topaz, are lower in cost than precious blue gems, such as natural sapphires.

, Blue topaz, being a semi-precious gem, is one inexpensive option for a blue gemstone. Because it is widely available, you can find it at very competitive prices.Aquamarine, though more expensive than topaz, is still relatively inexpensive as blue gemstones go. Turquoise, even in it’s highest grade, is an inexpensive gemstone., Semi-precious and precious gems differ in price, but there are other more cosmetic features that also factor in. The size of the gem, as well its clarity, cut and shade of blue all contribute to the final price tag., If you are looking to invest a good amount of money into your gemstone, a natural sapphire may be what you want. Sapphires are considered to be precious gems, which makes them more expensive than many other blue gemstone options, particularly the brightest and most vivid blue sapphires.


If you love the look of a sapphire but do not want to spend that much money, tanzanite might be your best bet. It is very similar to the sapphire in looks but is less expensive. However, it is also less durable than sapphire, so keep this compromise in mind.Iolite is another option for sapphire-lovers hoping to spend money. Unlike sapphire and tanzanite, the blue color of iolite is completely natural."

Look at the Cut and shape.,
Really look at the Color.,
Determine its number of Carats.,
Examine it for its Clarity.",How to Design a Solitaire Engagement Ring1," Modern diamond cutting is based on the optical calculations and is aimed at creating maximum brilliance as a result of dispersion. Diamond cut consists of the following parts: crown, pavilion and possibly culet. Pavilion depth and angle, crown depth and angle should be perfectly combined to achieve the right refraction of light. To deep or too shallow cutting lets light out of the gem, while its design should reflect the light back and make the diamond sparkle. There are round and fancy shapes of diamonds: pear, marquise\ navette, emerald\octagonal, oval, princess, radiant, heart, trilliant, asscher, cushion, round. Round cut is classical and the most popular. To choose the best shape you should consider fingers length and form. Small and symmetric diamonds look better on small hands with slim fingers, while Marquise and Pear would best fit short fingers.;
, A diamond works like a prism dividing incoming light into the spectrum of colors. There is a scale grading diamonds colors from D to Z, with D meaning a perfectly colorless diamond, and Z - noticeable color. Colorless diamonds marked D – F allow more light to pass through them, thus, they are considered the best and are the most rare and expensive. So, the less color the diamond has the more sparkling flashes (called “fire”) it will produce. Yellow color in a diamond reduces the color spectrum like a filter. Diamonds marked Z are yellowish or even brownish.

, Carat is a measure of diamonds weight, which is of course directly proportional to their size. To help you understand the proportions of carats and sizes there are multiple guide charts with relation tables available. They are adjusted for each diamond shape listed above.

, Diamond clarity is the quality describing the existence of internal and surface defects of stones. These peculiarities of texture are called inclusions and blemishes. Inclusions are structural imperfections, different in size, color, location, number and visibility. They can be whitish cracks or crystals of foreign materials. There is a clarity grade as well which allows assessing the presence of inclusions identified under ten times magnification.

"
Choosing the Metal.,
Choosing the Band.",How to Design a Solitaire Engagement Ring2," Typically solitaire engagement rings come in 2 metals: gold and platinum. Gold solitaire rings can be made from yellow or white gold. White gold is more popular for engagement rings; it is formed by mixing yellow gold and other white alloys. Women most prefer platinum, because it is more pure, eternal and rare. Don’t forget to check the markings to be sure about the quality of the chosen metal.

, The band is represented by the metal round circle, which sits around the finger. The right choice of the style and the size of the band is very important and predetermined by the hand and fingers size and shape, as well as the diamond’s characteristics. If the diamond is small and the fingers are small and slender wide and massive bands can never be a good option. Bands should fit well to the proportions. Bands can be straight or curved. Usually a curved band has the straight base and is curved at the top, where the diamond is fixed. Other shapes include: softly rounded, high domed/dome rounded, flat. A soft rounded shape is the most common and convenient for engagement rings.

Look for purity of color.,
Select medium or dark sapphires.,
Pick a clear sapphire.,
Choose the right color.",How to Choose Quality Sapphires1," A sapphire that has a splotchy and uneven color is not considered one of high quality. Look for sapphires that are saturated with a single vivid color all the way through. Avoid sapphires that have brown or gray spots within., Tone measures how light or dark a particular sapphire is. There’s no quantifiable way to measure tone, but on a scale from light to dark, medium and dark sapphires are generally considered higher quality than those that are light in tone., Generally, the more wrinkles and imperfections (inclusions) a sapphire contains, the less prized it will be. To choose a quality sapphire, find one with few or no inclusions that allows you to see straight through it.A sapphire without any inclusions is extremely rare. If you find one, you should immediately suspect that it is a fake.

, The most prized sapphires are blue and come from Sri Lanka. The second-most prized sapphire is a Padparadscha sapphire, which has a pink-orange color and also comes from Sri Lanka. The fancy pink sapphire is the third-most sought-after sapphire. It has a bright pink color and is generally found in Sri Lanka or Burma.Other colors like green, violet, and red are also available, but are less sought-after than the above-listed varieties.

Buy a synthetic sapphire.,
Get a good look at the sapphire.,
Find a sapphire with an asterism.,
Choose a sapphire with a symmetrical cut.,
Obtain a sapphire from a shop that offers certification.",How to Choose Quality Sapphires2," Some sapphires are found not in mines, but made in laboratories. These synthetic sapphires are of much higher quality (and far more affordable) than natural ones, so choose synthetic sapphires whenever possible., Turn the sapphire around in your hand as you hold it up to the light. This will help you see all the internal and external elements of the gem. Don’t rush the process. Take all the time necessary to see all the nooks and crannies of the gem., In most cases, inclusions are not desirable, and sapphires containing many inclusions might be considered of low quality. However, sapphires containing an asterism -- a naturally occurring arrangement of inclusions into a six-pointed star shape -- are rare and considered valuable., If you’re buying a heat-treated sapphire in a ring, necklace, or other jewelry, it should be cut in a symmetrical way. The shape itself is immaterial and entirely up to the buyer., Gemological societies (for instance, the Gemological Institute of America or the Gemological Association of Great Britain) offer certification to trusted gem dealers. The certification should verify the claims that the dealer or jeweler makes about the sapphire, including where it comes from and how much it weighs. Getting a certified sapphire is especially important if you’re purchasing an expensive one."
"
Look for keywords that indicate origin.,
Evaluate the trustworthiness of the seller.,
Find out if and how the emerald has been treated.",How to Choose High Quality Emeralds1," “Created,” “lab created,” “laboratory grown” or “simulated” are keywords that indicate the emerald is synthetic, not natural. “Chatham” emeralds are also man-made. Be wary of the way a seller uses the word “genuine.” Created emeralds are indeed genuine synthetic emeralds, not genuine natural emeralds.Jewelers may tout created emeralds as physically, visually and chemically the same as natural emeralds. However, they are nowhere near as valuable as natural emeralds.
Other terms used for synthetic emeralds are Gilson, Inamori, and Seiko.”Imitation” emeralds are not the same as lab-created or natural emeralds. They are various materials such as green glass or green cubic zirconia.”Composite” gemstone such as doublets or triplets are stones fused to other materials, such as an emerald top glued to a green glass bottom.;
, Determining the value of colored gemstones takes years of experience. While you can do your own research, it’s best to utilize the guidance of a professional when considering such a large investment.Find a jeweler who has gemological credentials, is informed about emeralds, and has multiple natural emeralds with different styles that you can view simultaneously.Research the place from which you are buying your emerald. There are many synthetic and imitation emeralds on the market, and it is imperative to be certain you are purchasing yours from a reputable dealer. Look for online reviews of the seller that come from a website other than the seller itself.
Gemological credentials come from a educational organization like the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) or the American Gem Society (AGS). The jeweler will have initials after their name, such as RJ (Registered Jeweler) or CG (Certified Gemologist). You can look up the initials in a search engine to find out exactly how much education the seller has achieved in their field., Because they are prone to fractures, most emeralds are treated somehow.However, if the stone was significantly treated to improve its appearance and hide flaws, the emerald may appear higher quality than it actually is. If the stone was treated, find out whether the treatment is major or insignificant.Ask if the stone has been examined for fillers.Get a report from an independent laboratory that can confirm the emerald is natural and to what extent it’s been treated.Don’t rely on a lab report that comes with the stone and is labeled as “independent.” Find your own, unbiased third party, such as a certified gemologist or appraisal organization.
Stones may be sold without the seller disclosing an epoxy resin or glass filling, which is considered a deceptive practice.Plastic polymer resin will disintegrate and yellow with age. Avoid emeralds with oil treatments, as oil will wear off the inside and outside of the emerald with time.

Study the color.,
Look for inclusions and fractures.,
Examine the cut and brilliance.,
Check for transparency.,
Find out the carat weight.",How to Choose High Quality Emeralds2," Color is the top indication of quality in an emerald.The rarer and finer the color is, the less importance clarity, carat and cut have on the gem’s value. To the contrary, the more common the color is, the more clarity, carat and cut matter. High quality emeralds have intense saturation.The color should be distributed evenly, without zones of different color visible to the naked eye.In general, the purer the green hue, the better the color is considered to be. All natural gemstones will have some undertone of other hues, but the blueness or yellowness in the emerald should be slight as well as beautiful.The emerald should be bright in its hue, like a spring green. If the appearance is more of a dark green “sleepy” hue, it isn’t an investment grade emerald., Emeralds with many flaws and cracks aren’t good candidates for setting in jewelry. Even if they can be set without damage, they aren’t likely to last long in the setting. Check the emerald with a loupe using reflected light to check for cracks and inclusions. Cracks look like little hairs or threads on the plane of a facet.Natural emeralds usually have inclusions, and they are typically invisible to the unaided eye.If the gem is priced well and appears flawless under a loupe or microscope, it is probably fake.Most emeralds have some cracks or fissures, but they should not be numerous, penetrate the stone deeply, or be large and near or breaking the surface.

, An emerald cut with skill will have facets that are positioned perfectly. As you move the stone, light should ripple sharply over them. The whole surface should be richly green without specific areas lighter or darker.A high quality emerald is alluring and has a lively sparkle.There are many cuts of emeralds. The most popular is the “emerald cut,” which is square or rectangular with a step cut.Emeralds are fragile, and this cut was designed to prevent breakage by placing facets in the four corners.Lower quality stones allow light to come through the back of the stone enough that you could read text through the crown of the gem (called “windowing”). On the other hand, gems with pavilions too deep have dark areas you can see face-up, which is a loss of light (called “extinction”).

, A high quality emerald may be a bit cloudy, but should possess a significant amount of transparency. Opaque and semi-opaque emeralds are a lot more common and aren’t worth as much., The price of a quality emerald will rise with its carat weight.When two to three carats or more, emeralds outweigh diamonds in cost by far.There are various gemstone weight charts and calculators available online that you can use to find out more about measuring emeralds.

Know the purity content of your platinum ring.,
Check the hallmark on the inside of the ring.,
Ask your jeweler about the alloy used in your platinum ring.,
Seek a master platinum-smith.,
Look for quality handcrafting in the engraving, filigree, pave or other fine details.,
Consider custom rings for a one-of-a-kind heirloom piece.,
Match your ring to your lifestyle.,
Choose a style that looks best on your hand.,
Ask your jeweler for a wax mold or silver replica of your ring.",How to Choose a Platinum Ring," As with all precious metals, platinum must be alloyed with other metals in order to achieve the hardness required for jewelry. A ring that is alloyed with 80% Platinum and 20% other metals is worth a lot less than a ring that is 95% pure platinum.;
, Federal regulations require all platinum bands to bear a stamp or ""hallmark"" on the inside of the band. If it says ""IridPlat"", or "".90Plat/Ir"" then the ring is only 90% pure platinum, and you should pay less for it than a ring that is 95% pure platinum. If the hallmark says ""Plat"" or "".95 Plat"", then the ring is considered pure platinum and commands a premium price.

, If you are buying a pure platinum ring (95% platinum), then it should be alloyed with either Cobalt or Ruthenium. These alloys produce a harder platinum that can hold a mirror bright polish and resist years of daily wear. Many .95 pure platinum rings are alloyed with the less expensive metal Iridium, but these rings are softer and will become scratched and dull within a year of daily wear.

, Find an ultra-specialist focused on designing and handcrafting jewelry in platinum. Working in platinum is very difficult. The metal doesn’t melt until it reaches 3223º, unlike gold that melts at a mere 1700º. The tools needed to work in platinum are completely different as well. Given these challenges, there are but a few talented master platinum-smiths who have the expertise to make high-quality platinum rings. While some mass producers choose to outsource their platinum “artistry” to China to cut costs, the handful of masters trained in the finer art of platinum-smithing are in the US and Europe.

, Platinum rings today come in thousands of designs with differing details to suit personal tastes. These details may include engraving, or deep cuts in the platinum that form a design. Some jewelry manufacturers choose to imitate hand engraving by embedding a design into the ring’s casting. This prefabricated engraving will eventually wear off and lose its luster. Therefore, look for deep and intricate hand engraving, which typically lasts for generations. Filigree is another design element reminiscent of the Art Deco period. Again, to save costs, many jewelers prefabricate filigree in the casting process. The result is chunky filigree that lacks elegance and finesse. True artistry from the Art Deco period calls for filigree that is created from hand-drawn wires and sculpted then soldered into a piece. For the best quality, ensure that any filigree in the platinum ring is handcrafted. Bezel set with pavé is another extremely popular platinum ring option. Bezel set refers to a border of metal, often set with small diamonds that accent the center stone – and can make it appear larger. Bezel setting with pavé in platinum requires very specific expertise. Proper setting ensures that the focus is on the sparkle of the diamonds, not the platinum prongs holding in the stones. Noticing these fine points today will ensure the right choice for years to come.

, For those who wish to express their individualism and own a statement ring that will become a family heirloom, custom is the only way to go. Many big jewelry houses scorn custom work. If you don’t like one of their limited design choices, then you have too much imagination. Custom-made rings allow you to work with the designer to create the ultimate reflection of your tastes. The “build your own ring” online tools are a fun gimmick, but far from the true custom craftsmanship associated with a quality ring. Work with a knowledgeable, personal jeweler who can guide you in the process.

, If high style and glamour are priorities in your life, go for a showstopper that’s loaded with exquisite hand artistry and a large center stone. If mountain climbing on Mount Kilimanjaro is your priority, forgo the delicate pavé work and opt for a platinum design with a low silhouette, that is, one that doesn’t elevate the center stone so that it won’t get banged around on rocks. Or, look at substantial platinum bands with unique engraving that look fashionable, yet are very practical. While most women fall somewhere in the middle, the point is that your ring needs to fit into your life. Some may feel more comfortable in a beautiful platinum band with an intricate floral design while others will gravitate toward a classic piece with a single center stone and filigree or the popular three-stone look with engraving. Nevertheless, since this purchase will likely be worn for ages to come, avoid the trendy, ultra-modern designs that promise to look dated in a few years.

, Now that you’ve eliminated certain designs based on your lifestyle, figure out what looks best on your hand. a) Match the size of your ring to the size of your hand. If you are large-framed with large, angular hands, don’t choose a dainty piece that fades away. Rather look at bolder designs with a thicker platinum band or consider stacking several rings. If you are petite, choose more delicate pieces and plenty of details. b) Don’t be obsessed with the size of the center stone. It’s irrelevant that your best friend has a three carat. If it was set in white gold or poor-grade platinum, lacks style and its diamond has visible flaws, this is not a ring to covet. Think quality and substance in the design, the workmanship, the platinum alloy and the precious gems you select. c) Try on many ring styles to be sure. Some women are sure that they want a certain style of ring until it’s on their finger. What’s right for a cousin is not likely what’s perfect for you. This is similar to clothing shopping. Trying on a piece is essential to know that it suits your fingers and hand size, that the ring doesn’t twist or become off-centered easily or that it doesn’t look good when stacked with a wedding band.

, If you have chosen a custom ring, you can ask your jeweler for a wax mold of your ring to ensure that the design meets your expectations before it is cast into platinum. Today, the best shops use computer-aided design (CAD) to create a three-dimensional image of your ring. Then, the jeweler creates a wax mold of the piece and the artisans refine its dimensions with extreme precision. Find out if your jeweler offers this service, which can eliminate any disappointment that your custom ring is not what you dreamed of. A few jewelers create a sterling silver and cubic zirconia version of a client’s custom ring before casting it in platinum to ensure that the ring is exactly what the client wants.

A luxury watch that you will wear with suits or formal wear will be very different than an athletic watch you will use to time your runs. When you are able to determine if this is a special occasion watch, or a watch for everyday use, you can begin to narrow your search.


Some common types of watches will be for athletic training, formal wear, everyday use, as a tech piece, or an antique piece.
There are also men’s, women’s, and children’s watches. Some watches are also marketed as unisex.;
, Look at watches that catch your eye, whether you see them on celebrities or stylish people you admire, or on the Internet. It can be helpful to keep a list of bookmarked websites or a written list of brands and watch types that you like. A local jeweler that specializes in watches can offer expert advice.
Ask friends or family members who wear watches for any brand recommendations.
Use the Internet to search for topics like “watch trends,” “watch reviews,” “popular watch brands” to gather ideas.

, Finding the right watch for you is a personal decision. You can choose the most trendy or popular watch but if you don’t like it, you won’t ever wear it. Look for watches that compliment your personal style and fit your tastes.Watch brands have their own personal styles that you can work off of. For instance, Rolex watches are luxurious and elegant. You can get a sense of a brand’s personality by looking at how they market themselves.

, Watches faces are available in a variety of metals and materials. You can choose watches that are made from gold, silver, rose gold, platinum, titanium, and more. Watch faces can also be made from plastic, though these will be less durable.


You can also choose a watch that is two-tone gold and silver if you prefer.
Metals will typically be more durable than plastic faces, though metal can become scratched.

, Watch faces come in different shapes, like square, circle, a hexagon. You may be limited in your choice of watch faces based on your choice of brands, but having a watch face shape in mind can help you to narrow your options.


Some novelty watches will come in more unique shapes. If you have your heart set on a uniquely shaped watch, you may not be able to find one by looking at mainstreams brands.

, The band is the part of the watch that goes around your wrist. Like watch faces, you do have a choice of materials. The most common choices are metals, like gold or silver, leather, or plastic.


Look for a watchband that is adjustable and durable. Some materials are naturally more durable than others; leather can break more easily than metal. You can adjust metal bands by having a link removed by a jeweler or watchmaker. Leather bands can have additional holes cut to make them tighter.
Watch bands can be replaced, though it will cost more to replace metal bands than those made of leather or plastic.
There are also more unconventional band materials that you can choose from, like woven fabric or a durable rubber.

, There are fairly standard color combinations that most brands will follow. For instance, you’re less likely to find a plastic watch face on a gold band.


If you are looking for a watch to wear every day, select materials that match or complement the accessories you already wear., This is more applicable to men’s watches, since women’s watches tend to stay within a smaller measurement range. The vast majority of men’s watches have faces that are between 34mm and 50mm in diameter. You will be able to find face dimensions on the manufacturer’s website, watch packaging, and on retailer’s websites.The majority of men look great in watches that are 34mm to 40mm.
Watches also vary in their thickness. A 10mm height for a case will sit better under a dress shirt cuff than a 15mm. Some people find taller watch cases more or less attractive, but this usually won’t be a big concern unless you are looking for a formal watch for suits., Watches can either display the time digitally, where the time is represented in number form, or through analog, which will use a clock with minute and hour hands. The size of the numbers or clock face can vary between watches, and the numbers can be in different stylized fonts.


Some people prefer to use digital watches if they are not comfortable reading time on a clock. Digital watches tend to be found in lower price ranges since they are not intended for formal wear or dress use. They work best with sport watches or smartwatches that are paired with other technology, like the Apple watch.
Analog faces are a more classic and traditional look and tend to stay in style longer than digital faces. There are different types of analog faces. Some faces may have numbers marking each hour, some may only mark four, while others will have no numbers on them and use symbols to mark each hour.

, There are two primary types of watch movements, which are essentially the engine that powers the watch and allows its functions to work. The vast majority of watches will fall in one of two categories, mechanical or quartz.There are two primary types of mechanical watches: automatic and manual. Automatic mechanical watches can be rewound (which replenishes the motor’s energy) throughout the day. A manual mechanical watch needs to be rewound daily for it to work. Quality mechanical watches will typically cost you more than $1000 and have higher maintenance costs. Quartz watches are more precise than mechanical watches and can be found in a wider variety of price ranges, from $50 to $500. Maintenance costs are much lower since you’ll only have to replace a battery occasionally, which is usually around $10.

, A watch that does more than tell the time and date are called complicated watches, so additional features are called complications.Complications can be found at a variety of price points and may or may not be important to you. Here are some common complications to look for:


Timer
Special materials like gems or diamonds
Smartwatch
Water resistance
Illuminated face
Alarms
Fitness tracking

, Watches are available in every price range possible. Before you choose a watch, you should determine how much you are willing to spend. Keep in mind that cheap off-brand watches are typically poorly made and can break frequently.


If you have your heart set on a certain brand, you will have to set a budget that reflects the brand’s price points.
Different price points can have a lot of variety in the brands and types of watches that you can find. Watch collectors can easily spend $20,000 on a luxury watch, but you can also find quality watches at the $200 range., This is the best way to find out whether a watch is proportional to your wrist and you enjoy the look. The band of the wrist should fit securely and the case should be centered on your wrist.


Avoid oversized watches, usually over 50mm case diameters, unless you are very tall and have very large wrists. Oversized watches that are larger than 50mm can dwarf your wrists and look clunky and outdated.
Metal bands, which can be called bracelets, usually will need links added or removed to customize the fit.
This will also give you a sense of the weight of the watch. Some watches are heavier than others, and the heft of a watch can be either comforting or burdensome. This is a personal choice but it is a good idea to try on watches with different weights., You should trust the person you are buying your watch from. Whether you are buying from a collector, a local jeweler, a watchmaker, a large retailer, or an online store, you need to trust the person or company you buy from.


Look at reviews for the company online to see whether there seem to be any quality issues with the products they sell.

, Like with cars, retailers can become authorized dealers for certain watch brands. Brands like Rolex and TAG Heuer will list authorized retailers on their websites. Authorized retailers can help you feel secure in knowing that you are buying a real luxury watch, rather than a counterfeit piece. If you are looking at lesser known watch brands, this won’t be an issue since the brand will most likely not authorize dealers other than themselves.

, Watches do break and can be costly to repair. Different watch brands offer different warranty policies that cover damage or repairs that can help to offset repair costs. Check to see whether there is a time limit on the policy and what it covers.


See whether the retailer you have chosen has an additional warranty. For instance, some retailers will replace watch batteries or cover basic repairs in-store.

Look at the color.,
Check the clarity.,
Check the cut.",How to Tell if It's Cubic Zirconia and to See the Best Quality," Loose cubic zirconia stones are generally colorless, but many shades of colors can be added using trace elements during the manufacturing process.;
, Clarity, or clearness, of loose cubic zirconia is a quality factor. The manufacturing process can sometimes cloud a stone, making visible imperfections. Just as with genuine diamonds, the clearer the stone is, the greater the value.

, Cut is very important in determining the quality for loose cubic zirconia stones. Just as with diamonds, the cut reveals the stone's beauty through every facet. The facets must be even and precise to create just the right appearance. As with diamonds, the skill of the stone cutter makes all the difference because stone cutters do much more than cut. They analyze the stone carefully to determine how much of the stone should be cut off to give proper clarity. Then, they take many steps to perfect their cut without taking away from the stone.


The Brilliant cut is the standard
There are other popular cuts such as the Trillion, Princess, and Radiant cuts.
There are also a variety of shapes to give each stone its own unique personality.

Buy from a reliable jeweler.,
Understand the difference between natural and cultured pearls.,
Check the pearl's luster.,
Make note of the size.,
Look for pearl pieces with matching pearls.",How to Buy Organic Gem Jewelry1," Pearls are highly valuable and desirable enough to appear in just about any jeweler's stock. A chain store jeweler is a reliable source, but you may not always get the biggest selection or the lowest cost. You can buy from smaller, family-owned jewelers or only for a better selection and price, but you need to do your homework on these sources first. Check reviews, ask if the jeweler is certified by an official gemological organization, and make sure that there are no complaints filed against the company.;
, Most pearls are not naturally grown. Instead, they are harvested from oyster farms specifically created for the formation of pearls. Both types are considered organic, however.

, Luster refers to the way in which light reflects from the surface of the gem. To determine if a pearl has high quality luster, look at how well images are reflected in the surface. The clearer te reflection, the better the luster.

, As far as taste goes, whether you choose large or small pearls is a matter of personal preference. Larger pearls will generally cost more, though, simply because there is more pearl there.

, No two pearls are exactly alike, and each one will vary slightly in shape, color, and size. If the differences are too noticeable, the piece will look unbalanced. It is important to note, however, that a piece made from pearls with very few differences will be more expensive.

Use caution when shopping for amber.,
Consider the color.,
Expect to see veins and inclusions.,
Do a float test on the amber.,
Perform a hot needle test.,
Test the amber with nail polish remover containing acetone.",How to Buy Organic Gem Jewelry2," The gemstone is not quite as valuable as pearl and does not appear in chain store jewelers frequently, but small jewelers and online merchants are more likely to sell it. Buying amber in person is preferable to buying online, though, since fake amber is commonly sold as the real deal and is easier to check if purchased in person.


If you do buy amber online, only buy from trusted, certified merchants who have a decent return policy.

, Amber is made from fossilized pine tree resin and usually has a rich golden honey or light brown hue, but one shade is not necessarily better than another. Blue amber even exists, but since it is quite rare, it tends to be expensive.

, Amber is not a gemstone that is meant to look smooth. In fact, some of the most valuable and expensive pieces contain inclusions of insects, plants, or pyrites. The inclusions and veins found in amber give it more character and do not ruin the quality or durability of the stone.

, Amber floats in salt water, but plastics meant to mimic amber usually sink. If you buy the amber as loose gemstones instead of in a solid piece of jewelry, the float test is a good way to test for fakes.

, Heat a needle and gently touch the needle to the bottom of the stone. Real amber will give off the scent of pine when heated. Fake amber will usually smell acidic or otherwise unpleasant.

, Wipe a cotton swab dabbed in acetone over the amber gemstone. Real amber will feel the same way before and after, but a fake will feel soft and sticky afterward.

Expect high prices.,
Buy from jewelers and trusted merchants.,
Do not trust sellers offering black coral.,
Do not expect perfection.,
Find out if the coral is reconstituted.",How to Buy Organic Gem Jewelry3," While not as coveted as many non-organic gemstones, coral can be quite rare and, as a result, fairly expensive. Pure red coral, called ""fire coral"" or ""ox blood coral,"" has been over-collected and is now limited in an effort to reduce the stress placed on natural coral reefs. As a result, pure red coral will not usually be cheap, and you should be suspicious of any merchant selling red coral at a low price.

, Coral is about as common with jewelers as amber, so you can find a few pieces at a big name retailer but are more likely to find a bigger selection with a smaller, specialized jeweler or online merchant.

, Gem-grade black coral is no longer available commercially. If you purchase a vintage or antique piece, the black coral might be real. On a newer piece, however, you will be unable to find gem-grade black coral.

, Coral is generally supposed to look slightly jagged and uneven. Perfectly round or square cut gemstones can be found, but the rough, ""natural"" look is generally preferred.

, Reconstituted coral is technically organic, but it is not quite as natural. These gems are made from coral fragments that have been ground into a powder, doused with a binding agent, and reformed into the desired cut. These stones may also be dyed to enhance the color.

Know what you're looking at.,
Look for jet in large pieces.,
Check the stone for scratches.",How to Buy Organic Gem Jewelry4," Jet is a form of coal made from fossilized wood. It was popular in the nineteenth century but is rarely seen today. Finding jet at a major retail jeweler will be difficult, and you may struggle to find it at a smaller jeweler, as well. Shopping online is your best option for new jet. Given its popularity in the past, however, you can also find it in antique jewelry sold at antique malls and vintage shops.

, Good jet has been polished until it gives off a matte or mildly glossy luster reminiscent of wax or velvet. It should not appear too shimmery, but it should not look too dull, either. If buying an antique piece, the polished luster may have worn off. Ask the merchant to quickly polish the gemstone to determine if the jet is real and able to be polished to its original condition.

, This gemstone has a very low density, so it is easy to wear even in large amounts.

, Jet has a low hardness and is easily scratched. A piece of jet jewelry that has been properly cared for should have minimal scratches, but do not be too surprised if you see a few light scratches on antique pieces.

Do your research about the trade of ivory.,
Buy online or at antique stores.,
Know what to expect.",How to Buy Organic Gem Jewelry5," Elephant tusks have been the most common source of ivory throughout the gemstone's history. Due to the manner in which elephants are illegally poached for their tusks, however, the trade of new, contemporary elephant ivory is internationally banned. Typically speaking, though, you can still buy old elephant ivory that is decades or centuries old. You can also buy mammoth ivory, which is, perhaps, the most human form of ivory in existence since it comes from the tusks of mammoths that died of natural causes over 10,000 years ago.

, Since new ivory is banned, your best chances at finding ivory jewelry come by shopping in antique malls and online. Make sure that the merchant is certified and that no complaints have been filed against the shop.

, Ivory used in jewelry is off-white in color and usually polished until it becomes slightly glossy. The ivory is usually carved into intricate designs, from flowers to cameos, but smooth, simple ivory bangle bracelets are also common.

Set a budget.,
Know the four Cs of diamonds.,
Measure the size.,
Choose the settings.",How to Buy Diamond Stud Earrings,"


Setting a budget before you buy can keep you from spending lavishly and it is a realistic factor that can determine whether you can afford the diamond stud earrings or not. Although it is advisable to buy within your price range, do not rush into buying a cheaply made diamond bracelet just to spare a few dollars. Everyone knows how expensive the diamond is, so a cheap diamond bracelet can be a fake one and can’t last for a long time. So be realistic. Only you know what you can comfortably afford, but once you’ve worked it out, it’s time to get best value for money.;
, The first thing you need to know before you buy the earrings is to know how to choose the diamond. There are four points you need to keep in mind. They are the four Cs of cut, carat, clarity, and color.


Cut may be the most elusive “C” to understand. A good cut predisposes the amount of light that can enter into the stone, refract and emit that brilliant quality that people love in a diamond. Most stud earrings, except for those custom-made ones, stick to a few basic shapes. They are round, princess, and heart shapes. Square, princess-cut diamonds may use a mix of step and brilliant styles. Brilliant-cut diamonds sparkle with fire thanks to the precise placement of 57 or 58 angled facets over the upper crown of the diamond and the lower pavilion area. The step style on a princess-cut diamond creates straight facets over the crown while the pavilion is cut in the brilliant style; this allows the fire to shine up through the stone. Buyers can also find beautiful preset pear, emerald, and oval-shaped earrings, and jewelers are happy to create custom orders in these and other shapes as well. The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) issues ratings for facet symmetry and for surface appearance, or polish, in round, brilliant-cut diamonds as follows: Excellent (EX), Very Good (VG), Good (G), Fair (F), and Poor (P).
Carat refers to the weight, but remember that bigger is not always better. It all depends on the blend of the other diamond characteristics. One metric carat (ct) weighs 0.20 grams, but carats are more commonly measured in relation to 100 points; for instance, a half carat is 0.50 ct or 50 points. However, the carat weight doesn't necessarily refer to size. While carat weights do have estimated sizes, two different diamond cuts of equal weight may look very different in their settings. The number of carats in earrings typically represents the total weight. If there are small, accent diamonds that enhance a larger one, those small stones are also part of the total. Small earrings of 0.50 ct or less make nice everyday earrings, and up to 1.00 ct can also suit somewhat casual wear. For formal wear, up to around 2.00 ct is a good guide for stud earrings. Too large, and the earrings could drag or flop over; drop or pendant earrings would feature larger stones better.
With regard to clarity, the important thing to bear in mind is that the less flaws visible to the naked eye, the more expensive the stone is . Clarity refers to the presence or absence of inclusions or blemishes, which are small flaws within the diamond or on the surface. These flaws can interrupt the play of light through a stone, or, if large enough, they can visibly mar the appearance. In stud earrings, the presence of small flaws may be acceptable because they are not generally visible to the naked eye. Accepting them can lower the budget or allow buyers to increase the quality of other characteristics.
The absence of color is usually the goal with white diamonds. The GIA rates stones with a letter grade from D, which is completely colorless, through Z, which is light yellow or brown. Most commercial diamonds are in the D through J category, which is considered colorless to near colorless. Unlike many inclusions and blemishes, color is at least somewhat visible to the naked eye. Stones around the H and I grades would be good for stud earrings; a J grade could work as well. Color is more visible in larger stones, and comparing different color grades side by side can show the difference. However, in a pair of moderately sized earrings, the very slight yellow of a J grade may not even be noticeable.

,


The size of the diamonds you choose will ultimately be decided by a number of different factors, one of which is your own personal style. A smaller diamond can more easily be paired with daytime outfits, while large diamonds usually only look appropriate with dressier apparel and evening wear. Carat is the weight measurement of a gemstone, and the jewelry industry lists the size of a diamond by its carat weight. Be aware that the total carat weight (TDW) for a pair of earrings includes all the diamonds in the jewelry.

,


The earrings 'setting' refers to the metal base that holds the stone. Yellow and white gold are the most popular metal settings for diamond earrings. Platinum is the strongest for holding stones, but it's much heavier, which could become noticeable with larger stones. Stud earrings typically have a basket setting with between three and six prongs holding a stone in place. The number of prongs generally relates to the size of a stone; six prongs would overwhelm a small stone while three might not be secure enough for a larger one. The cut of the stone also plays a part: A princess-cut stone has one prong at each of its four corners. A bezel setting is another choice for stud earrings. Metal surrounds the diamond with this setting, leaving just the crown facets visible.

If you are unsure on the style that she wants, it may be best to check with her to ensure that you make the right choice.If you do choose to surprise your future-spouse, make sure that the diamond will look flattering on her.;
, Though many claim that you should spend approximately three months of your salary when buying an engagement ring, this idea is the result of clever campaigning by the De Beers diamond company. While spending that much on a diamond will surely show your partner you care, a less expensive diamond might suit your lifestyle and pocketbook better. In any case, have a firm idea of the price range you are willing accept before you go diamond shopping., For diamonds that will be worn by you, your spouse, or a romantic interest, you'll want to think about other diamond jewelry in the recipients wardrobe. The diamond and setting you buy should match other jewelry as broadly as possible.


What is the main color of the jewelry that she already wears? Silver or gold? Take this into account when choose the setting color.
Consider asking the family and/or friend of the recipient what kind of diamond and setting they think would be best. Only do this if you trust them to keep your secret., If you're unsure what style of diamond the recipient of your stone will want, you might want to use trends to direct your search. Today's diamond market is defined by more natural and whimsical designs, like floral and celestial motifs. For a special occasion, you might give your significant other diamonds in the shape of:


The stars and moon
An astrological sign
Bejeweled butterfly wings, The cut of your diamond refers to how the stone was shaped to direct the light back to your eyes, creating a brilliant sparkle. It is the most important factor in deciding how dazzling your diamond will be. If a diamond is cut too shallow or too deep, light will be lost out of the bottom or the sides of the diamond, making the stone sparkle less. The main categories of diamond cut are:I deal cut (also sometimes known as 'Excellent') will reflect the highest proportion of light back to your eyes, making the diamond sparkle brilliantly.
A very good cut will reflect approximately the same light as an ideal cut.
A good cut can be counted on to reflect most of the light that enters the stone.
A fair cut will noticeably less brilliant than a good cut, but is still considered to be a quality stone., When a diamond expert refers to a stone's color, they are actually talking about a lack of color. Diamonds are graded on a scale of D - Z, with diamonds that are perfectly white earning a D rank, while diamonds ranked Z are yellow. The difference between different color grades can be very small, so choosing a diamond of a slightly lower color grade can save you a significant amount of money.


Diamonds ranked F to E are considered colorless and will have only minimal traces of color which will be detectable by a gemologist, but not by a layperson.Diamonds ranked H to G are considered near colorless, and will be difficult to tell apart from higher quality diamonds unless compared side by side.
Diamonds ranked J to I are considered near colorless, but are differentiated from higher rank diamonds by a somewhat detectable warmth to the color tone.
Anything below an I will have warm tones that are easier to see.

, Nearly all diamonds have minute flaws and imperfections, which are known as ""inclusions"". In most cases, these can only be seen through a microscope, but enough flaws can make the diamond appear cloudy. If no flaws can be seen with the naked eye, then it is known as ""eye clean"".


Clarity ranking, from flawless to visibly flawed, are: FL (flawless), IF (internally flawed); VVS1, VVs2 (very, very slightly included/flawed); VS1, VS2 (very slightly included/flawed); SI1, SI2 (slightly included/flawed); I1 (included/flawed).
Many SI1 clarity diamonds will have imperfections that are only visible under magnification, making these a more economical purchase in many cases.
Be sure to contact the seller before purchasing a diamond with a SI clarity rank or lower to verify there are no imperfections visible to the naked eye., Fluorescence is a natural property of diamonds, caused by tiny amounts of boron being trapped while the diamond formed. Fluorescence is graded from Faint to Very Strong. Some diamonds with Strong or Very Strong fluorescence may appear slightly ""milky"" in daylight. Unless you can examine the diamond in natural light and verify that no milkiness is present, you should avoid Strong or Very Strong fluorescence., While carat weight refers to the actual weight of the diamond, with one carat equivalent to 200 milligrams, the cut grade and shape of the stone will also impact how the stone looks when placed in a setting. To ensure you are getting an accurate representation of what your diamond will look like, view the stone from the top and asses the width of the top.


Each carat diamond is made up of 100 points, so diamonds that are a ½ carat will also be equal to 50 points.
A ring may be listed with ""CTW"" next to the carat value. This stands for ""Carat Total Weight"" and is a combined total of all of the diamonds in the ring, including side stones. #* If the listed price of a diamond is only carat total weight (CTW), be sure to ask for the weight and quality of the center stone. If the store cannot or will not provide this information, it may be a sign that the diamond is less high quality than you suspected., Different diamond shapes have different attributes. For example, a ""round brilliant"" shaped diamond offers the most sparkle, while ""step cut"" diamonds, like the Asscher and emerald cut, reflect flashes of light rather than sparkle. Longer shapes on the other hand, such as the oval, pear, or Marquise, can complement slender fingers.Other shapes you might consider:Round
Princess
Emerald
Asscher
Marquise
Radiant
Oval
Pear
Heart
Cushion, The shape and cut of a stone will influence how light enters it and is reflected. These factors can make your potential purchase look stunning under direct light, but average in normal lighting. You should verify the diamond looks good in poor light, too, before you purchase it., Online diamond providers can provide a vast choice of diamonds to choose from at competitive prices, due to their lower overheads. The disadvantage when buying from an online diamond provider is that you won't get to inspect the diamond in person before making the purchase.


Ensure that any online retailer that you are considering is well established, has positive reviews online, and sells diamonds from a reputable certification authority.
The diamond industry frequently uses price guides to set the total cost of the stone. Some trusted reports include: the Rapaport Diamond Report, the Troy Diamond Report, Ajediam Antwerp Diamonds Monthly, and the Gem Guide., Larger diamond stores will likely have a larger selection, but these can be intimidating and rigid when it comes to bargaining. Smaller diamond retailers and those privately owned by individuals will be more willing to deal with you on a personal level, and might even be willing to negotiate the cost of some of your diamond related expenses.

, As with most products, when a certain designer is popular, the price of that designer's products become more expensive. This is also the case with designer jewelers. The name attached to a certain diamond can drastically increase its price compared to an identical diamond from another jeweler, with no increase in quality., Different stores will have different selections, but some stores might be more willing to accommodate other requests you have, like using a combination of metals in the band to cut down on overall cost. As with any major purchase, you'll want to be sure you've found the right fit for your situation before you even begin to negotiate., Some stores and providers might have clear policies forbidding the negotiation of listed prices, but that doesn't mean you can't get some freebies in addition to your purchase. As an example, you might inquire about diamond upkeep and request the store include some diamond/jewelry cleaner with your purchase.


Be wary of diamond sellers trying to convince you to spend more on a diamond through convincing your partner.
Stay firm to your budget, even in the face of special deals. These are often a gimmick to increase sales. If you ask about a specific sale, it will many times be available even outside of the sale time limit.
Don't allow an emotional/pushy salesperson prevent you from asking questions and taking your time when deciding if a diamond is right for you. If you feel uncomfortable, you can always walk away and come back later or take your custom elsewhere., Even if you've decided to go with a more affordable diamond for your purchase, it's likely that you'll have to accrue some funds before you're ready to buy. This can be a delicate part of the diamond buying process, as too many changes to your lifestyle can tip off a romantic partner and spoil your surprise.

, When purchasing a diamond, make sure that it is accompanied by a ""grading report"" from an independent grading authority, which lists the 4 Cs and other attributes of the diamond. The grading report (also known as a ""certificate"") is extremely important to ensure that you are getting a diamond of the correct quality that you are paying for.

The two grading authorities with the best reputation are GIA (Gemological Institute of America) and AGS (American Gem Society).

, Depending on the seller, there may be payment options that you can take advantage of to cut down the time spent saving. Inquire with your diamond retailer to find if these options are available to you. Once you've saved enough, purchase your diamond and enjoy your glittering new investment.

Four C'S
Diamonds are graded on four qualities, known as the 4 C's.,
A diamond that costs less
About Clarity: Inclusions are not bad, though the common connotation has slightly negative tones.,
About Color: It takes a diamond master to compare any diamond to make out a colour grade with the naked eye.,
About Cut: Diamond cut can affect its value by 50% or more.,
The 'Very Good' and 'Good' cut grades offer great quality stones reasonably priced as compared to the 'Ideal' / 'Excellent' cut grades.,
Cut is not the Shape: Shape refers to the contour of the stone.,
About Carat: Save money on a diamond by buying just below the 1 carat mark (instance at 70 pts).,
Look up online marketplaces that sell loose stones.,
Research each online marketplace thoroughly to make sure that it is legitimate.,
Custom design the mount.,
Pick your metal.,
Decide on the setting design.,
As another alternative, consider checking out wholesale clubs that sell diamonds.",How to Buy Cheap Diamonds,"
These are Color, Cut, Clarity, Carat.

, In diamonds, these are ‘fingerprints’ of a diamond. No two diamonds are identical. Further, inclusions help distinguish between synthetic and natural diamonds. Any diamond certificate tells you the clarity grade. On the clarity scale from Fl to SI2, you can't notice the blemishes with the naked eye. So if you trying to save money the cue is in buying a Diamond that is not higher in grade than an SI1 or SI2. SI1 and SI2 mean that there are inclusions visible under 10x magnification. This is a very high power magnification, and nobody is going to look at your diamond like that, unless you ask them to.

, Get a Diamond that is high on the color scale only if you have no option. Anything higher than an H or I grade is for someone who has a lot of extra money. I diamonds do look nice and cost less. When evaluating color, ensure that the diamond is untreated. Treatment implies that the diamond has been through some kind of heat treatment, or irradiation, or fracture filling. All of these are meant to enhance the color of a diamond.

, The cut affects the brilliance and sparkle in a Diamond .This is what makes Diamonds so wanted.
A Diamond is divided into two parts. There is the top part, which is the crown, and there is the bottom part, which is the pavilion. In a well proportioned Diamond, the crown should be about one-third the length of the total Diamond. And the pavilion should be about two-thirds of the total length of the diamond from top to bottom. The proportions of a Diamond are clearly labeled on the certificate.

, Save here.

, And cut determines how well the shape is executed. If size is important, consider shapes other than round. While a round, brilliant-cut diamond is popular as it exhibits maximum brilliance, it looks smaller than diamonds in other shapes.
Consider an oval, pear-shaped or marquise diamond, all of which look larger than the round. Experiment further with setting styles and designs to make the diamond appear larger. Tulip setting and Tiffany Setting elevate the stone from its base making it look grander.

, A 70 pt diamond can be priced much less than a 100 pt (or 1 carat) diamond and it may look almost as big to the naked eye.
Another way to save a great deal of money is to buy three less than 1carat diamonds that are placed on one ring instead of single large 1 carat stone. This is not always popular but it’s best to know that many smaller stones on a diamond ring cost much less than 1 large stone of the same total weight.

, Try an Internet search along the lines of ""buy wholesale diamonds"" or ""buy loose diamonds."";
, Check the fine print. Look up return policies and quality statements, and stick with marketplaces that specifically offer GIA certified diamonds. If a marketplace does not say that it sells certified diamonds, it may be a scam.

, Go to a jeweler or other diamond expert who offers custom setting services.

, The most common options include yellow gold, white gold, silver, and platinum.

, The setting is the part that holds the diamond in place. Common designs, especially for rings, include prong/claw, hooked, short, and thin.

, Some may sell loose stones, while many sell pre-made diamond jewelry. The diamonds at these stores often cost less than those found at jewelers and standard retailers, however, and this may be an option worth considering if you feel hesitant about purchasing loose stones and designing a custom piece.

Research reputable jewelers.,
Talk with your jeweler.,
Recognize the limits of the Kimberly Process.,
Avoid diamonds from areas of conflict.,
Look for vintage or antique diamonds.",How to Buy Conflict Free Diamonds1," Your starting point for finding a conflict-free diamond is to find a jeweler you trust and who has a selection you'd like to choose from. The jeweler should be known to specialize in conflict-free jewelry. Consider using a jeweler who ethically sources their diamonds, funds projects in the communities where the diamonds are mined, and supports the Diamond Development Initiative.The Diamond Development Initiative tries to make all diamond mining accountable to human rights and environment standards. It hopes to support small scale and artisan miners in mining ethical diamonds while investing in local communities.;
, Ask where the diamonds were mined. The jeweler should be able to tell you about every step of the process that the diamond takes from being mined to ending up in the jewelry store. If your jeweler doesn't know, is vague, or or assures you the diamond is fine without answering your question, find a more knowledgeable jeweler to work with.If the jeweler tells you that the diamond is certified by the Kimberly Process or came from a reputable source, continue asking questions until you get a more detailed response. You should find out exactly where the diamond comes from and under what conditions.

, The Kimberly Process is a certification program that tries to prevent diamond mining from funding conflict. Countries that participate in the Kimberly Process are supposed to self-regulate and trade only with other countries that agree to the program. Unfortunately, some argue that the program is ineffective since there's no staff or enforcement.The Kimberly Process doesn't address the serious issues of child labor and environmental destruction from diamond mining. There are also concerns that their definition of ""conflict diamonds"" is too narrow to be effective.

, Several human rights agencies like Amnesty International have documented human rights abuse in several countries that mine diamonds. Avoid diamonds from these countries as well as from countries where mining funds conflict. Specifically, don't buy diamonds that have been mined from Zimbabwe, Angola, Democratic Republic of Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, and Liberia. Instead, choose a diamond from an area where human rights are protected and environmental standards are followed. You might want to get your diamond from:Canada
Botswana
Namibia
Sierra Leone

, If you have a family heirloom diamond, but don't like the setting or style of the piece, take it to a jeweler. The jeweler can usually reset or recut the diamond and create a new setting or design.Although you may not know where the antique or vintage diamond was mined, you'll at least avoid supporting current abuses and exploitation in the diamond business.

Set a budget for your purchase.,
Only buy online an online jeweler that offers a money back guarantee.,
Try to find a jeweler that has photos of the actual diamonds online.,
Check whether there are diamond certificates.",How to Buy Diamonds Online,"


If buying a loose diamond don't forget to leave money for a setting.
For engagement rings many people follow a rule of thumb of 3 times monthly salary but there are no set guidelines.
Many jewelers will offer a layaway plan that will allow you to pay for the purchase over time at lower interest rates ten a credit card.
Check whether there are any coupons and discounts, as lots of online diamonds selling services offer them regularly. Make sure you know about the discounts for some featured jewelry stores.;
,


You should look for at least 30 days and up to 45 days is common.
The jeweler should pay for both shipping to you and return shipping if needed.
Look for a reputable diamond certification such as GIA or AGS.

,


You can often find a good deal on a lower quality diamond, such as an SI1 or SI2, if you are able to see the diamond online.
Use comparison shopping. Choose several reliable retailers, look through the photos of available options, compare quality, sizes and prices offered, and only then make your choice.

, A diamond certificate is a document that includes information on:


carat weight
shape
fluorescence
clarity
measurements
color grade
finish grade
proportions

Buy a synthetically grown diamond.,
Consider buying a gemstone.,
Research the source of the stone.,
Check the source of your gold.",How to Buy Conflict Free Diamonds2," If you're still unsure or uncomfortable about buying a diamond, you might want to buy a lab-grown diamond or lab-grown gemstone like moissanite that looks just like a diamond. Choosing a lab-grown stone will guarantee that your jewelry came from a conflict-free source.Moissanite is almost as hard as a diamond so you can wear it without fear of scratching or tarnishing it.
Synthetic stones are usually less expensive than diamonds.

, You may decide that you don't want a diamond or synthetic diamond. Instead, you choose a colorful or clear gemstone or precious stone. You might want to buy an emerald, ruby, turquoise, or lapis lazuli if you want a pop of color or a piece of jewelry that's as unique as you are.Be aware that softer stones like opals and pearls will tarnish and scratch easier than harder stones. If you buy a softer stone, you may want to wear it only occasionally.

, Remember that even though your stone isn't a diamond, it probably came from a mine. Ask your jeweler to give you details about where the stone was originally mined. The jeweler should be able to give you specifics about where the stone was mined and under what conditions.


Some companies advertise fairly traded gems so it's worth asking if the gems are certified.

, Don't forget to check the material that supports your diamond, especially if it's gold. Current gold mining practices can be environmentally destructive, leaching mercury and cyanide. Ensure the health of the workers and the environment by choosing recycled gold. You can also purchase fair trade gold.Again, you need to ask your jeweler where the gold is mined. Fortunately, several large companies have begun pushing for mining regulations and investment in mining communities."

Look for a flawless or near flawless aquamarine for nicer jewelry.,
Consider an aquamarine with more noticeable inclusions if using the stone for beads or casual pieces.,
Decide on the right hue.,
Pick an appropriate intensity.,
Determine the carat weight you want.,
Choose the high-quality cut.,
Pick out a shape.,
Ask about heat treatment.",How to Buy Aquamarine Gemstone1," By nature, aquamarine is one of the cleanest gemstones available. Major inclusions are rare and often a sign of mistreatment. A quality aquamarine should not have inclusions that are visible to the naked eye, and any inclusions that are visible through magnification should be slight and interior.;
, Even though aquamarine has a hardness of 7.5 to 8 on the Mohs scale, it can still get damaged if worn frequently or if it strikes a hard surface. If you expect a piece of jewelry to get roughed up, save money by purchasing an aquamarine with interior inclusions that are noticeable to the naked eye. Avoid surface inclusions, however, since these may make your stone more likely to chip or break upon being struck.

, Stones rich in blue are typically more valuable than green hues, but most blue-green hues are more valuable than borderline-clear stones. Ultimately, however, the right hue is a matter of personal preference.

, Deep sky blue stones are the most valuable and, in general, darker shades are more coveted than light shades. Darker shades are rarer, and they also have a more vivid color than pale shades. This, too, is mostly a matter of personal preference, however.

,


Small aquamarines look nice in delicate pieces, but large aquamarines can make a striking statement.
Since aquamarine is fairly common, you can usually find large carat stones for affordable prices. For most gemstones, the price per carat rises considerably with more carats, but the price per carat for a 30 carat aquamarine is only a third higher than the price per carat of a 1 carat aquamarine.

, The cut of any gemstone determines its brilliance, or the way it reflects light. Well-cut aquamarines are highly reflective. Hold the stone up to the light and turn it to examine how the light strikes it from various angles.

, Aquamarines are fairly easy to cut and resistant to fractures, which allows jewelers to offer the gemstone in a vast variety of shapes. Traditional shapes include round, pear, oval, square, and emerald, but many vanity and modern shapes are also available. Choose a shape that appeals to your sense of taste.

, Heat treatment is a widely accepted practice used to enhance the blueness of a stone. Yellow-brown and yellow-green stones are heated to a temperature between 400 and 450 degrees Celsius, or 752 and 842 degrees Fahrenheit. This treatment is permanent and does not damage the stone.

Decide if you would like the watch to be fully assembled in Switzerland.,
Decide if you want a mechanical, automatic or quartz movement in your watch.,
Decide upon the price you are willing to pay.,

Go to a department store like Macy's, Nordstrom's, Selfridge's or Harrods to find a large selection of quartz and automatic watches.,
Go to a high-end jeweler if you want a luxury mechanical or automatic watch.,
Go online and search for ""Swiss made watches"" to find a list of retailers that have watches.,
Look out for online auctions, or estate auctions, in order to find collectible, antique Swiss watches.",How to Buy a Swiss Watch," Because many types of watches originated in Switzerland, many watch designers from other countries use Swiss watch design methods. Japan has notably used and improved on these methods, and its models rank highly among Swiss models.


You can choose a watch that is noted to have ""Swiss Movement."" This protected designation means that at least 50 percent of the moving parts of the piece were constructed in a Swiss factory using Swiss parts. It does not guarantee that it was fully made in Switzerland. The movement may also read ""Swiss automatic"" or ""Swiss quartz.""
You can choose a watch that is noted as ""Swiss Made."" This means the watch was fully made from Swiss parts and assembled in a Swiss factory. These designations should be on the watch case or dial.
If 1 of these terms is not used, then it is most likely not a Swiss watch you are buying. Because the terms are protected, they are, with rare exceptions, used when they are true.;
, These terms apply to watches made anywhere, but a mechanical or automatic movement may be harder to find. Quartz movement watches, because they oscillate at 32,000 vibrations per second, are very accurate.


A mechanical watch must be wound periodically. These watches are often expensive and beautifully constructed, even passed down from generation to generation. They are not nearly as accurate as quartz watches, but are beautiful works of art. They can fall behind in time by seconds or minutes each week.
An automatic watch harnesses the movement of a rotor while wearing the watch to wind the watch. It is recommended that you also buy a watch winder if you do not plan to wear it every day. It operates on the same principle as a mechanical watch.the only difference is that it is wound automatically. It also requires much less maintenance than a mechanical watch.
The quartz movement watch is seen as the most accurate. A battery works in tandem with the vibrating crystal to keep it accurate. The battery usually needs to be replaced every 1 to 2 years; however, it requires less maintenance than a mechanical watch.

, A Swiss watch does not need to be extremely expensive if it is plated or plastic, but materials like gold, platinum and diamonds will substantially increase the price. Since the invention of the quartz movement, a Swiss watch usually costs between $50 and thousands of dollars (between 70 and thousands of Swiss Francs).

, If you know you want a Swatch, they are available at many retailers, in their 600 stores across the world and from their 8 country-specific online stores, at swatch.com


Swatch are available in digital or traditional versions as well as many colors. The company regularly comes out with new collections. You may want to join their mailing list if you want to be updated when their new collections arrive in stores or online.

, You can get a customer service representative to show you which models are Swiss and choose from a wide selection.

, They will be able to recommend the best, most accurate models. They may also be able to suggest vintage watches that have been repaired and are collector's items.


You may also want to ask a personal shopper to be on the lookout, if you want to buy a luxury Swiss watch. Specify that you want a ""Swiss Made"" watch and the shopper may be able to tell you the best options from a number of dealers.

, Be on the lookout for scams or counterfeit watches. If a luxury Swiss watch is extremely low priced, it is most likely too good to be true.

, Many people consider classic mechanical movements to be works of art. Be on the lookout on eBay or other online auction sites to see if a Swiss watch is up for auction.

, Clarity, or the number of inclusions, often determines the quality of a stone. Prices also vary depending on color.


Low quality to mid-range aquamarines can range from $5 to $100 per carat.
Past 10 carats, mid-range aquamarines can cost between $150 and $200 per carat.
High quality aquamarines are much more expensive. An unheated light blue stone can cost around $90 per carat, while a light blue-green stone can cost between $180 to $240 per carat.
The most expensive unheated stones are medium to strong sky blue, and they can cost up to $550 and $600 per carat.
Heated aquamarines with a strong blue-green hue can cost around $180 per carat.

, Many shoppers prefer silver and white gold settings, since theses cool-toned metals coordinate nicely with blue hues. Yellow gold settings often look nice with deep blue-green aquamarines, however.

, Blue topaz is considerably less valuable than aquamarine, but the two stones can look very similar.


Avoid gemstones labeled as ""Brazilian Aquamarine"" or ""Nerchinsk Aquamarine,"" since both of these actually refer to blue topaz.
Also avoid ""Siam Aquamarine,"" which is actually blue zircon.

, Since natural aquamarines are prevalent and easy to mine, they often prove less costly than synthetic aquamarines.

, Trusted chains are good place to start, but if you want a less expensive option, look at the selection offered by local jewelers and individual sellers. When going to a lesser known source, ask for official certification from a nationally recognized gemological organization, such as the Gemological Institute of America (GIA).

, Loose gemstones are often less expensive, and you can examine the quality of the stone more thoroughly. Loose stones also provide you with greater customization opportunities.

Decide how much you can afford before you start shopping and add ¼ of this price to the initial figures. While choosing the best you are be prepared to double your budget for it. Be ready for cunning tricks of a jeweler to raise the price as well.;
,


Cut is the first of the ""Four C's"" and has the biggest impact on a diamond's quality.
Cut determines how a diamond reflects light, which determines the stone's brilliance.
Cut ratings typically range from ""ideal"" or ""excellent"" down to ""fair."" The higher the rating, the higher the cost.
Don’t try to skim on the cut, because a properly cut stone has facets, which are positioned in a way to reflect the incoming light. A properly-cut diamond sparkles, whereas a poor-cut one has a rather great influence on the quality of the sparkle.

,


Diamond color is a rarity characteristic and not considered a beauty characteristic. Thus, remember that colorless diamonds (D-F) will be much more expensive than a near-colorless counterpart (G-J).
Ratings from ""G"" through ""J"" are near colorless, and ratings from ""K"" through ""L"" only have faint color that most eyes will not detect.
Save money by selecting a color rating from ""G"" through ""K"" instead of demanding a colorless stone.
The above depends on the certificate. GIA-Certified diamonds are known to be graded more strictly than is done for other certificates.

,


Clarity refers to the number of inclusions in a diamond and blemishes on a diamond.
""FL"" refers to Flawless while ""IF"" refers to Internally Flawless. ""VVS-1"" and ""VVS-2"" are very very slightly included under 10x's magnification, while ""VS-1"" and ""VS-2"" are very slightly included under 10x's magnification.
""SI-1"" and ""SI-2"" are slightly included with inclusions being easily visible under 10'x magnification.
Choose a diamond with minor flaws instead of a flawless stone to help you save.

, Diamond carat weight is the single most determining factor when it comes to pricing a diamond. A heavier diamond will cost you more money, however this has nothing to do with the overall cut quality of the stone.

, Do not trust gradings that are only given by the jeweler.

, A jeweler that offers a lifetime warranty may feel more confident about the quality of the merchandise.

Tell by the color and the shine.,
Compare the ruby stone to a shard of red glass.,
Try to scratch the surface.,
See if the ruby rubs off on another surface.,
Know the types of fake.",How to Tell if a Ruby is Real1," Real rubies glow with a deep, vivid, almost ""stoplight"" red. Fake gems are often dull: they are ""light, but not bright."" If the gem is more of a dark red, then it may be garnet instead of a ruby.If it is a real ruby, however, know that darker stones are usually worth more than lighter stones.Check for a consistent and even color throughout the stone. Fakes are more likely to contain blemishes and impure spots. That said: rubies do sometimes have imperfections.
Use the ""stoplight red"" as a guide, but do not expect to find a real ruby that is actually that bright. If you do, then the ruby is likely fake. A real ruby should be more like a bright traffic light, however, than like a dull stone.;
, Rubies and other varieties of sapphire are often faked as glass. If the glass and stone look similar, then you may just be holding two pieces of red glass!It is relatively common for dealers to fake rubies using a glass composite., Real rubies are extremely hard stones. Grind a fingernail or a coin into the surface of the ""ruby"" and see if you are able to scratch it. If the ruby shows a scratch, then there's a good chance that it is not a real ruby. Only a diamond can scratch a ruby.Composite rubies are not as durable as real rubies. There is a chance that the ruby is not a complete ""fake,"" and just a machine-made stone., Gently scratch the stone against a hard, smooth surface: porcelain tile or a piece of clear glass. The stone should scratch the surface whether or not it is a ""ruby."" The tip-off, however, comes if the ""ruby"" leaves a red mark on the surface where you scratched it.The red mark might be a sign that the gem is artificially colored. It might tell you that the ""gem"" is actually made from a much weaker material.

, The stones commonly used as ruby imitations include garnets, tourmaline, glass, and composite gems.Garnets are dullish, dark-red silicate minerals. They are much softer than a ruby.
Tourmaline is a reddish-pink silicate mineral. Tourmaline is somewhat harder than a garnet, but much softer than the ruby.
Red-colored glass imitations are usually cheap, but not very durable. It should be easy to tell if a ""ruby"" is actually made from glass.
Composite rubies are real rubies that have been fused with glass. This makes the stone larger so that a jeweler can sell it for more money. Beware! Composite rubies are often sold as ""real"" rubies, for real ruby prices."

Check the country of origin.,
Inspect the symmetry.,
Look at the opal in strong, white light.,
Check the price.,
Look closely at the pattern.",How to Tell if an Opal Is Fake," Most real opals are mined in Australia, which is the opal capital of the world. Russia and Hong Kong make high quality fake opals that some shady jewelers try to pass off as the real thing. If your opal does not come from Australia then you should seriously suspect its validity.;
, If the opal is a natural stone, then even with cutting and polishing it may not be entirely symmetrical. If the opal is a perfect circle or oval, then you should have a licensed jeweler inspect it before you make the purchase.

, Do not use a fluorescent light, because it can make the opal appear to have more facets than it actually does and can give the impression of additional colors. If the opal seems to have multiple layers of color, then this is a good indication that it is the real thing. However, if an opal only appears to have colors immediately below the surface, it may be a fake.

, A real opal, even a small one, will usually cost over $100. If an opal in a jewelry setting costs only $20 or $40, then you should suspect the bargain.

, An opal created in a laboratory (Gilson opal)displays bright colours in large patches of colour. The pattern is often 'too perfect' and ordered, and can also often display a 'snakeskin' pattern.

Look for flaws through a magnifying lens or jeweler's loupe.,
Check for a sparkling effect.,
Examine the color.,
Look for wear on the facets.,
Check for layers.,
View the emerald through a dichroscope.,
Beware of cheap prices.,
Have the gem appraised.",How to Tell if an Emerald Is Real1," Examine the gem under magnification, ideally through a 10x triple-lens jeweler's loupe. Hold it so light strikes it at an oblique angle, in one narrow beam if possible.If you see tiny flaws or irregular patterns within the stone, it is likely a real gem — although not necessarily an emerald. If your gem is very clear, with almost none of these ""inclusions,"" it may be a synthetic emerald (man-made but real), or not a gemstone at all.


Gas bubbles only appear in natural emeralds near other inclusions of different shapes. If you see a swarm of bubbles alone, the gem is probably glass — but it could be a synthetic emerald.;
, Real emeralds produce little to no ""fire,"" or colorful flashes that appear under light. If your gem produces a rainbow of flashes, it is not an emerald., The mineral beryl is only called emerald if it is dark green or blue-green. Yellow-green beryl is called heliodor, and light green beryl is just called green beryl.A yellow-green gem might also be olivine or green garnet.The line between emerald and green beryl is blurred — two jewelers could disagree over the classification of a gem.

, Glass and other weak materials wear down quickly. If the edges of the facets look soft and worn, the gem is likely fake.Fake glass ""gems"" often develop a dimpled ""orange peel"" texture and slightly rounded facet edges.Look for these features under slight magnification.

, ""Soudé"" imitation gems are constructed from two or three layers of different materials, often a green layer in between two colorless stones.If the stone is not mounted, you can easily see these layers by immersing it in water and viewing from the side.It's more difficult to see this in a mounted stone, but you can try examining the area around the girdle for odd color changes.

, Some gemstones appear different colors from different directions, but you'll need a cheap tool called a dichroscope to make this obvious. Hold the gemstone very close to one end of the dichroscope while you look through the viewing window. The gemstone must be illuminated by a strong, diffuse light source as white as possible, such as an overcast sky.Rotate the gemstone and the dichroscope to view it from all directions. Real emeralds are dichroic, appearing blue-green from one angle and a slightly yellow green from another.Strong dichroism (two very distinct colors) is a sign of a high quality emerald.It is possible to get unusual results due to an internal reflection off a facet, due to properties of fluorescent light, or due to light reaching the viewing window without passing through the gemstone.Use this along with other approaches, not as a single, definitive test.

, If the deal seems too good to be true, trust your instincts. A natural, vividly green emerald with a brilliant luster typically costs at least $500 USD per carat.If the price tag seems suspiciously low, you are probably looking at glass or crystal, not emeralds.


Synthetic emeralds are much cheaper than natural emeralds, but not as cheap as most other synthetic gems.$75 USD per carat is a ballpark figure for small, synthetic emeralds.

, If you still have doubts, take the gemstone to a jeweler and have it professionally appraised. The jeweler will have access to specialized tools that will give you a definitive answer, along with a lengthy description of your gemstone.


Look for a jeweler with accreditation from a national organization, such as the American Society of Appraisers or American Gem Society. A trade school degree in gemology is also a good sign.
Avoid appraisers associated with a particular retailer, especially one that is trying to sell you the gemstone you want appraised.
Fees vary greatly, and may be per-item, per-hour, or per-carat. Do not agree to an appraisal that charges a percentage of the emerald's value."
"
Never settle for the selection offered only by one jeweler.,
Search both online retailers and traditional chain retailers.,
Pay attention to antique stores.,
Perform an Internet search on ""engagement rings"" to populate a list of retailers that sell diamonds online.,
Compare ring prices online, whether you purchase the final ring online or in a store.,
Know when to shop.,
Consider buying loose stones from retail wholesalers.",How to Buy an Engagement Ring on a Budget2," You may get lucky and find the best deal as soon as you set out, but odds are, it will take some shopping around before you locate the best bargain. While shopping around, run through the checklist and find out whether the store has a solid local reputation; whether its staff possesses sound knowledge; which warranties and guarantees it offers; if the shop has a busy repairs service (which stands for the indication of customers trust). Some shops are of the same owner, however prices can be higher at one place and lower at another.

, Chain retailers may offer specialty cuts and may help you along through the process, but online retailers often offer a better price. As well, pay your attention that in person you pay the price and get a ring at once, but online retailers offer you to wait some days or weeks from the date of the order.

, Such stores usually offer a variety of jewelry (valuable and estate pieces). Antique diamonds are usually hand-cut, so there are no other rings that look alike. Such diamonds are often cut in the way to show off the best qualities they possess. This means that one can buy a lesser quality stone, but it’ll give the appearance of an expensive diamond. Factor into that the price of an antique ring may be times higher as the price of the diamond is added to the oldness and fame of the ring.

, Stick with reputable, certified sellers to prevent yourself from getting ripped off.

, This will allow you to find the best bargain in the least amount of time. Some popular shops can have their offices in your town and the online selling in the Internet as well. The prices can be different in both cases, so check it out.

, Monitor local jewelers and wait to see when they run their sales. Keep watch year round, but pay special attention during late November, December, January, and early February. Many jewelers run sales from late November through December due to Christmas. Many also run sales throughout January and early February for Valentine's Day. You may get a discount from 5% to 50%, what will decrease your budget for an engagement ring by a pleasant cut.

, Some wholesale purchasers sell loose diamonds to customers at near wholesale prices. This cuts out the extra retail cost, providing you with a cheaper, more customizable stone.

Choose the diamond shape.,
Select your metal.,
Pick a setting.,
Decide between a solitaire setting and a three-stone setting.,
Consider an alternative to diamonds.",How to Buy an Engagement Ring on a Budget3," Round and princess cut diamonds are among the most common and most inexpensive shapes. Stick with one of these shapes if you need to save money or do not know your partner's preference. Otherwise, you may also consider an emerald, oval, pear, marquise, radiant, heart, asscher, or cushion shape.

,


Most traditional engagement bands are made of yellow gold. It’s better to choose yellow gold for a vintage-style or classic look. White gold suits clean, modern look. White gold engagement rings will need to be dipped in rhodium every 2-3 years in order to maintain the luster.
White gold has a silver-like appearance, but this appearance wears off over time and may need replacing later on.
Platinum is the most expensive option and may not be affordable if you are on a tight budget.

,


Setting refers to the way the diamond sits on the band.
The most common setting is prong, but others include bar, tension, bezel, channel, flush, cluster, and invisible.
Prong settings may often be the least expensive option, but look at a variety of different options before settling. Many others may also fall within your price range.

, Some settings may even have diamonds all around the band. Just remember that the more diamonds a band has, the more expensive it will be. Stick with the traditional, timeless solitaire setting to save on cost.

, Some people may actually prefer a high-quality colored gemstone such as a sapphire, emerald, or ruby. Do not, however, try to pass off cubic zirconia or other gemstone as a diamond.

Ask your partner.,
Choose a setting and a band that can be resized easily.,
Err on the side of “too big” rather than “too small.” It is easier and cheaper for a jeweler to size down a large ring than it is to size up a small ring.",How to Buy an Engagement Ring on a Budget4," Make sure you choose a ring that fits their finger, but look for one that they will not notice missing for a few days. Take it to a jeweler and ask to determine the size.

, Take the sketch with you to a jeweler and ask to determine the size from that. This way, you do not need to sneak anything out.

, Mark the stopping point with a pen, and show the mark to a jeweler for an assessment.

, Your partner may have shared information about their ring size specifically for occasions like this. Ask someone your partner has a close relationship with, but make sure to ask someone who can keep a secret.

, Partners who know that an engagement could be around the corner, may offer you the information willingly.

, In spite of all your precautions, the ring could still end up being the wrong size. Finger size may even change at some point in the future. Bands covered in multiple diamonds or those that feature other decorative elements along the side can be difficult, if not impossible, to resize, and the cost of doing so will be higher than with a simple, solid band and a traditional solitaire setting.

, If you feel uncertain about the ring size, choose an option that is slightly larger instead of one that seems too small.

Bring the stone to a professional jeweler.,
Get an appraisal.,
Certify the ruby.",How to Tell if a Ruby is Real2," Ultimately, the safest way to be sure is to pay a professional to have a look at the gem. He or she should be able to tell you whether or not the ruby is real.


Look up reputable jewelers in your city. Consider looking at reviews online before you visit the jeweler. Check whether other customers were satisfied with the accuracy of this person's analysis.

, A jeweler can analyze the ruby and tell you how much it is worth. Others may pay much more or much less for the gem – but an appraisal is usually a good ballpark estimate of what a stone is worth in monetary value., A licensed jeweler can give you an official certification that your ruby is the real deal. This document will act as legitimizing proof should you ever decide to sell the ruby. Make a copy of the certificate and keep it in a safe, secret place.Certify your ruby for the sake of insurance. If you ever lose the ruby in a disaster or another mix-up, then you will be more likely to receive compensation for the loss if you can prove that you lost an actual ruby.
If you plan to keep the ruby, keep it as a family heirloom. When your family or friends one day inherit the ruby, it will be much more valuable if it is certified. You will also save them the trouble of going through the same steps to determine whether the ruby is real.

"
"
Inspect the ruby with a 10-power magnifier.,
Expect microscopic flaws.,
Look at the ruby's cuts and facets.",How to Tell if a Ruby is Real3," Use a jeweler's loupe or a standard microscope. If you don't have access to a high-powered magnification tool of your own, consider asking a friend or a local lab. Otherwise, just visit a jeweler.

, Look for small, microscopic flaws that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. You should see some small imperfections on a real ruby. Fake and lab-created rubies are almost always flawless, as the natural flaws are so tiny that they are extremely hard to replicate.


If you see bubbles of any kind, then you are likely dealing with a fake ruby. Look for flaws other than bubbles.
External flaws (blemishes) include scratches, pits, nicks, and small scrapes. Internal flaws (inclusions) are categorized as: cracks (feathers) crystals, negative crystals, silk, fingerprints, halos, cavities, chips, and color zoning., The intricacies of the ruby surface will only be readily visible beneath a 10-power microscope. If the ruby is rounded, rolled, or excessively smooth, then it is probably a fake gem. The stone might be the real deal if the facet is clean, pristine, and sharp-cut.

Understand synthetic emeralds.,
Purchase three emerald testing filters.,
Look through a Chelsea filter.,
Follow up with a synthetic filter.,
View the gem through a support filter instead.,
Examine the emerald through a loupe.,
Examine the inclusions.,
Shine a blacklight onto the emerald.",How to Tell if an Emerald Is Real2," Synthetic emeralds were grown in a lab, and have the same chemical composition as natural emeralds. These are real emeralds, but cost much less due to the cheaper manufacturing process. If you suspect someone is trying to sell you a synthetic emerald for an inflated price, try the following tests.

For a definitive test, continue on to the next step to get started using emerald filters.
If you do not wish to purchase filters, skip down to the other tests. These do still require some tools, as synthetic emeralds are very difficult to identify by eye.

, Look online for a Chelsea filter, a synthetic emerald filter, and a synthetic emerald support filter. These last two are sold as ""Hanneman filters"" and may be available in a pair. All three filters together could cost $60 USD or more, so this may not be worth it for a single stone.


In some cases you will also need a jeweler's loupe to examine the emerald up close. This is not necessary for most emeralds.

, To get started, examine the emerald through the Chelsea filter:Place the emerald under a strong, incandescent light source on a flat, white background. (Fluorescent lights may alter results.)
Cover any attached metal or other stones with a tissue to prevent reflected colors.
Hold the Chelsea filter close to your eye and note the color of the stone viewed through the filter, from about 10 inches (25 cm) away or a little closer.
If the emerald looks red or pink through the Chelsea filter, continue to the next step to test it through the synthetic filter.
If the emerald looks green through the Chelsea filter, skip down to the support filter step.
If the emerald looks purplish-red, it is synthetic. Confirm borderline colors by looking through both other filters (synthetic and support) — if it looks greenish through both, it is synthetic. If it looks greenish through synthetic but reddish through support, it is natural.

, If the emerald looked red or pink through the Chelsea filter, it contains chromium. Both natural and synthetic emeralds can contain chromium, so narrow it down with the synthetic filter from an emerald testing kit:Move the emerald several inches away from the light source, then view it through the synthetic filter.
If it looks red or pink again, the gem is a flux-grown synthetic emerald.
If it look greenish this time, it is a natural emerald, likely Colombian or Russian.

, This is only useful if the gem looked green through the Chelsea filter. Follow these steps:Move the emerald several inches away from the light source, then view through the support filter.
If the emerald looks blue-green, lilac, or pink, it is a synthetic, hydrothermal emerald.
If the emerald still looks greenish (but not blue-green), continue to the next step.

, If the emerald appeared green through the Chelsea filter and through the support filter, it could be natural or synthetic. Fortunately, the synthetic emeralds that match this description tend to look quite different from natural emeralds. Examine emerald through a 10x triple jeweler's loupe:


If it is clear and almost entirely free of inclusions, it is almost certainly a synthetic, hydrothermal emerald.
If magnification reveals many small flaws (crystals, needles, wisps, and so on), the gemstone is a natural emerald that contains vanadium and/or iron, such as those mined in Zambia, Brazil, and India.


, Early synthetic emeralds had very few inclusions, compared to the many small flaws found in natural emeralds.Later techniques did produce more inclusions, but some types of inclusions only appear in natural emeralds. Look for these under a gem microscope if possible, or through a jeweler's loupe:


If you see a ""pocket"" in the gem that contains both gas bubbles and crystals, you have a natural emerald.This is called a ""three phase inclusion.""
Certain crystals only appear in natural emeralds: bamboo-like green actinolite fibers, mica flakes, or pyrite crystal cubes., For this test, you'll need a ""long wave"" blacklight — the cheapest, most widely available type. Put your emerald in a dim or dark room. Shine the blacklight onto the gem and watch the color of the fluorescence:


Yellow, olive-green, or bright red fluorescence is a sure sign of a synthetic emerald.No fluorescence at all means the emerald is likely natural, but this is not guaranteed. There is one type of synthetic emerald without fluorescence.Dull red or orange-red fluorescence could be natural or synthetic.

Get educated.,
Find the out where the emerald came from.,
Learn about emerald treatments.,
Decide what metal you want.,
Find out the store's return policy.,
Figure in the shipping costs if buying small.,
Read the product details and description carefully.,
Build your own.",How to Buy an Emerald Online," There are plenty of resources on the net, with all the hows and whys of emeralds. Here are some basics:


Basics: The Four C’s, as in diamonds, are applicable to emeralds as well. These are: Color, Clarity, Cut and Carat. Unlike in diamonds, color in emeralds is the most relevant feature. The only gemstone which has a color named after it is emerald: emerald green.
Emeralds are known to vary in hue and tone and saturation; three color qualities. An even tone, medium saturation and deep hue are the best. With variations in color tones and saturation, prices are affected.
Clarity feature in emeralds refers to the inclusions or flaws in an emerald. Sometimes invisible to the naked eye, these are the ‘unique fingerprints’ of a gemstone. Emeralds are naturally heavily included, and clearer ones can sway banks literally.
Cut refers to how well the shape of an emerald has been executed, to optimize its beauty. A very good emerald can be enhanced only by the expertise of the cutter, so this is another vital C.
Carat is the weight of an emerald, and naturally the larger an emerald, the higher the cost. However, if the caratage is high, but other features like color tone and cut are not the tops, even a large emerald maybe quite affordable.;
, Emeralds are also valued by their place of origin. The best known emeralds in history have come from Columbia. Some other sources of better emeralds are in Zambia, Africa.

, Treatments have been a part of the gemstone industry for centuries together; if it weren’t for these, we wouldn’t know our gemstones as we do, but wear them as amulets and rocks like the Incas. However, recently the industry has witnessed some malpractices, and now the jewelers are required to disclose treatments that a gemstone has undergone. Also known as enhancements, there are a range of these, and mostly permanently enhance the beauty of a gem.

, Metal preference can also affect the cost. Usually, 10K gold is lower priced than 18K gold; both yellow gold finish, as well as white gold. The color of an emerald is better enhanced by the yellow gold, though.

, This is most relevant to you when buying an emerald online. You don’t want to make the expensive error of buying an emerald that looked better in the catalog, and is a tad lower in your hands. Study the return policy of the jeweler carefully before buying.

, Most online retailers offer free shipping on orders above a certain sum. Check this.

, Be sure this is exactly what you want.

, A fun way to buy jewelry online is to build your own. Most sites offer to customize jewelry, and you can choose the emerald according to your budget.

Listen for the telltale ""tick, tick, tick"" rather than a much more rapid ticking noise.,
Look for jerky second hand motion.,
Look for fake ""magnification"" of the date.,
Loosen the stem and roll back the hands to change the date, it should change to the previous date when it goes down to the 6 position, not at the 12.,
Feel for a suspiciously light weight.,
Look for a clear backside to the watch.,
Look for non-metal construction.,
Test the watch's water-tightness.,
When all else fails, compare your watch to the real thing.",How to Tell if a Rolex Watch is Real or Fake1," On standard watches, the motion of the second hand is jerky and truncated because the majority of them are quartz watches. The second hand shifts abruptly from each second position to the next. If you listen carefully, you can usually hear a quiet ""tick, tick, tick"" from this motion. On the other hand, Rolexes (and many other fine watches) have second hands that move almost perfectly smoothly because they have automatic movements not quartz. Because of this, Rolex does not make a ""ticking"" noise. If you hear a slow ?ticking noise coming from your watch, this is a dead giveaway that you're not wearing a real Rolex, the noise you hear should be much faster than a battery operated watch..;
, As noted above, Rolexes have second hands that smoothly sweep across the face of the watch, rather than jerking from one position to the next. Look at your watch's second hand carefully — does it turn smoothly, tracing the path of a perfect circle around the edge of the watch's face? Or does it appear to speed up, slow down, or jerk as it turns? If the second hand's motion is anything less than silky smooth, you may have an imitation on your hands.


In fact, if you look extremely closely, a real Rolex's second hand motion isn't perfectly smooth. Many models actually move at a speed of about 8 tiny movements per second.Some models even have slower speeds. To the naked eye, however, this motion is usually undetectable, so the second hand looks like it's moving smoothly.

, Many (but not all)Rolex watches have a small dial or window that displays the date. Usually, this is on the right side of the watch face (near the ""three o'clock"" position). To make this dial easier to read, some Rolexes include a small magnification lens (sometimes called a ""cyclops"") in the glass over the dial. This part is difficult to counterfeit, so many fake Rolexes will have something that appears to be a magnification panel, but, on close inspection, is actually only ordinary glass. If the magnification panel over the date dial doesn't actually seem to make the date numbering any larger, you may have a fake.


Actual Rolex magnification windows should magnify the date to 2.5x — the date should take up nearly the entire window.Some good counterfeits will magnify the date somewhat but often not to the point that the entire window is filled. They will also not be centered over the date exactly. Be suspicious of a magnification window that looks glued on imperfectly or off center.

, This is virtually impossible to replicate. If it does not do this it is likely a fake.

, Real Rolexes are constructed from real metal and crystal and thus have some heft to them. They should feel solid and substantial in your hand and on your wrist. If your Rolex feels suspiciously lightweight, it may not be of the highest quality — it may be lacking some of the precious metals used in many models of Rolex or may be constructed entirely from substandard materials.

, Some imitation Rolexes feature a clear glass back which allows you to see the inner workings of the watch. This clear backing may or may not be concealed beneath a removable metal cover. In fact, no current models of Rolex contain this sort of clear caseback, so if your watch has this feature, it is not a true Rolex. Only a few Rolexes have ever been made with clear case backings, and these were all exhibition models.It is thought that counterfeiters add this clear caseback to help vendors sell watches to unwitting customers by allowing them to view the workmanship inside the watch. Inexperienced customers may be wowed by the inner workings of the watch, rather than alerted to the fact that something is wrong.

, Take your Rolex and turn it over. Examine the back of your watch — it should be made of smooth, unmarked, high-quality metal. If the band is not made of leather, it should be made from high-quality metal construction as well. If any part of the watch's construction is made from plastic or a thin, cheap-looking metal like aluminum, you're dealing with a fake. These qualities are clear signs that corners were cut during the manufacture of the watch. Rolexes are made from only the finest materials. No expense is spared in the creation of each watch.


In addition, if the back casing of your watch appears to be made from metal but can be removed to reveal a plastic inner case, the watch isn't genuine.

, One surefire way to determine whether a supposed Rolex is real or not is to see if it is waterproof. All Rolex watches are made to be perfectly airtight — if your watch leaks even a little bit, it's probably not the real thing. To test whether your watch is waterproof, fill a cup with water, make sure the stem is screwed on tightly and dunk the watch into the cup for several seconds, and take it out. The watch should be working perfectly fine and you shouldn't see any water inside the dial. If you do, you have a fake on your hands.


Obviously, if your watch is a fake, this test can harm or even ruin the watch. In the event of water damage, you may be forced to take the watch to an experienced repairman or even buy a new one entirely, so, if you're not comfortable with these possibilities, try to rely on the other tests.
Note that the Submariner is the only Rolex watch designed for deep water usage — while other Rolexes should be fine in the shower and the swimming pool, they may leak under more serious aquatic conditions., If you're still not sure if your watch is a real Rolex, it can be helpful to compare the way your watch looks to the way it is supposed to look. The Rolex website contains a catalog of all the watches Rolex produces, with multiple pictures for each. Find the model of watch you have on the Rolex site, then compare the appearance of your watch to that of the available ""reference"" images. Pay special attention to the dial — is everything laid out where it should be? If your watch has an extra dial like a chronograph or a date dial, is it in the right place? Are all the inscriptions identical? Is the lettering the same?


If you can answer ""no"" to any of these questions, you probably have a fake. Rolex's brand is famous for the quality of its craftsmanship — noticeable errors are extremely rare.

Consider professional testing.",How to Tell if an Amethyst Is Real1," Amethyst is a purple or violet shade. Some gems may have a slightly reddish undertone, but should still remain primarily purple.Brightness varies. Some amethyst gems may be so light there is only a light purple glimmer. Some may be so dark that, under light, they appear blackish.Color will not be entirely consistent in authentic amethyst. Your gem should have different hues of purple throughout and color may change slightly in response to different lighting.Color zoning is the uneven distribution of color in a gemstone.This may occur in amethyst gems. Authentic amethyst may have some color zoning, which can lessen its value, that's typically visible when the gem is laid flat on a white surface.;

This is a term that means the product is free of inclusions, which are materials trapped in a gem during its formation, visible with the naked eye. An authentic amethyst is likely to be mostly clear in appearance. Bubbles and discolorations are unlikely., Amethyst is easy to cut, so it's not uncommon to find amethyst jewelry in a wide-variety of shapes and sizes. You may find genuine amethyst cut into round shapes, pear shapes, squares, hearts, and so on. As amethyst cuts easily, authentic amethyst should be smooth and polished upon purchase.If the amethyst in question is cut into a round shape, look for uneven distribution of color. If there seems to be a lot of color variation, this actually means the stone is more likely to be authentic. Jewelers frequently cut discolored amethyst into a round shape as this makes variations slightly less noticeable., Authentic gems should be slightly imperfect. There should be some color zoning and the shade should have tones of white or blue in addition to purple. A gem that is one particular shade of purple throughout is likely a fake. You should also look for things like bubbles and cracks within the amethyst. A real gem will have some slight wear or tear accrued over time.Examine your amethyst closely for inconsistencies. Authentic amethyst is more valuable if cut and manipulated in a way to minimize the appearance of things like color zoning and scratches. Therefore, it may take quite a bit of examination before you notice any imperfections. Examine the gem under a magnifying glass if necessary.

, Specific gravity is a term used by jeweler's to ascertain the rough density of a gem. For amethyst, specific gravity should be around 2.65.You can measure specific gravity with a beaker, big enough to fit your piece of amethyst in, and a scale.


To start, write down the weight of the beaker. Then, write down the weight of the amethyst. Then, partially fill the beaker with water and write down the amount of water, as measured by the beaker.
Put the amethyst into the beaker. The water should rise. Subtract the level the water is at now from its original level. Write this number down. This is the amount of displaced water.Remove the amethyst and drain the water. Put in the amount of water that the mineral displaced.Weigh the beaker again, with the displaced water in it. Subtract the beaker's original weight from this number. This is the weight of the displaced water. To find specific gravity, divide the weight of the amethyst by the weight of the displaced water. This numbers should be somewhere in the 2.65 range if you have real amethyst., The hardness of a gem is measured on a scale from 1 to 10. Amethyst is a 7, meaning it's a fairly hard gem. Testing the hardness of a gem is a somewhat inexact process. However, you can test the hardness of a gem by seeing if its scratch resistant to other gems. If your amethyst is authentic, it should be scratch resistant to anything that falls lower than 7 on the hardness scale.Everyday objects fall fairly low on the hardness scale. A fingernail is has a hardness of 2. A knife blade is a 5. A steel blade is a 6.5.Try to gently scratch your amethyst with your finger nail or a knife blade. You can scratch it against an object with a steel blade, like an expensive knife or axe, if you can find one. Your amethyst should be scratch resistant to these objects. If it is not, it may not be authentic., The only way to be completely sure of the authenticity of amethyst is to have it tested. You can take your amethyst to a local jeweler and ask him or her about lab identification. Cost varies depending on the size of your gem. If you're concerned about authenticity, it may be worth the cost to know for sure.


Professional testing can ascertain whether an amethyst came from a geode. Many amethysts originally came from geodes.

Know the basics: The Four C’s, as in diamonds, is applicable to tanzanites as well.,
Educate yourself about Tanzanite.,
Look for clarity.,
Check the cut.,
Ask for the carat.,
Ask about its origin.,
Read the product details and description carefully.,
Read the return policy.,
Match with the diamond.,
Select the right metal.,
Build your own.",How to Buy a Tanzanite Online," These are: Color, Clarity, Cut and Carat. Unlike in diamonds, color in tanzanites is the most significant feature. The blue in a tanzanite is valued in terms of hue, tone and saturation. Clear, deep blue violet tanzanites are valued more than dusky ones.;
, Why is tanzanite such a prized gemstone? What makes for its popularity with the celebrities? What features should you look for in Tanzanites?

, The Clarity feature in a tanzanite refers to the inclusions or flaws in a tanzanite. Tanzanites are seldom heavily included, and clearer ones are quite possible. Larger sizes display the color best, so choose the largest that you can afford.

, The Cut refers to how well the shape of a tanzanite has been executed, to optimize its beauty. Excellent tanzanite shapes are possible, so cutters achieve imaginative shapes in tanzanite.

, Carat is the weight of a tanzanite, and naturally the larger a tanzanite, the higher the cost. Further, if the carat is higher, and color and clarity are optimum, a large tanzanite maybe a sound investment.

, Gemstones are also valued by their place of origin. This is where Tanzanite scores over all the rest of the gemstones. The only known source of Tanzanite is Tanzania in Africa. Given this, it is the rarest of rare gemstones. When you buy a tanzanite, it is an heirloom.

, Be sure this is the tanzanite you want.

, This is most relevant when buying a tanzanite online. Don’t make the expensive error of buying a tanzanite that looked better in the catalog, and is its distant cousin in real life. Study the Return Policy of the Jeweler.

, If you are choosing tanzanite and diamond jewelry, choose diamonds of a lower color and tip the costs. Such small diamonds don’t need certification necessarily.

, Metal preference can also affect the cost. Usually, 10K gold is lower priced than 18K gold; both yellow gold finish, as well as white gold. The color of a tanzanite is always enhanced by white gold.

, A fun way to buy jewelry online is to build your own. Most sites offer to customize jewelry, and you can choose the tanzanite according to your budget.

Familiarize yourself with opals and their terminology.,
Identify the types of natural opals available.Natural opals, as opposed to man-made and synthetic opals, are the most expensive and precious stones you can buy.,
Distinguish natural opals from modified and man-made versions.Modified opals are referred to as doublets and triplets.,
Recognize how opal stones are valued.",How to Buy an Opal1," Opals differ from other precious gemstones in their basic composition and how they are valued. These unique stones come in a wide range of colors and patterns, both of which can change, depending on the angle you view them from. Since buying an opal can be a significant investment, learn as much as you can about them before you start shopping. This will ensure you make an informed decision and get what you pay for.


Research reputable websites, favoring informational ones over retailer websites. Look into books on the subject. Get familiar with opal-specific terminology.A large portion of the world’s opals come from Australia, so a good place to start is the Australian government’s Department of Industry website. Learn more about opals by visiting http://www.resourcesandenergy.nsw.gov.au/miners-and-explorers/applications-and-approvals/opal-mining/about-opal.;
, There are four main types – boulder (also known as matrix) opals, black opals, white opals and crystal opals. They differ from each other greatly in appearance.


Black opals are the most rare and expensive of all. They aren’t actually black (they come in a range of brilliant colors) but instead have a dark body tone. The demand for these opals is high.
Boulder (also known as matrix) opals have a dark body tone that looks similar to the black opal. They cost less, but come in a similar range of brilliant colors.
Crystal opals are unique because they’re transparent to semi-transparent in appearance. They can have a very glassy surface and dark or light body tones. The color often determines their value.
White opals have a milky body tone. They are much more common than black opals and don’t feature the same brilliant hues. While less expensive than black opals, white opals can be very beautiful and colorful when of high quality., A doublet isn’t a full opal, but instead, a thin slice of opal (usually crystal or white) glued onto a backing of plastic or black glass. Triplets are the same as doublets, except they feature an additional layer of clear plastic or glass over the opal.Synthetic opals have the same composition and physical structure as natural ones, but they are made in a lab. Because they’re man-made, synthetics appear glassier and the color schemes and patterns are a lot more regular and organized.Doublets, triplets and synthetics are all worth much less than natural opals.
If you inspect the sides of doublets and triplets, you can spot their layers. This makes them easily recognizable.

, Opals don’t have an official valuation process like other precious gemstones. This can make it difficult to know exactly what you’re getting and a lot of the value is subjective in nature. However, there are some key characteristics you can use to assess an opal’s value. The most important factors are the range of play of colors, patterns, opal class, body tone, brilliance, thickness, color bar and faults.


“Play of color” means the range and brilliance of the hues visible in an opal when viewed from different angles.
The most valuable type of opal will have a play of color that covers its entire surface and can be seen from multiple angles."

Take a look at the logo on the face.,
Know what to look for in the calendar display.,
Check for misspellings.,
Be suspicious of “open heart” designs.,
Watch the movement of the hands.,
Locate the model and serial number.,
Test for glare.,
Feel for the watch’s weight.,
See if the watch comes with a certificate.",How to Spot a Fake Breitling," Breitling watches are stamped with a distinct logo bearing an anchor fixed between a set of wings. The logo is small and displayed tastefully in the upper center area of the watch face, with the Breitling name printed below, and is always etched directly into the face. If the logo is printed, or appears abnormally large or fuzzy, it’s most likely a fake.Breitling also engraves a small anchor symbol on the second hand of their watches. If this anchor is absent or sloppily printed, you’re dealing with a fabrication.;
, Inspect the dials beneath the Breitling logo and look for one displaying the date. Breitlings are what are known as “chronograph” watches, meaning they utilize a complex dial system to keep track of time. The subdials on most authentic Breitling watches are used to display the various measurements of the chronograph, and none should show the days of the week or month. If your Breitling watch does have a calendar display, it will appear in a separate, magnified window.Counterfeit watches most often display the day and month directly on one of the subdials.
Fake Breitlings that do feature a separate date display typically do a poor job replicating the magnification and clarity of the window.

, Carefully examine the face and back of the watch for lettering errors. As Breitling watches are of Swiss origin, different parts of the watch will contain Swiss words and slogans that are often spelled incorrectly on imitations. Take particular notice of the quality of the printing, as fakes utilize cheaper printing methods that often result in a fuzzy or pixelated appearance of the letters.Since the lettering on Breitling watches is written in Swiss (and sometimes French), it can be difficult to know if a section of text is misspelled. Consult images of authentic Breitling models online to verify authentic spellings and printing methods.

, See if the watch’s escapement is visible; this is what is known as an “open heart” watch design. The escapement is a small device used to regulate the watch’s mechanical movement. Breitling only manufactures one open heart model, and its numbers are extremely limited. If your Breitling watch has its internal workings in plain sight, you can bet it’s a knock-off.The “Breitling for Bentley Mulliner” is the only Breitling watch with an open heart design., Do the hands of your watch move in a continuous, sweeping motion, or is there a separate tick for each passing second? With few exceptions, Breitling watches are of mechanical construction and the movement of the second hand will be constant. Most Breitling forgeries keep time automatically and as a result the second hand will move with individual ticks. Battery-powered automatic watches are cheaper to produce and don’t require the craftsmanship mechanical watches are noted for, so more of these imitations saturate the market.The hands on mechanical watches move smoothly because of the constant tension generated by hand-winding, whereas automatic watches keep time with a staccato ticking.Some automatic quartz model Breitlings exist, though these are less common. Be sure what type of model you’re buying to know whether its operation should be mechanical or quartz-regulated.

, Look the band over for the watch’s model and serial number. Breitling stamps each and every one of their watches with these manufacturing details, either on the band, the casing or both. If you don’t find this unique stamp, or if the stamp lists an incorrect model or serial number, it’s not the genuine article.Breitlings with metallic bracelets will usually have the model and serial number stamped on the bracelet itself, while some models with leather straps bear the stamp on the back of the watch instead, in case the band is replaced.
Authentic leather strap watches will also be marked with the French phrases “cuir veritable” (genuine leather) or “croco veritable” (genuine crocodile skin), depending on the material. Replicas tend to leave out this detail, or get the type of material wrong.

, Hold the watch up to a light source to see if there’s a glare off the face. The crystal in a real Breitling is brushed with an anti-glare coating to cut down on the amount of light it reflects. There shouldn’t be much of a glare, and what reflection there is will be slightly bluish from the color of the crystal. If the watch face creates a blinding glare, you can bet it’s a fake., Hold the watch in your hand to assess its weight. Because of it’s heavy-duty, stainless steel construction and the quality of its internal components, the authentic watch should have a satisfying heft to it. The majority of replicas are manufactured from cheaper metals or even plastic, making them feel light and easily breakable.While many different models exist, the average weight of a Breitling watch is somewhere between 90-120g.Weight should not be the sole indicator of authenticity for a watch, as makers of knock-offs sometimes fill their watches with unnecessary pieces to make them heavier.

, If you’re buying the watch new, it should always come with a printed certificate of authenticity listing its technical specifications and manufacturing origin. The information contained in the certificate will describe the individual components of the watch, many of which can be used to tell a real watch from a fake one. An imitation will not go to the trouble of replicating this certificate.When buying a used Breitling, ask the current owner if the watch came with an official certificate.

Locate any identifying marks on your jewelry.,
Look for marks indicating silver jewelry.,
Find any marks indicating platinum jewelry.,
Run a magnet over the jewelry.",How to Identify Platinum and Silver Jewelry1," These markings will be etched into the metal. If the jewelry has a clasp then the marks are probably on the back of the clasp. The jewelry might also have a small metal tag etched with marks hanging from the end. Lastly, search the largest parts of the jewelry.


If your jewelry doesn’t have any markings at all it’s probably not a precious metal.;
, Some coins and jewelry will have a stamp with the numbers “999”.This indicates that the jewelry is made of pure silver.If you see a stamp with the numbers “925” followed or preceded by the letter “S”, you have sterling silver. Sterling silver is 92.5% pure silver that’s mixed with another metal alloy, usually copper.For example, a stamp that says “S925” indicates that the jewelry is sterling silver.
Pure silver jewelry is rare as pure silver is soft and easily damaged., Platinum is a very rare and expensive metal. Therefore, all platinum jewelry will be marked to show authenticity. Look for the words “Platinum”, “PLAT”, or “PT” followed or preceded by the numbers “950” or “999”. These numbers refer to the purity of the platinum, with “999” as the most pure.For example, an authentic piece of platinum jewelry might have a stamp reading “PLAT999”.

, Most pure precious metals aren’t magnetic. Therefore, if you place a magnet near the jewelry, you shouldn’t see any movement at all. If you do, the metal isn’t pure silver or pure platinum.Some silver and platinum alloys are magnetic. Therefore, a lower quality silver or platinum piece of jewelry may be magnetic.
If you have a piece of jewelry with a stamp that’s attracted to a magnet, see a reputable jeweler to verify its authenticity.

Look for the serial number.,
Look for the crown at six o'clock.,
Look for etched inscription inside the rim of the dial.,
Look for a high-quality crown logo on the dial.,
Look for perfectly precise lettering on the dial.",How to Tell if a Rolex Watch is Real or Fake2," Some expert-made counterfeits won't be easy to tell apart from actual Rolexes. To spot these, you may need to examine the watch's tiny, intricate detail work, which is the hardest part of the watch to fake. To start, try finding your watch's serial number. This will require you to remove the band. You can usually do this by pushing the joint holding the band to the watch out of its place with a thumbtack or similarly-sized object. However, if you're uncomfortable with this, you can also have a professional do it for you. The serial number should be located between the ""lugs"" at the six o'clock end of the dial.


The lettering on the serial number should be perfect and precise, with fine lines. Some counterfeiters use an acid-etching method which produces serial number markings with a noticeable ""sandy"" appearance under magnification.Between the opposite set of lugs, there should be another similar marking. This is the case reference number and will be labeled with the words, ""ORIG ROLEX DESIGN.""An original Rolex will have sharp and detailed engraving located between the lugs. Counterfeiters often try to mimic these engraving, the result often appears like the serial number has been roughly etched into the casing.
Note that it's possible to look the date of your watch's manufacture up with your serial number — several handy online sources (like this one) can help you here.

, Starting in the early to mid 2000s, Rolex began etching the trademark crown logo into the crystal of their watch's dials.If your watch was made in the past decade or so, you may be able to see this tiny mark of authenticity. Use a magnifying glass or a jeweler's lens to carefully examine the glass at the six o'clock end of the watch's dial. Look for the Rolex crown logo — the same design as the much larger logo at the opposite end of the dial. The etching you are looking for is very, very small and can be quite tricky to see. You may find that it is easier to see if you shine light at the face of the watch at an angle.


Some counterfeiters do attempt to copy this etching, but it is extremely difficult to duplicate with the precision of an actual Rolex.If this etching is large enough to easily see with the naked eye, you may have a fake on your hands.

, Another mark of authenticity is the fine, etched lettering that is usually included around the rim of Rolex watch dials. Examine this lettering with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. The lettering should be fine, precise, and elegant, with no imperfections. Additionally, the lettering should be etched into the metal rim. If it appears to be painted or printed instead, the watch is likely a fake.


Note that, typically, all watches from Rolex's Oyster series bear this etching. Watches from the Cellini series often have non-standard designs (rectangular faces, etc.) and thus may not have this etching.

, Almost (though not quite) all Rolex watches have the trademark crown logo located at the top of the dial near the twelve o'clock marking. Examining this logo under magnification can sometimes reveal a fake. The logo should appear to made of high-quality metal construction. The circles at the end of the crown's points should have raised bumps. The outline of the crown should glimmer with a different metallic sheen than the inside.If your crown logo looks cheap or flat under magnification, this is a sign of poor craftsmanship (and a likely indicator of a fake).

, Rolexes are renowned for their perfection. Even small, relatively undetectable defects can be clues that your Rolex isn't top quality. Examine the lettering on your watch's dial with a magnifying glass or jeweler's lens. Each letter should be perfectly, precisely formed with straight lines and smooth curves. The spaces between words and letters should be consistent. If you notice that any letters seem to be even slightly uneven or smudged under magnification, this is a sign that the watch was made with sub-optimal printing technology and is probably not a Rolex.


It's also worth mentioning that, obviously, any sort of misspelling is also a dead giveaway that the watch is a fake.

"
Beware sub-par packaging.,
Beware shady locations.,
Beware unusually cheap prices.,
When all else fails, take your watch to an experienced jeweler.,
Finished.

",How to Tell if a Rolex Watch is Real or Fake3," Everything about a Rolex watch should be elegant, dignified, and perfect. This even includes the packaging. Real Rolexes come in fine jewelry boxes which usually include a mount to hold and display the watch as well as a small cloth to clean and polish it. All packaging should bear the official Rolex name and logo. The watch should also come with a manual and warranty paperwork.If your watch is missing any of these things, it may not be genuine.


Buying a watch by itself off the street is a complete crap shoot — since there's no packaging, there's no way to tell it's authentic.

, When shopping for Rolexes, use common sense. A reputable jeweler or a fine watch dealer is much, much more likely to be selling genuine Rolexes than a street vendor. Rolexes can cost thousands of dollars, so it's safe to assume that anyone who sells them will have the resources to own a legitimate business. If you're unsure whether a certain retailer is a reputable Rolex seller, consult Rolex's online listing of certified retailers here.


Pawn shops can be a mixed bag — they may have genuine Rolexes, but they may not, depending on the individuals who sold the shop the watches. Some pawn shops take efforts to ensure that they only sell genuine watches, while others may turn a blind eye to counterfeits. If you don't know whether a certain pawn shop can be trusted, try to find online reviews and testimonials for the store before making your purchase.

, When it comes to buying Rolexes, if a deal seems too good to be true, it probably is. Rolex watches are fine-made luxury goods crafted to perfection — they're never cheap. The most expensive Rolex watches in the world sell for over a million dollars, while even some of the cheapest models can sell for over $4000.If you're being offered a Rolex for $100 dollars, it doesn't matter what the seller's explanation is — there's either something wrong with the watch or it's not the real thing.


Don't accept an unscrupulous seller's excuses. If you're being told that a Rolex watch is being sold for cheap because the seller found it or because it was given as a gift, walk away. Assume that there are no lucky coincidences when spending the kind of money that it takes to purchase a Rolex.

, Sometimes, even when you know what to look for, it's almost impossible to tell whether a watch is the real deal or a fake. In these cases, a knowledgeable, trustworthy jeweler or watch salesman can help you by examining the watch for qualities that the ordinary person can't catch. If you have a great relationship with this expert, you may be able to have your watch's genuineness judged for free. Otherwise, jewelry appraisal services, while not cheap, are fairly affordable when compared to the price of a Rolex.


For instance, some jewelry appraisal services can run at a cost of up to $180 per hour.Because of this, you may want to have multiple items appraised at once to get the greatest possible value.
Only use jewelry appraisal services that charge by the hour, on a per-piece basis, or for a contracted amount based on the estimated time needed. Never use appraisers that charge a percentage of the jewelry's value — this is a scamming technique.,"

Find a reputable gem dealer.,
Ask about the gem's origin.,
Consider the price.,
Ask for information during the sale.,
Be wary of unusual names.,
Look for legitimate online dealers.",How to Tell if an Amethyst Is Real2," If you want to make sure you're amethyst is real, look for a solid dealer. You're less likely to find knock off amethyst if you work with a dealer with a solid reputation.


Ask friends who are into jewelry. This is the easiest place to start when seeking out a gem dealer. If you have friends that have a lot of expensive jewelry, ask them where they got their best pieces. They may be able to point you to a solid dealer.
The American Gem Trade Association, the Federal Trade Commission, and the Jeweler's Vigilance Committee are organizations that all work to ensure honestly and quality when it comes to gem dealing. If a jeweler is affiliated with one of these organizations, he or she is more likely to be legitimate.If a gem comes with a lab report, which should verify things like specific gravity and hardness, it's far more likely to be authentic. Buy from dealers who provide lab reports with their gems., A reputable dealer should not shy away from answering questions about his products. Ask where the amethyst comes from. If the dealer hesitates, this is a bad sign. A good dealer should be knowledgable about the origin of his products.


Amethyst is typically found in Brazil, South Africa, and Namibia. In the US, it's often found in Arizona, Colorado, and the Carolinas. It's also found in parts of Canada.If a gem does not come from one of the above places, that does not necessarily mean it's inauthentic. Amethyst is present across the world. However, request a lab report if the amethyst is from an unusual region.

, Amethyst is generally inexpensive. It's not uncommon to find amethyst jewelry for around $20. You should be suspicious of amethyst sold cheaper than this. Many vendors may market fake amethyst as authentic and then sell it well below market value. This is to trick consumers into thinking they're getting a deal. Follow the old adage, ""If it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" Stay away from low price gemstone., When buying amethyst, ask for information about where the gem was mined, how it was cut, and so on. If a jeweler is able to answer these questions with ease, his product is more likely to be authentic. If he seems hesitant to provide too much information, he may be hiding something. It might be a good idea to seek out another seller.

, Many stores mislabel synthetic stones or low-quality purple sapphire as special forms of amethyst. They may be marked as Japanese Amethyst, Desert Amethyst, Lithia Amethyst, or Bengal Amethyst. Be distrustful of such designations. These stones are likely fake., It's not recommended that you purchase gems online. Fraud is far more likely over the internet. However, if you choose to go the online route, go for a site that seems legitimate.


The dealer should be affiliated with some of the organizations listed above. He or she should also have a company name, phone number, and physical address.Check to make sure the business is active. New content should be added regularly. There should be information about how much of a given product is in stock.Read any reviews you can find. If a lot of customers had a problem with a given store, it may have a bad reputation for a reason. You should also not buy amethyst online if there's no return policy."

Pinpoint your price range and how you plan to use the opal.You will set out knowing what you’re looking for and be more focused when evaluating the stones if you consider this information first.,
Inspect the color and pattern of the stone.Color is a major factor when assessing the value of an opal.,
Assess the clarity and transparency.Aside from color and pattern, clarity is the other major factor that determines an opal’s value.Clarity is the degree of transparency the stone displays.",How to Buy an Opal2," Set a price range for yourself and stay within it. Opals can be purchased to be set as rings, pendants, earrings and bracelets. The size of your opal will be determined by how you want to wear it.


For example, if you are buying opals to set as earrings, you will be choosing smaller stones than what you’d choose for a pendant or bracelet.
If you are shopping for a highly valuable opal, you’ll want the setting to also be of high quality., The range of colors exhibited when viewed from different angles (known as the play of color) is one aspect of this. Highly valuable opals will feature a range of brilliant hues that change and flash, depending on your perspective. The more play, the higher the price. The pattern of color is another factor. An opal without a full play of color can still have striking and unique patterns that increase their value. Patterns to look for are color ribbons, harlequin, rainbows and other variations.


The rarest visible color in opals is red, making it the most pricey, followed by orange, yellow, green, and blue. Blue is the most common visible color in opals.The most common pattern is the “floral” pattern, which can be described as colors that are randomly spread throughout the face of the stone., Opals can range from transparent to opaque. The value of the clarity level depends on what kind of opal it is. A crystal opal of high value will feature extreme clarity and transparency. On the other hand, black opals are considered more valuable if they are opaque.


Cloudy or milky stones are considered to be the least valuable.Clarity can also be disrupted by flaws like fractures, surface blemishes, cracks and pits. All of these will decrease the value of an opal.

"
Choose a good retailer.Opals are expensive, so it’s important to shop with a jeweler you can trust.,
Compare it with several other opals before making a final decision.Once you’ve settled on the opal you want, take the time to closely compare it to two or three other opals in the shop.,
Inspect the stone closely under sunlight before you buy it.Put your opal under scrutiny one last time.,
Obtain a signed Certificate of Authenticity from the retailer.Always request and obtain a certificate of authenticity when you buy an opal.",How to Buy an Opal3," Start by dropping into the jewelry retailers in your area. Assess each one’s display – is it neat and orderly? Are the items well-maintained, or do they have dust on them? How wide is the collection and how maintained is the shop in general? Make your decision based on what you find out. Avoid the larger chain jewelry shops that advertise loudly about their discounts. The quality of their stock is generally low in comparison to other shops.


Use caution if you plan to purchase online. Digital images can distort the look of the stones and you can’t hold them in your hands and inspect them closely. Opals are expensive and it’s hard to spend that amount of money without seeing something in person.

, Hold them side by side and note the similarities and differences in color, pattern and clarity. Make sure the opal you buy is absolutely the one you want.

, Turn it over – does it have backing? If so, it’s not a full opal and you need inquire about it. Inspect the opal from both sides to confirm whether it’s natural or man-made – look for layers of other materials. If you want to buy a full opal, it should be 100% opal with no other materials.


Lastly, ask to inspect it under sunlight. This will give you a better view into the stone’s clarity and may reveal flaws that you missed.

, Make sure that it is signed. You’ll need this certificate for insurance purposes and resale value in the future. A certificate also holds the dealer accountable for what you’ve been sold, which is helpful if you end up having problems with the stone.

Use an acid testing kit on hard-to-verify jewelry.,
Rub the jewelry against the stone.,
Drop the acids on the different metal lines.,
Observe the reaction of the acid.",How to Identify Platinum and Silver Jewelry2," If you can’t find any identifying stamps and you’re unsure about the origin of the jewelry, use a testing kit to find out what the jewelry is made of. Purchase an acid testing kit from an online retailer or jewelry supply store. This kit will include a sanding stone and several bottled acids.


Buy a kit that can test for both silver and platinum. The bottle labels will indicate which metal they are used to test for.
If the kit doesn’t include gloves, buy some separately. If you get any acid on your hands you will burn your skin.

, Lay out the black slate stone on an even surface. Gently rub the jewelry against the stone in a back-in-forth motion to create a line.Draw two or three lines on the stone or one for each testing acid you’ll use. For example if you’re testing for platinum, silver, and gold, you’ll draw three lines.


Choose an inconspicuous part of the jewelry to rub against the stone. The stone will scratch and damage a small section of the jewelry.
Lay a towel down underneath the stone to protect your work surface from scratches.

, Select an acid test from your kit and carefully drop a small amount of acid onto one of the drawn lines. Make sure that you don’t mix the different acids together or you’ll affect your results.


Most tests have acids specifically for silver. However, you can also use an 18-karat gold testing acid to identify pure or sterling silver.Always wear gloves while handling acid.

, These reactions can take anywhere from a second to a minute. If the line completely dissolves, the test fails.For example, if you drop the Platinum acid test on a line and the line dissolves, the jewelry isn’t platinum. However, if your line doesn’t dissolve, the metal is pure.


If you use the 18-karat gold acid test to test on silver, the line will turn a milky white color.This will indicate that your jewelry is pure or sterling silver.
If you doubt your results, test the jewelry again to be sure."

Clean the acid from your jewelry.",How to Identify Platinum and Silver Jewelry3," Avoid using this acid on delicately decorated jewelry. The acid will corrode any part of the surface that it touches. If you purchased an acid scratch testing kit, use the silver testing solution included. Otherwise, purchase the silver testing solution online or from a jewelry supply store.

, Drop a small amount of the silver testing solution onto the metal. Choose a hidden area of the jewelry to test. For example, if you’re testing a large cuff bracelet, drop some acid on the inside of the bracelet. Alternatively, if you’re testing a flat, chunky necklace, drop acid on the back of one of the necklace sections.


Wear gloves to protect your hands and work over a towel to protect your workspace.
Don’t drop acid on clasps or other important sections. The acid may damage any smaller workings in the jewelry.

, The acid will appear dark brown or clear at first and then turn into a different color. The new color will indicate the purity of the metal. For example, if the liquid turns dark or bright red, the metal is at least 99% pure silver.


If the solution turns white, the metal is 92.5% silver, or sterling silver.If it turns a bluish green color, it’s copper or another lesser metal.

, Wipe off the acid with a clean cloth and throw it away. Rinse the jewelry under cold water to remove any residual acid. Use a sieve or plug up your sink to avoid losing your jewelry down the drain. Allow the jewelry to completely air dry before wearing it again.

Submerge the jewelry in hydrogen peroxide.,
Look for a reaction.,
Rinse the jewelry well.",How to Identify Platinum and Silver Jewelry4," First, fill a glass bowl or cup with hydrogen peroxide. Next, drop the jewelry into the bowl. The jewelry should be completely submerged in the liquid. If it’s not, add more hydrogen peroxide.


Hydrogen peroxide can be found at most grocery stores.

, Platinum is a strong catalyst for hydrogen peroxide. If the metal is real platinum, the hydrogen peroxide will begin to bubble almost immediately.Silver is a weaker catalyst. If you don’t see any bubbles immediately, allow the metal to sit in the liquid for about a minute and look for small bubbles forming around the jewelry.Hydrogen peroxide won’t corrode or damage your jewelry.

, Rinse the jewelry under cool water to remove the hydrogen peroxide. Plug up your sink or use a sieve while washing to avoid losing your jewelry down the drain. Allow the jewelry to completely air dry before wearing it again.

Search for a sterling silver hallmark.,
Listen for a bell-like ring.,
Smell the item.,
Examine the item's malleability.",How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver1," Precious metals are stamped with a hallmark, a symbol or series of symbols that denote its type, purity, and authenticity. If your item contains a sterling silver hallmark, it is sterling silver; if it does not have one of these markings, it is more than likely a silver plated piece.Use a magnifying glass to search for hallmarks in discreet locations. The United Kingdom, France, and the United States of America each have a distinct hallmarking system.


American sterling silver is marked with one of the following hallmarks: “925,” “.925,” or “S925.” the 925 indicates that the piece contains 92.5% silver and 7.5% other metals.Sterling silver items made in the UK contain a stamp of a lion. In addition to this stamp, UK made items will also contain a town mark, a duty mark, a date letter, and a sponsor’s mark. These marks will vary from item to item.France currently marks its sterling silver items with the head of Minerva (92.5% and below) or a vase (99.9% pure silver).;
, When sterling silver is gently tapped, it will produce a high-pitched bell-like tone that lasts for 1 to 2 seconds. To conduct this test, carefully tap the sterling silver item with your finger or a metal coin. If the item is truly sterling silver, it will generate a high-pitch ring. If you do not hear a ring, the item is not sterling silver.


When you tap the item, use extreme caution so you do not ding or dent it., Silver does not produce a smell. Hold the item up to your nose and smell it carefully for a few moments. If you sense a strong smell, the item the item likely contains too much copper to be sterling silver.Copper is a common alloy in sterling silver, but 925 sterling does not contain enough to make a smell., Silver is a soft, bendable metal. To determine if the item is silver, you can attempt to bend the item with your hands. If it bends easily, the item is probably made from pure silver or sterling silver.


If the item does not bend, it is less likely that it is made from silver or sterling silver."

Listen for ticking.,

Do your research.,
Look for all of the proper stamps.,
Examine the face of the watch.,
Examine the bracelet.,
Compare the serial numbers.,
Purchase a new designer watch.The best way to avoid fake watches is to buy exclusively from authorized dealers.,
Check the serial number with the manufacturer.,
Visit an appraiser.",How to Identify a Fake Watch," This is one of the biggest indicators that a watch is a fake. A high quality designer watch is built with hundreds of small, perfectly crafted moving parts. Therefore, it won’t tick at all. To test this, hold the body of the watch against your ear and listen closely., High quality designer watches are made using very strict quality standards. Therefore, any peeling paint, scratches, or misspelled words will indicate that the watch is an obvious fake. Additionally, if the clasp of the watch doesn’t close properly or the watch doesn’t keep time well, it’s a fake.


For example, some fake Michael Kors watches leave out the “S”.
Many low-quality Rolex fakes have badly centered crown stamps., Genuine designer watches are crafted by master watchmakers. These watchmakers use precise engraving instruments to create clear, legible lettering on the watch. If any of the lettering is muddled or hard to read, the watch is probably a fake.This rule applies for all of the lettering, including any serial numbers.

, A genuine designer watch is crafted with precious metals and has a lot of small moving parts. Therefore, it will feel slightly heavier than it looks. However, if the watch is fake, it will be surprisingly light.If possible, compare the weight between any watch you consider buying and a verified genuine model. They should be the same weight.

, Comb through online auction result databases to learn information about the watch you want to purchase. On these databases, you can see photos of designer watches and the prices they sold for.Similarly, do research on the manufacturer and become familiar with the brand trademarks, common bracelet details, and the clasp.If you know what to look for, you’ll be harder to fool.


For example, with the exception of a rare model made in the 1930’s, Rolex watches don’t have glass backs. Instead, they have a metal backing., Designer watches will have stamps of authenticity in several spots around the watch. These stamp locations can vary from model to model. Do your research ahead of time so that you know what stamps to look for on your particular model. Next, make sure the lettering on the stamps is spelled correctly and is easy to read.


For example, most modern Rolex models have a crown stamp on the winding mechanism, one on the wristband, and one on the face of the watch.

, Genuine designer watches use precious minerals such as sapphire to cover the face of the watch. Cheaper watches use mineral crystals instead. To see what kind of mineral your watch was made with, turn the watch on its side and examine the color filtering through the clear casing.


If the watch was made with sapphire, it will have a violet tint. This can indicate that the watch is genuine.
If the watch was made with mineral crystals, it will have a green tint. This is a sign that the watch is fake.

, Designer watches usually have one or two stamps on the clasp of the bracelet. If you’re familiar with the specifications of your watch model, you’ll be able to tell if these are missing. Similarly, if the clasp mechanism seems too simple or the bracelet links don’t move smoothly, the watch may be fake.The bracelets of designer watches usually feel heavy, look polished, and move smoothly.
Check for stamps inside the folding clasp mechanism.

, The serial number on the bracelet of the watch and the case should match. Some designer watches also include the serial number on a sticker on the back of the watch.


Beware of watches that are sold without a case. They are more likely to be fake.

, This is the most expensive option, but it’s by far the safest. When you buy the watch new, it will come with all of the paperwork and serial numbers verifying its authenticity.


To find an authorized dealer of your favorite watch, do an online search or talk to the manufacturer.

, If you’re buying the watch second hand or at an auction, check the serial number with the manufacturer before purchasing it. Designer watch manufacturers keep careful records on the different watches they make. Therefore, if the watch you’re buying is genuine, you will be able to find documentation on it.


To check the serial number, do an online search or call a customer service representative.

, If you’re worried that the deal you’re getting is too good to be true, take the watch to a professional appraiser before buying it. If the seller is being honest with you, they will have no problem letting you get the watch appraised. To find an appraiser in your area, do an online search or talk to a fine watch distributor.Ask the appraiser to determine whether or not the designer watch is real. If they say it’s real, have the appraiser walk you through their reasons for believing so.
Additionally, the appraiser may be able to tell you whether or not you’re getting a fair price.

Test for oxidization.,
Determine if the item is magnetic.,
Conduct an ice test.",How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver2," When silver is exposed to air, it oxidizes. The oxidization of the silver causes the metal to tarnish and take on a black tint over time. To test the item for oxidization, you will need a white cloth. Rub a clean white cloth over the item and then examine the cloth.


If you see black marks, the item is either silver or sterling silver.
If you do not see any black marks, the item is less likely to be made from sterling silver.

, Like gold and platinum, silver is a non-ferrous metal—it is not magnetic. Run a strong magnet over your item. If the item is not attracted to the magnet, it is made out of a non-ferrous metal. To determine which type of non-ferrous metal your item contains, you may need to run additional tests.If the item sticks to the magnet, it does not contain sterling silver. More than likely, the item is made from highly polished stainless steel intended to look like pure silver., Silver has the highest thermal conductivity rate of any known metal—it conducts heat extremely fast. You can use this knowledge to determine if your item is made from silver. There are two ways to conduct the ice test.


Set your item on a flat surface. Place one ice cube on the item and another ice cube on the work surface. If they item is made from silver, the ice cube on the coin should melt much faster than the ice cube on the table.Fill a bowl with several ice cubes and an inch of water. Place your silver item and a similarly sized non-silver item into the ice water. The silver item should become cold to the touch in approximately 10 seconds. The non-silver item will not feel as cold at this time."
"
Have your item appraised.,
Ask a professional to conduct a nitric acid test.,
Send to a lab for further testing.",How to Know if Something Is Sterling Silver3," If your home tests yield inconclusive results, you may need to consult a professional to determine if your item is silver, sterling silver, or silver plated. While there are a variety of professionals to choose from, some are more qualified than others. Select a professional that is certified, experienced, and highly recommended.


Professional appraisers are highly trained and experienced. Many reputable appraisers are certified by the American Society of Appraisers. Their job is to assess the quality and worth of items.
Graduate jewelers are trained and certified by the Gemologist Institute of America. They are skilled artists and experienced repairers of jewelry. They are also capable of evaluating an item’s materials., When nitric acid comes into contact with metal, it reveals if the metal is real or imitation. The professional will nick or scratch the item in a discreet area. They will place a drop of nitric acid into the nick or scratch. If the area turns green, the item is not made out of silver; if the area turns a creamy color, the item is made out of silver.


You may purchase a kit and conduct this test at home. When handling nitric acid, you need to be extremely careful. Always wear protective gloves and eyewear., If your item requires further testing, you may send it to a professional advanced jewelry or metal testing laboratory. Ask a local, trusted jeweler for lab recommendations or search for a reputable advanced metal testing lab online. At the lab, scientists will conduct a battery of tests to determine the chemical makeup of your item. These tests may include:


Fire assay—melting down a sample of the metal and conducting a chemical assay
The use of an XRF gun. This item send x-rays through the item to test the metal’s purity.
Mass spectrometry—a test used to determine an item’s molecular and chemical structure.
Specific gravity assessment—a water displacement test."

Learn about black diamonds.,
Know what features to look for.,
Brace yourself for that astronomical bill.,
Compare diamond prices.,
Check the black diamond.,
Consider a combination with white diamonds.,
Check the vendor’s references.,
Buying over the Internet.",How to Buy a Black Diamond," There are plenty of resources available to learn all about black diamonds. Black diamonds are crystallized carbon, just like regular diamonds. Either the color black occurs due to dark inclusions, or due to changes in a white diamond due to high temperatures or radiation.


A natural black diamond is quite rare and naturally very expensive. Most black diamonds occur as irregular black masses called carbonados. (Portuguese for black).Most black diamonds in the market today are treated. Treatment of gemstones is a process that dates back to several centuries. In fact, were it not for these, we wouldn’t know our gemstones as we do. An untreated tanzanite looks nowhere near the form it is used in jewelry as.
Black diamonds are treated to achieve that uniformity of black color. This is the norm of the industry, so long as you are not buying a black diamond believing it to be a natural black diamond. Those command astonishingly high prices.;
, A good cut, a smooth surface and a rich color is the pride of black diamonds. Even if treated, a black diamond is very much a real diamond.


Learn the Four C’s. All diamonds are evaluated on the basis of Cut, Color, Clarity, and Carat Weight. Black diamonds are no exception. Black diamonds have a simple cut (16 facets). The surfaces should be smooth. Color should be evenly distributed. Clarity refers to presence of inclusions or flaws. Grades are AAA, AA+, AA, A, and I1 with AAA being the best. A black diamond should have a glossy, sparkling surface. Carat is the weight of a diamond. Since the density of a black diamond is greater, a one carat black diamond will appear smaller than a one carat white diamond.
A great number of black diamonds on today’s market are not real. They are treated stones or simply dark brown or very dark green diamonds. What’s a real stone? It is difficult to cut and can be much more brittle than other diamonds.

, Beware of misleading ads. Go for terms that say untreated or GIA certified. Fancy black is untreated. When an unusual color is an asset in a diamond, the term ‘fancy’ is used.

, If you are going to buy black diamonds, do a search on different websites to see what black diamonds are listed and simply compare prices. Be aware that vendors can list the same stones from wholesaler lists and some diamonds on the Internet may not be available after one calls to inquire about them. They may be either out on inspection or sold by another dealer.

, In a fiber optic light, the edges of a black diamond will appear to have dark brown edges.

, A solitaire black diamond is more for a very strong personality. Combining black diamonds with white ones in a piece of jewelry becomes poetic and enhances the beauty of both the diamonds. Quite a balance between conventional and modern.

, Before buying, there are a few things you are to consider. To begin with, check vendor’s associations and credentials with public and professional organizations. Inquire about vendor’s credentials, if you didn’t manage to find them on the official website. Make sure you’ve checked the feedbacks from previous customers on the consumer forum.

, Surprisingly, but buying black diamonds over the Internet is a rather pleasant experience. A great variety of well-cut stones at the best prices can be easily found on the Internet. It is easier to buy online than to find a reputable local jeweler, whom you can trust for setting a diamond, maintenance, cleansing, repairs and so on.

Negotiate your best deal.,
Look into “used” diamonds.,
Don’t skimp on the cut.,
Choose your color.,
Focus in on clarity.,
Weigh your carat needs.",How to Buy a Diamond for the Absolute Best Price," Unless you are buying a diamond as an investment opportunity, your goal is likely to find a stone that you (or someone you care about) will find beautiful for years to come. For diamonds that are destined to be jewelry, then, make sure you are choosing a stone that you like. Only then can it possibly be a good deal.Follow your own opinion on which diamond looks best to you, and take the salesperson’s advice to heart, but always demand verification of a diamond’s legitimacy and quality.Any legitimate diamond seller should be happy to provide you with a report specific to each stone, ideally prepared (in the U.S.) by the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) or the American Gem Society (AGS). Don’t assume a diamond’s quality, or even its existence as a real diamond, without such a report.
If you are particularly concerned about avoiding “conflict diamonds” (diamonds mined and sold either by way of or to support violent regimes), look for Kimberly Process Certification.;
, When the quality of the stone is your first priority, you should always examine loose diamonds.The fact that a setting can conceal imperfections, however, can also play to your advantage when choosing a diamond.If the diamond is for a ring or another type of jewelry, setting the stone will almost certainly conceal or minimize some of the inclusions (dark spots), blemishes, or undesired coloring. A diamond in the mid-range of the color scale, for instance, can save you potentially thousands over a colorless stone, and when set the difference may be negligible.A quality setting can even enhance a smaller stone, again allowing you to save some money. In truth, the only of the “Four C’s” of diamond quality (cut, color, clarity, carat weight) that you should always avoid skimping on is the cut. With both loose and set diamonds, this is usually the most obvious factor in the visual appeal of the stone., In some ways, buying a diamond is just like buying any other product. To get the best price, you have to shop around. The diamond market has long been tightly-controlled, but thanks to more suppliers and more retail options (especially online), things have loosened up a bit in recent years.You may be understandably wary of buying a diamond online, but this is usually where you will find the best prices. Seek out recognized, legitimate sites with available grading reports on their stones and fair return policies. You can visit the websites of retailers such as Zales, or popular online sellers like Blue Nile, among other options.Shop around at a few brick-and-mortar retailers to get an idea on price ranges and the quality levels and diamond characteristics that you seek. This will offer you guidance as you undertake your online search.

, You can find good deals on diamonds if you look around. If you want the absolute best price, however, you’ll might have to work a bit extra for it. A diamond is often a major purchase, and just like a car or house, the price is often negotiable.Legitimate online retailers may offer less room for price negotiation, but you can still use them to your advantage. Take evidence of the best online price for the kind of stone you want to physical diamond stores. See if they will match or at least approach that price for a similar stone that you can personally examine.
You have to be willing to walk away if you want to maximize your savings. You may be surprised how often this simple tactic can produce a new “absolute best” deal on a diamond.

, Not surprisingly, new diamonds are subject to a retail markup. You may be able to bypass this and get a better deal by buying secondhand.


Look into estate sales, auctions (online and physical), police auctions, and pawn shops, among other options.
Don’t let yourself be duped. If a deal for a diamond seems to good to be true, it probably is. You don’t want to get stuck with a fake diamond or, even worse, a diamond acquired illegally.
Focus your energies primarily on sellers who can provide some sort of evidence of the provenance and quality of the diamond. You’ll still have to trust your eye a bit more, but you can also ask about bringing the stone into a certified gem dealer for an appraisal., Of the “Four C’s” of diamond quality evaluation, the cut of the stone has the most direct impact on the beauty of the diamond. The right cut can make a good diamond great and a great one fantastic.The American Gem Society (AGS) rates the cut of stones on a 0-10 scale, with zero being “ideal” and 10 being “poor.” The amount of detail that goes into rating the cut of a stone is rather astounding.You have not only the quality of the cut to consider, but also the style. Here, personal preference should play the largest role. Choose the style of cut that appeals to you.

, When it comes to diamond color, less is more — at least when it comes to price. Colorless diamonds are very rare and thus very expensive. There is nothing wrong with seeking out a diamond with some color if that is what you want, however.The AGS also rates color on a 0-10 scale, with zero being colorless and ten indicating a brownish-yellow color. Other groups like the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) rely on a scale that goes from D (colorless) to Z.
While a lack of color remains the traditional standard for diamond beauty, there has been an increased market interest in recent years for colored stones — such as so-called “chocolate diamonds,” for instance. Again, personal taste should be your guide.

, The clarity level of a diamond depends upon the number and size of inclusions — dark specks or spots in the stone — and blemishes closer to the surface. By common standards, the clarity level of a diamond is determined by viewing it under ten-times (10x) magnification.The scale for clarity used by the AGS and similar organizations is more complicated than the 0-10 scales used for cut and color. It includes, in order from best to worst, FL (“flawless”), IF, VVS 1-2, VS 1-2, SI 1-2, and I 1-3.
Keep in mind that many inclusions and blemishes will be invisible to the naked eye. If choosing a flawless diamond isn’t essential for you, you can save a good deal of money without most people ever even noticing.

, We’ve all heard the term “carat” used in reference to gold and diamonds, but few of us know just what it means (other than more is usually better). Carats are a scale of diamond weight, and are thus the most objective of the Four C’s.One carat is equivalent to 200 milligrams (or 0.2 grams), and each carat is subdivided into 100 points. For example, then, a 1.75 carat diamond weighs 0.35 g.
When two diamonds are of equal quality otherwise, the heavier one will obviously cost more. But bigger isn’t always better, depending upon the other quality factors.
The bigger your diamond is, the higher the quality the other factors will likely need to be for your stone to look just right. After all, every little blemish and discoloration will be more noticeable in a high-carat rock.

Ask for a certificate.,
Do your homework.,
Breathe on it.,
Heat the stone.,
Try to look through it.",How to Know the Quality of a Diamond," Every stone should be appraised and issued a certificate. Of course biased appraisers will write whatever boutique owner needs, so certificates should be issued by a respectable authority. Certificate should be up-to-date, as absence of regular appraisal shows some possible issues with the stone.;
, Stamp GIA on a certificate is not 100% grant it is real. Gemological Institute of America Inc. (GIA) is the world-known facility, trusted by all shop owners and customers. However their certificate appraisal costs quite a sum, while Gemology Institute of America (GIA) is a fake issuing fakes. Do not be fooled by abbreviations, so browse and write down the names of the most popular and trusted appraising companies.

, Take the gem with pincers and breathe on it. Real diamonds disperse moisture at once, so the stone will remain clear. Fakes will have spots of moisture on them and if you breathe on them for some time, it will begin condensing, while real diamond will remain clean.

, As diamonds disperse heat immediately, the real stone will remain cold after heating them by a lighter for 30 seconds. This is a standard check you can and should require to be done in your presence.

, Diamonds are not silicon, they are carbon and their inner structure prevents light from passing through directly – that is why they are so shiny. Place a stone on a paper with a text. If you see only a black spot, this is diamond. In case you see some lines and shapes, this is obviously a fake. Placing a real diamond on a dot on a sheet of paper will result in a black spot visible through it. Fake will show circle instead.

Gather basic information.,
Familiarize yourself with CZ quality grading.,
Choose a setting.,
Find sources.,
Comparison shop.",How to Buy a Cubic Zirconia Ring," Before you can order any type of ring, you must know what you are shopping for.


Cubic zirconia rings are sized on the same scale as any other type of ring. You may find your ring size using a standard sizer, or you may go into any jeweler and have them size your finger for you.
Remember that you have the same style options with CZ as you do with any type of precious stone, so will need to choose between circle, oval, pear, princess and square cuts. Additionally, you may be able to find a CZ ring featuring any of a variety of rarer shapes, such as a heart, star or octagon.
As cubic zirconia rings can be found at a variety of price points, it is also helpful to have a budget in mind before you start shopping.;
, Just as with diamonds, cubic zirconia stones are graded according to carat, color, clarity and cut, on a scale of A to AAAAA � A being the lowest and AAAAA being the highest.


Carat is the stone's size, or weight.
Most cubic zirconia stones are white in color (the equivalent of a perfect diamond). Note that colored CZ may have some color irregularities.
Clarity refers to the cloudiness (or lack thereof) of a stone, as well as its flaws. CZ is rarely, if ever, cloudy or flawed. Its perfection is the most give-away indicator that it is not a real diamond.
The cut of a stone determines how it refracts light, and a well-cut, high-quality stone will be cut in a way to provide as much white light (""ice"") as possible. Conversely, the more colored-light (""fire"") a stone refracts, the lower the quality of the stone.

, Just like diamonds, cubic zirconia stones can be placed in a multitude of settings. You can find setting styles by browsing through any jewelry catalog, or by searching online.

,


Retail department stores often carry a selection of preset cubic zirconia rings, at relatively inexpensive prices.
Jewelry stores carry higher-grade CZ jewelry, and will even set a loose stone for you in order to create a custom CZ ring.
Wholesalers sell cubic zirconia jewelry, as well as loose stones. An online search will produce a multitude of CZ wholesalers that you can shop with.

, Before you purchase a CZ ring, take the time to compare rings you like from an array of available sources. Take into account style, price and quality when weighing your options.

Buying that perfect loose diamond is not difficult at all, especially if you know what you are looking for.,
Determine the weight of the loose diamond.,
Evaluate the cut of a diamond.,
Pay attention to the clarity of the diamonds.,
Don’t confuse clarity of a diamond with its color: There is a multitude of colors for loose diamonds.",How to Evaluate Loose Diamonds," The best way to make a conclusion about the cost of a diamond - is to understand what makes it desirable. Four major criteria define the quality and value of the diamond - its carat weight, diamond’s cut its clarity and its color.;
, A diamond is normally weighed in carats. It is not the same with the weight of gold in carats. One carat in of loose diamond is equal to 200 mg of the diamond's actual weight. The number of carats will have an influence on the final price of the diamond. Carat weight is often determined by the approximate size and calibre of diamond. This is acceptable for general measurements, but can be inaccurate. Sometimes diamond of bigger size can weight less. To determine the exact weight of your loose diamond it is better to use the diamond scale.

, The cut means the shape and size of sides and geometric proportions of the diamond. It is one of the most difficult parts of diamonds evaluation. The most common way of diamonds cutting is brilliant side. It looks like compressed pyramid on the top of the inverted pyramid. Perfect diamond side was invented to give to a loose diamond bright brilliance. But not every diamond is cut according to this principle. Some diamond cutters consider that bigger stone is better than diamond with better proportions. Diamonds can be of different shapes, including emerald side (rectangle), ""princess"" side (square), pear-shaped, oval, heart-shaped, and ""Marquis"" side (elongated and rounded). It is important to note that evaluating the loose diamonds it is necessary to find a well-balanced stone that is able to catch lots of light. Be careful, because some diamonds can be polished several times to hide the bad spots. In the case of uneven polishing the diamond balance will be broken. Pay your attention to the tip of the diamond. It should be not very wide. The wide girdle on the tip of the diamond can have a negative influence on luminous reflectance.

, Defects of diamond’s clarity make it less valuable. Perfect cleanliness and shine are the best for loose diamonds. The main types of defects are spots and inclusions. Inclusions are splits inside of the diamonds, small dark and white spots, so called knots which are located on the diamond’s surface, scratches, grooves, jags and impact marks. Almost every diamond has some defects. The idea is to determine the size and number of defects. If there are no visible defects with tenfold increase they say that the diamond is perfect. The value of such diamond is really high. To evaluate the clarity of diamond can help the scale of clarity. The commons system of clarity evaluation includes such signs as IF, without inner defects; VVS1 and VVS2, extremely few defects; VS1 and VS2, very few defects; S11 and S12, few defects; 11, 12 and 13, defective. The diamonds with signs which are lower than VS2 are of no value for you, but can be good for jewelry.

, You can find yellow, brown, purple, green, red and blue diamonds. Color is the result of the composition of a diamond and it does not change. The diamonds with color can be natural and artificial. Diamonds with no color allows maximum light to pass through and colorless diamonds are preferred for their sparkle. You can examine this by viewing it under a bright light. If the stone is cloudy, milky or with yellow or brown cast, then the diamond is not of particularly good quality.

Look for flaws and inclusions.,
Perform the breath test.,
Get your sapphire certified.",How to Determine if a Sapphire is Real1," Use a jeweler’s magnifying glass, at least 10x magnification, to inspect the sapphire closely. Natural sapphires form with tiny bits of other matter in them, so look for small specks and blemishes. These flaws are a good indication that a sapphire is real.Lab-created (fake) sapphires do not have inclusions of this nature, and some natural sapphires don’t have flaws either, but if you find flaws it is real.;
, Take your sapphire and breathe on it to fog it up. Count how long it takes for the fog to start fading and how long until the fog is totally gone. Natural gems should clear up in just one or two seconds, but created sapphires may take closer to five seconds to clear up., Gemologists can examine a sapphire and determine what kind of gem it is. They will give you a report on what they decide about the sapphire once they have analyzed it. They can tell you if it is natural or synthetic, treated or not, as well as many other attributes.Once the gemologists have fully examined the gem, they will give you an official statement. If you have an old family sapphire that you are sure is natural and valuable, it is good to have it certified to ensure that you get the best value if you sell it.
A certified sapphire will be easier to sell for a good price.

Find a reputable store or brand that carry diamonds with light performance information.,
Use visual scopes to assess the levels of light performance in a diamond.,
Look for a verification report.,
Simply examine the appearance of each diamond you consider buying.",How to Buy a Diamond Based on Light Performance," A diamond has many different characteristics, including color, clarity, and carat. The most important characteristic when purchasing a diamond is its light performance, which makes a diamond outshine others in every sense of the word.;
, Everyone has a budget and it is important to understand where you are with your money. Explore your options and see what color, clarity, and carat size you will feel most comfortable buying, then proceed.

, As more information about diamonds becomes available to consumers, more and more companies are addressing these issues directly. Stores are starting to provide their own stats to customers in order to help them make decisions; find a dealer or store that understands what light performance is and can explain why it is an important part of the diamond purchasing process. This will also enable you to compare diamonds from various stores more easily.

, Reflector-based visual scopes are a great way to test for the cut proportions of a diamond. The Firescope, for example, clearly shows you the difference between a diamond that is poorly cut and one that is cut perfectly without any light leakage. (Keep in mind, a diamond with light leakage will not perform as well as one that does not have any light leakage.)

, Verification should come from an independent company that can verify the light performance level of a diamond. Companies such as ImaGem, GCAL and GemEx take actual measurements of light performance under different lighting conditions. Be careful of fake reports or companies that quote “light performance” without any proof of diamond testing. Always look for direct measurement reports; these give you an accurate portrayal of a diamonds performance.

, A diamond that has high light performance will look more brilliant, have more fire, and exhibit more scintillation compared to a low performance diamond. It’s easy as that. Your knowledge of light performance should lead you to the best looking diamond, and if it doesn't, keep looking.

Check the gem for air bubbles.,
Use the scratch test.,
Watch how light reflects from the sapphire.",How to Determine if a Sapphire is Real2," Lab-created sapphires are essentially glass that is put through a process similar to the one that forms natural sapphires. Since they are glass, tiny air bubbles remain in them after they form. If you see any bubbles inside of the sapphire then it is not real.Be sure to turn the sapphire over and inspect it from every angle. It’s possible that air bubbles will only be visible from one angle.

, If you have two sapphires and you know for sure one is real, use it to scratch the second one. Gems of equal hardness can’t scratch each other, so if both are real sapphires then nothing will happen. If the real sapphire leaves a scratch on the second sapphire, then the second one is not real, or is at least of lower quality.This test can damage a synthetic sapphire, so be wary of ruining the inferior gem.

, Turn the lights off in a room and shine a flashlight on the sapphire. If the sapphire is real, it will only reflect light that is the same color as the sapphire. If it is fake, meaning it is made of glass, it will reflect other colors besides the color of the gem.

"
"
Look for intersecting lines in the sapphire.,
Ask the jeweler if the gem is natural.,
Ask the jeweler if a natural sapphire has been treated.",How to Determine if a Sapphire is Real3," Some natural sapphires are of such poor quality that they can’t be sold. One way that sellers make up for this is filling the sapphire with lead-glass which masks the poor quality of the sapphire. If you see criss-crossing lines, you may have a real sapphire but it is most likely of low quality.

, If you are considering buying a sapphire from a jeweler, you should always ask whether the gem is natural or synthetic. The FTC requires that jeweler’s disclose information about any gems that they sell.Don’t be afraid that you will sound critical or uninformed if you ask about a sapphire. It’s your money to spend and you want to know for sure what kind of product you are buying.

, There are various treatments that are done to sapphires to enhance their color or clarity. While this may make the sapphire look better, you may feel it reduces the natural quality.Treatments are not permanent, so it is good to ask about treatments and how long they will last on the gem. Treatments can be removed to return the gem to its natural look.

However, there tend to be significant price jumps at 1, 3, and 5 carats. You may get a better deal if you select a 0.9c, 2.9c, or 4.9c ruby instead.Remember that the size, cut, color and clarity are a matter of aesthetics and practicality as well as value; someone with slender fingers or less ostentatious taste may prefer a smaller gem.


As a rough guide, a one-carat natural ruby that costs less than $250 is likely considered ""commercial quality"" instead of ""fine quality."" At $700 and up, hold it to a high standard. At $10,000 per carat and up, the ruby should be exceptional and rare.Laboratory-made rubies tend to be sold for about 85–90% of the price that a natural ruby of the same quality would fetch.Because larger rubies are rare, the price increases faster than the size.A commercial-quality five-carat ruby may sell for ten times as much as a similar one-carat ruby, while a fine-quality five-carat ruby (which is quite rare) may sell for twenty-five times as much as a similar one-carat ruby.;
, The cut of a gem describes how the gem has been shaped by a lapidary. The general shape is a matter of preference, although most rubies are cut as oval, cushion (a rounded square), marquise, or round. Heart or emerald (a rectangle with cut corners) are other relatively common options, but due to lower demand they may be a little cheaper compared to a gemstone of similar quality cut to a different shape., Ruby catalogs or websites may list this under ""color"", or under ""hue"". While many prefer a pure red or purplish red ruby (sometimes termed ""pigeon blood"", it is a matter of personal taste, and high quality rubies exist in orange-red, rose, or pink, as well. If you are interested in pink rubies, look for pink sapphires. The stones called ""Sapphire"" and ""Ruby"" are made from the same mineral, corundum, and are classified by their mineral content, which creates the color. Light red, pink or violet corundum is usually classified as a sapphire, as in this way they have individual value in comparison with other colors of corundum. If they were grouped as rubies, they would be considered stones of inferior quality. For reference: a ruby's color comes from the strong presence of chrome. Sapphires are colored by iron and titanium for blue, vanadium for violet, a small iron content produces yellow and green tones, while a weak amount of chrome produces pink.
Pink rubies may be in higher demand in Asia than in Western countries, and therefore worth more on that continent.Some companies will try to describe the color based on the area of the world it came from, but this system is not accurate.

, While you can select the basic characteristics above while shopping online, it is extremely difficult to judge a ruby in more detail from a photo. Online gem salesmen may include information using the metrics described below, but even if they tell the truth, you may not find the ruby attractive when it arrives. If you must buy a ruby online, always make sure there is a return policy, and look up reviews of the company online to avoid scams. When the ruby arrives, judge it using the criteria below, and send it back for a refund or replacement if it doesn't match your standards.

, Inside the ruby, you may see one or more black or grey patches, called extinctions, where the light doesn't reach. The more of these there are, the lower the ruby's value.Move the gem around in the light to see how visible the extinctions are from different angles. If you greatly dislike this trait, lighter-colored, shallow-cut stones tend to have fewer extinctions, but may have other problems, such as windowing (a transparent appearance, like looking through a window) and less brilliance.The exact effect of inclusions on the ruby's price is somewhat subjective. All other qualities being equal, one that has no inclusions would be more valuable than one with some. One with some would be more valuable than one with much. Transparency is still preferred.

, This metric is also called color purity or intensity, and should be included with the ruby's description. Vivid rubies have the richest color and are the most valuable, with strong rubies close behind. A medium, fair, or weak saturation means the ruby's color is masked by significant shades of brown or gray, making the color less distinct.These ratings are assigned based on the judgement of the jeweler, not on a scientific measurement.

, The tone of a ruby is a description of the amount of color present, ranging from very dark to very light. Medium tone rubies tend to be the most valuable, but this is up to personal preference., Many rubies contain inclusions, or visible materials trapped inside the gemstone. Most commonly, a clear stone is more valuable. However, some ruby collectors appreciate the unique appearance a stone's inclusion gives it. Silky filaments of a mineral called rutile can create a sheen that is highly valued and, when cut correctly, creates the cat's eye effect (also called chatoyancy) or star (asterism) .If these filaments are arranged in a star pattern, the ruby is a rare and valuable star ruby.


There is no standard ruby clarity grading system. One common system rates the gem from 1 (perfectly clear) to 4 (many inclusions).
Another common system rates them from F (flawless), VVS (very very small inclusions, difficult to see under 10x magnification), VS (very small, visible under 10x magnification), SI (small inclusions, barely visible to the eye), and I (inclusions easily visible to the eye)., Natural, untreated rubies are rare and expensive. Many rubies are heat-treated by the lapidary to intensify the color. This treatment is widely accepted, since it does not affect the stone's durability and improves its appearance, but it does affect it's value. An untreated ruby will fetch a higher price than one that has been treated; however, if the gem has been treated with surface diffusion or flux healing, extra material has been added to correct flaws in the ruby and these rubies tend to be much less valuable due to the temporary nature of the treatment. Be sure to ask if the ruby has been treated in any way, as it does affect the value. For rubies of exceptional value, a reputable jeweler will be happy to supply this information to you and place it on the bill of sale. Also, an appraisal is usually requested by and paid for by the purchaser, and done by an independent, certified appraiser. , Rubies are often set in white gold, but the metal you choose comes down to personal preference. If you are buying the ruby as a gift for someone, try to find out which metals are preferred.Lower carat precious metals are cheaper, but may be less lustrous or more capable of tarnishing.

, In a prong setting, metal claws hold the edge of the gemstone in place. This keeps the gemstone secure, and is a popular option for larger gems., A bezel, or metal rim, fits tightly around the gemstone to secure it. This is another common setting for large gemstones, as is the half-bezel that fits around a portion of the gem., If the items of jewelry has multiple smaller stones, it may not require one of the above options to keep it secure. Explore designs such as pave (small, precious metal balls which align the gems as a pavement of stones), channel-set (a groove containing the stones), or invisible (using grooves cut into the gemstones to attach them without a metal perimeter., Rubies created in a laboratory are chemically identical to natural rubies, and therefore are just as durable and attractive. They are almost always a cost conscious choice than a natural ruby of similar quality, because the manufacturing process is less expensive than locating and mining natural rubies.Lab-created rubies are an especially good choice if you are concerned about the negative human rights and environmental impact of ruby mines, which can be considerable.


While these are often called synthetic rubies, don't confuse them with imitation or artificial rubies, which are not real rubies and are much less durable and bright.
Star rubies are considered highly attractive, but natural star rubies are extremely rare and expensive compared to lab-created ones. Any lab created ruby should be clearly marked as such, but this is where the reputable jeweler and the opportunist may be differentiated and the phrase 'Caveat emptor' (Buyer beware) should be considered., About 98% of all rubies that are sold have been on the market for decades, since rubies are extremely difficult to destroy. Some companies specifically market some of their gems as ""recycled"" stones, sourced from public and retail owned jewelry, arguing that no new environmental impact is produced.Critics note that purchasing new rubies supports gemstone mining communities, but recycling stones also has its supporters. It has been shown that if the provenance of a stone is known and of interest, the stone can fetch a higher price because of its history.

, Most of the world's rubies come from here, the country formerly known as Burma. While older rubies may come from the famous Mogôk valley, they are now more typically from the region of Möng Hsu.Due to the history of the region and the many famous rubies that were mined there, Myanmar rubies have a special cachet. However, due to human rights abuses by the government of Myanmar, the importation of new gems from the region is banned in the United States and Canada, and was banned in the recent past by the European Union.The purplish-red rubies known as ""pigeon's blood"" rubies come from this area, and are extremely valuable, due, in no small part, to the history of the mines.

, Sri Lanka (old Ceylon), Thailand, and several African nations export rubies, or have in the past, but these sources tend to ebb and flow as new mines are discovered or emptied. None of these sources are as famous as Myanmar gems, but some of them may be preferable for human rights or environmental reasons. The governments of Tanzania, Ghana, and Zimbabwe are all attempting to regulate the environmental impact of mines with limited success, as the individuals or small groups involved do not have the money to comply with environmental regulations.Rubies mined in the United States are subject to environmental regulation, but they only make up a small fraction of the world's rubies."

Compare the yellow sapphire with a piece of yellow glass.,
Look for tiny bubbles.,
Check for scratches.,
Note the facets.",How to Check Yellow Sapphire1," Most fake sapphires are made from glass. While yellow glass may look similar to yellow sapphire at a glance, the two are drastically different when compared with one another. In general, yellow glass is too big and too colorful to be real.;
, Sapphires can have several interior inclusions, but yellow sapphires of high quality will not have inclusions that are visible to the naked eye. Fake sapphires, on the other hand, often have tiny bubbles inside.

, Sapphire of any color is extremely hard. Diamond is the hardest gemstone, ranking a 10 on the Moh's scale of mineral hardness, and sapphire ranks at 9.0 on the same scale. As such, very few materials can scratch a sapphire. Glass, on the other hand, ranks between 5.5 and 6.0 and is scratched much more easily. A glass imitation of yellow sapphire often has lots of surface scratches, while real sapphire has very few, if any.

, Since glass is not as hard as sapphire, it is cut much more easily. Yellow glass stones are cut quite simply and usually have smooth, rounded edges. On the other hand, yellow sapphires have more complex cuts that are sharp and crisp.

Use the fog test.,
Check the setting and mount.,
Use a jeweler's loupe to inspect the diamond.",How to Tell if a Diamond is Real1," Put the stone in front of your mouth and fog it like you would a mirror. If it stays fogged for a couple seconds, it’s probably a fake — a real diamond disperses the heat from your breath instantaneously and won't fog up easily. Even if you wait in between fogging it up and looking at it, it will still clear much faster than a fake.


It can help to use a stone you know is real next to the suspect stone and fog both. You can watch how the real one stays clear while the fake one fogs over; if you breathe on fake diamonds repeatedly, you will see condensation start to build up. With each puff, the fake stone will fog up more and more, while the real one will still be clean and clear.;
, A real diamond is not likely to be set in a cheap metal. Stamps inside the setting indicating real gold or platinum (10K, 14K, 18K, 585, 750, 900, 950, PT, Plat) are a good sign, while a ""C.Z."" stamp will give away that the center stone is not a real diamond.C.Z. stands for Cubic Zirconia, which is a kind of synthetic diamond.

, You can usually borrow one from the jewelry store. Mined diamonds usually have small naturally occurring imperfections, which are called ""inclusions,"" that can be seen with a loupe. Look for small flecks of minerals, or very slight color changes. These are both signs that you're dealing with a real, albeit imperfect, diamond.


Cubic zirconium (which should pass all of the other tests) usually doesn't have imperfections. That's because they are grown in sterile environments instead of produced by chance in the Earth's laboratory. A gem that is too perfect is more often than not a fake.
It is possible, however, that a real diamond will be flawless. Don't use imperfections as the determining factor in whether your diamond is real or not. Rule out fakes using other tests first.
Note that lab-grown diamonds will also normally have no imperfections because they are also produced in carefully controlled environments. Gem-quality diamonds grown in a lab can be chemically, physically and optically identical (and sometimes superior) to naturally occurring ones. This ability to surpass the quality of ""natural"" diamonds has caused considerable concern among those in the mined diamond business who have lobbied heavily to have lab-grown diamonds distinguished from ""natural diamonds"". Lab-grown diamonds are ""real"" but they are not ""natural"".

Take note of the cut.,
Stay away from ""X"" cuts.,
Avoid ""grooves."",
Check the stone under magnification.",How to Check Yellow Sapphire2," On a small scale, natural yellow sapphires can be cut into nearly any style. Once stones get larger than one carat, however, many jewelers tend to prefer cutting sapphires into oval or cushion mixed cut. Since round and emerald cuts are more popular, however, jewelers often cut synthetic stones into round and emerald shapes. Natural sapphires can, in theory, be cut into the same shapes, but it is much less likely.

, Manufacturers of synthetic stones often place an ""X"" cut, also called a scissors cut, on the facets of a stone.

, Occasionally, the facets of synthetic stones do not come out as crisp as the facets of a natural sapphire would. This flaw looks very similar to the grooves one might expect to see on a vinyl record, but they can usually be seen only under magnification of a 10x loupe.

, A good synthetic may have flaws that are only visible under 10x to 30x magnification. Low, 10x magnification can usually identify the curved, grooved banding found in synthetic sapphires, especially when the examiner places a piece of translucent glass in between the stone and the light source. Higher 30x magnification can identify gas bubbles and masses of powder that has not melted.]"

Watch out for fillings.,
Be aware of foil backed stones.,
Keep setting in mind.,
Note the color.,
Look for a certificate.",How to Check Yellow Sapphire3," Like any stone, yellow sapphire occasionally contains inclusions and negative space inside the stone. When a gem-cutter slices into one of these imperfections, a small hole can develop. Most jewelers prefer to keep the hole in the gem rather than cut it away, but untrustworthy jewelers sometimes fill the stone with glass or borax paste to add weight and make the stone appear higher quality. Examine the stone by shining a light on it. Patches of unevenness are usually a good indication of this practice.

, Foil backing reflects more light, making the color of the yellow sapphire look more vibrant and the luster of the gem look brighter. The backing can be hard to see if the stone is already fitted into a setting, but careful examination of the base of the stone under magnification can often reveal a foil backing. Moreover, this potential falsification is more commonly found in antique jewelry, meaning that you may not need to worry about it quite as much if purchasing a new piece.

, If you have any doubts about the seller you plan to buy from, consider buying loose stones or stones with settings that give you a look at the bottom of the stone. Claw, tension, and channel settings are good examples. On the other hand, closed settings, like the bezel mounting, are often used by scammers to hide flaws and evidence of fraudulence.

, True yellow sapphire is a pure yellow, but similar, less precious imitations often have slightly different hues. Citrine has a slight green tint, golden topaz has strong traces of orange, and yellow tourmaline has a brighter, lemon-like hue., While a certificate does not give you the same assurance that physically checking the stone might, it does provide you with the satisfaction of knowing that the stone was checked and approved by an official, trusted organization. Look for certificates from national gem societies like the Gemological Institute of America or the American Gem Society.

Jade is either nephrite or jadeite. Jadeite has is slightly harder, takes a higher gloss polish (glassy) and can be gray (most common and least valuable), green, orange, lavender, yellow or white. It is graded with same criterion as a gemstone, with emerald green being comparable in value to an emerald. Nephrite is slightly less hard than jadeite, but still at 5.5-6 on Moh's scale, slightly harder than a normal steel knife point. This is the most important test to distinguish jade from softer substitutes, which don't require abrasives to carve. Learning the colors and texture of jadeite and nephrite (they are different!) is the second most important step. Nephrite is valued most highly as a carving, with dynastic carvings selling for over 1M$ at auction. The most valuable colors are pure white and translucent celadon.
The most expensive and desirable jadeite (Burmese Jadeite, Burma Jade, Imperial Jade, or Chinese Jade) usually comes from Myanmar (formerly Burma), but small quantities are mined in Guatemala, Mexico and Russia. Jade can come from many places, but the most common and least valuable gray or grayish green.
75% of the world’s jade come from the mines of British Columbia in the form of nephrite, but that's also mined in Taiwan, the United States and (in small amounts) Australia.;
, Materials passed off as jade include:


Serpentine (""New Jade"" or ""Olive Jade"")
Prehnite
Aventurine quartz
Grossular garnet (""Transvaal jade"")
Chrysoprase (""Australian jade"" - most of it comes from Queensland, Australia)
Malaysia Jade (permanently dyed translucent quartz that may be called by its color – Red Jade, Yellow Jade, Blue Jade)
Opaque dolomite marble (""Mountain Jade"" - from Asia, dyed in vibrant colors)
In New Zealand Greenstone or Pounamu is highly regarded by Māori. Māori people recognize four main types of pounamu, identifying their color and translucence: kawakawa, kahurangi, īnanga. These are all nephrite. They also regard a fourth type of pounamu - tangiwai- from Milford Sound which, although prized, is actually bowenite and authentic jade in the eyes of the rest of the world.

, If possible, examine the internal structure with a 10X loupe. Can you see little fibrous or granular, felt-like, asbestos-like intertwinings? If so, it's probably genuine nephrite or jadeite. Chrysoprase, on the other hand, is microcrystalline, so it'll look homogeneous. This takes a trained and experienced eye.


If you see anything resembling layers with the 10X loupe, you're probably looking at jadeite that's been ""doubled"" or even ""tripled"" (thin layer of gem-quality jadeite sometimes glued over a different base).

, This refers to jadeite jewelry, not to nephrite carvings. Even if you have real jade in your hands, it can still be treated by dyeing, bleaching, use of stabilizing polymers, or creating jade doublets and triplets. Jade is divided into three categories based on these possibilities:


Type A - Natural, untreated, undergoes a traditional process (plum juice washing and polishing with beeswax), no ""artificial treatments"" (e.g. high temperature or high-pressure treatments). This has a ""true"" color.
Type B - Chemically bleached to remove impurities; injected with polymer with the use of a centrifuge to enhance translucency; covered with hard and clear plastic like coating. Subject to instability and discoloration over time because polymer gets broken down by heat or household detergent; nevertheless, still 100% real jade with 100% natural color.
Type C - Chemically bleached; dyed to enhance color; subject to discoloration over time due to reaction with strong light, body heat or household detergent.

, Real jade has a very high density, which means it will feel somewhat heavier than it looks. If it feels heavier than most stone pieces of the same size and passes the eye test, it is more likely to be authentic jade.This is obviously an imprecise but effective test to perform, and once commonly used by traders and purchasers of gems.

, Another traditional way to judge the density of stones without measuring is to observe the sound of plastic beads gently tapping each other. If you have a piece of real jade, clink it against the stone in question. If it sounds like plastic beads, then the stone in question is probably fake. If there's a deeper, more resonant sound to the clicking, it might be authentic.

, It should feel cold, smooth and somewhat soap-like in your hand. It should take a while to get warm if it is real. This is most helpful when you can compare it to real jade of a similar shape and size.

, This method is the most reliable of the basic tests. Jadeite is very hard; it will scratch glass or even metal. Nephrite, however, can be softer, so performing a scratch test improperly may damage a genuine piece. If it scratches glass or steel, it could still be many of the alternatives to jade as well, including the various forms of green quartz and prehnite.


Use the blunt end of a pair of scissors and gently press down and draw a line on an area on the jade piece. Do this on the bottom side to avoid vandalizing the carving.
Avoid any weathering surfaces because these are much softer and can be easily damaged. If the scratch makes a white line, gently wipe it off (it might be metal residue from the scissors). Is there still a scratch? If so, it's probably not authentic jade.

, Both jadeite and nephrite have a very high density (jadeite - 3.3; nephrite - 2.95). Density is measured by dividing the weight (in grams) by the volume (c.c.).

, If the scale doesn't come with crocodile clamps, wrap the tested jade with a piece of string, a rubber band or a ponytail holder., Record the weight. It's important to use a scale based on grams, therefore measuring force in dynes.

, The clamp can touch the water; it shouldn't significantly affect the weight.


If you're concerned, however, use one of the alternatives described above. Since the test is based on the difference in weight, as long as the string, band or ponytail holder remains on the jade both in the air and in the water, the difference will be the same.

, Divide the weight in the air by 1000 (or 981 if you have a calculator handy) and subtract the weight in water divided by 1000 (or 981 if you have a calculator handy). This gives the mass in grams in air and the apparent mass in water. Subtract the in-water value from the air value to determine the volume in cc.

, Once you've calculated the density of the jade item, see if the number suggests authentic jade. Jadeite has a density of 3.20-3.33 g/cc, while nephrite has a density of 2.98 - 3.33 g/cc.

Look at the stone's refractivity.,
Observe the reflections.,
Drop the stone in a glass of water and see if it sinks to the bottom.,
Heat up the stone and see if it shatters.",How to Tell if a Diamond is Real2," Diamonds sharply bend, or refract, the light that passes through them, resulting in their strikingly brilliant appearance. Stones like glass and quartz sparkle less because they have a lower refractive index. A stone's brilliance is difficult to alter in any way, even with an expert cut, because it's an inherent property of the stone. By taking a close look at the stone's refractivity, you should be able to tell whether it's the real thing or a fake. Here are a few ways to do it:


The newspaper method: Turn the stone upside down and place it on a piece of newspaper. If you can read print through the stone, or even see distorted black smudges, then it probably isn't a diamond. A diamond would bend the light so sharply that you wouldn't be able to see the print. (There are a few exceptions: if its cut is disproportionate, the print can still be visible through a real diamond.)

The dot test: Draw a small dot with a pen on a piece of white paper and place the stone over the center of the dot. Look directly down on it. If your stone is not a diamond, you will see a circular reflection in the stone. You won't be able to see the dot through a real diamond.

, A real diamond's reflections usually show up in various shades of gray. Look straight down through the top of the diamond. If you see rainbow reflections, you're either dealing with a low-quality diamond or a fake.Instead, check for ""sparkles."" A real diamond will sparkle significantly more than an equivalently-size piece of glass or quartz. You may want to take along a piece of glass or quartz as reference.
Don't confuse sparkle with reflection. Sparkle has to do with the brilliance or intensity of the light that's refracted by the cut of the gem. Reflection has to do with the color of the light that's refracted. So look for intense light, not colored light.
There is a stone that has even more luster than a diamond: moissanite. This gemstone is so similar to diamond that even jewelers have a hard time telling them apart. To tell the difference without special equipment, hold the stone close to your eye. Shine a penlight through the stone. If you see rainbow colors, that's a sign of double refraction. This is a property of moissanite, but not of diamond.

, Due to its high density, a real diamond will sink. A fake one will float at the top of the surface or in the middle of the glass.

, Heat up a suspect stone with a lighter for 30 seconds, then drop it straight into a glass of cold water. The rapid expansion and contraction will overwhelm the tensile strength of weaker materials like glass or quartz, causing the stone to shatter from the inside. Real diamond is strong enough that nothing will happen.

"
"
Ask for a heat probe test.,
Request combination diamond/moissanite testing.,
Get a microscopic examination.,
Subject the diamond to high sensitivity weighing.,
Inspect the diamond under ultraviolet (UV) light.,
Get an x-ray examination.",How to Tell if a Diamond is Real3," The tight, evenly-packed crystalline structure of diamonds makes them disperse heat quickly; thus, real diamonds will not heat up easily. Heat probe tests take about 30 seconds and are often done free of charge. It also doesn't hurt the stone the way some other ways of testing will.


Heat testing works for the same reasons that the DIY ""shatter"" test works. Instead of measuring whether the gem breaks under the pressure of rapid contraction, however, heat probes measure how long the diamond retains temperature.

, Many jewelers keep specialized devices that distinguish diamond from moissanite and can quickly indicate if a stone is a true diamond or a simulant.A traditional heat probe test will not be able to tell the difference between moissanite and a real diamond. Ensure that the test is being conducted with an electrical conductivity tester and not a thermal tester.
If you are testing a lot of diamonds at home, combination testers can be purchased online or at diamond specialty shops.

, Place the diamond under a microscope with the top facet dace down. Gently rock the diamond back and forth with tweezers. If you see a slight orange flash along the facets, the diamond may actually be Cubic Zirconia. It may also indicate that Cubic Zirconia was used to fill imperfections within the diamond.


To get the best view of the diamond use a 1200x power microscope.

, Diamonds can be distinguished by very fine differences in weight, since cubic zirconia weighs approximately 55% more than diamonds for the same shape and size.A very sensitive scale capable of measuring down to the carat or grain level is necessary to do this comparison.


The only way to accurately perform this test is by having a known real diamond of roughly the same size and shape. Without something to compare it against, you will have difficulty determining if the the weight is off.

, Many (but not all) diamonds will exhibit blue fluorescence under an ultra violet or black light, so the presence of a medium to strong blue confirms that it is real. The absence of blue, however, does not mean a stone is necessarily fake; some diamonds do not fluoresce under UV light.Very slight green, yellow, or gray fluorescence under ultraviolet light may indicate that the stone is moissanite.Though a UV test can help you narrow down your choice of possibilities, if possible, try to avoid relying on the results of this test as definitive indicators of whether or not a diamond is real. As noted above, some diamonds fluoresce under UV light and others do not. It's also possible for fake diamonds to be ""doped"" — treated so that they glow under UV light when they otherwise would not., Diamonds have a radiolucent molecular structure, which means that they don't appear in x-ray images. Glass, cubic zirconium and crystals all have slightly radiopaque qualities that make them show up clearly on an x-ray.


If you want to get your diamond x-ray tested, you will either need to submit it to a professional diamond testing lab, or make a deal with your local x-ray imaging center.

Find a reputable diamond appraiser in your area.,
Ask the right questions.,
Request a certificate of appraisal.,
Look at your certificate carefully — not all certificates are created equal.,
Get your stone registered.",How to Tell if a Diamond is Real4," Most diamond retailers hire their own gemologists and appraisers, but many consumers find it more desirable to request third party appraisal from an independent gemologist who specializes in the appraisal of diamonds. If you're going to invest in a stone, or are curious about a stone you already own, you'll want to be sure that the stone you've got is appraised accurately.


An appraisal involves two basic steps: first identifying and evaluating the stone in question, and then assigning value. When looking at independent appraisers, it would be ideal to select an appraiser with a Graduate Gemologist (GG) degree issued by a Gemological Institute in your country, who isn't involved directly in the sale of diamonds.This way, you can be sure that the science is sound.

, Aside from finding out whether or not the stone is fake, a good appraiser can answer a variety of questions about the quality of your stone to make sure that you're not getting ripped off. This is especially important if you've already purchased or inherited a stone. The gemologist should be able to tell you:


whether or not the stone is man-made or natural (Note: man-made diamonds are diamonds, just not ""natural"". See the section on detecting man-made diamonds for more detail.)
whether or not the stone has been color-altered
whether the stone has had permanent or temporary treatment added
whether a stone matches the grading documentation provided by a retailer

, Whatever tests you choose to have performed, the best and most reliable way to tell if a diamond is real is to check the paperwork and speak to the gemologist or the appraiser. Certification and grading assures you that your stone has been ""proven"" real by experts. Proof is especially important if you're buying a stone sight-unseen, like from the Internet. Ask for a certificate.

, The certificate should be from a grading authority (e.g. GIA, AGSL, LGP, PGGL)or an independent appraiser who is affiliated with a professional organization (like the American Society of Appraisers) but not with any one retailer.


Certificates come with lots of information about your diamond, such as carat weight, measurements, proportions, clarity grade, color grade, and cut grade.
Certificates may also come with information that you might not expect a jeweler to give you. They include:


Fluorescence, or the tendency of the diamond to give off faint glow when exposed to ultraviolet light.Polish, or the smoothness of the surface.

Symmetry, or the degree to which the opposing facets mirror each other flawlessly.



, Once you know for sure that your diamond is real, whether through independent appraisal or grading lab, take your stone to a lab that can register and fingerprint your diamond. This will ensure you that you have your real stone, and that no one will be able to switch it out without your knowing.


Just like humans, every diamond is unique. New technology is allowing gemologists to quantify that uniqueness by producing a ""fingerprint"" of your gem. Registration usually costs less than $100, and can assist in insurance purposes. If a stolen diamond of yours with a fingerprint shows up in an international database, you should be able to retrieve it by showing documentation that proves it is yours."

Recognize synthetic diamonds.,
Recognize moissanite.,
Recognize white topaz.,
Recognize white sapphire.,
Recognize cubic zirconia.",How to Tell if a Diamond is Real5," Lab-created or synthetic diamonds are ""real"" but they are not ""natural"". Synthetic diamonds cost a fraction of what a mined diamond costs, but they are (usually) chemically the same as ""natural"" diamonds. Telling the difference between a natural and a synthetic diamond requires a trained professional using highly sophisticated equipment which tends to rely on detecting the higher uniformity (closer to perfect) structure that gem-quality lab-created diamonds usually have as well as distinctive trace quantities and uniform distribution of specific non-carbon elements within the diamond crystal. Man-made diamonds do not command the same re-sale value as mined diamonds due to successful PR campaigns by the mined diamond industry to suggest that mined diamonds are better than lab-made diamonds because they were mined instead of ""made"". If you care about re-sale and insurance values it is important to know if the gem is ""natural"" or ""man-made"".

, Diamond and moissanite are very easy to mistake for each other. It is difficult to tell the difference between them but moissanite sparkles a little more than diamond and also produces a double refraction, which can be difficult for most people to see. You can try shining a light through a stone, and if it gives off a much more colorful and large shine than a known diamond, then you'll know that moissanite is what you have.Diamond and moissanite have very similar thermal conductivities. If you only use a diamond tester, it will show ""diamond"" when you actually have moissanite. It is important to test any stone that tests ""diamond"" on a diamond tester or a moissanite tester. For a professional jeweler, the best option is to just get a combined diamond/moissanite tester.

, White topaz is another stone that can look a little like a diamond to the untrained eye. However, white topaz is much softer than diamond. A mineral's hardness is determined by its ability to scratch and be scratched by other materials. A stone that can scratch others easily without being scratched itself is hard (and vice versa for soft stones). Real diamonds are some of the hardest minerals on the planet, so look for scratches around the facets of your stone. If your stone appears to be somewhat ""scratched up"", it's probably a white topaz or another soft substitute.

, Contrary to popular belief, sapphires aren't only blue. In fact, these gems are available in virtually every color. White varieties of sapphire, which appear clear, are often used as diamond substitutes. However, these stones don't contain the sharp, sparkling contrast between light and dark areas that real diamonds do. If you find that your stone has a somewhat hazy or ""icy"" appearance — that is, its light and dark areas don't contrast greatly — it's probably a white sapphire., Cubic zirconia is a synthetic stone which closely resembles a diamond. The easiest way to spot a cubic zirconia is by the color of it's ""fire"" or shine. Cubic zirconia gives off an orange shine which makes this stone easy to identify. Its artificial origin can also give it much more ""clear"" appearance than natural diamonds, which often contain minor flecks and flaws.


Cubic zirconia are also known to exhibit a greater spectrum of color than real diamonds when light is focused on the stone. A real diamond's sparkle and reflection should be largely colorless, while a cubic zirconia can project colored sparkles.One commonly-circulated test for determining whether a stone is a real diamond is to scratch glass with it. According to popular belief, if the stone scratches glass without becoming scratched itself, it's a real diamond. However, some high-quality cubic zirconia can also scratch glass, so this test is actually not a definitive way to determine whether a diamond is real or not."

Inspect the piece for official markings.,
Look for noticeable discoloration.",How to Tell if Gold Is Real1," A stamp will indicate either fineness (1-999 or .1-.999) or karat (10K, 14K, 18K, 22K or 24K). A magnifying glass will make this easier.


An older piece might not have a visible marking due to wear.
Counterfeit pieces can often have a marking that appears authentic; more testing may be needed either way.;
, It is important to check for discoloration in areas that face constant friction (typically around the edges).


If the gold seems to be wearing off and showing a different metal beneath it, you probably have a piece that is only gold plated.

Locate the date code.,
Match the symbol for pre-1950 watches.,
Translate the code for post-1950 watches.",How to Date a Bulova Watch1," Genuine Bulova watches manufactured between 1924 and 2009 should all have an imprinted date code marked somewhere on the watch. Once you locate and identify the date code, you should know the year during which that watch was manufactured.


Bulova watches made between 1924 and 1949 are marked with a date code symbol. These symbols are typically located on the inside movement of the watch, so you or a professional jeweler will need to open the watch to locate the code.
Bulova watches made between 1950 and 2009 are marked with a two-digit alpha-numeric date code. This code is typically found on the outside backcase of the watch, just below the serial number. Opening the watch should not be necessary.
Note that these codes only specify the manufacture date of the watch. It is possible that the watch did not go into circulation until a later date, but there is no way of identifying the exact year a specific watch went on the market.
Also note that many Bulova watches also have a serial number listed on the backcase, but this number cannot be used to date the watch and only served as a method of identification.;
, If there is no alpha-numeric code on the backcase of the watch, it probably dates back further than 1950. You will need to check the inside movement of the watch for a pictorial date symbol to identify the manufacture date.


Note that some dates share symbols with other years. When in doubt, you should cross-check the date symbol with the watch style to determine which era the watch likely fell into.
The date symbols are as follows:1924: asterisk (same as 1941)
1925: circle (same as 1934, 1944)
1926: triangle (same as 1935, 1945)
1927: square (same as 1936, 1946)
1928: crescent moon (same as 1938)
1929: rounded shield (same as 1939)
1930: horned circle (same as 1940)
1931: rectangular shield
1932: rounded capital T (same as 1942)
1933: capital X (same as 1943)
1934: circle (same as 1925, 1944)
1935: triangle (same as 1926, 1945)
1936: square (same as 1927, 1946)
1937: right-pointing arrow
1938: crescent moon (same as 1928)
1939: rounded shield (same as 1929)
1940: horned circle (same as 1930)
1941: asterisk (same as 1924)
1942: rounded capital T (same as 1932)
1943: capital X (same as 1933)
1944: circle (same as 1925, 1934)
1945: triangle (same as 1926, 1935)
1946: square (same as 1927, 1936)
1947: 47
1948: 48
1949: J9



, For Bulova watches created in 1950 or later, the manufacturer switched to a two-digit alpha-numeric code system. These codes are usually found on the backcase, but some can be found on the inside movement near the set-screw.


The first digit of the code corresponds to the decade. The second digit of the code corresponds to the specific year.
The decade codes are as follows:1950s: L
1960s: M
1970s: N
1980s: P
1990s: T
2000s: A


The second digit of the code matches the ending digit of the year in which the watch was manufactured. When ""0"" is used, the end of the year was a ""0"" (1950, 1960, 1970, and so on). When ""1"" is used, the end date of the year was a ""1"" (1951, 1961, 1971, and so on). This pattern continues for digits ""0"" through ""9.""
For example, a Bulova watch marked with ""N2"" was manufactured in 1972. A Bulova watch marked with ""T8"" was manufactured in 1998.

Understand why gemstones are cut and cleaned.,
Identify the cut of your gemstone.,
Check for blemishes.,
Find out the Carat or gemstone weight.,
Find out if the gem has been treated.,
Check the transparency.,
Look at the settings and closures.,
Always buy from a credible jeweler.",How to Assess the Quality of Gemstone Jewelry," Even the prettiest of gemstones, when excavated, is rough and unattractive. Any gemstone requires cleaning before it gains its resplendent form. Gemstone cutting is also required because quite a few gemstones possess strong and rigid crystalline structures and are too hard to be molded into any other shape.


Some gems are easy to cut because of weaker bond between their crystalline layers whereas there are some which require certain special tools and skill for cutting and trimming. 
Then, there are few gemstone varieties that have simpler crystalline structures and can be cut in only one or in a few directions. While some, like diamond, possess a very complex structure and, therefore, can be cut in myriad ways. 
Each cut of a gemstone is called a facet. The term, multi-faceted has originated as a gem term that describes complex cuts that exhibit one or more facets.The reasons for cutting vary from gemstone to gemstone. Diamond requires cutting to achieve brilliance and sparkle it is famous for, while some other gemstones need cutting to be molded into a particular shape or a particular jewelry design.;
, To do this, review the definitions below:



Checkerboard Cut: It is a technique where the stone is cut into a variety of square facets with regular spaces around the gem. It gives it a “Checkerboard Effect” in light and dark squares when moved in light. Checkboard cut is common in garnets, topaz, citrines and amethysts or other semi-precious stones.

Cabochon Cut: This is probably the oldest form of gemstone cutting and is characterised by rounded top and flat bottom.  Cabochon cut is common in gems like star sapphire, cat's eye gemstones, tiger's eye gem stones, star gemstones and star ruby.

Rose Cut: It is one of the varieties of cabochon cut where flat facets are polished into the curved area of cabochon cut stone.

Brilliant Cut: Earlier rose cut method was employed for cutting gemstones. However, nowadays, brilliant cut method is mostly used for this purpose. Brilliant cut requires cutting of gem in the form of two truncated cones facing each other.

, Perfect gemstones are those that carry no blemish. However, even though clarity or perfection is valued in gems it varies from gemstone to gemstone. For example, emerald does not lose its value because of its ‘’imperfection’’ (its violent formation leads to flaws even in the most valuable emeralds). Furthermore, any blemish in colored gemstones is easily visible whereas darker stone can hide this deficiency.  As color gemstones vary greatly, GIA (Gemological Institute of America) classifies them as 'Type 1', 'Type 2' or 'Type 3'.



Type 1: The gems falling in this category are blemish less and exhibit clean image with no mark being visible to naked eyes. Some of the stones that can be included in this category are  aquamarine, yellow and green chrysoberyl, heliodor, morganite, smoky quartz, spodumene, tanzanite, green tourmaline and blue zircon.

Type 2: Gemstones in this category are mostly flawless. However, there are certain flaws that they carry which make them less valuable than type 1. Stones in this category include   amethyst, ametrine, andalusite, alexandrite, citrine, corundum (all sapphire and ruby), garnet, iolite, peridot, spinel, tourmaline that is not green, pink or watermelon, and zircon that is not blue.

Type 3:  Flawless stones are extremely rare to find in this category. Emerald, red beryl and red, pink and watermelon tourmaline are some of the stones that fall in this category.

, Carat refers to the unit of weight in gemology. One carat is equivalent to .200 grams. However, neither weight nor size determines the value of any gem. A badly cut or colored stone will be far less in value than a smaller but perfect specimen.  


The weight of any gemstone is directly related to the price it commands. However, it should be noted here that a gemstone’s price may increase in geometrical progression for weights up to 3-4 carats. However, colored gemstones of 4 carats and above are priced even more than those with geometrical progression because of the low availability of colored gemstones of such sizes.

, A natural gemstone always derives more value than the one that has undergone treatment to enhance color. Artificial interference always affects the value of any gemstone. Dyed or filled gemstones are always considered to be of low quality. It is difficult in today’s time to lay your hands on untreated colored gemstones that have good color quality and clarity levels. It is, therefore, not surprising to find untreated colored gemstone with good color and clarity command superior price.

, Transparency in any gem is dependent on the amount of light that passes through it. Transparency in gemstones is related to its chemical and crystalline nature as well as its thickness, inclusions and its surface condition.

, Understanding different settings and closures will also help you in laying your hand on “perfect gemstone.” However, even a perfect gemstone will lose its value if it is crafted in an inferior setting.

, Apart from following the above mentioned steps always remember to buy any gemstone or gemstone jewelry from a reputed and credible jeweler. He will provide you with the best quality gemstone jewelry that will fulfill your desire to be a head turner on all occasions.

Weigh your piece of gold.,
Fill a vial with water.,
Place your gold in the vial.,
Use the following formula to calculate density: Density = mass/volume displacement.",How to Tell if Gold Is Real4," A jeweler can normally do this for you for free if you don’t have your own scale. You will need the weight in grams.

,

It’s helpful if the vial has millimeter markings on the side, since that will make it easier for you to read the measurements for this test.
It doesn’t matter how much water you use as long as you don’t fill the vial to the top, since the water level will rise once you immerse the gold in it.
It’s also important to note the exact amount of the water level before and after immersion.

, Take note of the new water level and calculate the difference between those two numbers in milliliters., A result close to 19 g/ml indicates either real gold, or a material with a density similar to gold. Here is an example calculation:

Your gold item weighs 38 g and it displaces 2 milliliters of water. Using the formula of /, your result would be 19 g/ml, which is very close to the density of gold.
Bear in mind that different gold purity will have a different g/ml ratio:

14K – 12.9 to 14.6 g/ml
18K yellow – 15.2 to 15.9 g/ml
18K white – 14.7 to 16.9 g/ml
22K – 17.7 to 17.8 g/ml

Note 1960s style elements.,
Consider key markings from the 1970s.,
Consider an expert appraisal for watches past the 1980s.",How to Date a Bulova Watch2," Since Bulova watches are marked with date codes, you won't usually need to rely on the watch appearance for dating purposes. There are some circumstances that make this a beneficial practice to know, however.


For example, if the date code has worn away or is otherwise obscured, your next best option is to date the watch by appearance.
An understanding of watch styles can also help you narrow down a date for pre-1950 Bulova watches. Some of the date symbols used for these watches were shared with watches of other decades. For instance, the asterisk marked watches manufactured in both 1924 and 1941. Knowing the difference between a 1920s style watch and a 1940s style watch can help you determine which date (1924 or 1941) an asterisk-marked Bulova was made in.
Note that dating a watch by style will only tell you the decade the watch likely came from, not the exact year.

, Most Bulova watches from the 1920s feature a ""deco"" style common to other fashions and decorations of the decade.The hands of the watch are usually thick.
Look at the style of the watch face. The sides and front of the metal will usually be decorated with engraved patterns.

, Watches of the 1930s were smoother and more elegant than those of the previous decade.


The lines of the watch are generally fairly clean. Watch faces no longer had much engraving on them, and when engravings were used, they were minimal.
Square watch faces came into fashion during the 1930s. Rounded faces were still common, especially early in the era, but rectangular faces were more prevalent in the later part of the decade.
Watches in general had a more straightforward, ""masculine"" appearance during this decade.

, Watches made in the 1940s were very similar to those made in the late 1930s, but the designs were even more rigid.


The lines and angles were much more rigid, with very few rounded edges. Rectangular watch faces were common, while founded faces were fairly rare.
Watch faces were small, but the designs were bold and blocky. The hour markers were quite simple, though.

, Watches manufactured during the 1950s were more decorative than in the previous two decades.


This decade marked an era of technological and scientific advancements, and this trend shows up in most watch styles of the decade. Many watches took on what would have been a ""futuristic"" appearance.
Bold, fancy watch faces were back in style. The numbers and hour markers became elaborate again, and the metal surrounding the watch face was often curved or angled in a decorative, rather than straightforward, manner.
Rectangular faces were still common, but rounded faces came back into style again.

, During the 1960s, watches were bolder and took on an appearance inspired by the modern art era.


Most watch faces were round and notably larger than in past decades. The metal surrounding the face was usually quite thin and simple.
The hands of the watch were usually wider, yet they also came to a sharper, more defined point.

, In thee 1970s, watches were heavy, big, and fairly flashy.


Square faces were back in style. The metal surrounding the watch face was simple yet heavy and blocky.
Hour digits were somewhat rare, and most watches marked the hours exclusively with lines or dashes.
Metal bands were more common than ones made of leather.

, Many watch styles from the 1980s and beyond were quite varied, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific style to a specific decade.


If you suspect that your Bulova watch originated during one of these decades, you may need to turn to an expert jeweler or appraiser for a more exact idea of the likely date.
That being said, there were still a few key design elements were noting from each decade.
During the 1980s, metal watch bands and simple hour marking were in style.
In the 1990s, decorative leather bands and hour digits came back into fashion, but metal bands and plain hour markings were also common enough.
Once the 2000s hit, watches of nearly all previous style eras could be found on the market.

Compare the original yellow sapphire with yellow glass.,
Look for bubbles.,
Check for scratches.,
Consider the facets.",How to Buy Natural Yellow Sapphire Stones1," Mostly the imitations are made from yellow glass. Although they may look similar to original sapphire at first glance but when compared you will find a discrete difference between the two.;
, Sapphire can have several interior inclusions, but the bubbles in genuine ones can’t be seen from naked eyes. However, fake sapphire have tiny bubble entrapped inside that can be seen with naked eyes.

, Ranking at 9th position as per Moh’s scale (a scale used to measure relative hardness of a mineral by its resistance to scratching), yellow sapphire is just one level lower than diamond that is placed at 10th position. Therefore, sapphire of any color is extremely hard, which means it’s relatively harder to cause scratches on sapphire. On the contrary, an imitation often has lots of scratches on their surface; this is another reason to differentiate between an original sapphire and a fake.

, Since a glass is not as harder as original sapphire, hence the former one can be easily molded into various shapes and usually have smooth and rounded edges. However, original sapphires have more complex cuts that have sharp and crisp edges.

Measure the watch band.,
Gather your tools.,
Prepare your work area.",How to Remove Watch Band Links1," Before you set about removing any watch links, it is necessary to measure your watch band so you know exactly how many links you will need to remove. To do this:


Position the watch on your wrist exactly the way you intend to wear it. When you are satisfied with the way it is positioned, turn your wrist over so that the watch band clasp side is facing up.
With the watch band on your wrist, gather the slack in the band and hold the links together to simulate them being removed. Stop gathering the links up when the watch band fits your wrist just the way you like.
Look where the links are gathered close together at your wrist – be aware that because of the design of the watch band they may not touch. The loose hanging links will tell you the number of links you should remove first.
If you can't accurately judge the number of links to remove, remove one less than you expect - it is always easier to remove another link than add one back in.
Be aware that it is always better to remove an even number of watch links. This way, you can remove the same number of links from each side and ensure that the clasp is still located in the center of the watch strap.;
, In order to remove watch links properly, you will need certain tools. These may include:


A thin, pointy object like a spring-bar removal tool or pin pusher.
A long-nosed pliers.
A small hammer.
A screwdriver.
A parts tray.

, Make sure that your work area is free from clutter. It is probably a good idea to put down a sheet or some other covering on your work surface and possibly the floor. This is to make sure that any small pieces won't get lost."

Take note of the cut.,
Avoid ‘x’ cuts.,
Check the stone under a magnifying glass.",How to Buy Natural Yellow Sapphire Stones2," Below one carat an original yellow sapphire can be cut into almost any shape, but beyond one carat jewelers prefer to cut it into either oval or cushion mixed cut. On the other hand jewelers often cut synthetic stone into oval and emerald shape.

, Fortunately, manufacturers of synthetic stone usually place an X cut, also called a scissors cut, on the facets of a stone.

, A synthetic stone, no matter how original it may look, will definitely possess some flaws which can be easily identified under 10x to 30x magnification. A magnifying glass will help you identify the curved and groove banding found in synthetic sapphires, especially when you place a translucent glass in between the stone and the light.

"
Be cautious of filling.,
Say no to foil backed stones.,
Look for a genuine provider.",How to Buy Natural Yellow Sapphire Stones3," Some sapphires often contain some space inside them, which on slicing may showcase imperfection. Although some jewelers leave the space as it is, but some fraudulent ones fill the gap with borax paste or dust of glass to add on to the weight of the stone. Patches of unevenness is considered as a good indication of this swindling practice.

, Foil backing adds on to the deep colorization and luster that makes the stone look brighter than ever. The backing could be really hard to notice any difference from naked eyes, but by examining the base of the stone with a magnifying glass can often reveal a foil backing. This type of practice is more common in antique type of jewelry, hence observe them carefully.

, Always purchase a gemstone from a provider who is certified to sell gemstones. However, the certification may not give you the surety of genuineness like physical checking of the stone might, but it does provide you the satisfaction that the gem is approved of the officials of a trusted organization.

Separate the bracelet.,
Choose which link you are going to remove.,
Watch out for a small metal ferrule.,
Remove the link's second pin.,
Remove the next link.,
Reassemble the watch band.,
Reconnect the clasp.,
Try your watch on.",How to Remove Watch Band Links2," With some metal watch straps, it is necessary to separate the bracelet before you can remove any links. To do this:


Remove the spring bar from the watch strap clasp. To identify which spring bar it is, hold the clasp in your left hand, and it will be the one on the left side.Use the spring bar removal tool or pin pusher to compress the spring bar and lever it out of the clasp.
Be careful that it doesn't spring across the room, because this is the only one you have!

, Use the pin pusher or spring bar removal tool to push the pin that secures that particular link, following the direction of the printed arrows on the underside of the metal link.You should be able to push the pin 2 or 3mm and then pull it out from the other side using your pair of pliers or by hand.
Place the pin in your parts tray, you will need it to put the bracelet back together again.

, Some watch bands contain small metal ferrules in the middle of joining links that will be released when you take out a pin. It may fall onto the floor or work station, so keep an eye out for it. You will need it later., Repeat the pin removal process on the link's other pin. When you have finished, you should have two pins and possibly two ferrules ready to use later.

, If you need to, remove another link on the other side of the clasp, using the same process. When you have removed as many links as you need to, you are ready to join the bracelet back together.

, Once the required links have been removed the pin will need to replaced into the band to complete it again. To do this replace the pin in the opposite direction to the arrows.


If your watch band has ferrules, place the ferrule in the middle of the link that you are joining up, and when you push the pin back into the hole, make sure to engage the ferrule.
If you need to, you can gently tap the pin back into place using your small hammer.

, To reconnect the clasp, you need to do the reverse of the disconnecting process. Ensure that the clasp is the right way round and replace the spring bars.

, Your watch should now fit, if you have removed the correct number of links. If it is still too big, you can always remove another link.


If it is a little loose or a little tight, it may be possible to further adjust the bracelet by inserting the clasp's spring bars into an alternative set of holes to adjust the size.
Make sure to keep any extra links and spare pins or ferrules safe, you may need to use them again in the future.

Identify the link you wish to remove.,
Remove the screw.,
Remove the link.,
Reassemble the watch band.",How to Remove Watch Band Links3," Turn the watch on its side, find the link you wish to remove and locate the screw holding it in place.

, Use a 1mm screwdriver to remove the required screw. You can do this by applying light pressure and turning the screwdriver in a counterclockwise motion.Continue to turn in a counterclockwise motion until the screw becomes loose.
Use a pair of tweezers or pliers to grab the screw before it falls. Make sure to keep it somewhere safe, as you will need it to reassemble the watch.
Ensure that you do this over a table or tray to make sure you don't lose screws should they fall during the process.

, Once the screw has been removed, your chosen link can easily be separated from the watch band. Repeat this process for each link that you need to remove.

, Once you have removed the necessary number of links, you can reassemble your watch band by simply reconnecting the links using the removed screw and a screwdriver.

Measure the band.,
Bend down the top edge flaps.,
Open the bottom edge flaps.,
Remove the links.,
Put the bracelet back together.",How to Remove Watch Band Links4," You can do this by attaching one end of the watch strap to its case, then wrapping the strap around your wrist. Count how many of the links are overlapping and add one to this number. The number you come with is the number of links that will need to be removed. With this kind of watch band, you can easily remove links from any part of the band.

, Place the watch face down on your work surface and bend down the top edge flaps of the section you intend to remove.

, Flip the watch over and snap open the bottom edge flaps. These are located directly to the left of the top flaps you opened already.

, Take the link out by sliding the section you wish to remove sideways. This will automatically disengage the staples which hold the links together.

, To do this, you will need to engage the staples on both sides of the strap at the same time, before snapping all of the flaps back into place."

Remove the pin.,
Gently apply pressure.,
Release the mechanism.,
Dissemble the links.,
Gently remove the necessary links.,
Reassemble the watch band.",How to Remove Watch Band Links5," Using a pin pusher, remove the pin from the link you wish to remove. Make sure you follow the direction of the arrow marked on the underside of the link.

, Hold the band firmly, with one hand on either of the link whose pin you just removed. Gently apply an upward pressure on the side of the link which is closest to the case. At the same time, apply a gentle downwards pressure on the side nearest the clasp. You should be able to feel the mechanism disengaging., Keep applying gentle pressure as you gently ""rock"" the band to complete the mechanism's release., When the mechanism has been released, you can take the links apart by moving the clasp side of the strap towards the case., Once the links have been disengaged, you will be able to pull the links apart. Try to do this as gently as possible. Repeat for as many links as necessary., To reassemble the watch, simply follow the sames steps as above, but in reverse."

Locate the crown on your analog expedition watch.,
Set your watch to the correct time.,
Set the date and day on your watch.",How to Set a Timex Expedition2," To set the time and date of your analog expedition watch you will first need to locate the crown. The crown will appear as a small circular disc on the edge of your watch. You will be pulling this disc out and away from the body of the watch to set both the time and date.


Pulling the crown all the way out will allow you to adjust the time.
Pulling the crown half way out to the middle position will allow you to adjust the date.
Pushing the crown back in will restart the watch, starting from the time and date you have set it to.

, Once you've located the crown you can use it to adjust the time. Using the crown to adjust the time is a simple process that involves pulling it out fully and twisting it until the hands of the watch are at the right time. Follow these steps to set your watch using the crown:


Pull the crown out to its outer position, pulling as far as it will extend.
Once extended you can twist the crown to adjust where the arms of the watch are positioned.
Twist the crown until the arms are set to the right time.
Push the crown back down into the watch to start it up once again.

, To set the date and day on your watch you will need to first find the crown. The crown will need to be pulled out and away from the watch and then twisted until the correct date is shown. Follow these few steps to use the crown when setting the date:


Find the crown and pull it out of the watch to the middle position. This will be half of its length.
Turn the crown clockwise until you see the correct date.
If the date isn't changing, pull the crown to the outer position and turn ahead by 24 hours.
Put the crown back into its neutral position, fully pressed down into the watch.

Use a ball burr to grind off the head of the rivet where the hinge attaches with a wire.,
Take the old spring to use as your pattern.,
Choose a metal wire that fits through the bracelet's original divot holes.,
Assemble the bracelet or necklace, placing the spring inside to make sure the sides fit together.",How to Repair Jewelry," Depending upon the damage, some steps may not apply. Acquire the needed materials at a hobby shop or bead store.

, Wear reading glasses or use a free-standing magnifying glass, if needed.

, Open the jump rings. These are the 2 circles that link each side of the clasp to the chain; each of these rings contains a slit.

, Place 1 set of needle-nosed pliers in your dominant hand, and clamp the pliers on 1 side of the jump ring's slit. The slit should be facing toward the ceiling. Pick up the second set of needle-nosed pliers in your other hand and clamp it on the other side of the slit. Open the slit wider by slowly pulling in opposite directions. Repeat on the other jump ring on the other side of the necklace.

, Slip the new jump rings and clasp onto the jump rings. Close gently with pliers, using the method you have just learned. You can use this method to repair clasps and chain links.

, Save all original parts; they will be used to make a pattern for the new hinge.;
, Make a divot into the bracelet or necklace, where the hinge is attached. Use a small steel punch to push out the pin. Use the ball burr to make the divot in the other side. You will reattach the new hinge to these divots.

, Count the number of times the coil circles. Take an 8 inch (20.3 cm) piece of guitar string. Coil the guitar string around the pliers according to the number of times the original hinge was coiled. Use a heavy duty wire cutter to trim the excess guitar string. Further shape the coil according to the original hinge. Place it within the bracelet to ensure a good fit.

, Use a torch to ball the bottom end of the wire. Use a steel block to hammer the wire flat.

, Put the rivet through the coil. Check the coil tension. Cut the string with wire cutters, then hammer the rivet flat on the other side. Polish and buff.

Get two pairs of flat nose pliers.,
Purchase a new clasp, and extra jump rings.,
Open the jump rings and remove the old clasp.,
Add the new jump rings and clasp.",How to Repair Silver Jewelry1," You can buy these for relatively cheap at your local hardware store. You can also purchase a jewelry repair kit from a hobby store, which will come with special pliers and tools needed for repair. Just make sure you get a pair of flat nose pliers that are small enough to handle smaller pieces of jewelry.If you’re buying the pliers on their own rather than as part of a kit, you’ll need two pairs in order to hold each end of the broken clasp.;
, Since your clasp is broken, you’ll need to buy a new one to attach on your jewelry. Get a silver plated clasp and a few jump rings, or connector rings, in order to secure the clasp to your jewelry. You can buy these supplies online, or you can find them at a local hobby or crafting store.You can buy clasps and jump rings in all different kinds of material. They’ll most likely be plated in silver rather than made from silver.

, Using the flat nose pliers, grip the ring connecting the clasp to the chain or string. There should be a slit in the ring where it does not fully connect; grip it on either side of this slit. Pull one hand towards you and push one hand away, separating the two sides. Slide off the old clasp.Make sure you don’t pull the jump ring outward. This will only bend the ring and make it very difficult to get it back into its normal shape.

, Remove any jump rings that may be damaged or broken and replace them. Then, on the last jump ring, hook the new clasp on before closing the ring. Make sure the jump rings are closed and secure.If you’re having trouble seeing the clasp and jump rings, consider purchasing a hands-free magnifying glass. This will help you see what you’re doing but still keep your hands free to work.

Use a hard silver solder.,
Use a soldering torch.,
Use flux when soldering.,
Use the torch to solder the silver pieces.",How to Repair Silver Jewelry2," You want to make sure you purchase a hard solder and not a soft solder. A soft solder will not work with silver jewelry, and may actually damage it further. You can purchase hard silver solder online, or from a local hardware store.You can choose to buy solder wire, or sheets. The sheets are generally cheaper, and will allow you to cut the size you need.

, Soft solder can be soldered with a soldering iron, which is electric. Hard solder must be soldered with a torch, with is powered by gas. Butane torches are useful for standard jewelry repair jobs like fixing jump rings and reattaching small chains.Always handle soldering torches carefully. Wear protective gloves and make sure you are in a room with good ventilation to avoid inhaling any fumes.

, Flux cleans the metal prior to soldering so that it can bond and melt properly. Use a liquid flux to coat the surface you’re soldering before beginning. You can also purchase flux sprays made specifically for hard soldering, and for working with silver.Hard soldering might also require pickling after being soldered, in order to clean it. You can purchase separate pickling liquid, or you can even use a flux that is self-pickling.
Brush flux onto the joint or surface you plan to solder before applying the solder.

, If you are soldering two pieces together, for example, place the solder wire against the spot you need to solder. Adjust the torch to its highest temperature setting, and heat the wire until it melts. Once it melts, it will join with the silver piece you’re repairing or bonding with another piece.


After soldering, you will want to rinse the newly repaired or joined piece in water, then pickle it to clean it if the flux you used wasn’t self-pickling.

Take your silver jewelry to a jeweler if you need it resized.,
Consider that silver jewelry repair may take longer and cost more than gold.,
Look for a jeweler who has a laser welding machine.",How to Repair Silver Jewelry3," Resizing silver jewelry is much more difficult and time consuming than resizing gold. When melting down the silver to resize it, it gets very dirty through oxidization. A jeweler will be able to make sure the piece returns to its previous shiny state after resizing.Keep in mind that if you have a silver ring with a stone in it, some jewelers may tell you it can’t be resized without taking the whole ring apart. Silver conducts heat through the entire ring, making it difficult to resize when there is a stone setting on the piece.

, Even though the silver itself is less valuable per ounce compared to gold, it is time consuming to repair. A jeweler might price the work at a high rate simply because of how long it is going to take them to repair the piece and then polish it back to its normal coloring., Laser welding is the safest way to resize and work on silver, as it won’t harm the metal the way traditional torch welding will. Laser welding will allow a jeweler to resize a silver ring with a stone on it, for example, when the same couldn’t be done with traditional torch welding.A laser welding machine can cost upwards of $20,000, so smaller, independent jewelers might be less likely to own or have access to one.

Use a special silver polishing cloth.,
Avoid using dips and polishing agents.,
Use a homemade silver cleaner.,
Be careful when cleaning silver jewelry that contains precious gemstones.,
Repair shallow scratches by buffing with regular toothpaste.",How to Repair Silver Jewelry4," These cloths are made specifically for cleaning and polishing silver. They don’t require any liquid cleaner or polishing agent. Just use the cloth to gently buff away tarnish and restore the jewelry to its natural shine., Liquid polishing agents and dips are harsh chemicals that could damage plated silver. They need to be used in very well-ventilated areas, as well, as the smell could be hazardous to your health. You also may have to dispose of these chemicals carefully, as they are considered hazardous.These heavy-duty cleaners can also cause your jewelry to tarnish more quickly, as they could strip the protective surface off.

, If the polishing cloth doesn’t do the trick, you can try using things from your kitchen to clean your silver jewelry. A little bit of phosphate-free dishwashing soap and warm water, for example, could help. Or, try using a paste made from baking soda and water. Apply a small dollop (about the size of a pea) to your jewelry and use it to buff away tarnish.Always rinse your jewelry after using any kind of polish, homemade or otherwise. Rinse it briefly, then dry it with a clean cloth. You don’t want any polish to get stuck on the jewelry anywhere and harden.

, Certain gemstones may require special attention when cleaning. If your silver jewelry contains fragile pieces like pearl, you will want to make sure you only use cleaning or polishing agents that are safe for these parts of the jewelry., Put a little bit of toothpaste on a cloth. After wetting down the piece of silver jewelry, rub the toothpaste gently into it using circular motions. Rinse the jewelry again. If the scratch is still there, repeat the process. If the scratch doesn’t go away after a few tries, it may need to be taken to a jeweler for repair.


Don’t use toothpaste that is for tartar control or has a whitening agent. These ingredients are too abrasive and may actually end up damaging the silver.

Know that not all reports are the same.",How to Evaluate a Diamond Grading Certificate," Many laboratories call their documents ""certificates""; however, this can be misleading to a consumer. If you read the back of these documents, even the ones that print ""certificate"" on them, the fine print on the back states that they only ""certify"" that a gemologist or several gemologists have graded the diamond. They also state that the report is ""no guarantee"", and therefore, by definition, does not certify the quality that they are documenting.


The only retail establishment using an ISO laboratory that actually issues a certificate is Tiffany & Co. They do certify and guarantee the quality of their diamonds.;
, Hoge Raad voor Diamant (HRD), or ""Diamond High Council,"" is Europe's counterpart to the GIA. HRD's grading certificates are legal documents in the eyes of the European Union.

, The Precision Gem Grading Laboratory (PGGL) in Philadelphia, PA, uses ImaGem's Direct Measurement technology for objective diamond grading. ImaGem's technology grades diamonds based on measurement of color, clarity, fluorescence and light behavior. They have the capability to support all grades with numerical measurements.

, The International Gemological Institute (IGI) mostly conducts appraisals for diamond engagement rings.

, The American Gem Society (AGS) grades and evaluates diamonds based on their cut grade from 0 (most desirable) to 4 (least desirable).

, The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) is a non-profit institute that created the ""four Cs"" (Cut, Clarity, Color and Carat Weight) methodology of grading diamonds, as well as the International Diamond Grading System. However, reports from this institute omit certain aspects of diamond cuts that other reports cover (e.g. crown height percentage, pavilion depth percentage, crown angle, pavilion angle).


Reports from the GIA after 2005 that are full Diamond Grading Reports (they do not use the word ""certificate"") include the diagram and proportions of the diamond's cut.

, The European Gemological Laboratory (EGL) is an independent network of diamond grading laboratories. EGL laboratories use GIA nomenclature, but their master grading diamonds do not necessarily match those used by the GIA, nor does their lighting and grading methods.. Therefore, diamond certificates from the EGL are generally less reliable than those from the GIA., This is the most vital information to determine, as it summarizes the beauty of the stone. The cut determines how the light reflects and refracts through the diamond to make it dance and dazzle.

, To know how well a diamond has been cut, make sure the document grades the gem's cut or light behavior based on direct measurement.


Beware of labs that list cut grades based on a model, and not the actual diamond.

, The diamond grading report should have measures for brilliance, fire (spectral colors), sparkle and pattern. It should also include polish and finish (craftsmanship) notations.


If it does not, you have the right to ask your jeweler for an independent light behavior grading certificate.

, A diamond grading certificate only details the gem's properties at the time of inspection, so it means virtually nothing if the diamond was altered afterwards.

, The older the certificate, the greater the chance that the diamond has been altered (e.g. set or worn).

, If the document is over a year old or has no date, you can ask the gemologist to verify the report or pay to send it in for re-examination.


If this is not possible, at least ask about the diamond's history and inspect the stone under a scope for abrasions on the crown (top), culet (bottom), or at around its girdle (the narrow band around the outer circumference of a diamond, where it is held by the jewelry setting).

, One carat is equal to 1/142 of an ounce.


Generally, the higher the carat weight, the higher the price; however, prices leap at certain weights, and some weights are more popular (and thus more expensive) than others.

, The diamond weight is an exact measurement usually to the second decimal. It is one way to verify the report.


It is important to note that the carat weight is a volume weight, not the visual size of the diamond. It is possible for a .97 carat diamond to be wider than a 1.03 carat diamond.

, Grading reports list a maximum and minimum diameter for round diamonds, since no diamond is perfect. The difference between these two diameters is indication of how good the proportions are in a round diamond.


For example, a round diamond with a measurement of 6.50 x 6.56 x 4.72 mm may have a diameter that varies by 0.06 mm. This number is the difference between the first two measurements listed.

, A list of the average diameter tolerances for variances is:


0.5 carat - 0.05 mm
0.6 carat - 0.06 mm
0.7 carat - 0.07 mm
0.8 carat - 0.08 mm
0.9 carat - 0.09 mm
1.0 carat - 0.10 mm
2.0 carat - 0.12 mm
3.0 carat - 0.14 mm
4.0 carat - 0.16 mm
5.0 carat - 0.17 mm

This is a suggested industry reference; fancy shape preferences are as individual as diamonds are.



, For fancy shapes, divide the diamond's length by its width to determine the ratio. If your answer is 1.8, for example, then the ratio is 1.8:1.

, A list of the average ratios for fancily-shaped diamonds are:


Pear - 1.50:1 to 1.75:1
Marquise - 1.80:1 to 2.20:1
Emerald - 1.30:1 to 1.50:1
Princess - 1.15:1 to 1.00:1
Radiant - 1.50:1 to 1.75:1
Heart - 1.25:1 to 1.50:1
Oval - 1.30:1 to 1.50:1

, Consult the organization that produced the certificate for information on what each clarity measurement means.

, The clarity ratings for the GIA are listed here as an example:



FL = Flawless. No internal inclusions or external irregularities visible under 10x magnification to a trained eye.

IF = Internally Flawless. No internal inclusions but possibly tiny external irregularities in the finish visible to trained eye under 10x magnification.

VVS-1 = Very Very Slightly Included 1. Usually one very tiny inclusion visible only to a trained eye under 10x magnification.

VVS-2 = Very Very Slightly Included 2. Tiny inclusions visible only to a trained eye under 10x magnification.

VS-1 = Very Slightly Included 1. Some very small inclusions visible to anyone with 10x magnification.

VS-2 = Very Slightly Included 2. Several very small inclusions visible to anyone with 10x magnification.

SI-1 = Slightly Included 1. Small inclusions visible to anyone with 10x magnification.

SI-2 = Slightly Included 2. Several small inclusions visible to anyone with 10x magnification.

SI-3 = Slightly Included 3. Inclusions are visible to the naked eye of a trained observer.

I-1 = Included 1. Flaws that are visible to the naked, untrained eye.

I-2 = Included 2. Many flaws clearly visible to the naked, untrained eye that decrease the diamond's brilliance.

I-3 = Included 3. Many flaws clearly visible to the naked, untrained eye that decrease brilliance and compromise structure, making the diamond vulnerable to cracking or chipping.

, As a rule, colorless diamonds are more expensive and desirable than yellow or brown diamonds.

, Natural blue, green, pink, red and some yellow diamonds may also increase or decrease in value depending on market demand. Diamonds that have enough concentration of color and graded as fancy by a laboratory generally have a greater value, depending on the market and their grading factors, since they occur more rarely in nature.

, This often negatively impacts the market value.Diamonds with brown or grey overtones can be cut beautifully, however, and that can mask their slight body color. They offer a lower price due to color, but they can be just as brilliant - although warmer looking. Be aware, if the price is too good for the size, look at the diamond next to a white, lighted background.

, Depth refers to the total depth of a diamond from table to culet, as a percentage of its total diameter. The desired depth percentage depends on the shape of the diamond. Well-cut round diamonds usually are around 59%-62%.

, Culet refers to the bottom of a diamond that ends in a point. It may be faceted to protect the fragile tip from chipping.

, Table refers to the width of the largest top facet of a diamond. The table percentage is the averaged measurements of the table, as a percentage of the total average diameter of the diamond. Table percentages of a well proportioned modern round brilliant cut diamond range from 52% - 62%.

, Girdle refers to the area of the diamond where the bottom meets the top of the diamond. It may be rough, bruted, bearded, polished or faceted. It is also the area most likely to have naturals, nicks, chips and cavities

, Before buying a diamond, be sure its certificate lists each of the following finish qualities as ""good"" or better, and that the grading characteristics of ""polish"" and ""symmetry"" are at least ""good"" or better:


Polish
Symmetry
Fluorescence

Opinions vary on the desirability of fluorescence in a diamond. Strong fluorescence in slightly yellow diamonds may make them appear whiter, but strong fluorescence in white or fancy colored diamonds is generally less desirable. Any amount of fluorescence may affect the value.



, On some diamond grading reports, the finish section details other characteristics of the stone not covered by the general report, like external grain lines or inscriptions."

You may see several different markings engraved there, all of which have different meanings. A date code will be either a symbol (like a triangle, and eight-pointed star, or a half-moon, for example), a two-digit number, or one letter and one number. You may need to use a magnifying glass to help you read the codes, as they are very small.
If your watch was produced earlier than 1924, it will not have any date code on it.
You may also see a serial number on the back of your watch. This can also be useful in helping you identify how old your watch is, but it is not the model number.;
, Once you have identified a date code on your watch, you will need to interpret it, as the date is never printed in an obvious way. Bulova has used a few different systems for dating their watches.Between 1924 and 1945, a series of symbols was used to indicate the year in which the watch was produced. If you see a symbol, do an internet search to find a table that will show year which year corresponds to which symbol. Be aware, however, that some symbols were used more than once. For example, a circle was used in 1925, 1934, and 1944.
A transitional system was used between 1946 and 1949. In 1946, the code was 46 followed by a square. In 1947, the code was 47. In 1948, the code was 48. In 1949, the code was J9.
Beginning in 1950, Bulova started using a code including one letter and one number. The letter indicates the decade, while the number indicates the year within the decade. The decade codes are as follows: L = 1950s, M = 1960s, N = 1970s, P = 1980s, T = 1990s. For example, if your watch is stamped with the code M8, this means your watch was produced in 1968. If it is stamped with the cope P0, your watch was produced in 1980.

, As you are looking for identifying markings on your watch, you may come across a patent date. Patent dates typically include a month, day, and year, and are preceded by the letters ""pat."" Some people jump to the conclusion that this is the date that their watch was manufactured, but it is not. The patent date is merely the date on which the specific design of the watch was patented, so it will not be of much use.Patent dates may be helpful in helping you rule out certain dates of manufacture. For example, if your watch's design was patented in 1950, you know your watch could not have been produced any earlier than 1950 (but it could have been produced any time after 1950).

, On many watches, you will find two different serial numbers: one on the case of the watch, and one on the interior mechanism of the watch. This is because the two are often manufactured separately.If you check both the case and the mechanism and discover that they were made in different years, this can be due to several reasons. If the difference is only one year, it may simply be that one component was manufactured first and then warehoused until it was needed to assemble the watch. If the difference is more than a year, it is likely that one of the elements has been replaced.

, To find the serial number on the case of your Bulova watch, simply flip it over and look at the flat back of the case. If there is a serial number, it should be engraved here.Serial numbers do not all contain the same number of digits.
Not all Bulova watches will have serial numbers on the case. If yours does not, you may want to consider looking for a serial number on the mechanism.
You may want to use a magnifying glass to help you read the serial number.
If you already looked for a date code on your watch, you may have already found the serial number.

, If there are no identifying marks on the outside of your watch, or if you want to know the model number of the movement that was used in your watch, you will have to take the back case off. The serial number may be located anywhere on the mechanism. Be very careful doing this, as you can damage the watch if you are careless.Be sure to place the watch on a soft cloth as you are working in order to prevent it from getting damaged.
If the watch has a snap back case, you should be able to see a raised lip around the back and bezel of the case. There won't be any hinges or notches. Snap back cases simply snap into place, so you should be able to remove one by prying it up with a dull tool. Don't use anything sharp (like a knife blade) that you might cut yourself with.
Some older watches have swing-back cases, which can be identified by a hinge on the back of the case. These are opened the same way as snap back cases, but the back hinges open instead of coming all the way off. You may even be able to open this type of back with your fingernail.
If the watch has a screw back case, you should see six grooves or notches located somewhere along the perimeter of the metal back. You will need to open the back case using these notches. Screw back cases must be unscrewed before you can lift them away. You will need a special tool known as an adjustable case wrench to open one.
There may also be a second protective cover inside of your watch. This can usually be pried off with a fingernail, but be careful not to damage the mechanism as you are doing this.
If you have any trouble getting the case open, bring the watch to a professional jeweler.

, If you opened the back of your watch to locate a serial number, be sure to put it back together right away.


For snap back watches, locate the small pin on the inner lip of the case and the small hole around the perimeter of the watch. Line up the pin and the hole, then press and click the case back on using your hands.
For screw back cases, place the case over the back of the watch and grab onto the grooves using the case wrench. Rotate the case clockwise until it screws back into place.

, Once you have identified a serial number on your watch, you can try searching for the number online or using an online chart to help you identify when the watch was made. There is no official Bulova chart to reference, but many people have compiled charts based on their own observations of patterns.Some serial numbers are easier to identify than others. For example, watches that were produced before 1926 tend to have serial numbers that start with the numbers 1 or 2, but the exact number does not give any further clues as to its production date.Between 1926 and 1949, the first digit of the serial number was typically used to indicate in which year within a decade the watch was produced. For example, a serial number that starts with 1 could indicate that that watch was produced in 1931 or 1941.

, Once you have identified the age of your watch, you can begin comparing it to the models that Bulova produced during those years. Luckily, there are lots of websites that include complete lists of Bulova models (with pictures) organized by year. Scroll through one of these lists until you find a model that matches your watch.Be aware that there are often some variations within models. For example, Bulova may have offered the same model with different choices for case material, movement, dial, and hands., When comparing your watch to various models, pay the most attention to the shape of the watch's case. Even if there were different options offered for the model, the general shape and lines should be the same.After the shape, pay attention to the dial features, as these are also likely to remain the same, even if different options were offered. Note details like the placement of the hands and the sub-seconds.

, If you find a model that matches your watch, you should be aware that Bulova did sometimes reuse model names. For this reason, the model name alone (without the year) may not be very useful in identifying a watch."

Some will need only a simple click of a button to detach their bracelet from their watch head. Others will need a specialized screwdriver to release the bracelet from the watch head. Consult manufacturer directions for more information about how to remove the watch from the bracelet., Submerge it in a small bowl filled with soapy water or rubbing alcohol. Soaking your watch bracelet in this way will loosen the grit and grime that it has accumulated. The length of time you allow your watch to soak depends on how grimy it is.If it is quite dirty, leave it submerged for a few hours.
If it is not too dirty, leave it submerged for about 30 minutes.
If your watch’s head doesn’t detach from the bracelet, wrap paper towel or plastic wrap around it, and bind it in place with string or a rubber band. Alternately, take your watch to a jeweler for a professional cleaning.

, Dip a soft-bristled toothbrush in rubbing alcohol or soapy water. Remove your bracelet from the liquid and use the toothbrush to gently scrub away discoloration or dirt that has collected within the gaps of the watch band., Some chemical cleaners contain benzene or similar substances that can ruin stainless steel. They might also cause skin irritation, even when they’ve been cleaned off. Therefore, stick to soapy water or rubbing alcohol when cleaning your stainless steel watch., Use a damp cloth to gently wipe away any sticky or yucky spots on the watch head. Wipe both the front and back of the watch head.Do not remove the cover over the watch face. The cover exists to prevent dirt and rust from affecting the watch face.

Press the clasp down.",How to Adjust a Deployment Clasp," Open the deployment clasp as you usually would. The exact method you'll need to use will vary depending on the type of deployment clasp you have.


The deployment clasp must be completely opened and expanded to its longest position. You need to be able to see into the side of the clasp. Make sure that you can see a thin metal prong or pin extending from the top piece to the bottom piece. The two metal pieces are connected on the closed interior side by a small hinge.
Standard deployment clasps and hidden deployment clasps are pried open, but push button and fold-over push button deployment clasps must be opened using the appropriate button.
For more information, please see the Opening and Closing the Deployment Clasp section of this article.;
, Look into the side of the branded section of the clasp. You should be able to identify a hinged flap beneath the top logo. Flip down the flap to open this portion of the clasp.


Grab the branded top with one finger and the unmarked back plate beneath it with your thumb or another strong finger. Hold the branded portion steady while pulling the back plate down and away from it. It should click open without additional work.
If you are unable to open the flap with your fingers, use a penny or similarly small metal coin. Insert the penny in between the branded top and the unmarked flap. Twist the coin to either side. The pressure should force the flap to drop open., Thread the strap of the watch or bracelet in between the branded metal bar and the newly opened flap.


Hold the metal bar between your thumb and index finger with the back plate flap hanging open and down.
Insert the unattached end of the strap through the gap. Continue threading it through until the band has reached your desired length.
Note that the watch will look larger now than it will once the deployment clasp is closed again. Keep that in mind while adjusting the length of the strap. The distance around your wrist will need to equal the sum of the length of both strap ends, the face of the watch, and the length of the closed clasp.

, Close the back plate flap to set and secure the new length of the band.


Close the flap by pressing it back up toward the branded top bar.
As you close the back plate flap, look into the open side of the hinged metal again. Make sure that the prong or pin connecting the flap and the branded metal top is inserted into one of the holes in the strap., Slip the watch over your hand and onto your wrist. Close the deployment clasp as you usually would to keep the watch on.This is the best time to check the fit. The band should be tight enough to stay on your wrist without turning or slipping off your hand, but it should not be tight enough to dig into your skin or cut off any circulation.
If you need to make any adjustments, open the watch as usual and take it off your wrist. Follow the same procedure you just completed to open the adjustment flap, then slide more or less of the band through it to tighten or loosen it. Repeat as needed until you achieve the correct fit.

, The deployment clasp and band have now been adjusted to fit your wrist. You should not need to repeat these adjustments again, and the watch should be ready to wear.


Each time you want to wear the watch or bracelet, open the deployment clasp and expand the band to its widest position. Slip the band over your hand and onto your wrist, then close the clasp.
Note that deployment clasps are designed to preserve the lifespan of leather and similarly fragile bands.

, Pinch the lip of the open clasp end beneath your index finger or in between your index finger and thumb.


To determine which end is the open end, look at the deployment clasp from the side. You should be able to see hinges on one side, and the other side should not have any hinges. The side without hinges should also have a slight lip on it when viewed from the top of the clasp.
The ""open end"" of the clasp is the side without hinges.

, Pull up on the clasp lip with your index finger until the cover snaps open, lifting up and away in the direction of your pull.This type of deployment clasp is held together with pressure, so you only need to apply force to open it up.
Some deployment clasps are stronger than others, so you may need to apply considerable force to open yours. If you cannot lift the clasp cover with your fingers, you may need to insert a small metal coin or flat screwdriver into the space beneath the lip. Use this tool as a lever; press down on the end hanging outside of the clasp, causing the end inside the clasp to lift up and pry open the cover from beneath.

, Open the entire deployment clasp, stretching it out until it reaches its maximum length.


If the band has already been attached at both ends, the band will also expand to its full (adjusted) length. If the band has not been attached at one end, though, you can only open the clasp to its full extended length.
Note that this type of clasp folds out into three hinged parts, creating a “z” shape.

, Slip the band over your hand and wrist, then press the cover back down to close the deployment clasp.


Fold the clasp thirds back up in their natural orientation.
Place your thumb beneath the bottom part of the open clasp end and your index finger over the cover at the open end. Pinch the top and bottom together in between your fingers, continuing until you hear a click. Once the clasp clicks into place, it should be securely closed.

, This style of deployment clasp has a push button on one side of the unhinged edge of the clasp.


Some versions have two buttons—one on either side of the clasp.
The push buttons on these clasps control the opening mechanism. They offer additional security and prevent the clasp from opening on its own.

, Press the button into the side of the clasp. Hold it down as you lift the unhinged edge up and open.


For two-button models, you will need to press both buttons simultaneously.
You can release the buttons as soon as the clasp is open.

, Continue opening the clasp until you have expanded it to its fullest length.


This type of deployment clasp should fold out into three hinged portions, creating a zigzag or “z” shape.
If the band has already been adjusted, place it over your hand and onto your wrist while it is expanded like this.
If the band has not been adjusted, do so now.

, Fold the clasp thirds back up, pushing the top and bottom in between your fingers until you hear a click.


You should not need to use the push buttons to close the clasp.
After clicking into place, the clasp should be closed and secure.

, Look for the latch covering the unhinged portion of the deployment clasp. Pull the latch up and away from the clasp.When folded down, this latch prevents the opening mechanism from engaging. It also prevents the opening of the actual clasp from getting snagged.

, Locate the push button on the side of the deployment clasp. Press it in while simultaneously lifting the clasp up and away from the security latch.


Note that some versions have a button on either side of the clasp. You will need to press both buttons at the same time to open this type of clasp.
You must press these buttons to trigger the opening mechanism. Do not attempt to open the deployment clasp with force alone.

, Open the deployment clasp until it expands out as far as possible.


This type of deployment clasp is also made of three hinged portions arranged in the same zigzag manner as the standard and push button varieties.
If you haven't adjusted the band yet, do so now.
If you have adjusted the band, this is when you should slide it around your wrist.

, Fold up the clasp thirds, stacking them one on top of the other. Squeeze the entire clasp in between your thumb and index finger until you hear it click closed.


You should not need to use the push buttons to close the clasp. Gentle force should be enough.

, Return to the separate latch lying next to the deployment clasp. Push it back toward the clasp, then press it down onto the clasp until you hear a click.


After clicking this latch closed, the opening mechanism should be secured and the entire deployment clasp is considered closed.

, Look for the point at which the two band ends meet. Grab each end near this point and simultaneously pull them away from each other.


The deployment clasp itself is actually located on the inside of the band, so you won't be able to see it from the front.
As you pull the two ends apart, the resulting pressure should be enough to engage the opening mechanism of the clasp and cause it to lift away from the band.
Note that some versions of the hidden deployment clasp also have push buttons on either side of the clasp. For this type, you will need to push both buttons in while simultaneously pulling the joined ends of the band apart.

, Continue opening the band by spreading the separate ends apart as far as they will go. The deployment clasp should expand until it is nearly flat.


This style of deployment clasp differs slightly from the other common types. There are still three separate metal pieces connected by hinges, but instead of opening into a ""z"" shape, the longest of these sections will lift straight up while being supported by the other two sections, forming something closer to an ""n"" shape.
With the clasp expanded, adjust the band or, if previously adjusted, put the band onto your wrist.

, Bring the two band ends back together, holding them as close to each other as possible.


This will draw the deployment clasp near the band, but under most circumstances, it won't actually be enough to close the clasp.

, While holding the band ends together, use your thumb or index finger to push the flattened clasp into the back of the band. Continue pushing until you hear it snap or click into place.


Even if the clasp has push buttons on it, you should not need to use them while closing it.
After clicking the clasp into the back of the band, it should be closed and secured.

""Haileo"" is the simplest way of saying 'hello', but it is very rarely used.,
""Dia duit!"",
""Fáilte romhat"" means welcome.",How to Learn the Irish Language1,";
, is the most traditional way of greeting someone. It's pronounced ""dee a gwitch"". It translates to God be with you, lit. God to you.


If there's just one person say ""Dia duit"" but, for two or more, say ""Dia daoibh"". Duit is singular, daoibh is plural.

Extra marks if you can reply with ""Dia's Muire's Pádraig duit/daoibh"". Pádraig is the Irish for Patrick; St. Patrick is the patron saint of Ireland.
It may be of interest to note the spelling of 'Muire' in this phrase. If your name is Mary, it translates to Maire, not Muire. However the mother of God's name is spelled Muire. This is because in Irish there are reverend and common versions of some names. For example, Uncle John would be (Uncail) Seán but St. John would be (Naomh) Eoin.

Build a trap for a leprechaun.,
Make a trap out of a cylinder.,
Make the trap shiny.,
Put a trinket inside the trap to draw in the leprechaun.,
Spot where the leprechaun has been there.",How to Catch a Leprechaun1," Because they are said to be little people, you could build a trap for a leprechaun out of a shoe box. Either way, choose something small.


Make a trap door in it. Or prop it up with a dowel that you glue to it.In addition to a shoebox, you could use anything small, such as a clean can, a paper towel roll, a bag, a net, or an old shoe. You could also put honey inside the trap so the leprechaun will get stuck inside the trap.
Cut a hole in the top of the shoebox, and cover it with a small piece of felt. You will place your bait on top of the felt. When the leprechaun snatches it, the leprechaun will fall down the hole and into the box.;
, You could use a cookie can or oatmeal cylindrical container instead, cover it in scrapbook paper, and prop a cardboard ladder up the side. If the leprechaun enters this vault, he won’t be able to get out.


Put two holes in either side of the cylinder at the top and put a toothpick or other small stick through each end.
Tape a perfect circle you make out of construction paper to the skewer. This will make a swinging trap door., Since leprechauns are drawn to shiny things, you could wrap the top of the leprechaun trap with tin foil.


You could also paint it gold. Sprinkle it with glitter and other shiny decorations that will appeal to a leprechaun.
Some people paint their leprechaun traps green in honor of the leprechauns' native Ireland. Decorate the trap with Irish symbols the leprechaun will like. Four-leaf clovers and rainbows may attract the leprechaun.

, Since leprechauns are tied to gold, that’s a good choice for bait.


Try an earring. Gold coins are said to make good bait for leprechauns. You can buy gold foil covered chocolate coins at candy stores. As for food and drink, leprechauns like whiskey and dandelion tea. They live in the wild, so they eat nuts and mushrooms.Put the box in a corner and wait for the leprechaun to take the bait. Time your trap right. Folklore holds that leprechauns are very active the night before St. Patrick's Day (March 17).Go looking for secluded spots around the yard. Leprechauns like to use rocky places, caves, holes and other hidden areas to live and make their shoes.

, How do you know if you trap snagged a curious leprechaun?


A trail of green or gold glitter may be spotted leading into and out of the trap. Perhaps a leprechaun would leave a trail of Lucky Charms cereal if you really want to get creative. The leprechaun might turn a nearby cup of milk green with green food coloring or leave tiny footprints around.A leprechaun is no taller than 2 feet (0.6 m) 6 inches (75cm),so his feet are smaller than most human footprints.

Play “Catch the Leprechaun” with a group of kids.,
Make a leprechaun scavenger hunt.",How to Catch a Leprechaun2," Make a boundary in which to play tag. Give 3 to 5 kids a gold coin and a gold sash. Tell them they are the leprechauns. Name the other students “the Shamrocks.” Play tag, and when a leprechaun is tagged, he or she must give up the gold coin.
Whoever gets the most gold coins wins. Play again with new leprechauns to give everyone a chance to win.

, Use the method for creating barefoot leprechaun prints with tempera paint.


Have your children follow the footprints to the next clue. Leave a leprechaun item, like a pipe, small hat, coin, rainbow or shoe at each station.
Place riddles at each station that they have to solve before moving on. Make a pot of gold filled with chocolate coins at the end as the treasure. Leave a note from the leprechaun teasing the kids to catch him next year.

Beware of the tricks leprechauns play.,
Know what leprechauns stand for.,
Figure out how leprechauns operate.",How to Catch a Leprechaun3," Captured leprechauns are said to give you three wishes and a gold coin. Leprechauns are tricksters. There are many Irish fables about people choosing wishes that backfire.For example, there was a man named Seamus from County Mayo who wanted to be the richest man on a tropical island. But he found himself alone on the island and ended up using his third wish to return to Ireland.
Leprechauns will trick you by twisting the mind. They are smart and will try to confuse you into making the wrong wishes. Don’t trust them because they are devious.

, Leprechauns are said to be part of a fairy world made up of little people and who are called the Luacharman. They are known as tiny shoemakers, cobblers for the fairy world. Sometimes they are called the ""wee people.""Leprechauns are connected to gold. It’s believed they watch the golden treasure left by Danish people who invaded Ireland more than 1,000 years ago. So if you catch one, according to legend, the leprechaun will have to tell you where the gold is hidden because he is compelled to tell the truth by fairy law.Look the leprechaun in the eye. According to Irish folklore, fairy law holds that Leprechauns must also be courteous. But if you look away from it, the leprechaun is freed from these rules and likely to vanish.

, This will help you catch them, and figure out what to do with them when you do. For one, leprechauns rarely travel in groups. They are solitary creatures.Leprechauns are male. They are said to be friends of the robin. They like to drink alcohol, which is one reason some leprechauns are evil. But they are generally harmless, if a bit mischievous. There is nothing to fear.
They are old-fashioned and a bit shabby. They don't like conformity so if you catch one it will probably have something like a green jacket and red pants. They wear tall hats and have shoes with big buckles on them.

It’s located in a meadow named the Glen of Cloongallon.A large 600-year-old oak tree grows in this meadow and legend holds that leprechauns saved the oak from the English Tudors.
You can see this grove online, where a fairy watch webcam is trained on it at all times., Leprechauns are known to burrow underground in a secret network of caves throughout Ireland.


They love music and might be heard playing the fiddle or the Irish harp, especially at night.
The other sound they make is a ""tap, tap"" sound that occurs when they are working on shoes.

, Some people believe you won't find leprechauns in America. They are Irish (so, of course they have an Irish accent!)


Leinster leprechauns like honey and aren't dressed too flamboyantly. The Ulster leprechauns are poets and healers. They wear pointed shoes. The Munster leprechaun has legendary drinking habits.
The Meath leprechaun is known for his diplomacy.He is also known for his chattiness.The Connaught leprechaun is serious and industrious. They are the most secretive.

Think about what bottoms to wear.,
Pair your bottoms with an appropriate top.,
Wear a dress.,
Add a blazer.,
Slip on appropriate shoes.",How to Dress Smart Casual (Females)1," For a smart casual outfit, you must balance flairs of professionalism and fashion.Consider wearing bottoms that are comfortable but sharp looking; they need to be able to pull through a professional yet casual look. For example, a nice pair of slacks, darker-colored conservative skirts, and even a dark wash pair of jeans can all be appropriate bottoms for a smart casual outfit.Most times, your bottoms can act as a base from which you create your ensemble outfit.


Your bottoms can absolutely incorporate a pop of color.You could wear something like a brown or dark green skirt, navy blue slacks, or a dark, indigo wash pair of jeans.If you decide to wear a skirt, it must be a business appropriate length (at least to the top of your knees).
However, keep in mind that if your bottoms include color and are more fashionable, you should try to balance your outfit with a milder, yet chic top.;
, Since smart casual is all about balancing, your top must equalize your outfit. If your bottoms are dressier, your top can be more casual (ruffles, color, accents, prints, etc.). If your bottoms are more casual, dress up your outfit by sporting a sleeker, more professional top.


A professional top would be a button-down shirt, a dressy blouse, or a collared top.Again, your top can incorporate color, it just has to stabilize out your outfit. If your bottoms are a muted color, opt for a colored shirt.If your bottoms are the outfit piece adding color, wear a more neutral top.

, Wearing a dress is a safe choice if you are trying to dress smart casual. A dress immediately elevates the “dressiness” of your outfit, but the print or material of the dress can add a needed casual element.No matter what kind of dress you choose to wear, the hem of the dress should reach at least the top of your knees.If you have a professional looking dress (conservative length, darker color), you can dress it down by pairing it with casual accessories like a colored scarf or simple, yet stylish jewelry.Vice versa, if you have a more casual dress, you can spruce up the look by pairing it with stylish and conservative heels and simple, clean cut jewelry.
When wearing a dress for a smart casual outfit, choose to keep it simple. When in doubt, you rather your outfit come off as more dressy than casual., A blazer is a great outfit piece that can add a professional tone to your outfit, but still keep it casual when paired with a softer top.If you’re considering wearing a blazer, make sure it has a fitted cut. This tailored piece can make your outfit look a bit more put together, while your other clothing items channel the more casual side of your ensemble.


A plain black or navy blue blazer can incorporate a more professional feel, while a colored blazer can add in a pop of color as an accent piece., For a smart casual outfit, consider finishing your ensemble with a comfortable pair of dress shoes. Heels work great, and close-toed pumps are always a safe choice to complete your look.Flats can also be an option if you want to go for a more casual look.


You can make your outfit stand out while maintaining a casual look by having your flats be a main fashion statement. They can be colored or patterned, but it must balance out your outfit of mainly neutral, composed pieces.Wedges and some opened toed shoes can also work for a smart casual outfit if you are attending a more casual event. However, if you are dressing for work, stay away from these options.Avoid wearing sandals with a smart casual outfit; sandals are plain casual.

"
"
Wear suitable jewelry.,
Wear a belt.,
Sport a watch.,
Carry a purse.,
Consider wearing a scarf.",How to Dress Smart Casual (Females)2," Accessories are often the outfit pieces that can firmly establish the feel of your ensemble. They can dramatically push an outfit toward being more “smart,” or more casual.For example, statement necklaces are usually go-to pieces of jewelry that can liven up and dress up a plainer outfit.They can include color and act as an accent to an otherwise muted outfit.


This same principle goes for earrings. You still want your earrings to be simple, but they can add some flair and elevate to your outfit.
If your outfit is already a bit varied with colors and prints, consider toning down to jewelry to balance your look out., Accessorizing your outfit with a belt can add a pop of color to your look, function as a statement piece, or add a bit of texture to your outfit. For example, if your outfit consists of mostly matte fabrics, you can wear a patterned or patent belt to make your ensemble a bit more interesting and add a little variety.Depending on what kind of belt you use, incorporating one into your outfit can make your look more fun and fashionable (if the belt is colored), or more put together and smart (if the belt is more modest).


Thin belts tend to look really nice with dresses, and wide belts can pair well with longer skirts., Wearing a watch may bleed over into jewelry territory, but it can be a separate accessory in it’s own right. Try to pick a watch that is simple, yet can make a statement. For example, a watch with a slightly bigger face, but a simple band can make a great accessory addition. Or, if your watch is going to have a bit more color in the band, make sure the face of the watch isn’t so big and bold.


Another thing to consider is the material of the watch. Your watch should be some sort of metal (silver, gold, platinum), but the metal color should go with the other metal pieces in your outfit.
For example, if your shoes and purse have gold detailing, avoid wearing a silver colored watch.

, A colorful or unique purse can act as a statement piece to a calmer, more conservative outfit. Conversely, a stylish and simple bag can elevate a more casual outfit. Your purse does not have to match your outfit, but if you already have a color piece in your ensemble (top, blazer, shoes, etc.), you might want to keep your purse color on the more reserved side.


Any purse that you use should be sleek and fashionable, no matter which way your outfit is leaning toward. For example, if you purse if smaller, it could be a bit more playful and flashy when paired with a casual outfit. If your purse is bigger, keep it simple and modest when paired with a more colorful outfit., A scarf can serve as a simple accessory that can add a little variety to your outfit.You don’t want the scarf to overpower your outfit, but enhance it in a small way. A scarf can always add a bit of color to your outfit, while sometimes lending a more fashionable feel, depending on the print and fabric.


If your outfit consists of mainly dark colors, consider pairing it with a graphic scarf."
"
Wear your favorite print or color.,
Soften your look with a sweater.,
Renovate your work basics.,
Always wear at least one statement piece.",How to Dress Smart Casual (Females)3," For business suits, the classic attire can be rather boring. Consider switching up your business look by wearing a blouse that is your favorite print of color. Adding in this variety can keep your outfit looking appropriate and smart, while also letting your personal fashion sense shine through., Blazers are a great way to embellish a smart casual outfit, but if you want to go for a softer look, consider wearing a colorful cardigan or wrap sweater.The color of the cardigan can be a statement color, or it can be an accent color to an otherwise muted-toned outfit.


If you are always chilly, a turtleneck is also a viable option for a smart casual sweater look.

, In many business settings, pantsuits are a norm. Switch up the norm by updating your normal pantsuits for ones with slimmer silhouettes. Slimmer silhouettes can flatter your figure while staying modest, and you can mix and match your pantsuit combinations., Dressing stylish everyday might be exhausting, but when in doubt (and running low on work appropriate outfits) always wear at least one statement piece.That means, if your dress is going to be pretty boring for the day, make sure your shoes, or you necklace, or your belt is making a fashion statement.


Your statement piece could be colorful, or printed, or embellished. This is the easiest way to make sure your outfit is incorporating the “smart” part of smart casual.

Make sure everything you wear fits well, and has clean lines.,
Wear nice shoes.,
Change your dress for the evening.,
Wear classic colors.,
Dress appropriately for the Vatican.",How to Dress in Italy1," Italians love a classy look that emphasizes a persons good points.


Capri pants are a good choice for women; Italians may wear shorts only at resorts. Men rarely wear very short shorts outside of vacation.
If you’re wearing a suit, put on a tie with it. You should probably skip the track suit or sweat pants. It’s going to look too informal for Italy. Pack business casual clothing for your vacation, something you’d be willing to wear to work.Avoid baggy clothes. Italians are partial to clothing that is nicely fitted. So skip the slouchy shirt or baggy jeans. Italians do wear jeans though, but they would pair them with a dressy top.;
, Italians study shoes, and they like a classy she without too much fake bling. Leave the flip flops, gaudy sandals, and Crocs at home.Choose a high quality fabric or leather in your shoes. Make sure that your shoes are in good shape. Get them shined! Pay attention to comfort, too, though, if you’re going to be walking long distances to see the sites.
Italians will recognize and appreciate designer labels in shoes as well as clothing. This doesn't mean, however, you have to wear designer clothing to look good in Italy. As long as your clothes are classy and clean you should be ok. Tennis shoes and cheap flip flops are not considered nice shoes and will mark you as a tourist. If your a female, think of simple ballet style shoes or a nice classy boot or runner (such as PUMA). You can’t go wrong, though, with nice leather shoes.Wear high heels at night when dining out if you’re female. There are some restaurants that won’t let you in if you’re wearing flat shoes. Wedge shoes will be easier to walk in than stilettos. If you’re not in a city, though, you might want to forgo the heels because you could encounter cobblestone streets.

, Italians dress differently for the time of day. You’ll want to consider changing your dress when day turns to night. Try to bring a pair of long pants with lighter fabric for hotter months.


It would be unusual for Italian men to wear shorts in the evening. It’s considered more elegant to not wear shirts that have collar buttons or breast pockets. If you’re going out to dinner or are in a fine hotel, you should dress in a more sophisticated fashion. For example, you might not want to walk around in a tank top, shorts, and flip flops.
If you wear jeans, dress them up with a nice jacket. Make sure they fit you well and are stylish, not frumpy and tattered. A dress and a skirt are a must when packing.
Men should avoid wearing short-sleeved shirts to formal occasions and should not wear a tie with them at any time of the day or night

, You will occasionally see Italians wearing bright, bold colours, but they do it only sometimes and are more partial to the elegance of classic colours than loud prints.


Stick with colours like dark blue, black, cream, white and tans. You could wear some pastels, such as lavender or a salmon colour In the summer.
You can wear white, cream or light tan colors any time of the year in Italy. Brighter and lighter colors are very common in spring. Italians love to wear light colors in the sun because they don’t attract the heat as much, and it can get very hot.
You might want to avoid the most garish or unnatural colors, such as mustard yellow, neon green or lipstick pink.

, Many people who visit Italy want to see the Vatican. There are specific rules for dressing on a Vatican visit The same rules generally apply to any church or cathedral visit.


Vatican City is the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. You should avoid wearing tank tops or other clothing that exposes the shoulders when entering the Vatican or a church.
Try not to wear anything that is too revealing as that can be interpreted as a sign of disrespect. Wearing mini-skirts or short shorts would be frowned on in the Vatican. The South is more conservative and a scarf or shawl might be required there.
If it’s hot outside and you’re wearing something sleeveless, you could purchase a shawl to drape over your shoulders. Problem solved. Men should not wear tank tops or expose their arms in church.

Take a look at your body, as tough as this may be if you don't like what you see.,
Look at your age.,
Get the right clothes for you.,
Do your hair.,
Do not wear so much makeup you aren't comfortable.,
Think details!",How to Dress Like a Girl (Transgender)," What features do you consider to be feminine? Have you got great calves, a nice neck, slim wrists? What body parts are you less happy with? You may like to dress in a way that brings out the feminine parts, such as three quarter length sleeve tops, and hides the masculine, perhaps avoiding shoulder pads.;
, Are you young enough still to dress as a girl? How to dress age appropriately is an issue for many people. Would you rather be taken for a boy, or an older woman? Stereo typically, young girls wear pink, sparkles and frills. You can wear these, you can not wear these items. Wearing very feminine clothes before your body is the female form you should of been born with can, in some people's eyes, mark you out as trying too hard, attention seeking and fake. If you have the strength of character to cope with that, Hello Kitty Tee shirts, tu-tus and tiaras or whatever else you like it is! Good on you. If you want people who are less open to the idea that not everyone's identity fits with the body they were born with, try less overtly girly clothes. Think of cut, shape and style. You can wear boys clothes and still look like a girl too if you are lucky enough to be very pretty.

, Shop in the female sections, obviously. Look at clothes aimed at your age group to see what is perceived as socially acceptable. If you don't find things you like, look at clothes for those a little older, or a little younger, if you can fit them. For example, you may be shorter, as a trans girls of 12, than other girls, having not had your growth spurt yet. Use this to your advantage. Boys usually wear baggy tops, pants or trousers and have, often, a slouchier style. You may want things to be a little tighter than boys would normally wear. Don't wear things too tight across your butt, shoulders or chest if that makes you uncomfortable. An apparent good and safe option is skinny jeans, pretty tops and hoodies.


Many people make the mistake of buying very trashy and tight dresses which makes it very obvious that they are trying to be very feminine and sexy. Dress like this if you wish, it's not a crime. Remember though, if you want an easy life, dress like typical girls and women who generally wear comfortable, nice, conservative looking clothing.

, They say a women's hair is her crowning glory. Your hair has nothing to do with how you dress as a girl, so this step is simple. Let your hair grow, have it mid length, cut it short, get a wig, wear a hat, do what you like. Long hair isn't always feminine, short hair isn't always masculine. There are lots of short styles boys don't generally have, like a pixie cut, and there are long styles boys do have, like mullets. So make you hair look good with your outfit and you are set.

, Wear just a little mascara, eyeliner and lip gloss if you like, go without if you prefer or go all out. It is up to you. Many girls wear minimal make-up, it's a socially acceptable 'norm'. Some people wear too much, making themselves look over the top. No amount of make up is right or wrong for anyone.

, Put on some pretty earrings, cute shoes, have a nice hand bag or purse, use some nail polish in a shade you like, carry a store carrier bag from a girls clothing store (even if you haven't shopped there for months!) etc. There are lots of little, under stated things you can do to look more girl and less boy without looking like you are in fancy dress or feeling vulnerable to bullying or public humiliation. Have a girls watch, wear a floral perfume, wear ladies sunglasses, just on top of your head if you like! People do judge by appearance and the nicest people can make a thoughtless mistake if they are unsure so, whilst you shouldn't have to, it's often easier to give little hints that you are a girl, not a boy."

Don't wear socks with sandals.,
Avoid the most common tourist looks.,
Dress differently based on geography.",How to Dress in Italy2," Italians rarely wear socks with sandals or white socks beneath trousers. On the other hand, they typically wear socks with closed shoes. They always match the colour of the sock to the colour of the shoe.


When Italians do wear socks, it’s often very short socks not knee length or calf length socks. These socks are sometimes called “fantasmi,” which means invisible.

, This is especially important if you’re in a big city where safety could be an issue. Advertising that you are a tourist could make you a target.The best way to look like a tourist fast? Wear a fanny pack or money belt. This just advertises that you’re walking around with money.
Lugging around a backpack can also get you pegged as a tourist. You will want to carefully store important documents, and credit cards, in an inside pocket or front pocket so someone doesn’t pick your pocket.
T-shirts, tennis shoes, and any shirt or sweatshirt with a slogan on it will probably make you look like a tourist. Slouchy and scuffed is out; fitted and impeccable is in. Nice fabrics go a long way.

, Italian fashion sense varies depending on what portion of the country you’re in. It’s a mistake to think there’s just one way to dress in Italy.


The main geographic differences can be found between the south and the north of Italy. Remember that Milan is in the north, and it’s a sophisticated city that is a major hub of the global fashion industry. The style there would be sophisticated and reliant on designer name brands.In the south, such as in Rome, there would be more adherence to local traditions and trends that are not as contingent on the fashion industry. Dress more formally if you’re visiting a big city instead of a rural country town.
Another difference to consider is that the north gets pretty cold in the winter, although it’s warm during the summer months, whereas the south is pretty warm all year round.
In the summer, it can reach temperatures of 35 degrees Celsius in Rome. That's in the 90s in Fahrenheit. It can be difficult to predict the spring weather, which can seesaw between chilly to warm, ranging from 15 to 28 degrees Celsius (59 to 82 degrees Fahrenheit), with temperatures down to 10 degrees Celsius at night. Watch the forecasts.

"
Wear sunglasses.,
Bring a jacket or sweater.,
Wear a scarf and carry a great handbag.",How to Dress in Italy3," One thing you will notice right away when traveling in Italy is the sun is very piercing and seems very close.


It’s important that you wear sunglasses. This is even truer in the South of Italy and in the summer months, where you will find it very bright during the day.
During the spring and summer, you should also pack sunscreen to protect your skin, especially if you burn easily.
A straw hat with a brim is a great way to protect your skin and eyes and also look chic to Italians, whether you’re dressed for a formal or informal occasion.

, You may need these items when dressing at night, when it can get colder and also when dining in a nice restaurant. Men should pack a nicely tailored jacket.A great look in Italy would be a white shirt, black or navy blue blazer, and skinny black pants with nice shoes and a silk scarf. And sunglasses.A light trench coat is often a perfect choice for unexpected weather changes. In the winter, you’ll need a warmer coat in the north, such as a padded winter coat, and you will probably need warm gloves, a scarf and a hat. A down jacket or vest may mark you as a tourist.
A pair of leather boots can also be elegant looking and keep your feet warm during colder months. They’re also comfortable to walk in.

, These two items will go a long way to getting rid of the tourist feel and upping your elegance and class appeal.


Accessorize the look. One item you can’t go wrong with in Italy is a silk scarf. Italians often wear jewelry. and Italian women usually wear natural-looking makeup, but don’t wear anything too obvious if safety is a concern.
Take along a great handbag and an umbrella! Remember that Italians value clothing with elegant fabrics and clean lines, so avoid the messy patterns.Men could carry a messenger bag. This is sometimes called a “man purse” in America or a briefcase. Women groom their nails and eyebrows.

Colours .,
Body shape.,
Quality.,
You’ll feel better in quality clothes.,
Dress appropriately .,
Fashion.,
Last but not least experiment, if you’re short of cash try second hand shops or clothes swap with friends.",How to Dress Oneself and Look Good," The colours you wear should compliment your skin tone, hair colour and eye colour. Don’t be afraid to break out of the black and go for something colourful. Just make sure the colours are flattering. There are lots of books and web sites that will help you choose the right colours for example darker people can wear louder colours whereas paler skins often look better with more subtle colours. If you can afford have a professional do your colour palette. Your local college might run a course or get a group of friends together and share some of the cost. The investment will pay for itself in time because things in your wardrobe match up better and you’re less prone to making expensive mistakes.;
, Clothes can either flatter your shape or draw attention to your flaws. Some body shapes look good in flowing garments, while others look good in fitted or tailored garments. Again a professional opinion is the best. Some shops offer free personal shopper services for a minimum purchase. Ask the store if the staff are trained to give advice on body shape. The shape of your face is also important in deciding the type of neckline or collar to wear. Again there are books and web articles on the subject.

, Shop for quality, fewer quality items are better than a wardrobe stuffed with tops that are falling apart at the seams, faded or quickly lose their shape. Think about which is best spending £40 on a top that will be good for 40 wears or £8 on a top that starts coming apart after 3 washes.

, People sense you’re wearing good clothing, and treat you better - try it see what happens.

, It’s obvious that a tailored suit is great for work but there are subtler ways you can dress inappropriately. You won’t be taken too seriously in yellow and navy blue on a first date will give the impression you’re not interested in having any fun. (No I don’t mean the physical kind). Likewise showing too much skin on a first date may mean you do want to have fun of the physical kind.

, Like it or not people treat you differently if you’re dressed fashionably, not catwalk stuff but just reflections of the current trends. Think about the first impressions you have someone. Note it down and then look at the clothes they are wearing.

, Dressing can be a lot of fun and a great way of expressing yourself. You never know the next great outfit could change your life for the better.

Plan on layering your clothes.,
Wear shirts that can be layered.,
Choose appropriate outerwear.,
Wear long pants and skirts.,
Wear boots and sneakers.,
Gather some warm weather accessories.",How to Dress for Fall1," Temperatures fluctuate greatly during the fall. Mornings will be chilly, afternoons will be hot, and evenings will be cool again. If you are at work or at school all day long, you may not have the time to change your clothes. The best way to manage this is by wearing layers, which you can take off as the day grows warmer.;
, If you live in a place that gets cooler weather during fall, consider wearing some short-sleeved or long-sleeved shirts; these can be worn under cardigans, or over lacy tank tops. You may also wear turtlenecks and button-up shirts and blouses. If you live in a place that gets warmer weather, you can wear tank tops and short-sleeved shirts. Here are some more ideas:


Wear a lacy tank top under a long-sleeved shirt with a scooped neckline. The lace will peep out from under the neckline, giving you a feminine look while keeping you warm.
Wear a plaid, button-up shirt over a white tank top or short-sleeved shirt. For a classic fall look, pair this with some jeans and work boots.
Consider layering jumpers or knitted dresses over a long-sleeved shirt and some tights or leggings.

, The mornings and evenings during fall are usually cold, while the afternoons are warm. Because of this, you want to wear something over your shirt that can be easily taken off. Here are some suggestions:


If you live in a place that is relatively warm during the fall, wear light coats, cardigans, and sweaters. Avoid anything too thick or warm.
If you live in a place that is cold and wet during the fall, consider wearing a jacket or a long trench coat. You can also wear heavier coats, cardigans, and sweaters.
Hoodies are great for all sorts of weather; they can also be easily tied around your waist when it gets too warm.

, If you really want to wear shorter skirts or shorts, consider layering them with dark-colored leggings or tights for a chic, fashionable look. Long jeans and dark-colored slacks are perfect for fall. Here are some more ideas:


If you wear skinny jeans, you can tuck them into a pair of boots.
Pair a wool or tweed skirt with a pair of dark, solid-colored tights or leggings.

, Fall is the time to put away your wedges, pumps, sandals, and flip flops. Instead, wear close-toed shoes, sneakers, and boots. Here are some ideas:


Got cozy and comfortable with a pair of Uggs or other fur-lined bulky boots.
For cool, damp falls, opt for a pair of Doc Martens or other combat, military, or work boots.
If you live in a place that gets warmer weather during fall, you can wear canvas shoes, such as Chuck Taylors, Toms, or Vans.
You can also wear some fashionable riding boots, knee-high boots, or calf-length boots.

, Accessories such as scarves, hats, and gloves not only keep you warm, but they are also easy to put away for when the day gets warm. Here are some ideas:


For hats, try a newsboy cap, or hats made from felt or tweed.
For scarves, try something made from flannel with a solid or plaid pattern. Avoid wearing wool or knitted scarves, unless you live in a cooler climate.
Gloves are the most versatile. Consider wearing some suede or leather gloves. If you live in a warmer climate, try on a pair of finger-less gloves.

Get yourself stylish horn rimmed glasses... as simple as that!,
Long sleeved and ¾ sleeved t-shirts are good on their own or for layering under a short-sleeved t-shirt.,
Add long-sleeved Shirts.,
Hooded zip-up sweaters should be a staple for very casual geek chic.,
Jumpers are a typical choice for this style.,
Cardigans are a modern, fashionable option.,

Other bottoms- If you want to go for a more obviously geeky look, then consider the options available in place of jeans.,
Converse trainers are a key choice.,
There are lots of varieties to go with this look.,
Accessories are a chance for you to be creative and individual.,
Lastly, get some geeky badges featuring anime/manga, cartoons, maths equations, etc.,
Where would geek chic be without suits?",How to Dress Geek Chic (Men)," Any color, preferably featuring a print relevant to geek/nerd culture. Comic book characters and symbols, science maths and computer jokes/references, science fiction & fantasy cartoons, movies, television series and games, anime/manga, video games. Plain t-shirts are good for layering. Try a plain bold colour like purple over a striped long-sleeve, and plain white t-shirts if you prefer to wear these under dress shirts.;
, Oversized glasses will be better, but make sure that they fit!

, These can be a variety of colours, using a stripe pattern is a good choice. Try not to think too much about colour-coordinating them with a t-shirt, as the aim of this look is to mismatch your clothes.


Polo t-shirts will go over a long-sleeved t-shirt or under a cardigan. Again, go for striped patterns. It's crucial that you make sure these tops fit you well, so look at modern fitted options. A baggy polo top will look geek, not geek chic.
Buttoned t-shirts. It's worth it to get a small amount of baseball-neck t-shirts to layer under a cardigan, as this will add some more variety and add a fashionable edge. Otherwise, buy V-neck t-shirts in stripe patterns for a modern flattering look.







, For long-sleeved shirts, get a variety of plain bold colours. Red, yellow, turquoise, etc. You can also get a few striped or unusual patterned ones. Have a look around vintage and thrift stores. For short-sleeved shirts you can be more creative. There are lots of different patterns to look at, checked being the most obvious choice for geek chic. Look at others, such as paisley designs, or repeated images. These are a good choice, because they are light, work well with all kinds of layering (a key to geek chic), and will instantly be recognised as a geeky sign.

, Any colour is good, go for ones with patterns, geometric, striped, a variety is good. These are a back-to-basics choice for layering over a t-shirt is you get cold. Use jumpers and cardigans for wearing over a shirt however. Its worth getting some toned-down pull-over hoodies as well for colder weather.

, Get quite a few so you have lots of matching options. Use v-neck plain sweaters for use over checked shirts, and sweater-vests for your patterned long and short-sleeved shirts. Argyle and stripes are the best choices for sweater-vests. Sweat jumpers can be used in small amounts, but striped ones are a very good choice. Black and white stripes, black and red, blue and green, etc. Argyle sweaters paired with coloured skinny jeans will present a classic geek look. Basically, sweaters of all kinds are the staple top for this look, so get many with lots of variety.

, Not so much in fashion any more and given bad reviews by many females, they are great for geek chic! Remember, the look is designed to look bookish, but cute and fashionably edgy. The best choice are simple, fitted, plain cardigans. Get a variety of colours. They are great for layering over anything, but good options are pairing them with plain bold shirts, polo’s and baseball t-shirts.

, When wearing with geek chic, skinny and slim fits are the best. Achieving a slim lower silhouette is a corner-stone of the look. For regular fitted jeans go for shades of brown and grey as well as basic blue and black. Red slim jeans are a core choice too. For skinny jeans, you can get regular skinny or stretch. Larger wearers should stay with regular skinny. Black skinny jeans will look flattering on anyone who isn’t massively overweight (if you are, then stay away from skinny jeans altogether, but getting slim jeans in your appropriate waist size will look very good). Apart from black, go for colours. Bright blue, red, purple, etc. Have a look around retro stores (online and offline) there are lots of neat alternative choices such as purple checked, burgundy, turquoise. Unusual jean colours of any cut are good for this look.

, Corduroy trousers have long been a nerd stereotype and should be incorporated into your look. Get green, olive, khaki, grey, but have a look for fashionable high-street stores selling skinny and fitted pairs. Look at chino and casual trousers, in browns or dark colours like burgundy and indigo. Apart from plain casual trousers, you should look at checked/plaid designs for the ultimate geek trouser option.

, There are lots of colour options and they go with casual and smart clothes. For a smarter choice, go with brogues in brown or tan. Apart from these, Vans are a great shoe brand to browse. There slip on pairs in checked patterns are a brilliant choice because they come in lots of colour combinations. Other than slip-ons look at their skate shoes and trainers. Wearing a pair of modern brown plimsolls with casual trousers and layered t-shirts are a great look.

, Check out bomber jackets, both leather and regular. Hooded wool jackets and heavyweight hoodies, nylon baseball jackets, macs/cropped trench coats. You can choose any colour you want, but try matching them with your shirts. A good option are zip-up track jackets. They are slimming, come in a variety of colours, and the lack of hood means they can look good with shirts. Apart from all of these, military-style bomber jackets are the best option. Light, look good and go great with t-shirts and hoodies, you should look at these. Brown, sand, plum, lots of colours and choices so choose one you like.

, The most obvious one is, of course, glasses. If you don’t need them, you can get 0 strength lens. Stay away from rounded wire frames, instead go for black framed, horn-rimmed and thick coloured arms. Look at modern options, and pick an attractive pair. For belts, its good to get black and brown for conservative options, but get ones that are snap-buckles, so you can get some interesting, geeky buckles (super-hero emblems, video game icons, etc.) to wear. Thick white belts are good to pair with a ‘poindexter’ look. Look at printed belts too, Pac-man, Mario, national flags, the varieties are near limitless. Buy a watch! All geeks have watches because time is very important. When buying a bag, go for a shoulder-strap messenger bag. Brown or green, or try one with an image printed on it. Want something a little more unusual? Try getting a character-shaped backpack. Nothing screams geek chic than a Yoda shaped backpack.

, Pin one to your cardigan, and bag straps.

, Pinstriped suits in light blues and browns are the best, especially with converse trainers (so Doctor Who). Essentially, brown is the colour of choice. A three-piece brown suit with a skinny coloured tie is good, but try plaid sports coats as well. Wear a ‘sandwich’ layer between coat and shirt, such as sweater vests, jumpers, cardigans, waistcoats/vests. For shoes, wear converse, but if true formality is required, wear brogues, loafers and Chelsea boots.

Wear cool outfits for spring and summer weddings.,
Wear warmer outfits for fall and winter weddings.,
Plan for inclement weather.",How to Dress for an Outdoor Wedding1," Selecting an outfit that you won't sweat through is key. However, be sure to keep your choice classy and suitable for the occasion.You can often wear sleeveless, strapless, and halter wedding dresses for an outdoor summer wedding, and may choose to wear a matching jacket at night when the sun goes down.You should, on the other hand, feel appropriately formal in dress pants and a button-down shirt with a suit jacket over it. Dress shoes that can be comfortably danced in are a must. Opt for a tuxedo if the wedding is very formal, or if you are a member of the wedding party.;
, A long-sleeved dress or a suit made of warmer material may be more appropriate for a wedding during a cooler part of the year. If you plan on dancing, perhaps you can wear a jacket, sweater, or shawl that you can then take off while you dance. Go for comfort over style, as the more comfortable you are, the more confident you will appear., If there is a chance of rain, for instance, you will want to be prepared with a rain jacket and umbrella. Wear shoes that are waterproof, and bring a secure bag to stow any extra things that you may need, such as deodorant or makeup. If wearing a dress, be sure that it won't drag on the ground in order to prevent it from getting dirty."

Remember the key to this effect is drawing attention to the face.,
Remember executive style is commanding style, not fashion style.",How to Dress in Executive Style," A good suit consists of a tailored jacket worn with matching trousers for men and a matching skirt or dress pants for women. However, the style, quality, fabric and fit of the suit are equally important. Before you buy, check the suit for quality, tailoring and details. The best suit fabric is fine wool; the texture smooth; the design lines sharp. There are no puckers or pulling. Seams and stitching should be properly finished; and buttons are sewn on securely. Fit is imperative – have it altered or leave it behind.;
, Executive accessories are high in quality, simple in design and classic in personality. For women, this would include jewellery- in small to medium sizes, quality metals and minimal details – scarves and belts refined in fabric and style. Men’s ties are of quality silk, with a plain or traditional pattern. The belt with a small buckle, must match the shoes, be simple in design, smooth in texture with a small buckle. When choosing your metals, always go for the gold… or platinum.

, Shoes that shine classic is the key to any executive look. For women, classic means pumps ¬– in quality leather – preferably black. Classic oxfords are the only choice for men – With thin soles, smooth leather and black or cordovan in colour.

, Hosiery When wearing a skirt, women’s hosiery must be nude and sheer. Men’s dress socks should be of fine quality, long in length and toned to match the trousers.

, Dark / light contrast, worn close to the face, commands attention; a splash of colour in the form of a tie holds attention.

, Use these tips to create a classic executive style and out-dress your competition.

Choose the right colors.,
Choose the right patterns.,
Choose the right fabrics.",How to Dress for Fall2," The weather starts to cool down during the fall, so you should wear darker, more neutral colors. Avoid bright and light colors such as whites, pastels, and neons. The colors that are most suitable for fall are:


Dark colors, such as burgundies, navies, and plums.
Neutral colors such as browns, grays, and blacks.
Earth tones, such as browns, tans, beiges, forest greens, dark greens, and olive greens.
Warm colors based on the fall leaves, such as creams, gold, bronze, dark reds, and dark oranges.

, There are certain patterns that are more associated with fall than others. Fabrics with bright, cheerful tropical flowers (such as hibiscus) will remind people more of summer or spring, and may look out of place on a cool, rainy, fall day. Plaid and houndstooth are perfect for fall, however; they are more somber and reserved, which blends well with the cool weather.


Consider wearing dark florals instead. An example of dark florals is anything with a black, navy, plum, or burgundy background. Flowers that work well with fall include roses, thistle, and pansies.

, You want something that can keep you warm. Avoid linens, silks, and light cottons. Not only are they too light for fall, but they are also often associated with warmer weather. The fabrics that are the most suitable for fall are:


Leather, suede, and pleather or imitation leather
Flannel, felt, and wool
Denim, corduroy, and chambray
Cotton
Lace

Try wearing boots with jeans.,
Layer skirts and dresses over leggings and tights.,
Bring out the outerwear.,
Layer your shirts.,
Mix and match.",How to Dress for Fall3," Both will help keep you warm as the weather starts to grow colder. Keep in mind, however, that skinny jeans look best tucked into a pair of jeans, while boot cut jeans look better when placed over the boots. Here are some more ideas:


Pair skinny jeans with some black or brown knee-high riding boots. A white shirt worn under a plaid button-up shirt will complete the outfit.
Wear some boot cut jeans over a pair of work boots; avoid tucking them into the boots, or you will create too much bulk. Pair this with a long-sleeved, scoop-necked shirt.

, If you can't part with your skirts and dresses for a season, then wear them with a pair of dark-colored tights or leggings and a pair of boots for a quick, chic look.

, Just because fall brings cooler weather does not mean that you have to put your favorite tank top of short-sleeved shirt away. You can still keep warm while wearing your favorite shirt by pairing it with a chic, fitted suit jacket or light cardigan. You can also pair it with a light-weight sweat or hoodie. Here are some more ideas:


Cardigans come in both short and long lengths. Consider wearing a long cardigan un-buttoned, and securing it around your waist with a wide belt. A pair of skinny jeans and tall boots will complete the look.
Try a tweed or corduroy jacket. The textures will add some contrast to your outfit.
If you live in a cooler area, keep warm by wearing longer coats or a trench coat. If you live in a warmer area, then try to find a jacket without a lining.

, You can keep warm on cool mornings with a tank top worn under a long-sleeved shirt or cardigan. As the day grows warmer, you can take the cardigan or outer shirt off. Here are some more ideas:


Wear a lacy shirt over a similar-colored tank top.

Pair a button-up shirt with a knit shirt. You can wear a tank top, short-sleeved shirt, or long-sleeved shirt depending on how warm or cool it is in your area. The layering will keep you warm in the morning, and you can take the button-up shirt off when it gets warmer.

, Fall is all about contrast: summer turning into winter, life turning to death, and warm turning to cold. Consider pairing solids with patterns, lights with darks, and mixing textures. Here are some ideas to get you started:


Try pairing leather and lace. The two textures work well together because they are so different.
Another way to mix and match textures is by wearing knit boot cuffs with some leather boots or solid-colored leggings.
Wear a a dark-colored shirt under a light-colored sweater.
Mix and match patterns, such as a red plaid button-up shirt with a white undershirt, or a dark-floral skirt with a black, lacy shirt.
Pair a flowing, boho blouse with some skinny jeans and boots. Secure the blouse around your waist with a colorful silk scarf or a wide, leather belt.

Check the wedding invitation for details.,
Research the venue beforehand.,
Consider the wedding time.",How to Dress for an Outdoor Wedding2," An outdoor beach or garden wedding has a more relaxed atmosphere and thus clothing may be less formal. If you are at all unsure about the dress code, ask one of the guests or the hosts. The last thing you want is to show up in inappropriate attire.


A beach wedding is likely going to be windy and humid, so you will want your attire to endure those conditions. Consider avoiding a short dress that could become revealing in a strong wind, and wear a lightweight shirt under a suit jacket in order to reduce sweating. Pack deodorant in a bag, just to be safe.

, Outdoor weddings at prestigious wedding venues often require formal attire. Determine how upscale the venue is and how their clientele typically dresses.A wedding at a vineyard would require far dressier clothes than a backyard wedding. If you have any doubts, ask your hosts for their honest advice on appropriate apparel.

, Night weddings often call for more formal attire than day weddings. Determine your look by checking the time of the event. Also look for key words, such as ""black tie,"" which indicates formal attire.A nighttime wedding might get chilly, so bring along a sweater or jacket for the cool evening air. A noon wedding on a day without overhead cloud cover may get uncomfortably warm, so consider that and bring sunblock.

Dress up instead of down.,
Avoid inappropriate clothing choices.,
Go light on the accessories for outdoor weddings.",How to Dress for an Outdoor Wedding3," Just because a wedding is outdoors, keep in mind that it is still a very important event. It is better to be overdressed than underdressed for such an occasion, especially as you will likely be photographed.If choosing between a knee-length dress or floor-length gown, go for the gown. If you are torn between loafers and dress shoes, go for the dressier and more formal shoes.

, Do not show up wearing jeans, sneakers, shorts, or a T-shirt. Remember that this is a family event, so choose a classy and dignified look instead of a scandalous one. Never wear white to a wedding, as you do not want to steal the bride or groom's show., Not only will this give you a more relaxed and sophisticated vibe, but it will also make dancing much easier.There is no need to overdo your look with a hat or armful of bracelets. Go for the simplest options, as this will allow you more freedom and comfort.

Soak the cotton item in the boiling water for about 5 minutes.,
Carefully remove the item from the water and place it in the dryer.,
Repeat these steps as many times as necessary until your fabric is the size that you want.",How to Shrink Cotton Fabrics1," Be sure that your fabric is 100% cotton. Realize that the shrinking process is permanent, so make sure you really want to shrink the item on which you are using this method.









If the tag says ""preshrunk,"" your efforts may or may not be in vain. Give it a try, but know that any shrinking method won't be as effective. It could also shrink in certain places and not in others. Worth a shot?;
, Make sure to leave enough room to put your fabric in without the water overflowing. If you'd like, you can add a cup of white vinegar to keep the colors from bleeding.







, Since a bit of color loss may happen, it's important to shrink your items separately (unless they're the same color, of course).You may wish to stir the fabric with a wooden spoon to ensure that it is completely soaked.









If you only want your item to shrink a bit, bring the water to a rolling boil, take it off the burner, and wait 5 minutes before you put your shirt in. The longer you wait, the less it'll shrink. Put directly into the water it can shrink up to 2 sizes., Set the dryer for the highest possible setting and tumble dry your item until it is completely dry.









You're dealing with very hot objects right now. Be careful! Use an oven mitt, potholder, or towel to protect your hands -- don't touch anything directly unless it's cooled off.

, It will shrink the most in the first go-around, but it can still shrink a bit more with each successive boil.

Keep your hair back and off your face.,
No boxy tee-shirts or oversized sweat pants.,
Wear short socks with your sneakers.

,
Keep a cool lookin' water bottle.",How to Dress Fashionable While Exercising," A tinted moisturizer with SPF--you'll want something that's light and won't clog your pores--and a bit of coloured lip balm are more than enough. Skip this step if you feel it's unnecessary.;
, If your hair is medium or long, wear it up in a high ponytail with hair bands that are complimentary to hair color. If it's short, keep it back with a hair band.

, Wear layered tank tops and fitted shorts/pants. Don't bother to spend a lot of money on expensive designer gym clothes (unless you can really afford them) because they're going to get ratty fast. Keep them clean and smelling fresh.

Select your fabric.,
Place only the fabric you wish to shrink in the washing machine.,
Set the water temperature for both the wash and rinse cycles to ""hot,"" and start the washer.,
Place your fabric in the dryer once the wash is completed.,
Repeat these steps until your fabric is the size you want.",How to Shrink Cotton Fabrics2," Again, be sure your fabric is 100% cotton and that you actually want it shrunk. If it's not 100%, it could still shrink -- just probably not as much.









If it's 100% cotton but ""preshrunk,"" you'll need to weigh your options. It's possible it won't shrink it all, that it'll shrink only in certain places, or that it'll shrink just fine.

, Do not run the washer with other clothing or fabrics that do not need to be shrunk or that might bleed in the wash. In hot temperatures, colors are more likely to bleed, so it's best to avoid the possibility.








, Some people recommend adding an enzyme solution to the wash, but this has not been verified. However, you may add a cup of white vinegar if you're concerned with color loss.







, Once more, set the dryer to the highest possible heat setting and wait until your fabric is completely dry. If you want it to only shrink 1/2 - 1 size, however, consider checking on it halfway through. You don't want to shrink it too much!









A nice, woven cotton dress shirt will shrink anywhere from 1-3%. Doesn't sound like much, but a 35"" arm means about 1"" will disappear!, The first time you shrink it will be the most effective, but you can get it a little smaller with another few washings.

Assess the level of formality for your position and workplace.,
Shop for the right clothes.,
Create the right outfits.,
Choose the right shoes.,
Carry the right accessories.,
Wear little jewelry.,
Keep makeup simple.,
Keep your hair conservative.,
Keep your fingernails in check.",How to Dress (for Businesswomen)," With more workplaces trending towards business casual, or in some cases outright casual, these days, it can be difficult to select the right attire for your specific office. It's best to assess the formality of the office when you go in for an interview. If, however, you are starting your job without visiting the office, there's no shame in asking your boss directly what the office dress code is like. Workplace attire generally falls into one of three categories:


Business professional attire is the most formal of business dress codes. This is common in conservative industries like law, finance, accounting, and some government positions. Women in these jobs must be more or less uniform with the men that they work with. This means that you will generally be wearing either a tailored suit or a dress and accompanying structured jacket.
Business casual is probably the most common type of business attire in the modern day. Casual, however, is a bit of a misnomer here. You'll typically want to be wearing either a collared shirt or sweater with dress pants or chinos. It's also appropriate to wear a professional-looking dress or skirt and blouse, but make sure that the piece is knee-length or longer.
Truly casual attire is rare in any workplace; even ""casual Friday"" or ""no dress code"" generally means that you should strive for the lower end of business casual. If, however, you work for a software company or some other progressive company, you may be able to wear casual clothing to work. This means jeans and a t-shirt or, frankly, whatever you want.;
, There a few other qualifications you'll want to consider when buying your professional clothes. First, you'll mainly want to focus on buying neutral colors. Think black, grays, subdued blues, and browns. This is especially true for business professional workplaces; business casual workplaces allow for a bit more color. In addition, make sure that:


Your dresses and clothes are not too tight or revealing. For business professional workplaces, be sure that your dresses or shirts cover your arms and do not have revealing necklines. In all workplaces, be sure that your clothing is not see-through or too tight.Your clothes are of high quality, or at least not of obviously low quality. Think of your clothing as an investment in your career; you should want to present your best self in the workplace. You'll want to budget about $300-$500 for medium-range clothing or about $2000 for higher end clothing.Your clothes fit and are neatly ironed. This may require some tailoring and dry cleaning.
You've bought enough outfits to not repeat one in a week. This is important as people will notice if you frequently wear the same thing.

, In most cases, you'll want to wear an outfit composed of matching neutrals. It's easier in business professional attire, because suits will obviously always match. However, it's also important in business casual to not dress too loudly. Try matching subtle patterns with other solid-colored items.


It's ok to have some louder statement pieces in a business casual environment, just be sure to match them with more conservative pieces.
If in doubt, a white blouse and grey pants or a grey skirt always looks sharp and professional.

, Choosing which shoes you'll wear has a lot to do with your workplace's attire rules and the outfit you'll be wearing them with. In general, business environments will require a woman to wear classic-style pumps or other classic styles with closed toes and heels lower than three inches. Flats are also acceptable. Try to coordinate the color of your shoes to that of your outfit.


Avoid shoes that hinder walking quickly.Women should also wear hosiery when wearing a skirt. This should be the same shade or lighter than your outfit. Wear skin-toned hosiery when wearing short-sleeves.

, Accessories should also not stand out in the same ways that they do outside of work. In general, women should choose either a purse or a briefcase instead of carrying both.A purse, if carried, should be small and coordinate with the color of your outfit.

, Many women tend to wear multiple pieces of jewelry. While this is fine outside of the workplace, business attire standards require that women limit the jewelry that they wear. For example, it is advisable to limit rings to one per hand and wear only a dress watch or simple bracelet rather than multiple bracelets. It is also advisable to keep necklaces simple and avoid dangling earrings.Pearls are always a safe, conservative choice for both necklaces and earrings., Makeup in the workplace should not make you stand out and should reflect restraint and class. In general, you should apply natural-looking makeup and use only clear nail polish.Use subtle makeup colors to accentuate your eyes and lips. This will bring attention to them and help you to communicate with others.

, Like makeup, hair in the workplace should not distract from work or communication. Hair should be kept shorter than shoulder length and must be a natural color (it can be dyed, just stay away from any unnatural shades). Women with longer hair may wear their hair in a neat braid or a bun.

, Your fingernails should be manicured and clean. They must be trimmed just above the fingertips or shorter. You should also avoid artificial nails. Again, stick to mainly clear nail polish or nail polishes of very subdued color.

Accept Yourself: You need to accept your flaws with your good points, only then can you camouflage your flaws and highlight your strong points.,
Use the magic of color.,
Be Bold: Don't be afraid of making mistakes.,
Accessorize - definitely!,
Invest in classic items.,
Layer it up: Wear layers of tops, spaghetti strap tops, and jackets to look more casually attractive.

,
Comfort first: Don't die for a fashionable piece.",How to Dress Effectively," For example: if you have a great shoulders but a bottom that you prefer to play down, you can highlight your beautiful shoulders by wearing strappy tops or off the shoulder items and cover your bottom with shaping underwear and a loose skirt.;
, Color plays a very important role in reflecting your personality. Warm and bright hues may make you look wider; dark colour can make you appear leaner. This does not matter as long as you are wearing a shade that lends color to your face and the tone of your skin. Pastel colours, saffron, and mauve are some colors to consider because they suit most skin-tones.

, Pick out things you think will suit you, be it an oversized jacket for a skinny girl, or a chiffon knee-length dress for a curvy woman. By making mistakes you'll start to understand what suits you best and what works. Playing it safe would never let you find the things that can make you beautiful.

, Be it for your office meeting, or for a day out with your pals. Wear your favourite watch or a scarf with diamond studs. You can play with colours like wearing a neon/colorful necklace with your off-white vintage dress. Accessories always fit! If you can't find an item of clothing you like in a trend you want to try out, look for a bag, scarf, or piece of jewellery that fits the bill.

, Investing in a fashion can sometimes turn out to be a fad, but you can never go wrong with the classics. Make sure that you don't over or under accessorize yourself; keep it simple. Some of the classic dresses/accessories are:


A pair of neutral colour trousers
Blue regular/straight fit jeans
Dark hued aviators
A leather/biker's jacket
A black t- shirt with a nice fit (not body hugging)
Black/brown leather handbag
A plain silk scarf
A knee length floral cotton dress
Brown leather belt (medium width)
A little black dress (not over designed)
Lapel coat

,, If you're not comfortable in it, you might end up sulking. Always wear what your feel physically comfortable in.

Buy some hairspray.,
Remove loose glitter and prepare to spray.,
Spray the hairspray over the glitter.,
Let the hairspray dry on the fabric.",How to Stop Glitter from Falling Off Clothing1," Most brands should suffice for a quick fix. Bear in mind that hair-spray may help affix the glitter in place on the garment, but it will not hold up forever. You may need to use fabric glue or a transparent iron-on transfer for a more permanent fix.;
, Shake the piece of clothing vigorously to remove any loose glitter. Lay a towel on a flat, dry surface. Then, lay the clothes flat out on the towel, with no creases.


If there are any creases in the garment, the hairspray may fix them in place. Consider ironing the garment beforehand, if it's terribly wrinkly.

, Be thorough: apply a thick layer, and make sure that you don't miss any spots. If you notice any problem areas where the glitter is particularly loose, make sure to give those spots extra attention.

, Look for drying instructions on the hairspray bottle. Allow slightly more time than the package calls for, as fabric may dry differently than hair. Once the hairspray has dried onto the glitter, pick up the garment and shake it lightly. If any glitter falls off, you may need to reapply. If not, then it's probably okay to wear – but be gentle!

Use fabric glue to fix the glitter in place.,
Make a glue-and-water mixture.,
Brush the mixture onto the glitter.,
Let the glue dry for 24 hours.",How to Stop Glitter from Falling Off Clothing2," You can sprinkle glitter onto fabric glue to stick it to the garment, and you can coat the glitter in turn with a water-and-fabric-glue mixture to give the glitter a protective outer layer. Glitter often flakes off when it brushes against things – so a coating of glue can help freeze the individual particles.

, First, dilute the fabric glue a little by adding water. There is no set proportion – but dilute it enough that it is easy to apply with a paintbrush. The mixture should be neither too pasty nor too thin.

, Put a newspaper at the back of the fabric on which you want to work. Use a synthetic painting brush to spread, drip, or dab the glue onto the glitter areas. Take care that the glitter doesn't come off. Cover all of the glitter area with this water-and-fabric-glue mixture.

, Lay out the garment in a dry, warm, and airy spot. Make sure that there aren't any wrinkles in the fabric, or else the glue may preserve these wrinkles for the ages. Once the glue-water coating is dry, your clothing should be ready to wear.

"
"
Wash gently.,
Let the fabric air-dry.,
Wear your garment carefully.",How to Stop Glitter from Falling Off Clothing3," Hand-wash the fabric, if possible, so that you have more control. Fabric glue is synthetic, so it shouldn't run off when you wash it. However, hand-washing will be gentler on the glue, the glitter, and the fabric. Wash carefully and do not knead the fabric too heavily. Avoid washing in the washing machine.


Use cool or lukewarm water. Hot water can loosen the glue.

, Hang it up on a clothesline or lay it out on a flat surface. A tumble-dry washing machine might tumble the glitter away, as the garment rubs up against other clothing. Furthermore, the intense heat of many quick-drying techniques (tumble-dryers, blow-dryers) may loosen the fabric glue and lead glitter to flake.

, Try to avoid creating friction that might rub the glitter off; try not to rub too hard and scratch on the glitter. Try not to wear it too often; keep it for special occasions, like a costume. The more often you wear your glittery garment, the more often you will need to wash it – and the more likely you will be to brush up against something!


Consider buying a little jar of glitter to repair the outfit as needed. You may also need extra fabric glue. Find these things at any arts-and-crafts store.

Put the clothing in a clothes dryer with an ice cube.,
Try putting the wrinkled clothing in the shower.,
Buy a wrinkle-removing spray at the store.",How to Remove Wrinkles from Clothes Without an Iron1," Tumble drying clothing is a great way to remove wrinkles. Put the setting on medium, and dry the clothing for about 15 minutes.









Hang the clothes up right after removing them from the dryer so that wrinkles don’t come back. Or wear them right away. If you leave the clothes in the dryer for a long time after the cycle ends or toss them into a clothes basket, the wrinkles will probably return.
Put a couple ice cubes into the dryer or mist the clothing with water before drying them. The ice cubes will melt, and turn into steam, which will help remove the wrinkles from the clothing. Or you could put a damp sock into the dryer with the wrinkled clothing. ;
, Many people have found this method will remove wrinkles fast. Start the shower, and put the water on hot. Close your bathroom door so the steam can’t get out.









Then, hang the wrinkled clothes on the shower rod. Seal the bathroom (the smaller the better) for air leaks -- shut windows, block the space under the door.
It takes about 15 minutes of steam to get rid of wrinkles, though. You also have to make sure you don’t get water on the clothing, so direct the shower head away from the clothing. Make sure your shower rod is clean so it won't leave any marks on the clothing. You could hang the clothes on the rod itself or on a hanger you put on the rod. Get the clothes as close to the heat and water as you can without getting them wet. It’s not good enough to just hang them in the bathroom a distance from the shower head. So you don’t waste water, you could try this method while you’re actually taking a shower.

, You can find common wrinkle-removing sprays at the grocery store. The clothing needs to be damp for the spray to work, but it will remove wrinkles. Or you can make homemade sprays.









Hand the clothing up, and spray it. Gently pull at the fabric to get the wrinkles out after spraying. Store-bought sprays like this work best on clothing made out of cotton blends. You don’t want to use a wrinkle-removing spray on delicate fabric like silk, as it could leave a water spot. Test the spray out on a small piece of the clothing before you spray the entire thing.
You could also make a homemade spray with water and a small amount of vinegar. Put it in a spray bottle and douse your wrinkled clothing with a light spray. If you try vinegar, be aware it could leave a smell. Instead of vinegar, you could add a small amount of fabric softener to the water. Keep a bottle in your desk at work for quick touch-ups before a presentation or in the car for long trips.
After spraying your clothing, it’s best to hang it to dry. Also, make sure you just dampen the clothes. If you soak them, it’s unlikely to work well. You could hang them outside, although that works best for whites, as sunlight can bleach colors from clothing. "

Place the ink cartridge of the tag face-down.,

Slip a rubber band around the pin of the security tag.,
Hold the larger part of the ink tag with one hand.

, Move it as far away as possible so the ink doesn't ruin the clothing as much if the sensor cracks.

, The rubber band should be large and thick enough to be strong, but thin enough to fit around the pin. This will loosen the pin.

Try using the bottom of a heated pot as the iron.,
Use a flat iron as an iron.",How to Remove Wrinkles from Clothes Without an Iron2," Take a pot the size that you would boil noodles in. Boil water in it. Then, dump the water out. Use the bottom of the pot as an iron.


The downside of this approach is that you have to be careful not to burn yourself, as well as the clothing. And the heat will be inconsistent because the pot could cool fast and is a circular shape.
Still, it's better than wearing a wrinkled shirt, and this method should help you remove at least some wrinkles.

, Usually, flat irons are used for curling your hair. However, you could also use the device to iron at least a small section of clothing. A flat iron works really well for reaching areas that are very hard to iron, such as a shirt collar.


It's also useful that the iron clamps down on the clothing, meaning it will apply more direct heat than another method, such as a blow dryer.
Make sure that you clean the iron first. If you leave hair products on it, like hairspray, they could mar your clothes. Be aware that the products could transfer from your hair onto the iron with each use.You could burn your shirt if you press the flat iron onto the clothing for too long, so be careful. You should not use a curling iron with a round barrel for this.

Use a blow dryer.,
Roll or flatten the clothes.,
Use a tea kettle.",How to Remove Wrinkles from Clothes Without an Iron3," In order for a blow dryer to work, you need to dampen the clothing first. Don't douse it. Just make it a little wet, perhaps with a spray bottle. Then, turn the dryer on the lowest setting. A plastic focusing tip really helps.









Hold the dryer about two inches away from the clothing so you don’t make it too hot. You don't want to burn the clothing or otherwise damage it.
You could also hang the wrinkled clothing first, and then direct the blow dryer’s heat on it, again standing one or two inches away.

, Maybe you're in a situation where you don't have any way to apply heat or steam to your clothes. You're in luck. You could try rolling or flattening it.


Take the wrinkled clothing and roll it up very tightly. Make it look like a burrito. Then, place it under a mattress or something else heavy for about an hour. When you remove the clothing and unroll it, there should be fewer wrinkles.
Alternatively, you could flatten the clothing with a damp towel. Place the wrinkled clothing on a flat surface. Dampen a towel (or a paper towel if you don’t have a bath towel). Put the towel on top of the clothing (where the wrinkled area is). Press down. Then let it dry. These methods will take a little longer than usual, but with some smoothing from your hands through the towel, your clothes should be relatively wrinkle free.

, Steam removes wrinkles, so you could boil water in a tea kettle. You want to hold the clothing about 12 inches away from the tea kettle’s steaming spout, though, or you could damage the clothing. One benefit of this approach is you can drink a cup of tea afterwards! This approach works well for small problem areas on the clothing.
If you have a larger wrinkled garment, it’s best to use the steam from a hot shower instead.

Locate the crown on the back of the watch.,
Lift the crown.,
Rotate the crown.,
Release the crown.",How to Set a Bulova Watch4," Turn the watch over until the back of the watch face can be seen. The setting crown should be located on this back face.


Note that you may see two circles on the back of the watch. The smaller circle should be the setting crown. The larger circle will be the power cell and should not be handled during this procedure.

, Use your fingernail to lift the crown up and activate the setting mechanism.


You will need to keep your fingernail underneath the crown throughout the entire process. Do not release it yet.
Bulova models with a back crown usually have a sweep-style second hand. A sweep second hand will not stop once the crown has been lifted; instead, it will continue rotating recording the number of seconds that pass in real time.

, Turn the lifted crown in either direction until the hour and minute hands on the front of the watch face show the correct time.


For this style of Bulova watch, it doesn't matter whether you turn the hands clockwise or counter-clockwise.
You do not need to worry about fine-tuning the minute hand, either, since it should not jump ahead when you release the crown.

, After moving the watch hands to the correct positions, simply let go of the crown. It should click back into place, thereby setting the watch.


On some models, the crown may not click back into place automatically. In that case, gently push the crown into the back of the watch with your fingertip. The crown should click into place without any resistance.
After you complete this step, the watch should be set.

Buy pieces that can be easily mixed and matched.Choosing outfits is much easier when almost everything you have can be mixed and matched.,
Organize and color coordinate your closet.Picking out an outfit is so much easier when you can find what you’re looking for quickly and easily, so get organized.",How to Pick out an Outfit," If you know it’s going to be a rainy day, this will eliminate a lot of your choices right off the bat, making it easier to pick something out.


For instance, if it’s going to be a cloudless summer day, you can bypass most of your closet and go straight to the sleeveless items, shorts, skirts and t-shirts.
Knowing what the weather will be like allows you to make the most informed decision about your outfit.;
, Are you running errands? You’ll probably want to wear something comfortable. Lunch with friends? Look for something casual but cute. A day at the office? Build an outfit that looks professional. Are you going out clubbing or spending a night out on the town? Sleek and stylish items are the way to go.


It’s particularly helpful to know what you’ll be doing when you’re choosing which shoes to wear. For instance, if you’ll be spending a day at the park, you probably won’t want to wear heels or dress shoes.
Factor in whether or not you’ll be doing a lot of walking, getting in and out of cars, or spending a significant amount of time outdoors when choosing your outfit.

, In general, you only have 3 options for your first layer – a top (you’ll want to pick this out before your bottom piece), a two piece suit or a dress. Once you pick out your base, then start building your outfit based around that.


If you need a casual outfit, start by choosing your top. Go with a cute tank top or cotton t-shirt that you can pair with your favorite jeans. Or, if the weather will be warm and you’ll be outside, try a casual sundress or khaki cargo shorts.
If you need something sleek and professional, start with a nice top made out of quality material, like a silk blouse, or something well-tailored, like a button down dress shirt. You can then pair that with black trousers or a pencil skirt.
For your base layer, you’ll want to start with the thinnest materials first. You’ll add volume and thickness later, if desired, by choosing additional layers.

, Once you’ve settled on a top, choosing a bottom piece will be much easier.Base your choice for the bottom piece on the style of the top you’ve already picked out. Pair t-shirts with skinny jeans or leggings for a casual look. If you’ve chosen a pretty blouse or a short sleeve dress shirt to wear to a nice dinner, go with sleek black pants/trousers or a black skirt.


If you’ve chosen a dress, a bottom piece is optional. The only bottom pieces you’d need to consider would be tights or leggings to go underneath the dress.
Going about it in this way allows you to build your outfit, piece by piece. Each new decision you make is informed by what you’ve already chosen.

, Technically, undergarments make up your “first layer” because they are closest to your skin, but you can’t make an informed decision about underthings until you have your base outfit picked out. Choose the items that work best with your outfit.


For instance, a t-shirt and jeans would call for a simple bra top and panties or boxer briefs.
A dress may require a strapless bra, or no bra at all, depending on the style and cut.
If you’ve chosen tight-fitting pants, be aware of possible underwear lines.
If you’ve chosen a top that’s somewhat sheer, you may want to also put on a lightweight tank top so that your bra isn’t visible., Examples of third pieces that work well are a cropped jacket, a cardigan, a funky hoodie, a faux fur vest or even just a long sleeved button down shirt to go over your short sleeves if you expect it to be chilly. Mix it up by adding a patterned third layer over solids.


If your base outfit is monochrome or features solid colors, choose a bolder third piece to accent.
For instance, liven up a black top and pants with a brightly colored or patterned cardigan or sweater.Add a casual flannel button down over a t-shirt and jeans to pull the outfit together and make it more interesting.
If you’ve chosen a boldly striped top, try a sharp solid colored blazer over it.

, Layered pieces allow you to do all sorts of interesting things with color and texture that will make your outfit truly stand out. Wear a soft knit cardigan over a silk top to add texture to your outfit. Or add texture by putting a belted, faux fur vest over a trendy sleeveless top and sleek skinny jeans.


Another example would be a button down cotton dress shirt topped with a tweed blazer.
If your top and bottom are both solid colors, try adding a third piece in another bright, solid color to make it really pop.
For instance, a black top and bright red jeans could be jazzed up with a bright blue cropped jacket.
Another example would be pairing black dress trousers and a dark grey button down dress shirt royal blue blazer.

, Once you’ve chosen a third piece, you may or may not want to add another layer to your outfit. If it’s going to be a chilly day, create another layer by tossing a cool hoodie over your casual jeans, t-shirt and flannel button down to complete the look.If you’re wearing a tank top underneath a sheer, long-sleeved blouse, consider adding a sleek, structured blazer on top as an additional layer.This will give the outfit another dimension and a more polished final look.

, If the weather is cool, your final layer will be a jacket or coat. Let the style of your outfit dictate what kind of jacket or coat you pair it with. For example, wear a black leather jacket over a bright top and skinny jeans for a trendy, punk-inspired look.


A classic pea coat looks great dressed both up and down.Pair it with a sleek, professional outfit for a great look. Pairing it with a cute top and vintage jeans looks just as great.
Add a warm, fleece hoodie over a t-shirt and leggings/jeans for a casual look.

, For instance, professional, sleek outfits should be paired with heels, patent leather dress shoes or stylish ankle boots to complete the look. Go with shoes that accentuate the look and mood of your outfit, while still being functional and comfortable for you to move around in.Shoes also provide an opportunity to add a pop of color to an otherwise monochrome outfit. Choose a pair of bright red ballet flats to complement a black tank top and skinny jeans.Complete your cool and casual t-shirt, jeans and flannel button down with a classic pair of alternative sneakers, like Converse All-Stars.
Jazz up a minimal black dress with embellished heels.

, For instance, polish the look of a baggy button down dress shirt by adding a brightly colored high-waisted belt. Your formerly casual outfit now looks trendy and form-fitting. Or try tucking your top into a pencil skirt and add a thin belt for a classy, iconic look.


Try a black leather belt with dress trousers and a nice button down shirt, topped with a sharp blazer, for a super polished look
Belts can also significantly change how a dress looks.
For instance, adding a belt with a wide band to a dress with an empire waist gives the dress a funky, more modern look.

, If you aren’t sure where to start with jewelry, trying adding a single statement piece to compete a look. Add a chunky, vintage necklace or earrings to a classy black dress to add an entirely new dimension to your outfit. Or try experimenting with different colors and styles of jewelry to accentuate your outfit.


You can also choose jewelry based on which area of your outfit you want to highlight.
For instance, add a gorgeous pendant necklace to a v-cut top.
If you’re going for casual or neutral, a nice watch is never out of place.
Simple studs in your ears add a little sparkle while not looking out of place with your t-shirt and jeans.

, Throw a brightly colored scarf over your shirt and cardigan/sweater for a classy look.Add a vintage clutch to your party dress to kick the glamour up a notch. Accentuate a sleek black outfit with a brightly colored handbag or briefcase. Get a great hippy look by adding a knitted bag to your peasant top and flare-legged jeans.


Don a pair of vintage cat-eye sunglasses to go with your black skinny jeans and leather jacket. This look is classic and punk-inspired at the same time.
Whatever you choose as your final touch, think of it as the icing on the cake – have fun with it!

, Go for versatile staple pieces that you can dress up or down to fit different types of occasions.When choosing your staple pieces, avoid fads and focus on selecting items that flatter your body type and reflect your personal style.Staple pieces will vary according to lifestyle and personal style.
A few great examples would be a sharp black blazer, a pair of skinny jeans that fit you perfectly, a well-made hoodie, a pair of neutral colored ballet flats, a solid toned sweater, dressy black trousers, patent leather dress shoes and a pair of black or brown boots., Since quality garments tend to be more expensive, get the most mileage out of them by selecting basic pieces that never go out of style.


For example, instead of buying a new jacket every fall, spend a little extra cash on that black leather jacket you’ve been wanting. It will last you for years and always be fashionable.A cashmere cardigan or sweater, while on the pricy side, will always look sharp and the quality material will endure for years., Go for items that are solid colors so that they are interchangeable. When you do buy patterned shirts, ties or dresses, make sure you have multiple ways you can wear them to get several different looks.


For example, if you buy a floral printed dress, make sure to have a few different matching cardigans in a solid colors, a few pairs of different colored tights, and a colorful belt or two already in your wardrobe.
Or, if you buy a colorful neck tie, make sure you you have a few different dress shirts and suits it will match.
Not only can you get multiple looks from that one dress by changing up the accent pieces, but those accent pieces will also match other outfits in your wardrobe.

, Group similar items together, and then color coordinate them. For instance, put all of your skirts or dress pants together in one section of you closet, and then arrange them by color.


You may also find it helpful to create sections in your closet based on function. Group together all of your work clothes in one area, your casual t-shirts and jeans in another, workout clothing in another, and so on.
If you have storage space, removing seasonal clothing from your closet when not in use can help you better organize things.
For example, when summer comes, store your sweaters and coats out of the way.
This will open up your closet and make it easier for you to pick out outfits.

Decide how thick you want the face to be.,
Measure your wrist.,
Pick the size of the band.,
Choose a strap material.,
Check the fit of the watch before you buy it.",How to Size a Watch1," Most watch faces are between 6 and 10 millimeters thick. If you prefer a smaller or lighter watch, consider choosing one that's closer to 6 millimeters thick. You may want a thinner face if you're bothered by a watch that snags on things.Keep in mind that you'll usually have more control over the diameter of the watch face rather than its thickness.;
, Take a flexible ruler and wrap it around your wrist. This will give you a measurement so you can choose the best diameter for your wrist. For example, for wrists:Smaller than 5 to 6 inches (12 to 15 cm), choose a diameter 38 millimeters or less.
Between 6 and 7 inches (15 to 17 cm), pick a 38 to 42 millimeter diameter.
Between 7.5 and 8 inches (19 to 20 cm), go with a 44 to 46 millimeter diameter.

, Your watch will feel more comfortable if you choose the right size band. Try on several watches to decide how wide you'd like the band to be. If you want to wear a wide band, decide if you'd like it to fit tightly on your wrist. For a looser fitting band, pick a thinner band that can slide up and down on your wrist (like a bracelet)., You have a lot of options when it comes to the strap material. If you expect you'll be sizing the watch a lot, choose a material that will be easy to adjust. Fabric or leather straps might be the easiest to adjust since you can simply use a different hole to secure the strap.If you choose metal straps, you'll need to use jeweler's tools to add or remove links when sizing the watch.

, Once you've selected a watch, try it on and ask the jeweler to make any adjustments. Ask if you can take home extra links or a spare strap so you can size the watch in the future. Many jewelers will be happy to add holes to watch bands or remove extra links from the band."

Look for a bib necklace in gold, silver, copper, or any other metallic finish you like. Metallic jewelry can complement virtually any color, pattern, or look, so you’ll get your money’s worth with a metallic bib necklace.


For example, you could wear a dramatic big necklace made of silver chains with a white tee and skinny jeans, but you can pair it over a little black dress just as easily. One metallic necklace can be worn with all types of outfits, from casual to dressy.;
, If you want a bib necklace that you can style with super casual outfits, look for a cloth version. You can find cloth bib necklaces in all sorts of different colors, often with beading or design work. Not only are these effortless, they are lightweight around your neck.


Look for bib necklaces will a ribbon tie. Instead of a normal necklace clasp, you'll tie these bib necklaces in a sweet bow around your neck. These are perfect for casual, daytime outfits.

, If you are really looking for a way to make a statement, go ahead and buy a bib necklace in a bold color or pattern. While it won’t be as versatile as a metallic or neutral, you will make a striking, noticeable statement. This is a perfect choice for someone looking to spice up a specific outfit!


Purchase a bib necklace made of layers of different colored beads or baubles. A multi-colored necklace can be paired with all different colored outfits, and it's an easy way to make a bold statement., When you’re wearing a bib necklace, it needs to be the star of the show. Because it’s a heavier, larger piece, keep your other pieces small. This is especially important for any accessories near the face, like earrings or headbands. Not only will this keep your look from being busy and weighed down, it will get your necklace the attention it deserves.If you're wearing a bold bib necklace, skip the chandelier earrings and wear a pair of simple studs instead. This will keep your top half from looking busy and weighed down.

, Bib necklaces will fall along the neckline of whatever top or dress you are wearing, so keep it simple. Skip the intricate lace-up shirts or the embroidered V-necks, because there will simply be too much going on. A bib necklace should enhance a simple neckline, rather than overshadow an interestingly-designed one.For example, a tiered bib necklace pairs beautifully with a deep V-neck shirt because it fills in the simple neckline. Look for combinations that complement each other, rather than overlapping or competing.

, Bib necklaces look great with solid, neutral tops and dresses, but that doesn’t mean you need to stick to those. If you want to wear a patterned or a colored piece of clothing, pair it with a bib necklace that contrasts with it in some way. This will ensure that your bib necklace is the center of attention.


For example, a white shirt pairs well with a black bib necklace, and vice versa. Metallics pair well with neutrals, and colored bib necklaces look great with their complementary colors.
A striped or geometrically-patterned shirt would look great with a floral or free flowing bib necklace, while a whimsical shirt would look best with a simpler, linear one., Because bib necklaces are large, they add the perfect pop to an otherwise simple outfit. Pair a metallic or colored bib necklace with an all-black or all-white outfit to instantly take it from boring to trendy.

You want the necklace to be shorter so that it sits entirely above the shirt or dress, rather than layered on top of it., This look is supremely trendy right now. Typically, you probably wear your button down shirt with a button or two undone at the top. Take it from “typical” to stylish by buttoning your shirt all the way up to the top and then adding a fun bib necklace around the collar. The necklace will frame the collar of the shirt.This is great for anyone wanting to wear a glitzy, fun bib necklace in a professional setting.

Gather your supplies.,
Prepare your wire.,
Wrap the wire around your stone.,
Create a band between windings with your wire.,
Attach a jump ring and string your chain.,
Add jump rings and clasps as necessary.",How to Reset an Heirloom Stone1," For this project, you'll be wrapping jewelry wire around your heirloom stone to make a necklace setting. If you are a beginner to wire wrapping stones, you may want to choose an inexpensive wire to begin with.The following list of supplies for this process can be bought at most craft or hobby shops and includes:


Clasps (x2)
Heirloom stone (loose)
Isopropyl alcohol
Jewelry chain
Jump rings (x2)
Pliers (needle nose preferred)
Rag (or paper towel)
Ruler
Wire cutters (or side cutters)
Wire (25-gauge jewelry/craft wire);
, Many kinds of jewelry wire will have a polishing agent on it. This can turn your fingers black when working and make a mess. Clean this from your wire by dampening a clean rag or paper towel with isopropyl alcohol and wipe down the wire., There are many different wrapping patterns you can use to make the new necklace setting for your stone. Generally, the wire should hold your stone firmly in place. One of the simplest wire wrapping techniques you can use involves:


Wrapping your wire horizontally (left to right) around the middle of your stone three to five times. These windings should have no space in between and be tight.
Tucking the loose end underneath your windings with your pliers when you are satisfied with the windings.
Wrapping your wire vertically (top to bottom) around the middle of your stone three to five times in the same fashion as your horizontal wrap.

You may want to use a dab of permanent craft glue, like E6000, on the wire ends to hold them in place. However, this glue may be difficult to remove., Measure the distance between your vertical and horizontal windings with a ruler. Add 2 to 3"" (5 to 7.6 cm) to this measurement. Cut a piece of wire to this length, then use your pliers to wind one end of the wire around your vertical and horizontal wrappings to create a band running between the windings.


To create a secure bond and ensure that your stone doesn't come loose from the necklace, you may want to use dabs of permanent craft glue, like E6000, where the wires connect., Take your pliers and twist the jump ring so it opens enough to fit around your band of wire between horizontal and vertical windings. Close the jump ring with your pliers, then string the chain for your necklace through the jump ring., Some chains may come pre-equipped with jump rings and clasps. If not, however, you'll have to bend open another jump ring, attach it to one end of your chain, add a clasp to the jump ring, then close the jump ring with your pliers. If your chain is too fine for your clasp to connect to the end link of its opposite end:


Take another jump ring and open it with your pliers. Add this jump ring to the end of the opposite, clasp-less side of the chain. Close off the jump ring, and connect both ends of the chain by attaching the clasp at one end to the jump ring on the other."

Identify if you need to adjust your watch.,
Remove links to make the band smaller.,
Add links to loosen the band.,
Replace the watch strap.",How to Size a Watch2," Since watches can be worn tightly or loosely, you'll need to decide if the watch is fitting the way you'd like. Check your wrist after wearing your watch to see if it leaves an imprint on your skin. If it does, your watch might be too tight. Or if the watch bothers you by sliding up and down on your arm, you may want to tighten it., To secure the watch to your wrist, consider wearing it on a tighter setting. If you have a metal strap with links, pinch the clasp up towards you. This will show you how many links to remove. Use needle-nosed pliers and a push pin to remove the extra links or take the watch to the jeweler.If you have a fabric or leather strap, use a different hole on the strap to secure it to your wrist.

, If your watch is fitting too snugly on your wrist, add links to the band. You'll need to use links that came with the watch when you bought it or ask a jeweler to add new links for you. Carefully remove the pins from the clasp end and insert the new link. Secure the clasp end back onto the strap.

If you have a fabric or metal strap, use a different hole to secure the watch. If you're on the loosest hole setting, you may need to use an awl to punch an extra hole in the band.

, Use a screwdriver to remove the screws on both sides of the lugs. The lugs are the metal points that hold the strap to the watch itself. The strap should come away easily once you've unscrewed it. Put the new strap in place and screw both sides back into the lugs. Try on the watch and adjust the strap according to your preferences.If you're unsure what size strap you'll need, look on your old strap. Many straps will have the size printed on the underside of the band. If you don't see it, measure the distance between the lugs in millimeters.

Gather necessary documentation for your stone.,
Choose a suitable setting.,
Get the jeweler's opinion on your resetting.,
Determine the metal for the setting.,
Recycle the metal of the old setting, alternatively.,
Have the jeweler reset the gem.",How to Reset an Heirloom Stone2," Many jewelers may require special documents certifying the value and/or authenticity of heirloom stones that are precious. This is often for insurance purposes.Some documents that may be required by your jeweler include:


A GIA/EGL Certificate along with a certified appraisal of the stone.
An IGI lab report and its associated stone map., Many settings for heirloom stones have three to six metal claws or prongs that hold the stone to a flat metal piece or basket on the ring band. Other designs wrap the shaped metal of the band of the ring around the stone to hold it in place. Which setting suits you best will depend on your preference.


Fewer prongs or shallower settings will display your heirloom stone better, but more prongs and deeper settings might be best for especially precious heirloom stones.
The prongs of your setting can be shaped so that they are pointed, rounded, flat, V-shaped, or so that the prongs form pockets in which the stone is held., Depending on the size of your stone and its condition, some settings might not be suitable for your heirloom stone. Ask potential jewelers if your resetting plans are reasonable and, if not, what alternatives are open to you.


Even if your ideal setting won't work with your stone, you may be able to use a similar setting instead., When choosing a metal, keep in mind the tones that flatter your complexion, the kind of jewelry you wear most often, and so on. A metal that matches with your favorite colors will fit seamlessly into your wardrobe. Keep in mind that the metal's color may influence the color of your stone.Common metals to choose from include:


Platinum
Gold (yellow, white, rose, and green)Silver
Stainless steel
Titanium, This is also an excellent tactic for convincing others to get an heirloom gem reset. A jeweler can easily melt the metal from the old band and use some or all of it to create the new setting. This way, you keep all the ring's original material, but can enjoy a setting all your own., After all the particulars about the heirloom stone resetting have been discussed, you'll have to give your heirloom stone to the jeweler for resetting. Once it is ready, you'll only have to pay the jeweler and you can enjoy your new heirloom stone setting.

"
Prioritize mom-and-pop jewelry shops.,
Get many quotes for the resetting.,
Inquire about the jewelers professional credentials.,
Research other work done by potential jewelers.",How to Reset an Heirloom Stone3," Smaller establishments oftentimes offer better customer service. Additionally, these shops are frequently more flexible than chains. This means that mom-and-pop jewelers might be more willing to accommodate your requests.Mom-and-pop diamond stores also have a tendency to be more flexible where price is concerned.

, Take your heirloom setting to several different jewelers, discuss the changes you're thinking of making to the setting, and get a quote for the work. The price range between different stores may vary considerably.


Some stores may have less access to certain kinds of metal, which could drive up the cost of your setting unnecessarily.

, Master jewelers and gemologists should have certificates or a degree to back up their expertise. Look for credentials issued from international, reputable agencies, like the GIA (Gemological Institute of America) or the EGL (European Gemological Laboratory)., If you like previous work done by a jeweler, it's more likely that you'll also appreciate the work they could do resetting your stone. At each store you visit, ask to see examples of settings done by the jeweler, and give preference to jewelers' whose style you like."

Respect the sentimental value of the setting.,
Offer concrete reasons why the stone should be reset.,
Point out differences in taste and style.,
Discuss changes with the original owner, if possible.",How to Reset an Heirloom Stone4," Some heirloom stones may have been passed down for generations in their original setting. This can make people connected to the ring hesitant to change it. When talking about resetting an heirloom stone, try to:Acknowledge the history of the piece and its importance. This will show others that you realize the sentimental attachment they have to it.
Avoid being demanding, especially with the stone's original owner. This can come across as disrespectful.
Express how much you appreciate being given an heirloom stone. Point out features of it you particularly like., There are many legitimate reasons, beyond the setting's appearance, for having a stone reset. For example, prominent settings might not be suitable for your active lifestyle. Some other reasons you might use include:Damage to the setting that needs to be repaired. In some cases, it may be more reasonable to replace the setting than repair it.
Decay to the setting over time. This can cause the metal of the setting to become soft, brittle, or easily broken., For settings you'll be wearing frequently, or those you'll be wearing permanently in the case of wedding rings, you'll want the setting to match your personal style. Stress how much you appreciate the original setting, then gently point out:That the current setting doesn't flatter your particular body. Certain settings, for example, may be too big or small for your finger.
That you'd like to add a personal touch, like perhaps including a feature from your mother's ring., Heirloom jewelry can be especially important to the original inheritor or owner of the piece. To preserve harmony in your family, you may want to respectfully discuss potential changes to the setting with its original owner. You might say something like:""I absolutely adore this ring. I was wondering if I might talk to you about the setting. My hands are so much larger than yours, I'm worried it might look small on my finger. Do you think changing the setting might help that?""

Instead, there are small holes on each side of the cuff, where cufflinks are added. Wearing cufflinks with this shirt means that the cufflink will be securing four layers of shirt fabric.This is a dressier look, and the most classic style of shirt to wear with cufflinks.


Cufflinks can also be worn with single cuff shirts, the variety typically found at department stores. Wearing cufflinks with this style of shirt is a more casual look.;
, With your arm extended, use your opposite hand to fold your French cuffs back. Make sure that the end edge of the cuff (closest to your fingers) folds back to form a neat and even lining.









If you are wearing a single cuff shirt, there is no need to fold back your cuffs.

, Pinch the two open edges of the shirt cuff together so the two edges lay flat, away from the wrist. The inside fabric of the cuff edges should be pressed against each other. This will create the classic “kiss cuff” most commonly worn with cufflinks.The two open edges of the cuff will be pinched together as if they are kissing.









A single cuff shirt will not use the “kiss cuffing.” Instead, the two cuff edges overlap one another, making a barrel shape.
Again, you can wear cufflinks with single cuff shirts, but it is considered to be a far more casual look. Traditionally, cufflinks are paired with French cuff shirts for formal occasions.

, Make sure the cufflink holes are even and aligned. This will make inserting the cufflinks a lot easier, and can reveal if your fold is even and aligned where it should be.









For a single cuff shirt, align the cufflink holes by making the overlapping of the cuffs looser or tighter, until the holes match up.

, When your arms are at your sides, the decorative face of the cufflink should be outwardly displayed.Aside from the face of the cufflink, the rest of the cufflink material is inserted through the layers of cuff fabric, and is secured on the other side of the cuff.


The way you secure the cufflinks will vary slightly depending upon the style of cufflinks.

, This style of cufflink has a bullet shaped capsule that is held in place between two posts.Flip the bullet on its axis to align with the post of the cufflink. This will allow you to maneuver the cufflink through the aligned holes in the layers of cuff fabric. Hold the cufflink with your thumb and pointer finger. Use your middle, ring, and pinky finger to hold the top portion of the cuff in place, and insert the cufflink post through the holes on the top section of the cuff. Then, bring the bottom portion of the cuff up to meet the cufflink, and fit the post of the cufflink through the bottom portion of the cuff. Flip the bullet shaped capsule back horizontally to secure the cufflink on the shirt.









This cufflink style is the most common of all cufflinks, and one of the easiest to put on.

, Whale back cufflinks have a straight post combined with a flat, solid whale tail backing, similar to bullet back cufflinks. Flip the whale backing straight so it is flush to the post. Grasp the cufflink with your thumb and pointer finger, and use the rest of your fingers to hold the top portion of the cuff still. Push the cufflink post through the holes on the top section of the cuff, then bring the bottom portion of the cuff up to meet the cufflink. Push the cufflink post through the bottom portion of the cuff. Once the post and backing are completely through all of the cuff fabric, flip the backing perpendicular to the post to secure the cufflink.This style is similar to bullet back closures, but offer a more secure backing that locks into place once flipped.

, Fixed backings are an extension of the cufflink face. This means that the post and backing are formed from the same piece of metal as the front face of the cufflink.The backing does not bend or move in any way. Grip the cufflink with your thumb and pointer finger, and use your other fingers to hold the top of the cuff steady. Maneuver the back of the cufflink to fit through the top cuff’s holes. It will fit through the holes the same as a button would. Then push the back of the cufflink through the bottom portion of the cuff.


This cufflink style may require a bit more work to put on, but can be beneficial in the long run from not having moving parts., Chain link cufflinks are the original form of cufflinks, and feature a connecting chain linking the two ends of the cufflink together.Hold the top portion of the cuff with your middle, ring, and pinky fingers, and use your thumb and pointer finger to push the back of the cufflink through the top cuff’s holes. Then bring the bottom cuff up to meet the top cuff, and again, use your thumb and pointer finger to push the back of the cufflink through the holes of the bottom portion of the shirt cuff.


These cufflinks are normally a bit more difficult to put on. However, the benefit of wearing these cufflinks is that the flexible chain between the front and back of the cufflink typically allows for a more relaxed cuff fit.
An additional benefit of this style is that there is something to look at on both sides of the cuff., These styles of cufflinks have a fixed backing, featuring a design on the back end, rather than a plain fixed disc. Attach these cufflinks the same way you would attach fixed back cufflinks. Use your thumb and pointer finger to fit the entire back end of the cufflink through the holes in the top layer of the cuff fabric, while your other fingers hold the cuff steady. Then, bring the bottom portion of the cuff up to meet the top portion, and push the back of the cufflink through the holes in the bottom cup. The cufflink will be secured when the back is held in place on the bottom portion of the cuff like a button.


This cufflink style allows for an appealing design on both sides of your cuff, and enables you to switch what is shown as the face of the cufflink. It’s like having two pairs of cufflinks in one.

, This style of cufflink is similar to fixed backing cufflinks. Usually, the backing is composed of an attached ball. Use your thumb and pointer finger to insert the balled backing of the cufflink through the holes on the top layer of the cuff. Then bring the bottom portion of the cuff up to meet the top portion, and push the post of the cufflink through the bottom portion’s cuff holes.


The upside of these cufflinks is that they are very easy to put on and you get the slackened cuff fitting.The backing ball also serves as a more appealing backing than a bullet or plain fixed backing.

, Unfold these hinged cufflinks (so they’re opened and have a straighter form) and insert the small, back end of the cufflink through the holes on the top layer of the cuff. Once the back end of the cufflink is completely through the top layer of cuffing, bring the bottom portion of the cuff up to meet the cufflink backing. Then push the backing of the cufflink through the holes of the bottom portion of the cuff. Hinge the cufflink back into place, folding it, to close and lock the cufflink into place.This style of cufflink is one of the most secure varieties, and offers a tighter fit to the cuff.

",How to Photograph Jewelry," A white sheet of heavyweight paper works as an ideal background to photograph jewelry, especially for novice photographers. As you become more skilled at taking jewelry pictures, consider using a colorful background of printed paper that has minimal text, graphics and compliments the jewelry's color scheme. Your background should add visual interest to the photograph without distracting from the jewelry's best qualities.;
, Early in the morning and late in the afternoon are the 2 best times to take jewelry pictures. If you pick a different time of day, create soft lighting that will compliment the jewelry piece from all angles. Ideally you will have slight shadows behind the jewelry to help make the piece stand out.

, A piece of letter-sized cardboard wrapped in foil serves as an impromptu light deflector that can bounce light away from the jewelry piece when you aim it at reflective spots. If you need to use your camera's flash, place a piece of facial tissue over the flash to diffuse the strobe. Wearing a white t-shirt while you photograph jewelry also helps diffuse harsh lighting from your camera's flash when it fills the room with brightness as you snap photos.

, Use your camera's macro setting, which allows you to obtain crisp, up-close photos of the jewelry. Select different angles that show what the jewelry looks like up front, from the side and even from behind.

, A close-up, focused shot of a pendant hanging from a neck or a gemstone dangling from an ear lobe is more interesting to viewers and helps give them a better idea of the size of the piece.

, Jewelry is alluring because pieces tend to reflect everything in their environment. Jewelry can also reflect unwanted elements in the room where you are taking pictures, such as window blinds or light bulbs. To avoid unattractive reflections on your jewelry, stand as far away from the subject as possible while using your camera's zoom feature to bring the jewelry into focus.

Place a piece of tape over the bracelet.,
Secure the clasp with your free hand.",How to Put a Bracelet on by Yourself1," It usually helps to rest your hand, palm facing down, against a table or counter to steady it, so you don’t have to worry about the bracelet falling.

Consider your headband options.,
Brush through your hair to remove tangles.,
Decide whether you want a part or not.,
Place the headband on your hair.",How to Wear a Headband1," When you’re wearing a headband with your hair down, virtually any style will work.

You can find all headband styles in a variety of colors and patterns, so it’s easy to find an option that will match your outfit.;
, To ensure that your hair looks neat when you place the headband, you should brush it before hand. Brush your hair all the way down to the ends so it’s smooth and entirely free of tangles.








You may prefer to use a wide-tooth comb to brush through your hair because they don’t tug at your hair as much as a brush does.
If you aren’t happy with the natural texture of your hair, you can use a flat iron to straighten your locks or curling iron to add curls or waves after you brush it.  

, After you’ve removed any tangles from your hair, you can choose to add a part or not before you put the headband on. If you don’t want a part, just comb your back and away from your face. If you want a part, choose a side and carefully comb your hair over to that side.








Wearing a part with a headband typically looks best if you have bangs. After parting your hair, place the headband right where your bangs separate from the rest of your hair for the most flattering look.

, Once your hair is neatly combed and parted as you want, slide the headband into over your hair. Position it so it rests approximately ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline, and adjust your hair as you like, such as pulling it over your ears or pushing it behind them.








If you have bangs, you can use the headband to push them back and hold them off your face or you can pull the bangs loose from the headband, depending on the look that you prefer.

, These will appear less ""racy"" and more toned down than wider meshed fishnets.The smaller the diamond shapes, the better the look and the easier it is to suggest sophistication.

, Stick with black, brown, or nude for day wear., Boots are also a fine option; indeed a knee-length dress or skirt with knee-high boots and a touch of fishnet in between can be very ladylike provided the clothing is good quality.

, Choose an interesting color for the tights, and make it bright for extreme contrast (providing it matches the rest of your outfit). For day wear, choose office-acceptable colors like navy blue and dark green; for the evening, be more daring, especially when coupling the tights and fishnet combination with the little black dress.

Consider what you will be wearing with your tiara.,
Consider your hairstyle.,
Pick a tiara that complements your face shape.,
Get a tiara with an oval-shaped band instead of a round one.,
Choose a tiara that has a slight forward lean to it.,
Check that the fit of the tiara on your head is comfortable.,
Conceal the ends of the tiara if you choose to wear your hair down.,
Consider giving the tiara something to hold on to.,
Try an up-do for a classical look and maximum hold.,
Pair tiaras with formal outfits.,
Wear tiaras to formal occasions.,
Don't wash your hair.,
Style your hair first.,
Slide the tiara carefully in the middle of the head.,
Use bobby pins to secure the tiara.,
Don't clip veils to tiaras.",How to Wear a Tiara," When choosing a tiara, you should also take into account the dress that you will be wearing with it. The tiara is meant to complement, and not overpower your look. For instance, if the dress that you will be wearing is adorned with crystal beading, then it would be ideal to choose a crystal tiara. If the dress is beaded with pearls, then a pearl tiara would be the best style to match the dress as well.


If the tiara is not for a fancy, formal outfit (such as a prom, wedding, or other big event), choose a tiara that will be the focal point of the outfit.
Make sure that your tiara matches your jewelry, and does not clash. For example, if your jewelry is silver with diamonds, pick a tiara that is also silver with diamonds.;
, Different tiaras work better with different hairstyles. If you already have a hairstyle in mind to go with your outfit, then choose a tiara accordingly. For example, a smaller tiara will suit an up-do better than a wider, longer tiara.

, While there are no set rules as to which type of tiara you should choose, there are certain styles that complement certain face shapes better than others. In general, try to choose a tiara with a shape that is opposite your face shape.


If you have a heart-shaped face, choose a tiara with a V-shaped peak. This will create the illusion of a longer face.
If you have a long face, go for something with little or no height that extends evenly across the top of your head. Avoid tall or pointy tiaras.
If you have an oval face, you can get away with most shapes. You might want to avoid styles with peaks at the center, however, as this can make your face appear longer.
If you have a round face, go for tiaras that have a bit of height or a peak. These can make your face appear longer. Avoid rounded tiaras.

, Your head is actually an oval, so an oval-shaped band will fit your head better. A round band will leave gaps. It will also pinch your skull painfully.

, When you place the tiara down on a flat surface, the front should lean forward slightly. This will help the tiara frame your face properly.

, A tiara that is too large may slip down your head. If necessary, bend the arms of the tiara band a bit until it fits. Avoid bending the tiara straight down the middle, however, as this may damage it.


Make sure that the tiara is not too tight, or you will get a headache later on.

, In general, loose, relaxed hair looks too casual for tiaras, which are often associated with formality and regality. If you do choose to wear your hair loose, then drape several strands of hair over the ends of the tiara. This will make it blend in better.


Consider adding some waves or a soft curl to your hair. This will give your hairstyle some movement and grace.
For a more casual look, consider going with a simple floral tiara instead.

, If you are going to wear your hair down, your tiara won't have much to hold on to. Try braiding or twisting some hair to either side of your temple into a rope. Wrap both of these ""ropes"" around your head. Pin them in place just above your ear. When you put your tiara on, the ends of it should slide right behind these twisted or braided ropes.

, You can pull your hair up into a tight ballerina bun, or a loose/messy bun. You can even try a ponytail or braid.


Give a ponytail some volume by teasing the hair at the crown of your hair into a slight bump.

, There are certain accessories that look best when paired with certain types of outfits. Tiaras are one of them. Much how you wouldn't pair sweatpants and a fancy dress shirt, you wouldn't pair a delicate tiara with jeans and a t-shirt.

, Because of their association with royalty and regality, tiaras are best reserved for those special, formal occasions. They are usually too fancy and formal for day-to-day wear.


On the other hand, many girls choose to wear a tiara on their 16th and 21st birthdays in order to stand out and feel more special.

, It may sound gross, but having day-old hair actually helps the tiara stay on better. If you must wash your hair, avoid using conditioner. This will give your hair some texture and ""grip,"" and help the tiara stay on longer.

, This include applying hairspray. If you apply hairspray after you put on your tiara, you will dull the surface and make it sticky.

, Try to angle it slightly, so that the prongs go into your hair. It will blend in better with your hairstyle. Try not to just plop it on top of your head.

, To ensure that the tiara will not fall off, use bobby pins to hold it in place. Place the bobby pins in such a manner that they will be hidden, and will not interfere with the design of the tiara.

, This will cause the tiara to drag back painfully. Instead, put the tiara on first, then clip the veil directly to your hair.

Create a wide headband.,
Wear a bandana as a pin-up style headband.,
Make a hippie style headband.,
Do a 50’s style ponytail.,
Make a hair wrap.,
Wear your bandana 90’s style.",How to Wear Bandanas1," Lay the bandana flat on a table so that it looks like a diamond. Fold the bottom half of the diamond up to the top to make a large triangle. Then take the top corner of the triangle and fold it down to meet the base of the triangle to create a wide pentagon shape.Fold the pentagon in half length wide. The scarf should now look like a long rectangular band.
Repeat the process of folding the strip in half until the band is about 1 ½ inches (3.81 cm).
Pick up the band, making sure it doesn’t unravel. Place the middle of the band at the top of your head, then tie the two ends at the nape of your neck into a knot.
If you are wearing your hair down, make the knot under your hair.;
, Follow the same stems as making a wide headband, but instead of placing the middle of the band on the top of your head and tying it at the nape of your neck, place the middle of the band at the nape of your neck and tie the tails of the bandana into a knot at the top of your head., A hippie style headband goes over your hair like a crown, giving you a laid back, bohemian vibe. To create this style, follow the steps to fold your bandana in a wide headband, then place the center of the bandana on your forehead. Take the two loose ends and tie them behind your head, making sure that you hair falls underneath the bandana.









You can make the band skinny or wide, depending on your preference.

, Begin by laying the bandana down and bunching the bandana toward the center to make a long rope shape. Loop the rope shape into a loose, open knot.








After you form the bandana into an open knot, pull your hair back into a ponytail and tie your hair with an elastic band.
Slide the looped knot over your ponytail and tighten the knot until it is snug against your hair tie.
This is a good look to make with a long, scarf-like bandana as opposed to a traditional square bandana.

, Begin making this vintage-style hair wrap by first styling your hair by making a pouf or by doing an updo and keeping your bangs down if you have bangs. Fold the bandana corner to corner to make a large triangle. Then drape the triangle you made over your shoulders like a cape. Bring the corners up to the top of the head, letting your poof or bangs go in front. Bring up the back corner of the bandana and tuck it under the two front corners, then make a knot to tie the front corners of the bandana together above your forehead.








The bandana should be completely covering your head, with your bangs or poof coming out in the front to give the style more nuance.

, Another classic way to wear a bandana is a 90’s style look that works on both men and women. To create this look, lay your bandana out flat on the diagonal and fold it in half to make a large triangle. Lean your head forward and place the center of the base of the triangle against the top of your forehead. Then take the two ends of the triangle and wrap them to the back of your head. Tie them together in a knot at the nape of your neck. Make sure that the back corner of the bandana is resting on top of your hair and pointing at the knot in the back.


If you have long hair, make sure you tie the knot underneath rather than over your hair.

Find a complimentary headband.,
Gather your hair back into a ponytail or braid it.,
Arrange the headband in your hair.",How to Wear a Headband2," When you’re pairing a headband with a ponytail or braid, the look tends to be more casual. Look for a bohemian-inspired headband to coordinate with the more relaxed style, such as one that features artificial flowers or leaves. A woven or feathered headband also works well with a ponytail or braid., Once you’ve settled on a headband, pull your hair back into the ponytail or braid of your choice. Use a hair elastic or clip to secure your hair, and apply some flexible hold hairspray if you’re concerned that it might come loose.








You can pull your hair into a traditional ponytail at the middle of the back of your hair, opt for a high ponytail at the crown of your head, or go for a low pony right at the nape of your neck. A side pony also looks cute with a headband.
You can also put your hair in pigtails if you aren’t a fan of ponytails.
French braids look especially good with a headband, but you can do your any braid that you like, such as a traditional rope or fishtail braid.

, After you’ve finished putting your hair into a ponytail or a braid, place the headband in your hair and push it into place. You don’t necessarily need to position it ½ inch (1.27 cm) from your hairline as you would with your hair down. Depending on the placement of your pony or braid, you may want to push it further back in your hair.








You may want to pull some strands of hair free from the headband around your face for a softer look. You can also pull your bangs free if you prefer.

Choose the appropriate headband.,
Pull your hair into your favorite updo.,
Add the headband to your hair.,
Spritz your hair with hairspray to keep it in place.",How to Wear a Headband3," When you’re wearing a headband with an updo, choosing the right style is key. When you’re going casual, it’s best to choose a thin, delicate headband that won’t overwhelm your look with your hair all pulled up and back. If you’re wearing your updo to a formal event, pair it with an embellished headband that features pearls, rhinestones, crystals, or other beads for a more sophisticated look., After you’ve selected a headband, brush your hair and pull it up into your chosen updo. You can opt for a simple top knot bun, a fancy French twist, a sophisticated chignon, or whatever style you prefer.








It’s often easier to do an updo if your hair has some texture to it. That’s why it’s best to start with hair that hasn’t been washed in a day or so. If you have washed your hair, use some dry shampoo or a texturizing spray to add some texture.

, Once your hair is pulled up into the updo, place your headband in your hair. As with a ponytail or braid, you don’t necessarily have to position it just behind your hairline. Depending on the design of your headband, you may want to push it forward to create a tiara effect or push it back further so the embellished details are closer to the updo itself.








If you’re wearing a fabric or stretchy headband with your updo, you may way to use a few bobby pins to pin the band in place at the sides of your head or the nape of your neck to secure it.

, It’s easy for strands of hair to slip loose from an updo, so it’s a good idea to use hairspray before you leave the house. Opt for a flexible hold spray, though, so you hair won’t feel stiff or crunchy.

Look for skirts that have a bow placed on the side.,
Pin a small bow to the top your skirt or jeans, slightly askew from the center front but not quite to the center side.,
Thread a long sash or ribbon through the belt loops on your pants.,
Buy a pair of heels that have ribbons or laces that tie into a bow above your ankle.,
Look for a pair of flats or heels that have a small, decorative bow detail on the front of the shoe.,
Spruce up an old pair of flats by gluing or pinning a small bow to the front.",How to Update Your Fashion Wardrobe With Bows2," This is one of the easiest ways to incorporate a bow into your look, and the added dimension helps break up your torso. Avoid this look if you have wide hips, however, since a large bow at your hips may add unwanted volume.

, Stick with a smaller bow to avoid adding too much bulk to your hips. This option works best if you have a tucked-in shirt, making the bow on your skirt visible.

, Tie the ribbon into a large bow at the front or side, depending on what position suits your tastes best. This is a cute, simple alternative to a standard belt.

, The maturity of the heel nicely offsets the girlishness of the bow, preventing your look from becoming too childish.

, This is another way to introduce bows into your ensemble without overwhelming your look.

, Make sure you choose a simple pair of shoes that are still in fair condition.

, A stylish bag will accentuate the playfulness of the bow while giving it a chic twist.

, A black or white clutch works well with dressier outfits, and the addition of a small bow often looks classy and timeless. Alternatively, choose a small purse with a dainty shoulder strap for the same effect.

Do a front tie bandana look.,
Wear the bandana in front of your face.,
Wear the bandana cowboy style.,
Make French knot.",How to Wear Bandanas2," A front tie bandana look is an easy and classic way to wear a bandana around your neck. To make this look, fold the bandana in half corner to corner to make a triangle. Drape the triangle over your shoulders, then bring in the two corners and tie them at the front of your neck.

As with all clothing items, the most important rule is to wear something that fits!


Wear clothes to flatter your neck. If you have a short neck, you want to avoid turtlenecks, or anything that cuts off your neck. Instead go for low plunging tops or tops with items that draw the eyes down (necktie or button down shirt, for guys).
Wear clothes to flatter your shoulders. If you have narrow shoulders, you can wear items that make your shoulders look more broad. Good examples include shirts that puff slightly at the shoulder or include a small amount of padding or structure to the shoulder. Avoid these same things if you want to play down your shoulders.
Use stripes. You can also use stripes to your advantage, to make you look taller, thinner, or to make your shoulders look more narrow or more broad. Wider stripes will make your shoulders look more broad, while thinner ones will make you look narrower. Similarly, narrow stripes make you look taller and thinner, while wider stripes or horizontal stripes will make you look wider and shorter.
Wear clothes to flatter your waist. Generally, you want to wear clothes that are fitted at your natural waist. Covering up a tummy with baggy clothes tends to make women look pregnant. Men can get away with it a bit more. Use contrasting belts to draw attention to a small waist. Both genders will also want to avoid large prints if they've got extra space in the stomach region, as this just adds imaginary weight.
Wear clothes to flatter your hips. Men: if you're pretty bootylicious, you're going to want to skip double vented coats and suit jackets.If you want to make narrow hips look more round, go for cuts that flow out at the hip. Those with too much hip should instead wear darker colors on the bottom and bright colors with bold prints on top.;
, The items that you wear on the bottom of your body, whether it's a skirt or slacks, also conform to a certain set of rules about what makes your body look best. As with all clothing items, the most important rule is to wear something that fits!


Flatter your bottom. Rule number one is definitely to wear pants that fit, no matter the but size. If you want yours to look more shapely and you're a person of a lady-like persuasion, go for full shirts (either short or long). Either gender can go jeans with very structured and thick pockets, to create the illusion of shape. For those with a little too much bum, go for dark pants. Many of these same rules apply for flattering your hips.Wear clothes that fit your height. Narrow, thin stripes will make you look taller, so avoid these if you're already towering over your peers. Wider stripes or horizontal stripes, however, will make you look shorter and fatter. Play with either stripe in order to achieve a look that works for you.

, Colors can make a huge difference in how we look. Wearing a bad color can make you look washed out and sickly, or draw attention to blemishes in your skin. Good colors can draw attention to your best features and make you look fresh and awake. What colors are good or bad for you, however, depend on a lot of factors but the general rule of thumb is that high contrast is your friend.


Warm skin tones (naturally look better in gold): wear colors like reds, yellows, and olive greens.
Cool skin tones (naturally look better in silver): wear colors like purples, blues, and teals.
Try to highlight your best features. If you have a bright eye color, such as blue or green, where colors that are similar in order to draw that color out.
Try to downplay bad features. If your skin is naturally ashy, avoid washed out colors like pastels. If you have blemishes or a red face, avoid reds and pinks, as they will make the problem look worse.

, You want to generally make your base wardrobe using pieces of clothing that don't go out of style. This will keep you looking good (you won't be embarrassed 20 years from now, when you look back on pictures with your kids). It will also help you save money and reduce waste. Mix in trendy pieces and swap them out for the newer fads as time passes, but keep the main bulk of your wardrobe classic.

, With your color palette chosen using the advice in the previous section, you're now going to apply that as you create your wardrobe. By keeping all of the colors in your minimalist wardrobe in the same family (warm or cool), you'll be able to ensure that every piece matches with almost every other piece, and they can freely be switched around to create tons of different outfits.

, A few standard tops can be mixed and matched to work in any season, in any regions. You can also mix and match for more or less formal occasions. This means just a few pieces will get you through almost any given day!


Get a few basic tees and tanks. Get tee shirts and tank tops (or other warm-weather shirts) that look good on you. You'll want some in neutral colors and some in more interesting colors.
Get some fancy tops. You'll then want to get some fancier shirts. These are the kinds of shirts that you might wear to a nice bar or to a cocktail party. Choose these in sensual or dark colors.
Get some basic button-downs. You'll want several pairs of basic button down shirts. Depending on the weather in your area, these can be long or short sleeve, or a mix of the two. Have most in white, but a few can be colored or black.
Get some sweaters. Now you'll want some sweaters. How heavy duty these are and how many you get will depend on the weather in your area. Have at least one cardigan (button down sweater) and one full sweater. More than one of each is a good idea, so that you can have one of each in a neutral color and one of each in a brighter color.

, Just like the tops, a few standard bottoms can be mixed and matched to work just about anywhere.


Get a few pairs of jeans. Get several pairs of jeans that fit well. At least 3 is a good number, more if you wear jeans every day. Try to err on the side of darker blue jeans with similarly dark seams. This are less prone to going out of style and they make just about everyone look thinner. At least one of these pairs might need to be shorts if your weather gets warm enough to ever need shorts.
Get a pair of slacks. Now you'll want a pair or two of slacks. The best bet is one pair of black (thinly pinstriped, if you want to look taller and thinner) slacks and one pair of grey or brown slacks (depending on your chosen color scheme).
Get a pair of khakis. You'll also want one pair of khakis. These are useful for weddings and spring or summer events (like Easter gatherings). They're also great for interviews. Khakis are easy to dress up or down, so having one pair will make your life easier.

, If you're a guy, just get one suit that fits you well. Girls, however, will probably want a couple of dresses for certain occasions.


Get a formal dress. One formal dress, usually a nice cocktail dress in black, will be useful for semi-formal events. With the right jewelry and the right dress, it may even be able to pass for more formal situations, depending on the particulars.
Get a day dress. Now get a dress that is more casual but still pretty. This one will be used for both nice summer days but also for events like weddings and garden parties.
Get a short dress. If you want to, you can get one short dress. This can be worn over jeans or leggings for a cute look to go to the mall, or it can be worn on it's own to go clubbing.

, Accessories are a great area to let your own personality shine through. You can get sunglasses, scarves, hats, purses, watches, and other items that show who you are.


Don't forget, ladies, to get some jewelry. Adding fancy jewelry can help make a more casual outfit look super dressed up. Use this to your advantage!

, You'll want a few pair of shoes to make sure you're ready for any situation you encounter. Be careful with colored shoes: they can be your friend or your enemy. You just have to get them to match!


Get two pairs of casual shoes. Get these in either brown or black/white, depending on the color palette you chose. You can also get them in colors, but be aware that they might now match as well.
Get two pairs of formal shoes. Get one pair in either brown or black, depending on the color palette you chose. Get a second pair in a more interesting color or just get more of the brown/black.

, Now you can mix and match these pieces to get tons of different outfits for different situations. Of course, you will have to supplement with clothes for workouts or lounging, but these should cover most of your ""going outside"" situations.


For example, for a spring/semi-formal outfit, women can wear the day dress, fancy shoes, cardigan as needed, and nice jewelry. Men can wear nice shoes, khakis, and a tee shirt or tank with the cardigan on top.
Another example would be a summer/casual outfit. Men can wear jeans, and a tank top or tee with casual shoes. Women can wear the short dress with shorts underneath and casual shoes.
Women can wear slacks, the fancy top, and the cardigan on top. Men can wear a button-down top and slacks. Both would wear form shoes and accessories.

, Semi-formal attire can be confusing, since these days it generally means formal. Basically think of full formal as being ball gowns and your nicest tux (with cuff links!). Semi-formal, then, becomes cocktail dresses and suits with colorful button down shirts (tie optional).

, It's business...but it's casual? Seems like it would be a huge contradiction, right? It's not as complex as it sounds. Generally, you take one half of your outfit and make it more casual, while maintaining business attire on the other.


For example, jeans, formal shoes, a button down shirt (no tie), and suit jacket.
Another example would be wearing formal pants and shoes but a more party-friendly blouse (as long as it's not revealing).

, Of course, dressing for a party is a bit complicated. It really depends on what kind of party it is! Know ahead of time whether it's a costume or not. Beyond that, always err on the side of too-formal. Dressing slightly nicer than what you expect everyone else will be dressed as. If you're over-dressed, just say that you so rarely get an excuse to dress nice, you wanted to take the chance.

, You can probably guess that it would be in bad form to dress in all black for a wedding, unless you're one of the guys putting on a tux....but beyond that, you're clueless. The best advice is to dress semi-formal and in pastel, happy colors. Woman should avoid going to bright and should never wear mostly white, as this is seen as trying to draw attention away from the bride.

, Dressing like a pro for an interview is one of the most important things you can do to land a job. But how exactly do you dress? Like with a party, it's a good idea to dress just a little bit nicer than is maybe necessary. Dress not like how you would expect to dress in that position, but rather dress how you would expect to if you were going to have your new boss' job.

Marks made with these pencils also don't indent the paper, which is helpful when you want to add color to the image. A good quality eraser and thick paper are also important materials to have if you want your sketch to look professional.


If you don’t have the right type of pencil, you can do a sketch with a number 2. Just remember to make very light marks, rather than pressing hard on the page.
Drawing in pen is not advisable, since you won’t be able to erase marks you make.
You will also need colored markers, inks or paints to illustrate your clothing designs.;
, The model for your design, called a croquis, should be drawn in a pose that will show off the items best. You can show the model walking, sitting, bending, or in any other position. As a beginner, you may want to start with the most common pose, which is a runway sketch that shows a model standing or striding on a runway. This is easiest to draw and it will allow you to illustrate all of your designs in full view.


Since you want to illustrate your designs in a way that makes them look professional and appealing, it's important to model them on croquis that are well-proportioned and well-drawn.
Many fashion illustrators practice drawing hundreds of croquis to perfect their ability to create a variety of poses.

, It's nice to be able to draw your own croquis, since it allows you to create a model to the exact proportions you want. However, if you want to jump straight to drawing your clothing designs, there are a few shortcuts you can opt to take:


Download one online, where you'll find them in a range of shapes and sizes. For instance, you can download a croquis in the shape of a child, a man, a petite woman, and so on.
Make a croquis by tracing the outline of a model from a magazine ad or another picture. Just place a piece of tracing paper over the model you like and lightly created an outline.

, This is a the first line of your sketch, and it represents your model’s center of gravity. Draw it from the top of the head to the tip of the toes, along the backbone of your croquis. Now draw an oval to represent the head. This is the base of your croquis, and from this, a proportional drawing can be made. You can think of the croquis as the skeleton of the model.


The balance line should be a straight vertical line, even if you want the model to pose in a leaning position. For example, if you want the the model to be posed with her hips tilted slightly to her left, draw a straight balance line in the middle of the page. You want this line to extend from the top of the model's head to the ground that she is standing on.
Note that when you’re designing clothes, a proportional model isn't required, because the clothing is what is being showcased, not your figure drawing skills. Don’t worry too much about creating an accurate looking model or adding features to the face.

, Draw a square with equal side lengths on the balance line just below the middle, where the pelvis is naturally positioned on the body. Size the square according to how wide you want your model to be. A thinner model would have a smaller square width than a plus-sized model.


Keeping your desired pose in mind, tilt this pelvic square either left or right. For example, if you want your model’s hips slanted to the left, tilt the square slightly to the left. If you want a normal standing model, just draw the square upright without any angles left or right.

, Extend the torso lines upward from the two corners of the pelvic square. The torso should extend upwards, bending in midway at the waist and extending out again at the shoulder. As with a real human body, the shoulders should be the same width as the hips, or the top of the pelvic box.


When you’re finished, the torso should look like a normal torso you would see on a body. Refer to pictures of models in magazines or advertisements for reference. Notice how the waist is smaller than the lower portion of the body and hips. The torso should measure about two heads in length.
It’s common to sketch the shoulders and hips tilted in opposite directions, in a position called contrapposto, or counterpose. This gives the impression of movement. Draw the waist as a horizontal line that’s shorter than the shoulder and hips lines.
Pay attention to bend lines (the curve of the rib cage, etc.) as those angles and lines are crucial to creating a figure that doesn't look like it has dislocated body parts.

, The model's neck should be a third the width of the shoulder and half the length of a head. After drawing this, sketch in the head, which should be in proportion to the body. The bigger the head, the more juvenile or younger the model looks.


You can erase the initial oval you drew to represent the head.
Draw the head so that it looks natural with the pose you have selected. You can tilt it slightly up or down, or to the right or left.

, The legs should be the longest part of the body, the length of about four heads. The legs are also portioned into two pieces, the thighs (from the bottom of the pelvic box to the top of knees) and calves (from the bottom of knees to beginning of ankles). Keep in mind that fashion illustrators usually exaggerate the model's height by making her legs longer than her torso


The top of each thigh should be approximately the same width as the head. Taper the width of each leg from the thigh to the knee. By the time you reach the knee, the leg should be one third the width of the bigger portion of the thigh.
To draw the calves, taper down to the ankles. Each ankle should be about one fourth the width of the head.

, The feet are relatively narrow. Draw them like elongated triangles that are about the same length as the head. Construct the arms like the legs, tapered toward the wrists. Make them longer in proportion to the torso than a real person’s arms would be, since this gives a more stylized impression. Add the hands and fingers last.

, Think about what look you’re trying to create, and represent it down to the last detail. If you’re designing a dress, for example, add patterns, ruffles, text, bows, and so on to create a beautiful piece. Focus on the elements of your design that are unique, and include appropriate accessories so that the style you’re going for is clear.If you need some fresh ideas or don't know where to start, look up fashion trends on the internet or in magazines for inspiration.

, Since the purpose of a fashion drawing is to showcase your design ideas, use a bolder hand when you’re drawing the clothing. Sketch the clothes so that they appear to hang on the croquis in a realistic way. There should be creases around the elbows and at the waist, as well as near the shoulders, ankles and wrists. Think about how clothing hangs on a person and replicate that on your model.


Remember that different fabrics and structures lie on the body in different ways. If the fabric is thin and silky, it will rest on the body and drift away, almost billowing. If the fabric is thick like denim or wool, it will be boxier and will show less shape of the body (think denim jackets).
Try to illustrate the texture of the fabric you’re drawing, whether it’s smooth, coarse, stiff or soft. Add details like sequins and buttons to make the drawing look more realistic., Use different types of lines to create different creases in the fabric you're drawing. Knowing how to draw folds, wrinkles and pleats will help you illustrate the structure of the garment.Folds can be drawn using loose, wavy lines.
Use circular patterns to show wrinkles.
Take out a straight edge to draw exact pleats.

, If your design includes a patterned or printed fabric, it's important to accurately illustrate how it will look on a model. Start by drawing the outline of the patterned garment, such as a skirt or blouse. Divide it into a grid with different sections. Fill in the sections one at a time with the pattern on the fabric.


Pay attention to how folds, pleats and wrinkles change the appearance of a pattern. It may need to bend or be cut off at certain points to look accurate.
Take the time to draw the pattern in detail and make sure it looks the same across the entire grid.

, Use thick black ink or paint on the lines that you want to keep. You can erase the body shaping lines and any stray pencil marks at this point. Finally, carefully color in the clothing using hues you want your designs to have.


You can color in the clothing with markers, ink or paint. Mix colors and use a variety of shades to illustrate your designs.
Really imagine the design moving towards you under spotlights on a runway when you’re working on shading and texture. Deeper folds in fabric will result in darker shades of the color you're using. Where fabric is hit by the light, the colors should appear lighter.
Adding features like hair, sunglasses and makeup is a nice final touch that will make your fashion sketch come to life.

, In addition to making a fashion illustration, you may want to create a flat schematic. This is an illustration of your clothing design that shows the flat outline of the garment, as though it were laid out on a flat surface. It's helpful for people viewing the design to see the flat version as well as the way it would look modeled on a body.Flats should be drawn to scale. Make an effort to create illustrations that look as exact as possible.You should include a back view of your flats as well, especially of the back of the design includes unique details."

Wrap the pre-wrap around your thigh twice.,
Roll the pre-wrap down your leg.,
Put your new headband on.",How to Use Pre Wrap As a Headband Without Tying a Knot1," Then, simply rip it off of the roll (it should come off easily). After you’ve practiced this entire process enough times, you may want to adjust the length of the pre-wrap based on what you find works best for you.;
, Do this in the same way that you’d roll a bandana up. Slip it right off when it reaches your foot.

, It might be helpful for you to practice this at home a few times before you wear it to a game. That way, you'll know if the fit needs any adjusting.

Try your headband out with different hairstyles.,
Mix up your colors.,
Coordinate colors with your teammates.",How to Use Pre Wrap As a Headband Without Tying a Knot2," You'll probably want to wear it with a ponytail during games, but there's no need to stop there. Here are some ideas:


If you have short hair, you can still rock a pre-wrap headband. Just brush your hair like you normally would and place the headband so it sits at the top of your head. You can also use your headband to embellish different kinds of up-dos. Try a low ponytail, bun or chignon. Once you've put your hair up and styled it, put the headband on and secure it with some bobby pins. If you want to keep your hair down, you can still use the pre-wrap headband to push your bangs back. Simply pull the headband up over your face, then use it to push your hair back until the headband is a few centimeters past your hairline.

, Since pre-wrap is fairly cheap and it comes in an entire rainbow of hues, you can easily collect your favorites (some pre-wrap is even sold in packs of several colors). Try wearing two different pre-wrap headbands at once in shades that you think look good together – or your team's colors!

, Get your team together and think of ways that you can use your pre-wrap headbands to stand out from the crowd. Pick a day when you'll all wear the same color; you could choose one color for home games and another for away games. Or, if you have two team colors, half of you could wear one and the other half the other.

Make sure it can be cleaned.,
Remove any extras.,
Brush the hat.,
Vacuum an extremely dusty hat.,
Clean the hat with a peroxide solution.,
Clean the hat with soap solution.,
Rinse and dry the hat.",How to Clean Straw Hats1," Look to see if the hat has a label of some sort. You might be able to find this under the brim. Once you find it, see if your hat is made up of baku, shantung, or any other material that can be washed with water. It is possible to have a straw hat that cannot be hand-washed. This probably will not be the case.;
, Sometimes straw hats will have bands, ribbons, or other decorative pieces on them. If possible, you will want to remove these extra pieces. Don’t do this if the decorations are interwoven into the hat!


Cleaning the ribbon isn’t difficult! You can dust and hand-wash it. Use a brush to lightly dust away anything that has ended up on the cloth. Also, you can spot clean the ribbon with a wet cloth. After you clean or dust the ribbon, you should use a small amount of steam to freshen it up. You might also try using an iron on a medium setting to go over the ribbon.

, The hat will probably have excess dirt and dust on it. So, you should use a soft bristle brush to scrub that dust and dirt away. You can generally find these at hardware and beauty supply stores. Gently brush the grime off. You don’t want to be too rough, because you can end up harming the fabric of the hat.

, For an incredibly dusty hat, you may need an extreme solution. You can try placing netting or pantyhose over a vacuum brush, then using a vacuum on the hat. Again, this should only be used in extreme cases.

, Combine equal parts hydrogen peroxide and warm water in a bowl or bottle.Then, you should either spray a soft cleaning cloth with the bottle, or dip a cloth in the bowl.


Don’t use a colored cloth because its dye will bleed into your hat. Test a small area of the hat with the solution to make sure it does not damage the hat. Once this has been verified, begin wiping the hat with the cloth. Swipe off as much dirt and grime as possible.
Make sure that your cloth is damp, but not soaked. You don’t want to get your hat extremely wet.

, Combine a tablespoon of dish soap with a cup of hot water in a bowl or bottle.As you did before, dip your cloth in the bowl or spray your cloth with the bottle. Again, verify that the solution will not ruin your hat by placing a small amount on your hat. Rub the cloth in a circular motion to remove the dirt.

, While most straw hats should not be rinsed, this is a good option if the hat's label clearly says that it is OK to submerge it in water. Fill a bowl with warm water. Dip a cloth in the bowl, take it out, and run it over the entire hat. Put the hat in a cool place, preferably under a shadow, to let it dry. If your hat’s brim is curved, do not lay it on a flat surface."

Consider your lifestyle.,
Set fashion goals.",How to Develop Your Sense of Style1," Lay your favorite clothes on your bed or on a table. Choose pieces that you like or wear often. Look at all the possible combinations of clothing, and see if you tend towards a particular style (such as bohemian, rock chick, vintage, geek chic, etc.). Note which pieces are your favorite, and ask yourself why. Once you determine this, you can start looking for pieces that have similar features. For each individual article of clothing, you should note the:



Fit: How does the piece adhere to your body? Is it tight in certain places or baggy? Does it flare at the hips, or is it a straight piece?

Texture: Does the material lie flat, or is there a 3D effect? Are there ruffles, ruching, or pleats? Are there sequins, rhinestones, or other embellishments?

Color: Is it a neutral, such as black, navy, khaki, or white? Is it a jewel tone, such as teal, emerald green, or gold? Or is it a pastel, such as mint, light pink, or lavender?

Print: Is it patterned or solid? Are the stripes vertical, horizontal, diagonal, or a mix? Is there a flower or animal print? Are there blocks of color?;
, Think about the specific terms you want others to say about you. For example, perhaps you want to appear bubbly and friendly. Maybe you want to be called sophisticated and daring. You might even want to look intelligent and sensible. Write these words down in a list, and think about your style choices can help you fulfill these terms.

, There are many different categories of fashion that can help you refine your search for the perfect style. You may find that you conform to just one archetype or that there are many that fit your personality. Some popular ones include:Classic: you may have a conservative style. You may tend towards neutral colors with minimal decorations. Your clothing may be described as professional.Trendy: you may like to follow the latest fashions, and your clothing changes based on what's popular on the red carpet.

Romantic: if you're a woman, you may tend towards flowing or ruffled pieces. If you're a man, you may be attracted to old fashioned suits and vintage attire.

Bohemian: you may like baggier clothing with distinctive patterns such as paisley or tie-dye. Your clothing may appear rustic or outdoorsy. You might consider yourself a nature lover.

Sporty: You may tend to wear active wear as your casual clothing. You may wear tennis shoes around town, and you may enjoy outdoor activities.

, Think about the different types of clothing you need for various situations in your life.Write down all of the different social and professional situations you find yourself in during a typical week. Think about how you dress for each.How do you dress for work?
How do you dress to run errands?
What types of activities do you do with friends? How do you dress for each?
What types of special events (such as weddings) are you invited to? What do you wear there?

, Once you have examined what you like about your wardrobe, think about what you don’t like. Identify those gaps in your style that you want to fill.

Some ideas:


“I will find clothes that better fit me.”“I will buy more jackets and clothing that I can layer.”
“I will find more accessories that I can mix and match.”
“I will increase my shoe selection.”

Go clothes shopping!,
Have the right footwear.,
Accessorize.",How to Develop a Good Fashion Sense," It may seem boring and just like a chore, but will be useful and make looking through your clothes much easier. Take out everything and put on the bed. If something no longer fits or you just don't like it anymore, then put in a plastic bag ready to take to the appreciative charity shop. There's nothing wrong with getting rid of unwanted clothes. Tutus,stripy tights and woolly jumpers may have been your thing back then, but chances are you have moved onto other stuff,which is fine. If you find clothes which are too badly ripped,damaged,stained or worn for someone to wear or ever look good again, use as rag or put them in the bin. Now to organizing. You could fold jeans, dresses or skirts in one area and hoodies, jumpers,t-shirts and vests in another. If you have a wardrobe, you could fold items such as jeans, dresses, skirts, next to that fold up hoodies and jumpers and hang t-shirts and vests up on hangers. Put your underwear somewhere private and shoes maybe in a drawer. If you find any dirty clothes, take to the washing. Iron and put away.;
, There are so many to choose from- Girly, Rock, Emo, Parisian Chic, Glamorous, Casual.. the list goes on. Also, there's prints, patterns,pictures and textures to think about. Look at the internet or magazines for inspiration, and think about how you could put outfits together.

, It's a perfect opportunity to seek out some bargains and find pieces you love. Don't feel that you have to go to really expensive stores- TXMAXX, Primark and New Look are all great as they have loads of clothes,shoes etc, as well as some great jewelry. Shop wherever you want, and you can buy anything. Some great things to own as essentials are below, as long as some others which are just for fun but will add a real interest and look to your wardrobe.


Jeans- boot cut, wide leg or skinny.
Hoodies- like jumpers and cardigans, they come in bright colors and are casually cosy.
Jumpers- forget heavy, itchy uncomfortable sweaters- a colorful, stretchy one in either V/round necked is much better.
Cardigans- so cardigans may not be your idea of fashion, but have you considered long ones? They are simple but elegant.
T-shirts/shirts/vests- some basic ones in block colors like blue, green, red, white and black are good and you could get some with really cool pictures or patterns which look great on everyone.
Dresses/skirts- they don't have to be plain or boring! Dresses with a plain top but a ruffle/any other effect skirt look amazing, and you can choose from classic styles to more modern trends. Skirts don't come in just plain black or cotton- how about a colorful pattern? One big print? High or low waistband? They aren't essential but for a party or glamorous event, they are a good choice.
Pyjamas- still look good at nighttime! A pair which are quite heavy should be worn in winter but for spring/summer when its getting a bit hotter, a lighter pair are good to have as spares. Find a pair with a really sweet design.
Underwear- should fit perfectly, and not be boring! There are lots of of knicker and sock styles, and bras should be supportive and so you can't' feel them very much, i.e. not too small or too big.

, Now for shoes. Sneakers, trainers, pumps, heels, sandals etc are all in the shops. For a rock and roll twist, biker/military lace up boots look good teamed with something simple and to wear with almost anything, a pair of awesome Converse All Star in your favorite color. Shoes make a real statement, so have fun finding some nice ones.

, Bead bracelets and bangles look great worn as a set. Charms are cute. Long pendants or big chunky necklaces worn against a simple top make a maximum impact. Earrings and rings are pretty. Details like flowers, stars, flowers, prints and even your favorite things look amazing on jewelry too.

Start by acquiring different pieces of different styles.,
Even though it's hard, pick ONE fashion style that you like the best and use that as your main style.,
Incorporate other parts of other fashions into your outfits.,
Go shopping with friends so they can help you decide what looks best on you.,
Change things slowly.,
Keep your personality the same.",How to Combine Fashions," Maybe you like intricate black jewelry, neon skinny jeans, and pink frilly shirts? Buy whatever it is that you like, and make sure not to follow the crowd. Trends are bad to follow too, as you're constantly changing and spending money. Only follow trends that you like, but remember that trends mean everyone is doing them so you aren't unique in that way.;
, It makes you look like an indecisive, fashion wanna-be if you change schemes everyday or week. If you can't decide, go with either a fashion that fits your personality, or one that's the total opposite of your personality (so that people are surprised when they find out you're actually a very tough girl under all that pink!).

, You can wear neon blue skinny jeans, platform boots, pearls, an off the shoulder dark blue shirt, and a flower headband all at once. Just make sure your outfit mostly resembles that of the fashion scheme that you picked. Don't be afraid to change it up and lean towards another style you've incorporated some days, it's all about what you want to do!

, Even if you really like something, it serves no purpose if it doesn't look good on you. Honest friends will actually tell you if they think something doesn't fit your figure. Also, never buy anything that you plan to wear once you lose ten pounds; there's a lot of reasons why. It could take you (depending on your personality) a year to lose the pounds, and by the time you pull out the clothing, you'll find it's out of style/you may not like it. Or you might not even end up losing the pounds!

, You don't want to rush into this, because not only will you come off as a fake, you might make some major fashion mistakes. Try starting off with changing the accessories, like headbands and jewelry, move onto accessory clothing, like vests and jackets, and then the core clothing.

, If you like to run around and scream whilst wearing chains and lace, continue to do so! Same with dressing totally girly, while being into football and sports. Just because you change your outfit doesn't mean you need to change your personality. You should feel happy and freer with your new fashion choices!

Reconsider the dishwasher.",How to Clean a White Hat1," Before you decide to wash a white hat, you should carefully examine it. Look at how the hat is stitched, at the headband, and at the brim. If the hat appears to be constructed of quality material, has durable stitching, and has a plastic brim, it is a good candidate for washing.Do not attempt to wash a hat with a cardboard visor.
Avoid washing a hat if it has loose or flimsy stitching.;
, You will need to figure out what type of material the hat is made of. Look at the tag or printing inside the hat.

Then, blend it into your skin with a brush., Wait until your foundation dries completely before applying powder. Use loose powder, as this will appear the most natural on your face. Powder will prevent eyeshadow from smudging. If any makeup is misapplied, simply brush it away with a makeup brush.Loose powders come in two forms: translucent and colored. Colored works to correct tone, brighten your face, and reduce redness. Translucent powders are your best bet for the 60’s look because they don't change the color of the foundation., Draw a thin line with your black eyeliner on your upper lash line, and gradually thicken it as you grow closer to the outside of your eye.Use a black eyeliner pencil to maintain control. Liquid eyeliner can also work, but it is much more difficult to draw with, and not as easily removed.
If you make a mistake, use a dampened cotton swab to dab at and remove the makeup.

, Draw a thin, diagonal line, forming a wing on the side of your eye. The diagonal should be about 45 degrees up from your eyelid, and the line should be drawn in the direction of your eyebrow, but should end before the eyebrow. Be sure that the wing is extended in proportion with your eye size and shape.Keep your eyelid flat while drawing the wing. Tilt your head back and keep your eye slightly open as you apply the liner, if you find that it helps.
Keep your hand steady. Rest your elbow on a flat surface while you draw to reduce the chance of errors.

, Use your eyeliner pencil to smooth out and fill in the corner where the wing extends toward your eyebrow. The thinnest part of the eyeliner should be nearest to the corner of your eyelid. It should appear to thicken as it extends past your eye.

, This should extend along the waterline of your eye, and will help make your eyes seem brighter and more exaggerated., To add more drama to your eyes, paint on your lower lashes. This will allow the lashes to appear magnified, and attention-grabbing., Use liquid eyeliner to make sure that each line is thicker at the top near your eye and tapers to a thin point. Draw a few extending bottom lashes with the liquid liner., If you would rather, you can use fake lashes instead of simply the liquid eyeliner.

Find a quiet, comfortable place to talk.,
Adopt a casual, neutral tone.,
Give advice, not orders.,
Compromise with your teen.",How to Deal with Your Teen's Fashion Choices1," If you decide to sit your teen down and discuss their fashion choices head on, you should do so in a place that will be quiet and comfortable for them. You may choose a neutral spot in your home, such as the kitchen table, the living room, or the porch. Out of respect for your teen, you may ask to speak to them in your room so they are in a comfortable space. Opt for a time when your teen will be home and the house will be quiet, such as after school or after dinner.You may start the conversation with your teen by saying, “Can we chat for a second?” or “Can I talk to you about something?”
You may also opt for bringing up the issue when your teen is getting dressed for school or another event. This may make the conversation feel more natural and casual.;
, Go into the conversation with a casual tone that is not accusatory or defensive. You want your teen to feel like you are having an open discussion, not a lead up to a fight or a conversation where you are telling them what to do. Open the talk with a casual comment so your teen does not get defensive or upset right away.


For example, you may say to your teen, “I just wanted to chat with you about your latest fashion choices. Can we talk about them?” Or you may say, “Tell me about why you’re dressing this way these days. Are you getting into a new style?”

, Frame the conversation so you are giving them advice and not simply telling them what they can and cannot do. Avoid stating, “You are forbidden to wear this outfit” or “You are not allowed to wear that clothing.” Instead, go for phrases that sound suggestive and persuasive.For example, you may say, “I like that shirt but your jeans seems a little low, no? Maybe put on a belt to keep your pants up?” or “That’s a great dress, I just worry it may not be long enough for school. Maybe wear some tights with it?”

, Your teen may not be very open to your suggestions on their wardrobe and that is their right. Trying to control what they wear will only lead to more arguments and anger from both you and your teen. Instead, you may try compromising with your teen so you both get what you want in some way. This can also show your teen that you respect them and want to treat them like an adult.For example, if your teen does not want to change a low cut top, you may compromise and ask them to wear a sweater with the top so they are not showing as much skin. You may say, “How about you wear a sweater with that top and we’ll call it even?” or “Can you wear a sweater that that top? I’d feel much better about your outfit if you did that.”

Replace the tape frequently to ensure that you remove as much as possible., Use a dry, clean cloth to brush dried dirt, dust, or debris off your hat. Dried dirt may flake off easily as you wipe it. For stubborn dust, wet the cloth so that it is moist, but not saturated, and wipe your hat."

Measure your forehead.,
Measure your cheekbones.,
Measure your jawline.,
Measure your face-length.,
Ask yourself three questions.,
Look for an “oval face.” An oval face will have a length that is roughly one and half times greater than your face width.,
Look for a “round face.” A round face will be the same width and length.,
Look for an “oblong face.” An oblong face will be longer than it is wide.,
Look for a “heart-shaped face.” This face shape is very common.,
Look for a “square face.” A square-shaped face has a length almost equal to its width.,
Look for a “triangle face.” Triangular faces will be characterized by a large jawline, slightly smaller cheekbones, and smallest forehead.,
Choose hats for an “oval face.” Feel free to try all kinds of hats!,
Choose hats for a “round face.” Add some asymmetry to your look.,
Choose hats for an “oblong face.” Try a hat with a flared brim and low crown, such as a sunhat, a cloche, or a fedora with a large brim.,
Choose hats for a “heart-shaped face.” Go with a medium brimmed hat, such as a fedora with a medium sized brim, a boater, a cloche, a homburg, a beanie, or a beret.,
Choose hats for a “square face.” Experiment with circular styles.,
Choose hats for a “triangle face.” Feel free to try many hats.",How to Choose Hats for Your Face Shape," Using a tape measure, measure across your forehead. Measure from the peak of one eyebrow arch to the arch-peak of the opposite eyebrow. Write down that number., Using a tape measure, measure the distance across your upper cheeks. Start and end at the bump below the outside corner of each eye. Write down that number., Using a tape measure, measure from the bottom tip of your chin to the bottom of your ears. Stop at the place where your jaw angles upward. Multiply that number by two. Write down that number. This is your “jawline.”, Using a tape measure, measure from the center of your forehead (at your hairline) to the bottom tip of your chin. Write down that number., Using these measurements as a guide, ask yourself the following:What is the widest part of my face?
What is the shape of my jaw?
How long is my face? Is it longer than it is wide, and if so, by how much?

, The forehead is a bit larger than the jawline, and the angle of the jaw is a bit more round. An oval face will look like an egg., A round face has a round chin, full cheeks, and a round hairline. It makes you look younger than other shapes., The forehead, cheekbones, and jawline of an oblong face will be similar in size. Oblong faces may feature high foreheads., In a heart-shaped face, the chin is the narrowest part. A heart-shaped face has a broad forehead and/or wide cheekbones, and pointy chin., The distance from forehead to chin and from cheek to cheek are roughly the same., A triangle face may be any length. Triangle-shaped faces are also known as pear shaped faces., You are blessed with a very versatile look! Pick up whatever suits your mood, as long as the hat is in harmony with your outfit. Women with oval faces can top off any hat.The possibilities are limitless! It only depends on your personal preferences.
Experiment with earrings, necklaces, and bracelets.

, You can perfectly handle a fedora, a newsboy hat, or a baseball cap. This symmetrical face cries out for a new angle: asymmetry. The roundness requires a slimming treatment.Steer clear of round crowns, which can emphasize the roundness of your face.
It is wise to select a hat with a high crown and straight brim in order to give your face more angles.
Your main goal is to choose a hat that helps distract people's attention from your facial curves.
Slanting your hat forward draws out your face and gives a touch of definition.

, The large brim of a sunhat may well offset the length of a long face.Avoid any hats with tall crowns, which only elongate your face even more.
A cloche worn low to your eyebrows can help conceal your high forehead, and, like sorcery, create an impression of shortened face.
The large brim of the fedora also counterbalances vertical curves.

, These are all good choices! These hats balance out the width of your forehead.Slanting the hat to one side will slim your face and draw attention to the eyes.
Actually, any type will work well on you except those with large brims.
Avoid shapes that accentuate the shape. Stay away from wide brims which only accentuate your forehead and narrow your chin.

, Your defined and symmetrical face requires circular features to soften the edges of the face. Round crown and brim will do the trick, smoothing a boxy face and inducing the illusion of height and roundness.Opt for a sunhat, a cowboy hat, a homburg, a cloche or a toque, which gives you a feminine and flirty touch.
A beret will elongate and cushion your facial contour.
Tilting the hat off to one side breaks up the symmetry pattern of your square face.
A sunhat with a pair of sunglasses and a flowing maxi dress adds boho-chic to your ensemble. It is a perfect combination for your beach vacation.
Don't wear a hat with a short brim, no brim or a square hat. These two types of hats will both emphasize your angular face shape.

, A triangle face is like an oval face shape that the options are virtually endless when it comes to a hat. Make sure your hat brings balance to your shoulder line, and accent to your garment. Never get close to a crown that is narrower than the cheekbones.

Set limits for your teen early.,
Outline what you consider decent and what you consider inappropriate.,
Wear clothing that you think is appropriate.,
Go shopping for clothes with your teen.",How to Deal with Your Teen's Fashion Choices2," One way you can help guide your teen’s fashion choices a bit more is to set limits around their wardrobe early. You may make suggestions on what your teen wears when they are younger in age and just starting to get into fashion. You may also help them get dressed when they are younger so you can encourage them to wear certain items of clothing and get them used to certain styles. This may make it easier for you to sway them on their fashion choices when they are older.For example, you may tell your teen, ""It is not acceptable for you to wear your pants below your waist"" or ""I am not okay with you wearing clothing that show off too much skin.""
If you have more than one child, you should set the same limits for all of your children so there is no preferential treatment. Having the same guidelines around clothing for everyone in your household can make it easier for you to enforce the same limits.

, You should also let your teen know what your expectations are around their wardrobe, even if they may not want to listen to what you have to say. Keep your expectations consistent and clear so your teen does not feel you are making them up on the fly.For example, you may tell your teen that you are not okay with low cut tops, booty shorts, or pants that sag below the waist. You may tell them you are fine with tops that fit them well but do not expose too much skin and pants that sit properly at the waist.

, You may also dress yourself in a certain way so your teen sees you in clothing that is appropriate. Practicing what you preach will set a good example for your teen and show them that they can still look polished and put together without showing too much skin.


For example, you may wear your pants with a belt to show your teen that you approve of wearing a belt with your pants so they sit at the waist. Or you may wear clothing that does not expose too much skin so your teens sees that they can dress without showing too much skin.

, Another way you can set guidelines around your teen’s fashion choices is to go shopping with them. Suggest a shopping date where you give them spending money or have them bring their own money to spend. Be willing to take your teen to where they’d like to shop and give feedback on outfits they choose. Do not try to control where they shop or what they buy. Instead, give your input and only put your foot down when absolutely necessary.For example, your teen may want to shop at a trendy boutique at the mall. They may go for clothing that you find appropriate as well as a few items you think are inappropriate. Suggest that they buy more of the appropriate items and try to convince them to only buy one inappropriate item. This way, you limit them without having them feel you are being too controlling.

Pick your battles with your teen.,
Allow your teen to wear what they find most comfortable.,
Talk about the importance of healthy self-image with your teen.",How to Deal with Your Teen's Fashion Choices3," Though you may struggle to accept your teen's clothing choices, you should try to pick your battles and not fight them on every outfit they come up with. As a parent, you may have a completely different aesthetic and sense of style than your teen. Try to accept this reality and focus on how you can support your teen as they try out different styles and fashion choices. If you really feel strongly about a certain fashion choice, perhaps that is when you can put your foot down and be firm about disagreeing with their clothing.


For example, you may tell your teen that they should wear certain clothing for certain occasions, such as black to a funeral or a formal dress for a formal event. This could be a good way to encourage your teen to wear what they want, but within a certain limit and with a certain image in mind.

, As a parent, you should also avoid trying to pressure your teen into wearing clothing they find uncomfortable or that does not fit with their style. Though you may have a certain idea of how your teen should dress, you should try to accept your teen's choices and let them where what they find comfortable. Doing this will ensure your teen does not feel stifled by you or limited by your opinion. It will give them the freedom to express themselves through their clothing.


For example, you can tell your teen, ""I am trying to support your fashion choices and I want you to feel comfortable in what you wear.""

, A big part of your teen’s fashion choices has to do with their search for identity and self-image. As a parent, you should try to accept their choices. But you can also encourage your teen to embrace a healthy self-image and good self-esteem. Sit down with your teen and talk to them about how they can cultivate healthy self-esteem. Tell them they are feel free to express themselves in their clothing and their sense of style. But also remind them that dressing in a certain way could create a self-image they may not want or intend.For example, you may tell your teen, “Don’t be afraid to express yourself in your clothing and your style. Embrace who you are. But also remember that dressing in a certain way may create a certain image that you may not want or intend.”

Use an eraser or make up sponge.,
Sprinkle corn starch on stains.,
Brush with fabric stain remover.",How to Clean a Felt Hat2," If you notice a stain on your felt hat, use a gum eraser or clean makeup sponge to remove it.

Clean the sweatband.",How to Clean a Felt Hat3," To refresh and deep clean your hat, sprinkle it with an absorbent powder. Choose a powder that is close to the color of your hat to avoid discoloration. For instance, opt for:Wheat germ for darker colored hats
Baking soda for a white hat
Corn meal for beige or tan hats

, Leave your hat for several hours to allow the powder to soak up dirt and oils efficiently. Be sure to place the hat upside down on its crown rather than on its brim. The brim can lose its shape if left on a flat surface for a long time., Shake off as much of the absorbent powder as possible. Remove the rest of the powder by using a vacuum cleaner with a detachable hose, or a cordless mini vacuum cleaner. Place a breathable cloth (such as cheesecloth) over the hose or mini vacuum to reduce the suction power and avoid damage to the hat., Turn the sweatband in your hat down to allow it to dry. This will ensure that the sweat and oils do not soak into the felt. Leave the hat to dry for several hours, or overnight., If drying out the sweatband does not effectively freshen up your hat, wash it. Avoid getting water anywhere other than the sweatband. Use a toothbrush, water and a mild soap (e.g. shampoo) to gently scrub the sweatband. Carefully rinse the sweat band and blot the hat dry. "

Use a felt hat protection spray.,
Avoid touching the top of your hat.",How to Clean a Felt Hat4," Keep your hat stored in a cool place to keep it in good shape. Heat can cause the sweatband to shrink, rendering the hat unwearable. The foyer, for example, may be an excellent spot if the heating is moderate in that area., Purchase a water-repellent felt hat protection spray to safeguard your hat. These sprays protect against rain and stains. Using these sprays extends the shelf-life of your hat., When putting on and removing your hat, avoid touching the top (the crown). The oils on your fingers or hands could transfer to the felt and leave a stain. Instead, handle your hat gently by the brim."

Check your hat's care tag.,
Fill a sink or basin with warm water.,
Add detergent.,
Spot clean problem spots.,
Be gentle on stitching.,
Soak your hat.,
Rinse off with warm water.",How to Clean a Fitted Hat1," Not all hats will have a care tag, but before you do any cleaning you should check to see if your hat does. If there is a care tag, take note of the cleaning instructions on the tag, including the water temperature and detergents you should use., Start by filling your sink or a bucket or basin with warm water. You don’t want the water to be too hot as this can cause the hat to shrink. It should be cool enough that you can put your hands in it without getting burned.Make sure you completely clean your sink before using it to wash your hat. You don’t want any food particles getting stuck to your hat.

, It’s best to use a mild laundry detergent or fabric cleaner like OxiClean. These are gentle enough to wash the hat without destroying the fabric. Add about a tablespoon (0.5 oz) of cleaner to the water as the sink fills.Don't use detergents with bleach in them as this will ruin the color of your hat.

, Dip your hat into the sink of warm water. Then dip a toothbrush or small scrubbing brush into some of the cleaner you’re using. Gently scrub the problem areas on your hat until the stains come out.A gentle shampoo is a great option for spot cleaning sweat stains on your hat.

, Most fitted hats have stitching along the edges that keep all the materials together. Avoid scrubbing this area of your hat too hard, since it can pull the stitching apart and ruin the shape of your hat., Once you’ve spot-cleaned your hat, place your hat in the water and detergent mixture and let it soak for twenty to thirty minutes. Check the hat about halfway through to see if there are still stubborn stains that aren’t coming clean. If there are, repeat the process for getting rid of stains.You might need to soak your hat for longer, depending on how dirty it is. You can leave your hat to soak for up to a couple of hours.

, Once your hat has finished soaking, rinse it thoroughly with warm, not hot, water. This should get all of the detergent off and prevent soap stains from ruining your hat as it dries. You might need to rub a the hat with your hands to make sure all of the detergent is out."

Start by considering the marching band uniforms that the hat will go with and the type of marching band the hats are for.,
Choose the type of hat.,
Decide on whether you need ""specialty"" hats for specific band members.,
Choose a color scheme.,
Choose ornaments.,
Choose a retailer and order the hats/accessories.",How to Choose Hats for Marching Band Uniforms," A band with a more ornate uniform or that competes at high levels may require a different hat than one that has a simpler uniform or performs just for fun.;
,

Shako: The most typical type of marching band hat is the Shako. These are cylindrical hats with a small visor, a chin strap, a hole for a plume, and typically some ornamentation such as a chain and emblem. These are the hats you are most likely to see in a high school marching band. Shakos are the standard, and if you are unsure of what to get they are usually a good choice. They can also be made more or less simple with decorative and plume decisions.






""Aussie"": Another type of marching band hat is the ""Aussie"" or ""cavalier"" hat. These are wide brimmed hats, typically with one side pinned up. They are usually dimpled in the top with a loose rope strap that hangs down. They can have decorative bands or plumes attached. These hats are good as a ""stand-out"" or ""trademark"" feature as they are less common. They also suit some schools' mascots or history, and may be considered a ""fun"" hat for a more relaxed band.






Helmets/Caps: Other hats include helmets or caps. These are often military inspired. If your band has a military background or uniform type, this might be appropriate. They also tend to look more formal than other hat types.






Some marching bands or groups have very unique hats. A more relaxed band may simply use a hat, such as a vintage jazz hat. Other unusual hats are those such as the British foot guards' ""bearskin"" hats. A ""busby"" hat is a tall furry hat of a similar nature, though often bearing a plume.







, Typical tuba or sousaphone players will wear a beret instead of the typical band hat. This is for ease of playing and to avoid knocking the hat off. The drum majors (or other special band leaders) may also get special hats, though not always. This can be as simple as a different coloring pattern for the hat, a different plume, or a more elaborate hat (e.g. ""royal star helmet"").

, The colors should be chosen to match the uniform. For a high school or university, school colors are typical. Black or white may also be good choices for a contrast. Try to match the exact coloring of the uniform so you don't end up with two obviously different shades. If there are buttons or other ornaments on the uniform that are one color (e.g. gold or silver) then be consistent with the hats.

,

Plumes: There are a few different type of plumes. Two typical types are feathered or ribboned. Consider what look is more appropriate for the uniform. Do research and check the durability of the plumes. A plume with feathers always flying off in performances won't be good! Consider options such as multiple colors or add ins such as metallic or colored tinsel.






Emblem or other decorative features: Your band will look more uniform and elite if your hats aren't plain or blank. School or group logos, mascots, or lettering can often be added to hats. However, keep in mind that schools sometimes change their themes and logos which could cause old hats to look outdated. A simple two or three color design, often standard when buying hats, can do the trick.







, Ordering the hats from the same place as the uniforms is often ideal as you will be more likely to be guaranteed a color match. However, a little research into price and quality of other retailers may pay out. Remember that you want these hats to last many years, so ensure that they are built to do so!

Purchase or knit your own berets.,
Fix your hair.,
Experiment different styles.,
Accessorize the beret.,
Pin the beret to your hair.",How to Wear a Beret1," Choose colors that play well against your hair color and wardrobe. Look for berets with tight brims so they'll stay on your head. Consider whether you want a thinner, lacy beret for spring and fall or a thick beret for winter.;
, You can wear your hair in almost any fashion with a beret, depending on what kind of look you're going for. If you choose a bun, make sure to place it high enough to fit inside the beret, or low enough to sit below the band. You can also do a low side ponytail or two low plaits on either side of your head. Wearing hair loose with a few large curls makes for a glamorous 1940s look.

, Show your hairline or don't. Place it in front of your ears or behind. Figure out what looks best for you. Remember that berets are traditionally worn a little lopsided. Have fun with it! Here are a few specific looks you can try:









Tuck in the brim of the beret and tilt it to one side, pulling it low over your forehead. This looks good with a low side bun or plait on the non-tilted side of the beret.
Untuck the brim of the beret and allow a little air into the hat, to create a mushroom effect. Place this on top of your head, pulled over the ears and tilted to one side, if desired. This style looks best worn with loose straightened or curled hair.
Pad out the front of the beret using a silk scarf or cotton wool to give it some lift. Set it back on your head so the front of your hair is exposed. Secure the rest of the hair at the back of your head with a loose bun, or tuck it under the beret. A finger wave or fringe roll gives an added vintage effect., If the beret seems too plain, or if your outfit needs some jazzing up, add a broach, flower pin, or bow to the hat. Bold earrings are another option. Make it your own.

, Use crisscrossed bobby pins on the hair close to your temples to secure the beret on both sides of your head. A slipping beret can mess up your hair or fall off, ruining your careful styling.

Pat dry to remove excess moisture.,
Don’t lay it flat to dry.,
Let it air dry.",How to Clean a Fitted Hat2," Once you’ve rinsed all the soap off your hat, pat it dry with a towel or paper towel to remove most of the excess moisture. You don’t need to completely dry it, but it shouldn’t be dripping wet., Laying a fitted hat to dry will ruin its shape. Instead of letting it lie flat on a counter or table, place it on top of a canister, or place some balled-up paper towel inside the hat. This will help it keep its shape as it dries.You can also purchase a Cap Buddy, which is a plastic frame that you place your hat inside of. The frame is the same shape as the cap and maintains that shape even as it dries.

, Once you’ve removed most of the excess moisture from the hat, let it dry the rest of the way in open air. This can take between a few hours and a whole day, so make sure you have plenty of time to let your hat dry.You can also wear your hat while it dries, as long as it's not dripping and the feeling of a wet hat on your head doesn't bother you.

Avoid soaking old hats.",How to Clean a Fitted Hat3," If your fitted cap is made from wool, you’ll want to use cleaner specifically made for wool products. Other detergents – even laundry detergents – will be too harsh on the wool., You can still spot clean wool hats, but be sure to be very gentle when scrubbing the hat. Wool is a very sensitive material and can easily be shredded. Use a soft bristled brush if you’re spot cleaning a wool hat., If your fitted hat is older, it might not have the technology newer hats do that prevents color bleed. Before you clean your older hat, rub a little bit of your cleaner on the underside of bill. If color comes off on your hand or towel, you can’t use detergent to clean it. Use water only instead., Most older hats have a cardboard bill, which means soaking your hat in water to clean it will ruin the hat. If you’ve performed a color test on your hat and didn’t get any bleeding color, you can use the spot treatment method for cleaning an older hat. If you did see some color bleed, use water only for spot cleaning."

, You can tighten or loosen the beret by adjusting the ribbon. Once you are happy with the fit, tie the ribbon with a ribbon knot, cut off the ends and hide the knot under the edge binding at the back of the beret.








, Military personnel with long hair should wear their hair tied back in a military bun, in a position that does not distort the appearance of the beret. Hair may not be packed into the beret. No hair should be visible below the front edge of the beret., Army officers should wear their rank, while enlisted soldiers should wear their unit insignia or unit crest, centered on the flash.

, If you are only going to start with one belt, get one that is versatile and will go with all your clothes. That means a simple leather strap, either black or dark brown, with a simple buckle. You can always buy another belt down the road and you will need to anyway as you grow.

, Try a belt on right over your pants, or through the loops if you can, with your shirt tucked in. A belt will have a buckle with a silver stick one one side, that will have to fit through the holes on the other side of the belt once it goes all the way around you. A good belt fits in the middle hole, but if you are growing fast, get one that fits in the last hole or near. It should feel tight - tight enough to keep your pants up, but not so tight that you can't breathe.


Wearing a belt may feel a little funny at first, but you'll get used to it in no time.

Remember to match your shoes with your belt. Black belt with black shoes, brown belt with brown shoes. If you are wearing sneakers then it doesn't matter.

, Braided or web belts are an option because they fit your trousers more precisely than a belt with holes, and are generally more comfortable. However, they are somewhat out of style and a flimsy cotton belt generally won't hold your pants up as well either; if you have to keep tightening it to do so, it won't be comfortable.


The material in them will also, eventually, get clumped together, requiring you to over-tighten the belt. If you can get away with a cloth belt, go for it, but it won't look good on anything but jeans or shorts.

, A new leather belt is generally pretty stiff and will feel uncomfortable for a day or so as it breaks in. Don't give up on it - give it time to soften and conform to your waist.

, Wear it whenever you're wearing pants with belt loops. Like it or not, men are generally expected to wear a belt, especially when at work or when they are dressing up a bit. In the world of employment, men are expected to wear belts with business wear, with blue-collar work wear, and any time they are expected to make an appearance.


Even if you don't feel that you need a belt to keep your pants up - it's still something that ""completes the look"" and even if your shirt isn't tucked in, a belt will probably be beneficial - very few men get away without pulling their pants up at least a few times a day.

, As you get more comfortable wearing a belt, you can start getting more belts of different colors, looks, and materials. You can get belts that are made of leather, brown or black belts, or belts that are thicker or thinner depending on what you like.

Get creative!",How to Make a Fabric Belt," If you don't already know your waist measurement (for instance, from shopping for pants), it's very easy to find. Simply grab a tape measure and loop it around your midsection at your natural waist, which is usually at the top of your hips, just below the level of your belly button.Check the measurement where the tape starts to double up on itself — this is your waist circumference.


Some women's belts are meant to be worn around the hips, rather than the waist. In this case, slide the tape measure a few inches down so that it sits naturally around the tops of your hips and measure as normal.;
, Next, find some fabric for your belt. If you don't have any spare fabric handy at home, you can usually find it for fairly cheap at arts and crafts stores (and even online).Nearly any kind of comfortable, durable fabric is suitable for your belt. Regardless of the type of fabric you choose, you'll want a strip that's about seven inches (17.7 centimeters) longer than your waist measurement and five inches (12.7 centimeters) across.Below are just a few examples of fabrics that work well for belts:


Cotton (patterned or plain; ""web"" fabric is especially durable)
Polyester
Rayon
Bamboo fabric
Wool (can be expensive)

, When you have your fabric ready to go, lay it flat on your workspace lengthwise (so that it runs from left to right) and so that its design is facing down. Fold the left and right edges of the fabric in about 1/2 inch (1.27 centimeters). Use a hot iron to crease them down. Use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to sew these folds down with about a 1/4 inch (0.76 centimeter) seam allowance.


This is done so that none of the fabric's edges are exposed in the final product. This is a basic rule of sewing — exposed fabric edges wear much faster than properly-folded seams, so they're to be avoided at all costs.

, Next, fold the top and bottom edges of the fabric in about 1/2 inch and iron them in place just as you did for the left and right edges. Next, fold the entire piece of fabric over itself lengthwise so that it looks like a long, skinny strip (with the fabric's design now facing you). Iron this fold, then sew both the bottom edge and the top (folded) edge with a 1/4 inch seam allowance.

, At this point, your belt is more or less finished. For this simple belt style, all you need to do is fasten it around your waist to wear it. If you like, you can even tie a decorative knot or bow over your waist for added flair!


If the open edges at either end of your belt's fabric bother you, you can stitch them down just as you stitched the fabric edges earlier.
Note that this style of belt may be too wide for the belt loops at the top of some pants. This can be solved by simply folding the belt in half lengthwise once more and sewing the open edge again. Note, however, that repeated sewing along the same edge can give the belt a somewhat ""messy"" appearance.

, With just a little extra effort, it's easy to give your new fabric belt a buckle so that it can be fastened just like any belt you might buy at the store. To do this, however, you'll need a buckle first. Virtually any type of belt buckle will work with your new belt as long as it's not too large or small to accommodate the fabric of the belt — from old-fashioned frame-and-prong buckles to large, decorative cowboy buckles, there's no right or wrong choice.


Belt buckles can be purchased at thrift stores, vintage stores, antique shops, and even large department store chains.In addition, belt buckles can be easily purchased over the internet. DIY craft sites like Etsy even allow you to buy unique handmade pieces., If you can't find any belt buckles for sale near you or you'd rather save your money, it's also possible to substitute a few ordinary metal rings for the buckle. Ideally, these rings should be made of stainless steel or another rust-resistant material, should be O- or D-shaped, should be about as wide across as the belt is, and should be exactly the same size as each other.


Metal D- and O-rings are often available at hardware stores or online for cheap — sometimes as little a dollar or two per ring.

, Regardless of the buckle or fastening mechanism you use, typically, you'll secure it to your belt by looping one end of the belt through it and sewing this end of the belt to itself to secure it. Keep this loop somewhat tight — you want the buckle or fastener to stay more or less in its proper position, but you also want it to have a small amount of ""wiggle"" room to allow minor adjustment.


If you're using D- or O-rings, you should loop your belt through both rings at once before sewing it down.

, If you're using a belt buckle that works by threading a prong through holes in the other end of the belt, you'll now need to make these holes. You can put small holes in your belt with a sharp knife, scissors, or even a screwdriver.Make sure your holes are evenly-spaced and aligned in the middle of your belt fabric.


Don't leave the edges of your holes frayed — this will make them vulnerable to wear and tear. Instead, use an eyelet or a buttonhole stitch. You can even use eyelet pliers if you don't want to do this process by hand.

, Once your belt buckle or fastener is attached to your belt, you can use it exactly as you normally would! Since there are a huge variety of buckles and fasteners you can use, the way one belt is fastened may differ from the next, but most should be fairly intuitive.


If you're using O- or D-rings for the first time, don't worry — they're easy to fasten your belt with. Simply pass the end of your belt through both loops, then bring it back over the rings and thread it through the first ring once more. Pull the belt tight to fasten. The rings will hold the belt's fabric tight against itself, keeping the belt fastened with friction.

, Bows look fantastic on fabric belts made for women (and men who are very confident dressers). Best of all, they can be made from fabric leftover from the belt itself for an easy match! There are nearly endless bow variations — from basic shoelace-style knots to much more intricate designs. You may want to stitch your finished bow directly to your belt, but there are other alternatives: for instance, attaching it over an unattractive buckle to hide it.


For several easy bow-tying ideas, see our article on the subject.

, If you're handy with a needle and thread or a sewing machine, you may want to add detail stitching to give your belt some extra personality. This stitching can be as complex as you desire: anything from simple designs like zigzags to intricate designs like flowers are possible, depending on how much time you'd like to spend.


Another great idea is cross stitching, a technique which allows you to stitch images with pre-made designs (or your own custom-made ones). See our cross stitching article for more information.

, If you're looking for a challenging project, try adding criss-crossing corset-style lacing to your belt. This can be done in several ways. The easiest it probably to punch repeating holes along the top and bottom edges of the belt and criss-cross a long decorative string or ribbon through them. However, alternatives are possible: if you're confident in your sewing abilities, you can even put a break in the back of the belt and sew in real corset-style fasteners.For help, see our articles on making a corset and making a corset bracelet for basic corset-making guidelines.

, Your belt is yours to customize, so don't be afraid to go wild with it. There's almost no limit to the ways you can make your belt ""yours"" except your imagination and the tools you have handy! Here are just a few ideas to get you started customizing your belt — there are many, many more:


Add designs with markers
Stitch or write your favorite quote on it
Bleach or tear it for a distressed look
Add rhinestones, faux metal spikes, etc.
Stitch in decorative lace or fringe

Consider which glasses will best fit your face.,
Wear angular, slimming glasses if you have a round face.,
Wear large or rounded lenses with slim frames if you have a square face.,
Wear any glasses if you have an oval-shaped face.,
Wear tapered lenses if you have a heart-shaped face.",How to Wear Your Glasses1," There is nothing wrong with choosing glasses simply because you like the way they look — but certain spectacle styles do tend to look better on people with specific face shapes. To understand your face shape, consider whether your face is longer than it is wide; whether your jawline is round, square, or pointed; and whether your hairline is wide or narrow., Round faces are about as wide as they are tall, and they are characterized by softer, curved features. Straight and rectangular lenses will make your face look longer and thinner – especially if they sit high on your face. Stick to thin frames: thicker can overwhelm a round face.


Try wearing glasses with a “butterfly” taper, in which the lenses taper down toward the nose. You can create a better contrast with your face if the corners are angular rather than rounded.

, Square-faced features are angular, with a flat chin and strong jaw. If you'd like to soften your features, try wearing rounded lenses. If you like the strong profile, but don’t want glasses to make you look intimidating, you can still use square-shaped lenses. Make sure, however, that the lenses are large, and roughly even in height and width.Avoid narrow, rectangular lenses. These may clash with your strong features.
Keep the frames slim. Heavy frames can overpower your features and take away from the rest of your appearance.

, Oval faces are long and relatively thin, with a rounded chin and high cheekbones. This face type works well with most styles of glasses, provided that you avoid the extremes. Feel free to wear curved or square frames. Wear wide or narrow lenses, according to your preference – but avoid lenses that are too evenly round or boxy.


A thicker frame can add definition to your face — just be careful not to get anything so heavy that it overpowers your actual features.

, It can be hard to fit glasses for a face with narrow cheekbones and a small chin. If you'd like to draw attention from your pointy chin, try lenses that taper down from top to bottom. Likewise, a butterfly taper can help draw the eye toward the center of your face.


Stay away from anything too blocky or squared-off. This usually doesn’t work well with heart-shaped curves.
Very narrow frames may look somewhat fragile on a heart-shaped face. Try a thicker wire or plastic frame.

Wipe the belt down with a damp cloth.,
Purchase saddle soap or another leather cleaner.,
Add a little cleaner to a clean cloth.,
Rub the cleaner into the leather.,
Let it dry overnight.",How to Clean a Leather Belt1," For most cleaning, start with a soft cloth dampened with warm water. Wipe down the belt, focusing on any dirty areas.You can also just try a dry cloth if the belt isn't too dirty., Using a cleaner designed for leather is always the best choice. Saddle soap is a traditional leather cleaner, and it will suffice.However, you can also use another cleaner specifically designed for leather, as well.Sometimes, just a little mild soap will do the trick. However, you may not want to use it on a more expensive belt., It can help to start with a very slightly damp cloth. Add a little cleaner.If the cleaner is in a tub, like saddle soap usually is, you may need to rub the cloth in the cleaner to work up a light lather.







, Try to follow the grain, and don't rub too hard. Once you've rubbed it in, use a clean part of the cloth or another lightly damp cloth to wipe up the excess.







, It's best to leave the belt overnight so it has time to absorb all of the polish or cleaner. That way, it will stay on the belt instead of transferring to your hands or clothes, damaging them."

Lighten up your face to counter heavy frames.,
Avoid heavy eyebrow makeup if you wear thick frames, but consider filling your eyebrows in to accentuate thin frames.,
Consider wearing eyeliner to make your eyes stand out.,
Wear bright lipstick to balance your face, but not if you're wearing heavy makeup.",How to Wear Your Glasses2," Some eyeglass frames can cast dark shadows around the eyes in certain light. To combat this, blend a lighter-toned foundation under your eyes and down the center of your nose. This technique, known as contouring, makes you appear fresher and highlights your eyes. If you like, you can take this one step further and fully contour your face by bronzing your cheek bones, the top of your forehead and either side of your nose. Be sure to fully blend the highlighting foundation and bronzer with your natural-colored face makeup., Eyebrow styling largely depends on the size and shape of your eyewear, as well as the thickness and contour of your eyebrows.Full, defined, arched brows may be in style, but they do not always mix well with glasses. Avoid heavy eyebrow makeup if you wear big, thick frames. The same goes for those with naturally light hair or thinner eyebrows. You don't want to fill in your eyebrows with a color that's too dark or make them appear too full.
If you wear smaller, subtle frames, try filling in your eyebrows with your natural color. This can help draw focus to your eyes and accentuate your look. Use an eyebrow pencil—or eyebrow powder and a thin brush—to carefully fill in your eyebrows using short, dash-like strokes. Be sparing with the makeup, and follow the natural arch of your brow.

, Draw attention to your eyes with striking cat-eye eyeliner, well-defined eyelashes, and pops of eye shadow color. If you choose a bright eye shadow color, make sure that it complements the color of your frames. If your eye shadow clashes with your glasses, the effect may look cheap or gaudy., It's best to highlight either your eyes or your lips — avoid coloring both. If you have eye-catching eyeglasses and you want to wear eye shadow, try pairing your look with a colorless lip gloss or slightly tinted lip balm. If you'd rather draw attention to your lips than your eyes, pass up the eye shadow and wear thin eyeliner or mascara with a bright, cheery lipstick. Some people like to complete this look with vintage-style glasses.

Put your glasses on carefully.,
Wear your glasses on the top of your nose.,
Keep the lenses clean.,
Remove your glasses the right way.",How to Wear Your Glasses3," To put glasses on, you should grip the front of the frame with both hands. Slide the arms over your ears and lower the frame gently onto your nose. Always handle your glasses with two hands to reduce strain on the hinges.


Don't push your glasses into your nose. Too much pressure can cause a lasting indentation to form on the bridge of your nose.
Wear your glasses close to your eyes, not on the tip of your nose or halfway down the bridge. This position gives you the most visibility. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but you can overcome this discomfort in time.

, When you have your glasses on, touch the nose-bridge with your forefinger and push it up so that the frames sit comfortably on the top of your nose. Unless your optician has specifically instructed you to wear your glasses in another position, your glasses should sit comfortably between your eyes at the apex of your forehead.


Don't stretch them out. Make sure that you don’t rest your glasses on top of your head as it can stretch them out of shape.

, Wipe glass with a microfiber cloth, and use a bit of water to remove persistent stains. Regularly clean the frames with mild soap and water to remove any oil or dirt that could transfer to your skin.


Avoid wiping your glasses on your own clothing, such as t-shirts or jackets. This can leave hard stains and patterns that are very hard to wipe off.
Avoid touching your lenses with your fingers. This will smudge your glasses with fingerprints and bacteria.

, Simultaneously raise your temples and slide your glasses forward using both hands. When you put down your glasses, even just for a moment, make sure that you fold them properly. Lay them down by the arms, not the lenses.

Try cornstarch on oil-based stains.,
Remove water stains with a damp cloth.,
Use rubbing alcohol on small stains.,
Apply a lemon and cream of tartar paste.,
Use more aggressive measures as a last resort.",How to Clean a Leather Belt2," It's best to use cornstarch when the oil is fresh. Sprinkle the powder on the stain, and let it absorb the oil. If the oil stain is older, try rubbing in the powder with your fingers to help remove the oil stain. The heat from your fingers will help remove the stain. Use your fingers to brush the powder off.You can also try a dry rag to remove most of the oil first., If your belt has gotten wet in certain places, you've likely ended up with water stains. To deal with problem, you need to use a damp cloth to wet the whole belt, so that it can dry altogether without leaving small stains., For a small stain, such as a pen mark, rubbing alcohol may do the trick. Use something small to apply it, such as a cotton swab. Once the stain is gone, blow it dry with a blow dryer.







, For other stains, try mixing cream of tarter and lemon juice together in equal parts. Apply it to the stain, and leave it on the leather for 10 minutes. Wipe away the mixture.







, Washing the belt more thoroughly with soap and water could completely ruin your belt, so it's best to use it as a last resort. However, if you're throwing it out anyway, washing the belt by hand may save it. Rub in more water and soap to try to clean the belt.

Try activated charcoal.,
Use kitty litter.,
Use baking soda.",How to Clean a Leather Belt3," Add some to a bag or other air-tight container, and throw the belt inside. Seal it up, and leave it for at least a day. If it still smells, try it for longer.You can find activated charcoal at pet stores (in the fish supplies) or online.

, Another option for deodorizing is kitty litter. Kitty litter is designed to absorb odors for obvious reasons. To use, seal the belt in with the kitty litter in an airtight container. Let it sit for at least a day; let it go longer if it still needs deodorizing., Another option for deodorizing is using baking soda. Simply seal it in with the belt and leave it for a day or so.If you're worried about it leaving a white residue, try one of the baking soda ""packs"" made to deodorize things like refrigerators, as the baking soda isn't loose.

What seasons do you expect to wear the hat in? Knowing this in advance can narrow your options from the start.;
, There are all kinds of hats in the world, from casual to Kentucky Derby. Look through fashion magazines, catalogues, or online to get some ideas.

, The first rule of hat buying is that it should be proportional to your body.Your hat should balance out your dimensions rather than exaggerate them.


Tall crowns and upturned brims are lengthening, while wide and down turned brims make you appear shorter.A hat's brim should be no wider than the width of your shoulders.
The larger your build, the more hat you can get away with., See Part 2 for how to determine your face shape.

, If you're not sure about this, notice which color(s) you're wearing when you receive a compliment or simply feel your best when you look in the mirror. Chances are, this is your color!

, Your new hat will be one of the most prominent elements of your wardrobe, so it should complement your personal style.


Boho: berets, floppy wide brims, wide-brim fedoras
Preppy: structured hats with a wide brim, such as picture hats, bretons and boaters; structured berets, cloches, fedoras
Boys and tomboys: newsboy cap, fedoras, bowlers, boaters, ball caps, beanies
Vintage elegance: delicate pillbox styles, fascinators, structured wide brims, wide-brim cloches
Grunge: baseball hats, bowlers, soft berets or beanies, structured rolled wide brimsIf you're buying the hat to go with a specific outfit (for a wedding, cocktail party, etc.), you would do better not to match the hat mechanically to the attire. Find one that complements the look, rather than copying it.Consider your hairstyle. Many hats look best when long hair is pulled back and tucked into the ears.However, if you want to wear your hair loose, this is another factor when making your decision.
Loose and flowing hair: berets, fedoras, floppy, bowlers
Short styles (pixies, bobs, etc.): cloches, picture hats, bretons, rolled brims, floppy wide brims, some pillbox styles
Shoulder-length: cloches, wide brims of any kind, fedoras, pillbox styles (better with curls), boaters, bowlers
Bangs: upturned brims, or wider down-turned ones, such as a wide-brim cloche, Hats can be pricey, but you can often find some great deals at vintage or thrift shops.


If you don't have enough money for your perfect hat earn the money!


, Browse shops in your local area and search online to get a sense of prices and availability.

, Your neck should also be visible, so avoid turtlenecks or collars.

,,, The following are characteristics of each face shape, and the hats that suit them:


Oblong: long and narrow, slightly rectangular with wider points at jaw and hairline. Draw attention to your eyes with styles worn forward on the head and round or square crowns. You might also want a hat that can be pulled down to the eyebrows to diminish the vertical. Think cloches, tilted fedoras, or floppy hats.
Oval: longer than it is wide, and slightly wider at cheekbones than at forehead and jawline. Oval faces can wear just about anything, but if you have delicate features look for smaller-brimmed classic styles that accentuate your face. One trick is to make sure the crown is not wider than your cheekbones.
Round: length and width across cheekbones are equal. Balance out the soft shape of your face shape with structured hats, wide brims, angular styles, cloches or fedoras.
Triangular/Pear: widest points at jawline, with rounded chin and narrower forehead. Create length with a high crown and small brim (short, straight or upturned). Decorative additions to one side of the hat has an asymmetrical effect that may be flattering.
Square: hairline is wide and flat, equally wide across forehead and jaw; length and width almost equal. Balance the sharp angles of your face with softer designs like the cloche hat, large, soft brims, upturned brims, and round or curved crowns. Avoid square styles.
Diamond: wide cheekbones with narrow chin and forehead. Like the oval face, the diamond face can wear many styles. Small brims and high crowns accentuate the cheekbones and chin. Avoid a disproportionate silhouette by skipping peaked hats or any crown that's narrower than your cheekbones.
Heart: wider through forehead and cheeks with a narrow chin; cheekbones are prominent. Look for asymmetrical medium to small brims or bucket styles, as these narrow the face. Upturned brims draw attention to the eyes and create the illusion of length to balance a wider forehead. Avoid berets, baseball caps and straight brims, This information can help you find the right size hat.


Use a cloth tape measure (or a length of string that you can later measure with a ruler).
Place the tape measure around your head in a circle about 1/8 inch (3 mm) above your ears, across the middle of your forehead. This is roughly where the hat will sit on your head.
The tape should fit firmly but not tightly.
Remove the tape and note the measurement.
Hat sizing may vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, so always try on your hat or consult their sizing chart for specifics., Don't be shy: ask to try on any style that strikes your fancy. You might also get suggestions from the sales staff, which may (or may not) be helpful and give you new ideas. Remember, the final decision is up to you.


When you go hat shopping, wear an outfit that is typical for your style. Or, if you're buying a hat for a special occasion, bring the clothes you expect to wear along with you to compare.

, When you find a style you like, make sure the size feels good. It shouldn't squeeze your head or pop off. Remember, you want a hat you'll feel great in. If the size is wrong, even slightly, you're much less likely to wear it.


If the hat is just a bit too large, you might try a hat sizer. These are inserted into the inside of the hat's sweatband for a more secure fit.,


Gentlemen, remember to remove your hat indoors. Ladies, you can usually flaunt your hat anywhere you please, but do take it off at audience events, where you might block someone's view (besides the obvious exceptions, such as at the race track).

Talk to the eye doctor.,
Put the glasses on your child.,
Practice taking off glasses with both hands.,
Wear your own glasses.,
Teach them the rules of glasses care.",How to Teach Kids to Wear Eyeglasses1," When training your child to wear glasses, it can be helpful to understand when and where your child should have their glasses on. In some cases, the child may need to wear glasses all of the time. In other cases, they may only need to wear them during certain activities, such as school or reading. Some questions you might ask your optometrist or optician:


“When does my child need to wear glasses?”
“How do I care for this specific lens or frame?”
“Does my child need sunglasses as well?”
“Can I have the glasses adjusted for free if they become loose or misaligned?”;
, When you first receive the glasses, you should put the frames on your child for them. Use both hands to slide the arms of the glasses over their ears until the bridge of the glasses rests securely on the bridge of their nose.


As you do so, talk to your child. Say, “This is the proper way to put on your glasses. They should always sit on your nose.”
The glasses should not slide off. If they do, you should have them realigned.

, To help teach your child the proper way to put on and take off glasses, have them practice it in front of you. Have them take off the glasses with both hands. Make sure they do not touch the lenses. Next, have them put on the glasses again. Do this a few times until they have it down.Talk your child through the steps. Say, “always put on and take off your glasses with both hands. But do not touch the glass, or it will get dirty.”
If your child is a toddler, you may have success by cheering them every time that they do it correctly. If they take off glasses with both hands, clap and cheer. Do the same when they successfully put on the glasses.

, If you or another family member wear glasses, make learning a group activity. Have members of the family practice taking off and putting on glasses together. Clean your glasses together at night. Before leaving the house, ask “Does everyone have their glasses? Does everyone have their case?” This will help show your child that wearing glasses is normal, and it makes learning more of a fun, inclusive activity.

, There are certain rules that you should enforce about caring for glasses. Tell your child what these rules are, and remind them of the rules if they break them. You should teach them:



""On your face or in their case"": You want to make sure that if your child is not wearing their glasses, that the glasses are securely stored in their proper case. This will prevent the glasses from becoming scratched or lost.

“Wear your glasses on your nose, not on your head”: Pushing glasses up to the top of the head may cause them to misalign.To help keep the glasses in good shape, teach the child to wear them on their face only.

“Do not touch the lens/glass”: touching the lens can leave smudges. Encourage your child to not play with the lenses.

“No swimming or running in glasses”: if your child plays sports in glasses, they risk breaking the lenses and injuring themselves. Glasses should be put away during rough physical activity. If your child absolutely needs their glasses to see, you may want to invest in sports goggles that they can wear instead of their normal glasses."

Look and feel for seams on the plastic.,
Feel for an inappropriately light weight.,
Check for non-glass lenses.,
Look for low-quality metal hinges.,
Look for low-quality engravings in the corners of the glasses.,
Look for a poor “RB” etching on one of the lenses.,
Check the quality of the nose pads.,
Check for flushness of the temple logo.,
Look for the model number inside the “arms” of the glasses.",How to Tell if Ray Ban Sunglasses Are Fake1," All genuine Ray-Ban products are crafted from high-quality materials using the finest manufacturing processes. Notably, the plastic body of Ray-Ban sunglasses are cut from a single piece of acetate and are hand-polished. Because of this, you shouldn't be able to detect any nicks, rough spots, or especially seams on your glasses. These are after-products from cheap manufacturing processes and are dead giveaways that a pair of ""Ray-Bans"" aren't what they are being billed as.Seams can be anywhere on a fake pair of Ray-Bans, but they're especially likely to be on the places where the mold used to create the plastic closed — namely, the upper edges of the glasses above the lenses and the tops of the ""arms"" that rest on your ears.;
, Take your Ray-Bans in your hands. Turn them over a few times. Gently toss them an inch or two up and catch them.They should have some weight to them and feel solid and substantial. They shouldn't feel unusually light, thin, or fragile. If your glasses seem like they may not be heavy enough to keep a few pieces of loose paper from blowing away, there's a good chance they're not real.


Real Ray-Bans have metal support struts inside the “arms” that sit on your ears that are responsible for much of their weight. If you have a model with transparent arms (like, for instance, the Clubmaster Squares), you should be able to see this metal. If you can’t, you’ll know you’ve been wearing fakes.

, Take your glasses off and look at them from the front. give the lenses a few gentle flicks with your fingernail. If they have the look, feel, and ""clinking"" sound of genuine glass, this is a good sign — many Ray-Bans use real glass for their lenses. Non-glass lenses don't necessarily mean that your glasses are fake, however, unless they're obviously cheap-looking, cloudy, or poor-quality.


If your lenses don’t feel like glass, don’t panic — some models of Ray-Bans have non-glass lenses but are still made from the highest quality materials.To be clear, perfectly clear, glass lenses are a sign that your glasses are probably real, but non-glass lenses don’t necessarily mean they aren’t.

, Open the glasses and look at them from the back. The hinges in the corners of the glasses should be of good-quality metal construction. They should be cleanly bolted to the glasses, not glued on or held in place with cheap plastic — as noted above, these are signs of cheap, rushed manufacturing processes.


Many — but not all — Ray-Bans have a distinctive metal hinge that contains seven interlocking metal ""teeth"".Seeing this is a good sign, but its absence shouldn't be cause for concern, as other types of high-quality metal hinges are sometimes used (for instance, for Ray-Ban's Aviators and Clubmasters).

, Look at your glasses from the front. If you're wearing most models of Wayfarers of Clubmasters, you should see small, silver, horizontal diamond or oval-shaped marks in the corners of the eyes. These should be sharp, shiny, and well-made. You shouldn't be able to scratch any of the shiny material off and they shouldn't seem like they can be easily removed. If the engravings don't look very well-made, there's a good chance that the glasses aren't, either.

, Most models of Ray-Ban glasses will have a small, almost-imperceptible ""RB"" etched in the trademark Ray-Ban font on one of the lenses. This will be small and near the edge of the lens, but it may be easier to see if you shine a light at the glasses from an angle. If your glasses are fakes, you may not be able to see this at all or it may appear smudged or sloppily-etched.


Note, however, that some pre-2000 models may have a “BL” etching. This stands for “Bausch & Lomb,” the company that originally owned Ray-Ban. In 1999, Bausch & Lomb sold Ray-Ban to the Italian company Luxottica.This new ownership is reflected on the labelling and packaging of modern Ray-Bans (see below).

, Every part of a genuine pair of Ray-Ban sunglasses if made from high-quality materials — even the little pads that sit on your nose when you wear the glasses. These should be made of a firm, comfortable rubbery material. They shouldn't feel fragile, slick, slimy, or easy-to-remove.


You may also want to look for small ""RB"" logos embossed on the metal centers of the nose pads. These are included on many (but not all) Ray-Bans as a sign of quality., Take off your glasses and look at them from the side. There should be a cursive ""Ray-Ban"" logo on the temple portion of the glasses. Look at this closely — it should be cleanly, professionally attached, sitting more or less flush against the ""arm"" of the glasses. If the logo itself seems poorly-made or stuck onto the side of the glasses with glue or pins, your glasses are probably not genuine.


Obviously, for Ray-Ban models with very thin temple ""arms"", like Aviators, no logo is present.

, Look at the inside of the ""arms"" of the glasses that rest on your ears. If you have Wayfarers or Clubmasters, you should see white text inside the arms. On the left arm, you'll see your glasses' serial and manufacturing numbers. On the right arm, you should see the Ray-Ban logo, ""Made in Italy"", and a stylized ""CE"" (which signifies that the glasses are certified to be sold in Europe). If this text is missing, smudged, or poorly-printed, your glasses are almost certainly fakes.


If you still have your Ray-Bans' original packaging, check to make sure the serial numbers on the glasses match the ones on the box's label. If they don't, this is a sure sign of foul play.
Again, because the ""arms"" of Aviators are so thin, no text is present inside the arms of these models.

Give your child new glasses on a weekend.,
Teach them how to clean their lenses.,
Pack their case in their backpack.,
Invest in several soft elastic eyeglass straps.,
Speak to their teacher.",How to Teach Kids to Wear Eyeglasses2," It often takes a day or two for the eyes to adjust to new glasses. If you can, wait until the weekend to introduce your child to their new glasses. Not only can the child get used to them in a safe, familiar environment, but you can supervise them the entire time to make sure that they are caring for them correctly.

, It is important to teach your child early how to clean their own glasses. You can use prepackaged solution or dish soap to wash their glasses at the sink. You should always wipe glasses with a microfiber cloth; paper towels and tissues can scratch the lenses. Designate a special cloth to be your child’s. Keep this in their bathroom or bedroom. They will always use this special cloth to clean their glasses.You can also buy a box of individually wrapped wipes for glasses. These can be packed into a backpack easily so that your child can wipe their lenses at school.
You may also want to send your child with a dry microfiber cloth with them to school and other activities. Instead of wiping their glasses on their shirt, they can pull this cloth out to wipe away dirt or smudges.
Discourage your child from wiping their lenses on their shirt or clothing. This could scratch the lenses or cause them to become even dirtier., Even if your child must wear glasses all of the time, you should make sure that their case is always with them. Before they leave in the morning, doublecheck that their case is in their backpack. You can either look yourself or ask them, “Do you have your glasses case with you?”

, These straps come in an assortment of bright, funky colors and designs. These are designed to attach to the handles of the glasses, so that the eyeglasses are worn much like goggles. These will keep the glasses firmly secured to your child’s head.You can buy these at your optician's office, at a pharmacy, or at a convenience store.

, Contact your child’s teacher to let them know when your child should be wearing glasses. You should also inform them of any problems you are having convincing your child to wear the glasses. The teacher can make sure your child is actually wearing and taking care of their glasses during school hours, keeping a consistent schedule for your child.Let the teacher know if:


Your child can wear their glasses during recess
If your child needs glasses to take notes or read the board
Your child has a special case to store their glasses in when not wearing
How you’ve trained your child to clean their glasses

"
"
Let your child pick out their glasses.,
Ask your child why they do not like their glasses.,
Keep putting glasses on them.,
Train them to wear glasses during pleasant activities.,
Read them a bedtime story about glasses.",How to Teach Kids to Wear Eyeglasses3," If your child is hesitant about getting glasses, let them pick out which frames they get to wear. While you should encourage your child to get plastic frames instead of wire, they can choose the color or design. This will make them more excited about getting glasses, and they may be less hesitant about wearing them., Many issues that children have with glasses are easily fixed. If your child is being stubborn, sit them down, and ask them, “Why don’t you want to wear your glasses?” Listen to their answer, and address it respectfully. Do not dismiss their feelings.


If the glasses are uncomfortable or ill-fitting, you can take them back to the optician to have them resized properly.If the child is embarrassed about wearing glasses or if they think they are uncool, remind the child of celebrities, superheroes, or other characters who wear glasses, such as Clark Kent or Harry Potter.Your child might need a few days to adjust to their new vision. If they are complaining about vision after a few days, return to your eye doctor to see if the prescription can be adjusted.

, Young children, particularly toddlers, may try to take off their glasses repeatedly. If this happens, do not get mad. Instead, be persistent. Every time the child removes their glasses, give them a short break from wearing the glasses before putting them back on. This could be anywhere from ten minutes to an hour., When you first receive the glasses, choose a pleasant activity where your child must wear their glasses. This could be reading a bedtime story, coloring a picture, or watching a cartoon. Before you begin, make sure the child is wearing their glasses. Start the story or activity. If the child takes off their glasses, stop the activity until they put the glasses back on themselves. This will teach the child to associate wearing their glasses with pleasant experiences., There are many bedtime stories that feature protagonists wearing glasses. You can read these to your child to normalize eyeglasses and to teach them the basics of care. This may even teach them to enjoy wearing eyeglasses. Some books include:Winnie Flies Again by Valerie Thomas and Korky Paul

Ask for the certificate of authenticity and warranty card along with your purchase.,
Check the case or pouch the sunglasses come in.,
Look for the serial number and markings.,
Determine whether or not the materials are high-quality.,
Look for a sticker.,
Don’t forget to check the rubber nose-piece when determining the authenticity of Oakley sunglasses.,
Ask yourself, does the price look right?,
Get a second opinion.",How to Spot Fake Oakley Sunglasses," Most fake Oakley sunglasses don’t come with proper documentation. The certificate of authenticity and the warranty card should be the first two things you should look into when purchasing a pair of designer sunglasses. This verification method is incredibly reliable and is recommended for individuals who aren’t confident with their ability to detect a fake pair from construction alone.;
, All Oakley sunglasses come in a hard case or pouch. If the case appears to be flimsy and lacks quality logos, chances are you need to reconsider your purchase. Genuine Oakley shades are always encased in quality packaging.

, One of the more notable markings is the one that states where the sunglasses were made. It is no longer true that the only country that manufactures real Oakley sunglasses is the United States. Some if not most Oakleys are assembled in the US. Military sunglasses made by Oakley are made in the US. Additionally, you may also look for the serial number on the inside of the arm that indicates the model number of the sunglasses.

, Like most expensive sunglasses, Oakley shades will be made of nice materials. Moreover, they are put together extremely well. There should not be any loose ends or gaps between the hinges., When it comes to stickers on the lenses, real Oakley shades do not have any. This is a common mistake that counterfeiters make. Don’t let a vendor tell you that all sunglasses are required to have the UV protection or polarization sticker.

, A real pair comes with a soft cushion that almost molds or conforms to the bridge of your nose when worn. A rough or hard rubber nose piece is a sign that you may need to look for a different seller.

, An online search for “fake Oakley” sunglasses will list tons of foreign websites that sell them. These sites are not denying the authenticity of the sunglasses based on the keyword search terms and their price of $10 or $15. Specific styles of Oakley sunglasses do not fluctuate to much in price. The company that owns Oakley also owns many of the retail stores such as Sunglass Hut. If Sunglass Hut sells a pair of Straight Jacket's for $130, then other retailers will not be far from that price in either direction. A red flag is when a site or individual is selling, for example, a new pair of Straight Jackets at $60 or $70.

, When in doubt always turn to an authorized Oakley dealer such as Sunglasses Hut, Oakley.com or Lens Crafters. An online search will give you other dealers as well.

Check the box’s label for the glasses’ serial numbers.,
Inspect the carrying case for high-quality construction.,
Check the booklet for errors.,
Look for a high-quality cleaning cloth.,
Look for a good-quality lens sticker.",How to Tell if Ray Ban Sunglasses Are Fake2," If you bought your glasses new, they should have come in a box with a large white shipping label. This label should contain important identifying information for your glasses — if it doesn't, they're probably fake. Official Ray-Ban boxes should be labeled with the following:Model number: Starts with ""RB"" or ""0RB"", followed by four numbers.
Submodel number: Starts with a letter, followed by four numbers.
Lens type code: One letter/one number combination (e.g. ""2N"").
Lens width (in millimeters): Two-digit number.

, All Ray-Ban glasses should come with their own carrying case — if yours didn't (for instance, if your glasses came in a plastic bag), this is cause for concern, unless you bought them after-market (for instance, from a pawnbroker). The glasses' carrying case should have the following marks of good craftsmanship:A sharp, shiny gold logo on the front left side. The logo should read ""100% UV Protection - Ray-Ban - Sunglasses By Luxottica"".
A Ray-Ban logo on the snap.
Material that is textured (and feels like) real leather.
A hard, protective front portion.
Clean stitching.

, Real Ray-Bans are usually packaged with a small booklet that discusses the product you've purchased, contains promotional images, and more. This booklet should be flawlessly printed from good-quality matte paper. In addition, real Ray-Ban booklets are thoroughly reviewed and edited before their publication. If the booklet contains any sort of error — whether it's a spelling, grammar, or factual error — this is a sign of trouble.

, Ray-Bans almost always come with a small felt cloth to be used for keeping the glasses clean. If this isn't included with the glasses in its own clear plastic envelope, your glasses may not be genuine. If the glasses do come with a cleaning cloth, but it appears poorly-made, this can also be a sign of a fake. Look for the following sorts of defects in the cloth:


Stains or signs of previous use
Thin, coarse, or ratty texture
Loose stitching
Cheap-looking material

, Ray bans are sold with a distinctive cling-on sticker on the lens as a sign of quality. This sticker should be black and gold (not yellow) and have the Ray-Ban logo prominently featured in the middle of a black starburst shape. The text around the edge should read: ""100% UV Protection"" and ""Sunglasses by Luxottica."" The following defects can be cause for concern:


Missing or poorly-spelled text
Off-center logo or starburst shape
Glue under the sticker (it should attach via static, not like a conventional sticker)

Buy only from licensed retailers.,
Beware “too good to be true” deals.,
When in doubt, purchase directly from Ray-Ban.,
Understand why wearing fakes is a bad idea.",How to Tell if Ray Ban Sunglasses Are Fake3," When it comes to buying Ray-Bans, not all sellers are created equal. Some, unfortunately, make a practice of selling fakes, or, in the case of pawnbrokers, may be indifferent to fakes in their inventory. To ensure that you only buy fine, high-quality Ray-Bans, only make purchases from sellers that are officially-licensed by the Ray-Ban corporation.


If you live in the U.S., note that you can use the store locator on the official Ray-Ban site to find licensed sellers near you., As with many luxury goods, if your Ray-Bans seem to be a steal, they probably are. While Ray-Bans vary greatly in price depending on their make and model, they're never cheap. Being hand-made from the finest materials available, Ray-Bans are a premium good sold at a premium price. Be very skeptical of supposed Ray-Bans being sold under their market price, even if the vendor has some sort of convenient excuse for the discount.


As an example of the sort of costs you can expect for new Ray-Bans, know that, within the Wayfarer group of models, new glasses can retail from about $60 to as high as $300., If you're ever unsure of a seller's veracity, why take a risk? To make sure you get real Ray-Bans, simply buy from Ray-Ban's official website, ray-ban.com. The Ray-Ban site allows you to easily browse the entire Ray-Ban catalog, making it obviously preferable to any sort of ""shady"" seller you might otherwise use.

, Like most knock-offs, fake Ray-Bans aren't nearly as high of quality as the real thing. They're almost always more poorly made, more likely to break, and not as good-looking. However, besides these obvious points, there are several other compelling things that may make fakes even less appealing to you as a buyer. Below are just a few additional reasons why you may want to avoid buying and wearing fake Ray-Bans:Fakes may not provide adequate protection from the sun’s UV rays. In fact, wearing sunglasses without UV protection can actually be worse for your eyes than wearing no sunglasses at all.Fakes almost never come with warranties, so if they break (which is almost always more likely than with real Ray-Bans), you're completely out of luck.
Fakes may be made in factories or sweatshops that exploit their workers. Making a habit of buying fakes can be unwittingly supporting unfair labor practices in other parts of the world.

Set the glasses with the wings open on a flat surface.,
Unscrew the screw-fastener from the hinge.,
Press on the lens lightly.,
Screw the hinge back together.,
Acquire a replacement lens.",How to Take Out Lenses from Your Sunglasses1," Look, then, at the corners and see what, if anything, is fastening the wings (ear pieces) to the rims around the lenses. If you have trouble seeing this area, use a magnifying glass and more lighting.Some plastic frames have the wings (ear pieces) attached by a hinge embedded in the frame, so you will not be able to remove it easily, nor should you try to force it. If this is the case, skip the next step.
Some sunglasses have only the wings (ear pieces) fastened on by screws to the hinge, with the hinge and lens framing portions as one solid piece of plastic. In this event, you should skip to the next method.
If you see the hinge fastened by screws to the frame holding the lens, you can proceed with the next step.;
, You are removing the screw closest to the frame, not the wing (ear piece). Use the screw-driver from an eye glass repair kit. You should only have to do this for the side on the lens you are removing--unless you are doing both.


These frames are very light, so you may want to brace the frame with something, even your free hand or the hand of a helper while you do this.
Most of the screws you encounter will be right-handed—that is, turning the screw counter-clockwise should loosen it and clockwise should tighten it.
Once the screw is out, carefully set it aside. The screws are usually very tiny and easy to lose. It might help to affix the screw to a piece of fairly sticky packing tape. Many eye glass kits come with containers that are handy for storing the screws temporarily.

, At this point the frame and hinge should be separated. If the lens does not pop out on its own, give it an extra push.If you had to skip the step regarding screw-removal from the hinge, keep in mind that you will be putting extra stress on the hinge, so try to avoid grabbing on the wings themselves for the removal process.
Hold the frame so only a couple of fingers are pushing on the frame from the back--perhaps two thumbs.
Make sure the sunglasses are not high off the surface you are working on, and you don't accidentally lift them as you push with slow but gradually increasing pressure on the back of the lens until it falls forward.
Once the lens is out, have a soft-lined, but hard cased container ready to carry them until you determine what you will do with them next.

, Do this until you have a replacement lens ready to install into the frame. This will help avoid the frames getting damaged, and make it less likely you will lose the original fastener.


Make sure the hinge where the frame and wing meet is lined up properly.
Many eye glass kit screwdrivers are magnetic at the tips, so this can assist in keeping the screw lined up at the hinge's opening.
Standard technique should mean a clockwise motion will tighten the screw.
Hold the frame and wing together at the hinge with one hand or assistance while you use the kit screwdriver to complete the process.

, You will need to consult with your optometrist if a new prescription lens is necessary. Proper fitting of a replacement lens may require the services of an eyeglass shop."

Look for a metallic finish on the Black Impreme belt’s “double G” buckle.,
Check Guccissima belts for the “double G” logo.",How to Spot a Fake Gucci Belt," All authentic Gucci belts come in a gift bag. The bag should be a dark brown color with the double G logo (one backwards capital G facing another capital G) printed all over the surface of the bag, excluding the bottom of the bag’s interior.There should also be a dark brown string on top that can be tied to keep the product from falling out.;
, All authentic Gucci belts should come in a dust bag. The bag should be dark in color and have the brand name “GUCCI” in yellow gold letters in the center of the bag. There should be a drawstring, with only one string, in the top right corner of the dust bag.There should also be a tag on the inside of the dust bag that says “Gucci Made in Italy.” If this is missing, your belt is probably fake.

, If you ordered your Gucci belt from anywhere other than a Gucci store or retailer, you should ask for the original receipt as proof of purchase. This will help alleviate any worries you have about the authenticity of the belt.A receipt for an authentic belt should have the Gucci name at the top, the address of a verifiable Gucci store or outlet (including contact information), and the description/price of the belt in question.

, The stitching on a Gucci belt should be literally perfect. Not nearly perfect – actually perfect. You are paying for the high quality that this designer brand is known for. Each stitch should be straight across (not slanted) and exactly the same size as every other stitch.If there are noticeable mistakes in the stitching, you should consider that it is probably a fake Gucci belt.

, Authentic Gucci belts are made with perfect craftsmanship. If you notice any fraying of the materials on the belt, it is almost certainly a fake. This is especially true if you buy a “new” Gucci belt and it arrives with some fraying.If you notice any imperfections in the materials, this is a sign that you probably have a fake belt on your hands.

, Fake Gucci belts often have clip on belt buckles, whereas authentic Gucci belt buckles are typically soldered onto the larger portion of the belt. None of the models of authentic Gucci belts include a button holding the belt buckle in place.Some models have screws on the back of the belt buckle, while others don’t. You’ll need to check the specifics of each model.

, Authentic Gucci belts have a stamp on the inside portion of the belt, whereas this feature will be missing on their fake counterparts. In some newer belts, the stamp is near the buckle, while some of the older belts stamp the belt toward the center, length-wise.

The stamp should say the brand name, “Made in Italy,” and include an identifying number., An authentic Gucci serial number should be 21 digits long. Typically, the number should begin with “114” or “223.”

If your number begins with “1212,” it is definitely a fake. This is a common serial number given to fake Gucci belts.

, For this belt, the beginning of the pattern should start with two Gs; it should not be cut off in the middle or begin at any other point in the pattern. There should be no screws in the hardware of the belt buckle. The background of the belt should be beige, but the GG design should be blue. The inside of the belt should be black leather.For every two GG patterns, there should a hold for the belt buckle inside the second G.

, On this belt, the buckle is comprised of a regular G and an upside down G. The normal G has a matte finish, while the upside down G should have a metallic black finish. The inside of the belt should be a suede material. The “double G” logo should be perfectly printed over the entirety of the belt.This model should have screws on the back side of the belt buckle. Inspect the back of the belt buckle and see if there are noticeable screws.

, The size of the belt should be included in the serial number, and not imprinted anywhere else on the belt – fakes often have the size printed on the leather of the non-buckle end. The stitching should include the “double G” logo printed all over the entire belt. The inside of the belt is suede.

This belt, as with all of the other authentic Gucci belts, should not have a button holding the belt buckle in place. This is a clear sign of a fake.

Use your dominant eye.,
Wear your glasses.,
Hold the monocular up to your eye.,
Adjust the focus.",How to Use a Monocular1," If you have impaired vision, it is important to use the eye with the best vision. This can be helpful even if you have normal vision. Hold the monocular up against this eye while using. Be sure to hold the monocular with the hand on the same side as the dominant eye.If you are unsure which eye is dominant, you can do several tests to find out. Read How to Determine Your Dominant Eye to learn more.;
, If you wear glasses to see, you will want to wear them while using the monocular. Let the monocular press lightly against your glasses. You may want to fold down the rubber end to help aid your field of view.If you wear glasses, you will want to choose a monocular that offers at least 14mm of eye relief. This means that you can hold the monocular at least 14mm away from your eye and still see through it. The eye relief of your monocular will be clearly stated on the box of your monocular or on the manufacturer's website., Raise the monocular to your eye while gripping the barrel close to the ocular lens (the lens near your eye).The lens should be as close to the eye as possible without actually touching it.Close the other eye to maintain focus, and steady the monocular by resting your forefinger against your brow.Keep your elbow against your body to help keep the arm still.


You can also steady the monocular by holding your wrist still with your other hand.Another way to get a stable view is to lay on your stomach and rest your elbows on the ground, providing a stable anchor for the lens.
Do not touch either of the lenses on the scope.

, Different types of monoculars are adjusted different ways. Some monoculars can be adjusted with one finger rotating a ridged dial on the monocular. Others require the use of both hands. If the scene is becoming blurrier instead of clearer, rotate the dial in the other direction."

Lay down the glasses on a flat surface.,
Use pressure around the sun-glass lens to pop it out.,
Clean the sun-glass lenses.,
Acquire a replacement lens.,
Finished.

",How to Take Out Lenses from Your Sunglasses2," Make sure they are propped so the wings (ear pieces) are open and pointing towards you. It is better if the glasses are upside down in this case, so the top bar is laying on the surface, and facing away from you.


You will want to ensure there is no chance the sunglasses' wings will have extra stress put on them at the hinges, so check that you are not inadvertently going to be pressing down or outward on them.
Have some lens cleaner, or warm water and soap and clean lint-free cloths handy since you will be exposing the lens to more contact than in the other method.

, Since you have not loosened the frame, you will need to gradually do the separation by pushing the lens away from it.


Hold the frame, not the wings, so you can put two fingers on the lens and work them around the edge of the lens where it meets the frame.
Push the lens forward, away from you and the wings (ear pieces) with gradually increasing pressure along and around the frame until it comes out. This will avoid you pushing them over the nose-guards.
There are some sun-glass models where the lenses are sunken into the frame, so that there is significant frame material or a rim around each lens ahead of them--making a push-forward of the lens impractical. Only in these cases should you go ahead and turn the sun-glasses around so the wings (ear pieces) are pointed away from you so you can use the same gradual-pressure methods to push the lenses from front-to-back to get them out.
In the the case of the front-to-back lens motion, try to push the outer edges (wing-facing) of the lenses through first so you can pull them away from the nose-guards.

, This is more of a step if you plan to reuse the lens.If you use a lens cleaner--it needs to be suitable for anti-reflective and coated surfaces.
Spray the lens with the cleaner or dampen it with running warm water.
If you are using soap and water, add a small dab of soap at this point. Then rinse with more warm water.
For either cleaning technique, finish up by drying the lens with a lint-free cloth.

, If you need a replacement prescription lens, consult an optometrist. You may need to consult an eyeglass shop for proper fitting of a new lens for your frame.This method has a high risk of damaging your frames, so you may want to inspect them for damage, especially small cracks in the plastic version of sun-glass models before you proceed.

Face the target.,
Turn your head to track the target.,
Refocus as targets move.,
Stay still.",How to Use a Monocular2," Before you use the monocular, you should locate the object that you want to view. You can position yourself by pointing your nose and toes towards the target.Keeping an eye on this object before you raise the monocular can help you locate it more easily once the monocular is on your eye.


It can be harder to find and track an object with a monocular vs. binoculars because you don't have the same perception of depth as you would with binoculars.
It might help to observe other geographic features around the object you want to track, such as a tree branch, rock, or patch of dirt. Using these markers can help you focus on the right area and find your way to your intended target.If you lose sight of the object when you place the monocular to your eye, try opening your other eye to try to point the monocular in the right direction.

, If you are observing a moving target, you will have to follow this target with your sight. Turn your head slowly to follow it. If your target moves a great distance, you may slowly move your body as well. The monocular does not move from your eye.


Sudden movements can cause you to lose track of your target.

, If your target moves closer or farther away, you will have to focus the lens as you go. This will keep the target clear in your view as it moves. Focus the lens as you move your head and body to follow the target.


You can practice this action by rolling a ball back and forth, and tracking it with the monocular. This will help you learn how to focus the lens quickly and accurately.

, It is not wise to move with the monocular pressed against your eye. Your magnified vision may cause you to miss objects that are close to you, causing you to trip or injure yourself. Always turn your body to track a moving object, but do not walk, run, paddle, or drive while using the monocular.

"

Use the strap.,
Keep your monocular dry.,
Use the lens cap.,
Clean your monocular.",How to Use a Monocular3," If your monocular comes with a strap, you should keep it wrapped around your wrist or neck while using it. This will prevent your monocular from dropping and breaking. This is especially important if you are using it while on a boat or around water. If your monocular falls into the water, it can sink.

, While you can buy a waterproof monocular, these are often more expensive. If you are on a boat or kayak, you can protect your monocular by keeping it in a zipped freezer bag while it is not in use. Make sure that it is completely sealed to ensure that water does not get inside.You can even double-bag the monocular for even more protection.

, If your monocular came with a lens cap, make sure you have this in place whenever you are not using the lens. It protects the lens from damage as well as from dust, water, and other debris., If you notice blurred vision or specks obstructing your view, you may have to clean your monocular. You can use an eyeglass wipe to clean off the lens. If there are specks of dirt and sand in the lens, you can use a can of compressed air to blow them off. Toilet paper, tissue, and window cleaners may be too harsh for delicate lenses and may cause scratches.Using your t-shirt can leave streaks if your clothing is treated with fabric softener.

Swab the belt with rubbing alcohol.,
Follow up with Vaseline.,
Clean the belt.",How to Soften a Leather Belt1," Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball for an easy applicator. Then, wipe the leather surface thoroughly with the rubbing alcohol. This should clean the leather and open up the pores of the material. Make sure that the alcohol is deeply soaked into the leather. You may need to apply many coats.You can buy isopropyl rubbing alcohol at most drugstores and grocery stores. You may already have some in your cabinet!
If you don't have a cotton ball, use a towel, a tissue, or a clean piece of cotton. You can also use your fingers. Be careful, though: rubbing alcohol can dry out your skin with prolonged contact.;
, Put Vaseline or another petroleum jelly product onto your finger or a Q-tip. Then, spread the Vaseline across the belt so that it covers the entire surface. Let the Vaseline soak into the leather.You don't need to lump a goopy mess of petroleum jelly onto the belt in order to soften it. A thin, slick layer will do.

, Wipe the Vaseline away with a rag or tissue. Leave the leather out to dry before you wear the belt. If you want it to dry a bit more quickly, try leaving it out in the sun.

Let the oil dry into the leather.",How to Soften a Leather Belt2," Lay the leather belt outside on a sunny day. Leave it out for about ten minutes to open the pores and prepare the material., Coconut oil (the organic kind that you'd use for cooking) is a great easy-to-find softening agent. Try avocado oil, jojoba oil, olive oil, or almond oil. Use any natural oil that you would put onto yourself as a skin-softener. Leather is the dried and treated skin of a cow – so it essentially made from the same stuff as your own skin.


Natural oils have the added benefit of smelling pleasant. Rubbing alcohol and Vaseline will do a great job of softening up your belt, but you might be off-put by the decidedly chemical scent. Pick an oil that you like to smell.
Avoid using chemically hydrogenated oils – namely, most commercial corn oils and vegetable oils.

, Simply dip your fingers into the oil, then rub it thoroughly over the surface of the belt. Add multiple layers of oil for an improved softening effect. The more oil you use, the softer the leather will get.Don't worry about using too much. Most natural oil should not damage leather.

, Note that the oil—especially coconut oil—may slightly darken the belt. However, it also turns your stiff leather into a smooth, wearable material. If your belt is not soft enough, try repeating the oil treatment.


You can use this darkening effect to change up the look of your leather belt. Just make sure that you apply it evenly so there aren't any mismatching lighter splotches!

Buy a dedicated leather conditioner.,
Apply the conditioner.",How to Soften a Leather Belt3," You can usually buy these products (usually labeled as ""leather therapy,"" ""restorer,"" or ""conditioner"") at stores that sell saddles and bridles for horses. You may also use leather treatment products that are designed to soften, clean, and polish leather shoes.Many of these ointments will actually strengthen leather. They were designed for use on saddles and bridles, and you can trust them as a lasting solution.
Be aware that leather treatment products are usually more expensive than natural oils, Vaseline, and rubbing alcohol. Pick up one of these ointments if you have money to spend on pampering your belt., Most products will have specialized instructions listed on the bottle or tub of leather ointment. Spray, spread, or rub the conditioner into the leather and let it soak. Apply as needed. Let the belt dry before you wear it.

Wrap the measuring tape around the part of your hips or natural waist, depending on where you plan to wear the belt. Add 5 to 10 inches (12.7 to 25.4 cm) to this measurement, depending on how much leeway you want the belt to have.
The final width of the belt should be 1.5 inches (3.8 cm), but you'll need a little extra width while working on the design. It's best to have 1 inch (2.5 cm) extra on either side, so the width should be about 3.5 inches (8.9 cm).
You'll need to use canvas with a fairly tight weave, so 16-point or 18-point is ideal. Also note that you'll need a size 22 tapestry needle for canvas this tight.;
, Bind all four edges of the belt with 1-inch (2.5-cm) wide strips of masking tape.


When working on the actual design, you will only needlepoint in the space between the taped edges.
Taping the edges off can help prevent the canvas from fraying as you work. It also prevents the yarn from getting snagged on any rough edges.

, Lay the piece of canvas on a sturdy piece of paper and trace around all four edges. Keep the canvas as flat and still as possible when you trace the design.


Set aside the outline for later use. You may need to block the canvas if it becomes distorted, and you can use this outline as a guide during that part of the process.

, Find or design a pattern for your belt. If you're feeling bold and creative, you can create your own pattern. For those who would rather play it safe, though, you can find free needlepoint patterns online by searching for “free needlepoint belt patterns” using your favorite Internet search engine.


If you're new to needlepoint, or simply new to the process of using needlepoint on belts, it will be in your best interest to start with a simple design. Consider something like stripes or argyle. As you become more comfortable with the practice, you can gradually begin working on more complex designs like logos, flowers, and other free-form shapes.

, Use a waterproof pen or pencil to lightly mark out your chosen design onto the trimmed piece of canvas. This will make it much easier for you to determine where your stitches must go as you needlepoint.Professionally crafted patterns will use grids to illustrate the finished design. Count the number of squares used for a particular color on the chart, then mark out an equivalent number of stitches on your canvas.
Note that you'll need to use different symbols to mark out different colors on the canvas. Make sure that you know which symbols correspond to which colors before you begin to needlepoint.

, Look at the design and identify the darkest colors. As a general rule, you should needlepoint these areas first before moving onto the lighter colors.


Light colors yarns can become soiled when dark yarns rub against them. By working from dark to light, you can minimize the amount of soiling or bleeding that occurs and, as a result, keep your colors looking as pure as possible.

, For most patterns, you'll need to needlepoint the details first and complete the background afterward.


This is especially true of non-geometric designs. Complete the main design first, followed by any border you plan to use. Once those details are complete, you can fill in the background.
When you're working on geometric designs, however, you'll need to work across the length of the canvas gradually. Complete the details in one section, then complete the background for the same section before moving onto the next section and repeating the process.

, The yarn should only be between 14 and 18 inches (35.5 and 45.7 cm), no matter how much of that color you will need overall.


If you use lengths of yarn that are too long, it will be more likely to twist or fray as you work. That could result in stitches that look messy and uneven.
Make sure that you use embroidery thread/yarn suitable for the canvas mesh. Persian and crewel threads work well, as does size 5 perle cotton thread. You can use plain embroidery cotton, too, but only use three of the six plies. Silk threads specifically label for fine mesh work may also be used., Knot one end of the yarn, then insert the other end of the thread through the eye of your tapestry needle.


Tie the knot as close to the end as possible. This knot must be large enough to prevent the end of the thread from coming through the canvas.
Pull roughly 2 inches (5 cm) of yarn through the eye of the needle. Do not knot this second end.

, Insert the needle into the wrong side of the canvas, drawing it out through the right side. Start roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the beginning of your design.


Pull the yarn all the way through until the knot lies flat against the back of the canvas.
If you're right-handed, it will usually be easiest to start in the upper right corner of the color area. If you're left-handed, you may want to start in the upper left corner of the color area.

, Complete as much of the color area as possible using the current length of yarn. Stop once you only have a double needle-length of yarn left.


There are different types of stitches you'll need to know when doing needlepoint. Some of the basics include the half cross stitch, the continental stitch, the basket weave, and the backstitch.
The exact way to make your stitches will vary depending on the design and the type of stitch you plan to use. For each stitch type, you will need to pull the thread back through to the wrong side of the canvas to complete each stitch, but the positioning of the thread can vary depending on the stitch type.
Note that each stitch should begin and end the same way, regardless of where it is or which type of stitch you use.

, When you are no longer able to work with a length of yarn, bring the needle the the wrong side of the canvas and run it through a line of stitches from the back. This should be enough to secure the stitches you just made.


After securing your stitches, you should trim any knots or loose ends on the back side of the work.

, Repeat the stitching process across the entire length of canvas, switching thread colors as needed, until the entire pattern has been completed.


After the length of yarn, you can start each consecutive piece by feeding it through a few stitches at the wrong side of the canvas. This should be enough to hold the yarn in place and prevent you from needing to knot it.
Pay attention the the tension you use while creating stitches. Each stitch should lie flat against the surface of the canvas. Pulling too tightly will cause the canvas to distort, but pulling too loosely can cause the thread to unravel and look uneven.

, As you work across the design, do what you can to keep the work neat and clean. It'll be easier to create a polished piece if you're mindful about it throughout the process, rather than waiting until the very end.


Yarn can often become twisted as you work. Every few stitches, you should let the needle dangle so that it can naturally unwind itself.
Trim loose ends as you work to prevent tangles. If you wait until the end, small bits of frayed yarn can mingle into other colors and cause a distortion in shade.

, Some warping may occur as you complete your needlepoint. If the shape of the belt becomes distorted, you need to ""block"" it to stretch the material back into shape.Dampen the material with clean water from a spray bottle. The canvas should be moist but not soaked.
Note that you should only dampen the needlepoint if the threads you used are color fast. If they aren't, you will follow all steps of the blocking process other than the dampening step.
Place the outline you created earlier onto a piece of cardboard, then lay the work right-side down onto the outline. Carefully stretch the canvas so that it matches the outline and hold it in place using straight pins spaced 1-inch (2.5-cm) apart around the perimeter.
Allow the material to dry completely for an hour or two. After it dries, remove the pins. The canvas should be back in shape.

, Carefully peel away all of the masking tape, then fold the top and bottom lengthwise edges to the wrong side of the canvas by 1 inch (2.5 cm) each.


Only the portion of canvas previously covered by masking tape should be hidden beneath the wrong side of the canvas. The portion of the belt displaying your needlepoint should remain visible.
Use an iron to press these folds and hold the hem in place.

, Place a length of permanent fusible fabric tape over both lengthwise edges from the wrong side of the belt. Depending on the width of the tape, you may need to use one or two pieces to cover both raw ends.


Make sure that you use permanent fusible fabric tape instead of temporary tape.
The adhesive side of the tape is usually shinier than the non-adhesive side. Make sure that the adhesive side covers and overlaps the both lengthwise edges.

, Heat a standard iron and press the tape from the wrong side of the belt. Ideally, the tape should melt onto the material after being heated for 5 seconds.You may need to adjust the heat setting until you find the right one. Start with a low synthetic setting and work your way up to hotter settings as needed.
When finished, both lengthwise edges should be secured and unable to fray or unfold.

, Place a toothed belt tip over one short end of the belt. Carefully strike the belt tip with a hammer until it closes around the canvas and locks into place.Make sure that the belt tip is as wide as the canvas belt. A larger or shorter tip won't fit correctly.
The belt tip alone should be enough to stop the canvas from fraying, but if desired you can make the end more secure by covering it with fusible fabric tape or stitching across the end before putting the belt tip on.

, Slide two D-rings around the other end of the belt, pulling 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) of material through. Fold this end to the back side of the canvas and stitch in place.


You can use either a straight stitch or a zigzag stitch, depending on how you want the belt to look. Either way, make sure the stitching is tight and the end is secure.
Since there are so many layers of canvas, it's best to secure this end by sewing it instead of using fusible fabric tape.

, The belt is now complete and ready to wear. Wrap it around your waist and weave the free end into the D-rings to hold it in place.

If you are tall and thin, you can experiment with even wider styles. If you are short-waisted and carry extra weight at your middle, stick to thinner corset belts to create a balanced look for your figure.Some corset belts are so wide that they end just beneath the breasts. They are best worn if you have a naturally small waist.;
, The color of a corset belt can affect how it looks on your body. If you are thin and have a small waist, any color will work for your figure. If you are thicker in your midsection, opt for a corset belt in a dark shade that will help minimize the appearance of your waist rather than light or bright colors that may make your waist appear larger.If you’re not sure what color corset belt to start with, a black belt is the most flattering option on all body types.
Patterned corset belts, such as an animal print style, can help add flair to your outfit, but they can have the same effect as belts in light and bright colors. They work best for small waists.

, No matter what your body type is, you can spice up the look of a corset belt by choosing an embellished style. Select a belt that features metallic, studded, lace, or cutout details to make even more of a statement piece.You may want to choose a corset belt that features actual laces so it is more reminiscent of an actual corset.

, Because a corset belt helps define the waist, it’s an ideal piece to wear over loose-fitting outfits. You might wear it over a baggy sweater, oversized dress shirt, or loose-fitting maxi dress  to help create a more flattering fit.If you’re wearing a corset belt with a loose-fitting top, be sure to choose bottoms that have a slim fit to create a balanced silhouette. Skinny jeans, leggings, and pencil skirts are good options.
You can use a corset belt to make a dress out of a large t-shirt. Wear the belt over an oversized white or black tee that falls to approximately your knees to create a casual-looking dress.

, When you’re new to wearing a corset belt, it’s usually best to create a monochromatic look with it and the clothing that you layer it over. For example, wear a black corset belt over a black dress or a white belt over a white dress shirt. It will help create a defined waist by won’t break up your figure at all so you’ll create the most flattering silhouette.If you want your belt to stand out a little more when you’re doing a monochromatic look, choose an embellished or textured style. For example, a studded black leather belt will stand out against a black dress more easily than a plain black style.
You can also use contrasting fabrics to help the belt stand out. For example, layer a white satin corset belt over a white cotton dress shirt for added definition.

, You may typically wear your belts over simple tops and dresses, but you can make an even bolder statement with a corset belt. Wear it over an item that you might not expect, such as a blazer, coat, or other tailored menswear-inspired pieces. The corset belt has a decidedly feminine look, so you can create a striking look by pairing it with clothing that has a more masculine feel.When you’re wearing the belt over heavier items, such as a blazer or coat, don’t cinch it too tightly. You still want the corset to be comfortable, so loosen it slightly if necessary.

, While belts usually sit at the waist, corset belts offer more versatility when it comes to placement. You can set it right at your waist to help define it for a traditional look, or position the belt higher up, just beneath the chest, so it accentuates that area of your body.Keep the type of fabric that your top or dress is made of in mind when you’re trying to decide where to place the belt. In most cases, thicker clothing, such as a wool sweater, looks best with the belt at the waist. Thinner items, such as a cotton dress, can work with the belt at the waist or higher up on your torso.

, When you wear a corset belt, you usually want it to be the centerpiece of your outfit. That means you should go for a minimal look when it comes to other accessories. Skip the statement necklace, heavy bangles, and dramatic dangling earrings so they don’t compete with the belt.Choose delicate jewelry, such as stud earrings and thin chain necklaces, when you’re wearing a corset belt.
If you want to wear a piece of statement jewelry, opt for a cocktail ring. It will add personality to your outfit without drawing too much attention from the belt.

, When you’re choosing shoes to wear with a corset belt, aim to create a contrast. Because the belt has a feminine look, footwear that has a more rugged or chunky appearance is the ideal option. Pair your belt with hiking boots, wedge heels, or menswear-inspired loafers.If you want to wear your belt with heels, skip stilettos and opt for a thicker heel, such as a stacked heel.
For a subtler look with your footwear, pair the corset belt with simple ballet flats.

, To keep attention on your corset belt, you don’t want to have an oversized purse or bag on your shoulder. Instead, choose a small handbag, such as a clutch or wristlet, so the belt remains the star of your look.Avoid crossbody bags, which may hide or compete with the belt.

It’s important that your glasses fit properly and conform to your face so that you can wear them for extended periods without discomfort. Try to find a pair that wear naturally without any painful protrusions, awkward gaps or slipping.Ideally, your sunglasses should fit close to your face and have large enough frames to keep light from straying into your vision around the top and sides.
Look closely at the material of the temple arms (the part that goes over your ears). Certain materials like silicone and molded acetate will be much more comfortable than rigid plastic.;
, Think about why you’re in the market for new eyewear and what kinds of things you’ll be doing in them. Are you searching for a good all-around pair? Does your occupation require them? Or are they purely for fashion purposes? Keeping in mind your reasons for wearing sunglasses will help make sure you end up with the right pair.


Someone looking for an all-purpose set of sunglasses will have the most luck with a basic pair of Wayfarers, aviators or Browlines. Those with fashion in mind should look at classic styles like Persols or other timeless designs, especially those with visually interesting frame shapes and materials. Outdoor enthusiasts will likely gravitate toward brands like Oakley and Zeal Optics that manufacture durable, functional eyewear for active use.
Collect a few different pairs of sunglasses over time. That way you’ll have a pair suitable for any occasion.

, Try on many different styles and see how they look on your face. Just like when you’re trying a new shirt or pair of pants, fit is important. While the “best” pair of sunglasses is the one you like the most, they’ll each frame your face in a unique way, so once your functional needs are met, go with what looks best on you.Generally, it’s best to stick with sunglasses that offset the shape of your face. For instance, if you have a thin, angular face, you’ll want to wear a wide, curved pair of glasses, whereas people with rounder faces will be able to better pull off squared, linear frames.
In the end, go with what you think looks good. Picking out the perfect pair of sunglasses is mostly a matter of personal preference.

, Once you’ve settled on a style and fit for your sunglasses, you can weigh your options for the materials they’re constructed from. Glasses that are made with basic materials such as plastic and lightweight metals will obviously be less costly than premium artisan ones like wood and tortoise shell. Pay attention to any particular frames that catch your eye.Try to find a material with a desirable balance of good looks, durability, comfort and price.
Set a budget for yourself and keep that number in mind when shopping for sunglasses in various materials. Frames made from tortoise shell or buffalo horn can cost upwards of $20,000 in some instances, while even the highest quality plastic frames will be no more than a few hundred dollars., Break out your sunglasses when it’s bright outside so that your vision remains unimpaired. High concentrations of UV rays are damaging to the eyes, and they can also be a nuisance while driving or performing other tasks. Since this is the primary intended use of sunglasses, their level of protection should be something you consider when selecting a pair.Make sure the sunglasses you buy are polarized. This means they’ll eliminate the glare of reflected light.Keep your sunglasses somewhere close at hand, like in the glove compartment of your car or in a case that you can slip in your pocket. That way you’ll have them when you need them.

, Find a pair of sunglasses that will hold up to the rugged use of sports or outdoor activities. In addition to blocking out the sun, they’ll also provide a barrier between your eyes and whatever dirt, debris or tennis balls that might be coming at you. Brands like Oakley, Roka and Spy Optics are well known for their sport-inspired eyewear, especially in “shield” and wraparound styles.When buying performance sunglasses, decide on the depth and color for the lens tint that will be the most beneficial for the activity.

, Complete your look with a pair of shades that accentuates your clothing. Sunglasses are a visual aid first and foremost, but when worn correctly they can also fulfill the role of other accessories like hats, belts and watches. Look for glasses that are consistent with the style and colors you’re dressed in. If you only plan on owning one pair, make it a neutral design that will go with a wider variety of wardrobe choices.Keep your eyewear consistent with the rest of your clothes. It would be silly to wear a pair of brightly-tinted cycling goggles with a suit.
Match your sunglasses to your outfit the way you would your shoes or belt—brown frames go with dusty earth tones, navy and olive; black or metallic frames go with black, white or gray attire; brightly-colored frames shouldn’t clash with the other colors in your clothing, etc.

, Those who wear eyeglasses can have the lenses of their sunglasses formulated for their individual prescription. That way, you’ll never be forced to choose between seeing and shielding your eyes from the sun, and you’ll look dapper to boot. Prescription sunglasses will be the most useful for people who spend a lot of time outside and frequently wear sunglasses as part of their daily ensemble.You can also get prescription sunglasses with photochromic or graduated lenses, offering a middle ground between normal eyewear and stylish flair., It’s hard to go wrong with a classic full-frame model of sunglasses like aviators or Wayfarers. These are versatile styles that can be worn with anything from a t-shirt and jeans to resort casual getup, but they serve best as a laid-back, casual accessory. They also tend to be constructed from simple materials like plastic and lightweight metal, making them readily available and inexpensive.Full-frame glasses are the most durable because the lenses are enveloped and secured on all sides by the frame.
Aviators should be reserved for less formal appearances, and won’t go as well with nicer attire as something like a Wayfarer or Persol.

, The lenses of half-frame glasses are attached to the frame at the top and open at the bottom. They are a more vintage frame style and have a considerable business and fashion-savvy appeal. Glasses like the Browline/Clubmaster and semi-rimless complement a suit and tie or shorts and flip flops equally well.These should be handled with care since most of their lenses are exposed.
Half-frame glasses are versatile and make a great alternative to the same old humdrum styles you see everywhere., Slip on a pair of sunglasses that can hang with you while you’re shooting hoops or mountain biking over rough terrain. Performance sunglasses are typically made with composite materials that are lightweight, flexible and specially treated to minimize glare. A pair of a shield, wraparound or sport half-frames will ensure that you look good while taking part in your favorite pastimes.For high-impact activities, get a strap to go along with your sunglasses so that you don’t lose them.

, Since almost every part of a pair of sunglasses comes in many different designs, you have a lot more options to choose from than just what’s on the rack. Play it cool with some timeless Persols, or experiment with more unusual frame shapes and colors, like John Lennon’s trademark round pair. Use your shades to show off your unique personality. The number of possible combinations is virtually endless.If you really want to shake things up, wear a pair of specialty frames. These come in all sorts of shapes like rectangles, ovals, triangles, and even stars!
You can have your sunglasses tinted almost any color for an extra splash of character.

Try out the monocular before you buy it.,
Get a warranty for the monocular.",How to Select a Monocular," The magnification power of the monocular will affect how far and how detailed you can see something. Monoculars with higher magnification power will let you see further and in more detail. Most monoculars have a magnification power of 5x to 8x.Though higher magnification can seem like a better option, it will be harder to use the instrument at higher magnifications, as small movements make the image jump more at higher magnifications. If you are looking for an easy to use monocular with decent magnification, you may opt for a 5x, 6x or 8x one.If you want monoculars with higher magnification power, you may go for a monocular with a 9x or a 10x magnification. You may opt for higher magnification power if you are experienced with using binoculars, spotting scopes, and monoculars.
Keep in mind that as the magnification power gets higher, your field of view goes down. So you may opt for a monocular with lower magnification power if you want a wide field of view.;
, You should also consider your ideal lens size, as a bigger lens will allow you to see a wider view and get a better, brighter image. A smaller lens may not have as good of a view, but they are easier to use and less bulky. Most monoculars will have a lens size of between 20mm to 42mm.You may find that monoculars come with a specific magnification power and lens size, such as an 8 x 25, which is a monocular with an 8x magnification and a 25mm lens. You may try out several different monoculars with a set magnification power and lens size to get a sense of what you are looking for.

, Most monoculars have a lens that has an anti-glare coating on it. The coating on the lens can affect the image brightness and enhance or obscure your view through the monocular.There is a range of anti-glare coverage, from just the external elements to all the lenses fully coated. The best (and most expensive) option is ""fully multi-coated,"" which means all sides of all the lenses have multiple layers of anti-glare coatings, so your view is not obscured.
Other options are coated (the lowest quality, should be used only in non-direct light); fully coated (lenses are coated with a single material and may still be affected by glare and sunlight); and multi-coated (lenses are layered with multiple anti-glare coats, though the coating is not of the same quality as fully multi-coated lenses)., You should also look at the close focus capabilities on the monocular. The close focus is the distance at which the monocular will focus on an object. Close focus may be measured in inches, rather than yards.If you want to view objects in detail when they are a few feet away from you, you may opt for a monocular with a high close focus. A monocular with a high close focus will allow you to view objects at a distance in detail.

, Eye relief is the space between your eye and the eyepiece on the monocular. It is measured in millimeters and will affect how far you can see through the scope of the monocular. If you wear glasses, you will need an eye relief of at least 14mm.If you do not wear glasses, you may not need a large eye relief.

, Monoculars use both lenses and prisms to refract light and make distant images appear magnified. Monoculars usually use a roof prism or Porro prism. The type of prism used will usually depend on the magnification level of the monocular.If you are choosing a model with a higher magnification, the monocular will likely have a roof prism. This image will be more narrow and compact than one produced bt a Porro prism.
A Porro prism is the most commonly used. Porro prisms will give the image more depth and produce a brighter image than roof prisms.

, You should consider your ideal size for the monocular. A smaller sized monocular will often fit in your pocket and can be a good portable device. A larger monocular may be bulkier and harder to carry, but it may also offer a sharper, brighter image.An 8 x 25 or 10 x 25 monocular are considered pocket or compact models. You can slip a compact monocular in your bag, in your pocket, or keep it in your car.
Larger monoculars that are 9 x 30 or 10 x 42 may require a larger carrying bag and are often set up on a tripod.

, Think about how often you are planning to use the monocular and in what ways. If you want a monocular that is lightweight and easy to carry with you on hikes or walks, you may opt for a smaller, lightweight model. If you do not mind a heavier monocular that you need to transport in a carrying bag, you may opt for a larger monocular model.You may try several different sized monoculars to get a sense of their weight and girth. If you are planning to carry the monocular around with you often, you may not want to get a model that is too heavy or bulky.

, If you are planning to use the monocular at night, you may opt for a model that has night vision. Night vision monoculars have a built-in illuminator that allows you to see through them at night. These models also have a lower magnification so the image is less fuzzy or obscured at night.If you are planning to use the monocular around water, such as when you are boating or fishing, you may want a model that waterproof. Waterproof monoculars can be more expensive so you may not go for this feature unless you know you are going to use the device near water.

, When you shop for a monocular, you should look online at several models and brands to compare their prices. Take into consideration what you are looking for in terms of magnification power, the lens, the size, and the weight of the monocular. Try to compare several retailers online as well so you can get the best price for the monocular model you want.You may also visit several retailers and compare prices that way. Talk to the salesperson about getting a price match or a reduced price on a monocular if you find the same model at a different retailer for a lower price.

, You should go in person to several retailers and try the monoculars yourself before you buy one. Hold the monocular in your hand to feel its weight and size. Slip it in your pocket and see how comfortable it feels. Put the monocular to your eye to make sure the eye relief is a fit for you.


You may try out several different models to get a sense of what will suit your needs. Do not be afraid to ask a salesperson to let you hold the monocular and try it out in the store. Notice the magnification power and the lens on the monocular. Make sure it is a good fit for you.

, Once you decide to buy a monocular, you should speak to the salesperson about getting a warranty for the product. In general, monoculars are often more expensive and may come with a warranty to ensure the product works well.


Having a warranty for the monocular will make it easier for you to return it if there is an issue and give you some assurance that the manufacturer stands by their product.

Don't think that your braces and glasses make you a nerd.,
Stay true to your personality.,
Don't take yourself so seriously.,
Remember that glasses are in now.,
Know that braces aren't forever.,
Tell yourself that everyone is self-conscious about something.,
Know that people will get used to your new look pretty fast.,
Keep up your confidence.,
Find the part of you that you want people to see.,
Go wild and get a makeover.,
Don't hide your smile.,
Choose glasses and braces that fit your personality.,
Maintain your appearance.,
Take care of yourself.",How to Rock Both Braces and Glasses," Though in recent times, the terms ""nerd"" and ""geek"" have been reclaimed as pretty cool, if people still use these words negatively in your school, then you need to realize that your glasses and braces don't have anything to do with who you are as a person. If you don't want to be labeled a geek, then you have to think that you aren't a geek (unless you are, of course -- and that's cool, too!).


People may have an image of what it means to wear braces and glasses -- it's up to you to prove them wrong!
If you act like you're cool, then other people are sure to follow. But if you act weak or scared, then you'll leave an opening for people to call you a nerd or a geek.;
, Stick to your real personality and be confident. No matter what people say to you, you're still the person you always were underneath. If you don't change who you are, how you feel, or how you act, then people won't think twice about your glasses and braces. Wear what you usually wear and keep being your smiling, happy self. If people notice a change in how you act, then they'll know that your glasses and braces are to blame.


If you're normally outgoing, don't let your glasses or braces hold you back!

, Learn to laugh at yourself. If you want to poke fun at yourself for having four eyes or a face full of metal, go for it. Why not beat other people to the punch? If people know that you're comfortable with your quirks, then they'll back off. If you act like you're constantly worried about what people will say about your braces and your glasses, then they'll be more likely to make fun of you.



Be approachable and friendly. If you have a great personality, less and less people are going to notice your mouth of metal. Remember Ugly Betty, who does this successfully.

, Wearing glasses, whether they are thick black glasses or of the thinner variety, is decidedly in now. Celebrities such as Ryan Gosling, Anne Hathaway, Katy Perry, and Justin Bieber have been seen sporting this trendy accessory. It's cool to wear glasses, and though glasses make some people think of computers and ""being nerdy,"" guess what? Computers, the tech world, and programming are all the rage in this world, so even if that doesn't describe you, wearing glasses will make you more cool, not less cool, by association.

, Even in the most extreme situations, you won't be wearing your braces for the entirety of your elementary school, middle school, or high school years. We're talking about a year or two of unpleasantness in exchange for a straight pair of pearly whites. You shouldn't have a countdown until the minute your braces come off, but you should remember that soon, your teeth won't be sporting extra metal swag.

, No matter what age you are, but especially if you're a preteen or a teenager, you will be spending most of your time around people who are really just little balls of stress and insecurity. Everyone at that age has something they don't like about themselves, from their acne to their height, so you can just be happy that all you have to worry about are braces and glasses, and learn to love these aspects of yourself.

, It'll only take a week or so of wearing glasses for you to take them off for a minute and have people say, ""Wow, you look so weird without them!"" People will quickly adapt to your new look and will forget that you ever looked any other way. And that includes you. Once you get settled in, you won't even wish you didn't have glasses or braces because you'll be used to the new you.

, Remember what an amazing person you are -- glasses, braces and all. Don't be afraid to go to parties because you don't like the way you look. Don't fear approaching your crush because you think you can never kiss with braces anyway. Go about your daily life while remembering how amazing you are, and the rest will be as easy as pie.


Remember that you love who you are, what you do, and all of the people in your life. If you've always had lower self-confidence, work on addressing your flaws and finding something you're passionate about. If you're happy with yourself, then you'll be happy with your appearance.

, Whether it be your cool fashion sense, athleticism, singing or dancing talent, whatever! Find the part of you that makes you most unique. Let this be the thing that people will notice, not your glasses. Show off your favorite personality trait or skill (without being too arrogant), and you'll see that this is what people really focus on.


If you like singing karaoke, don't be afraid to get up on stage and belt your favorite tune!

, Have you been sick of the same old haircut? Think you've been styling your hair the wrong way? Feel like you've been doing your makeup all wrong? Well, this may be the perfect time to treat yourself to an appearance upgrade. If you're happy with your looks already, of course, then you need not apply!


It can be fun to get a new hairstyle while you get braces and glasses. Just don't try to style your hair to cover up more of your face, though, or people will be on to you!

, Don't be one of those people who is afraid to smile for three years because of braces. Not smiling a lot externally will make you a less happy person on the inside. So, continue to flash your smile, to be a happy person, and to let people see your teeth. Don't let your appearance keep you from having a great time with your friends. You'll be a little self-conscious about smiling with your new braces, at first, but after a little practice, you and everyone around you will forget that you have them on.

, There are various color and shape options available for glasses. There is also the option of contacts. Some patients can wear Invisalign instead of braces, but even the rubber bands in braces can be customized for those who want colorful teeth or made white/clear for those who want to be subtle.


Don't think that having glasses or braces means you have to look unattractive for a little while. You'll have to wear them for a while, so you might as well make the most of them.
It depends on the look you're going for. Some people get their favorite colors in their braces to add some flair to their look, while others opt for the clear braces instead. It's all about what makes you feel comfortable.

, Don't stop caring about your clothes and your looks just because you're wearing glasses and braces. If you normally like to dress up, then keep doing that. Don't go into sweatpants mode just because you feel down about your appearance. In fact, you can even dress up a bit more if you think that will cheer you up and make you feel special.


If you normally wear makeup, keep wearing it. Don't think that you want to take attention away from your beautiful face!

, Keep clean and groom yourself nicely. Wear a little mascara, blush, and lip gloss, and a little perfume if you are a girl. And if you are a guy, let smelling good be your top priority, not only will this attract girls, it will boost your confidence. Bathing regularly, and wearing deodorant is just enough, though wearing nice cologne is always nice.


Making an effort to maintain your appearance will make you feel better about your looks and your personality.

Clean the surface of your lenses in order to determine where the scratches actually are.,
Apply scratch remover to your lenses.,
Wipe off any excess scratch remover.,
Try another cleaner if toothpaste or baking soda did not work.,
Apply a scratch filling product if scratches remain.,
Put your glasses back on!",How to Remove Scratches From Plastic Lens Glasses1," Make sure to use a cleaner made specifically for glasses and a clean micro-fiber cloth. You can get this at any eye glass store or optometrist's office. In fact, they will probably give it to you for free if you have bought glasses there.;
, There are a wide variety of products that can be used to remove scratches to your lenses. Begin by dabbing a non-abrasive toothpaste on the lens.Rub it on the scratch in a circular motion with a cotton ball and rinse it with cool water. If the scratch is deep, you may need to repeat the process a few times.


If you don't have non-abrasive toothpaste you can make a paste from baking soda and water.Put baking soda in a bowl and mix in small amounts of water until you have a thick paste. Rub the paste on the same way you did the toothpaste, and rinse it off when you think the scratch is gone.

, If you cannot remove it all with a rag or a cotton ball, rinse the lenses with cool water and wipe dry with a non-abrasive rag.

, Try buffing the scratched plastic glasses with brass or silver polish and a soft rag. Rub the polish around on the glasses and wipe any excess off with a clean, soft rag. Repeat until the scratch is gone.


Be careful of your glasses frames when using a cleaner that is not made for glasses. Try not to get any on your frames because it is unknown what the cleaner will do to the frames.

, If you still have visible scratches on the surface of your plastic lenses you can apply a product that will fill the scratches temporarily with wax.Simply rub on the product onto the lenses using a clean micro-fiber cloth, rub it around in a circular motion, and then wipe it off with a clean area of the cloth. This will allow you to see clearly through your glasses but will need to be reapplied weekly.


The two types of products that work best for this are products made to wax your car, such as Turtle Wax, and furniture polishes that contains wax, such as Lemon Pledge.

, You should be able to see much better through your newly repaired lenses.

Verify that your lenses are plastic, not glass.,
Clean the surface of your plastic lenses as you would normally.,
Buy a glass etching abrasive designed for glass art projects.You can buy the abrasive at any hobby or craft store.,
Put on your rubber gloves before applying the abrasive to your plastic lenses and take the lenses out of your glasses.,
Apply the glass etching abrasive to the lenses with a cloth or a cotton ball.,
Wipe off all of the abrasive with a soft cloth or cotton ball.,
Put your lenses back in your glasses frames and put on your glasses.",How to Remove Scratches From Plastic Lens Glasses2," This method can ONLY be used on plastic lenses, as it will permanently and irrevocably ruin glass lenses. It is also a method of last resort for plastic lenses, as it will remove all coatings from your plastic lenses.This means that once all the coatings are gone, your lenses will no longer have any protection and you are more likely to get major scratches in your lenses in the future.Only do this method if you are ok with removing the anti-reflective or anti-scratch coating from your glasses. Many times it is scratches to these coatings that hinder your sight and so removing the coatings will allow you to see through your lenses once again. It's best to try this method as a last resort before you cave in and buy new glasses.

, Use a cleaner made to clean eyeglasses and a clean micro-fiber cloth. Cleaning the surface will allow you to see the extent of the actual scratches to your lenses.

,


Glass etching compounds contain hydrofluoric acid, an acid that eats through almost anything other than plastic. When you apply it to your lenses it will eat through any coatings but will leave the plastic lenses completely intact.You will also need rubber gloves when applying the abrasive, so buy those too if you don't already have some.

, You will also need a small plastic container to set the lenses in while they are covered in the abrasive. Be sure that this container will not be used with food after it is used for this project.

, Then put the lenses in your small plastic container and let them sit for a few minutes.

, Rinse the lenses with cold water. Dispose of all items that came in contact with the abrasive (except your lenses obviously) in the trash.

, While they will no longer have anti-reflective or anti-scratch coatings, you should be able to see through them much better.

Put on the belt loop.",How to Make a Leather Belt," First, you will need to take measurements to know where to cut the leather. A simple way to do this is to put on a belt that you already have, put it on to the belt hole that fits you best, and measure the belt all the way around. You can also use a tape measurer by putting it around your hips at the place where the belt would sit and recording the measurement.Use a measurement that feels most comfortable. If you pull the belt or measuring tape tightly, then you might end up with a belt that feels uncomfortable to wear.;
, Purchase a long piece of 8 to 9 oz. vegetable tanned leather. Any type of vegetable tanned leather will do. You can find leather online, at a tannery, or look for a leather shop in your area., You need to create a straight edge on the leather to give the strap cutter somewhere to rest. First, lay your leather out flat on a table. Then, mark straight, long line on one side of the leather. The line should be larger than the size you measured. For example, cut 45 inches for a 32-inch waist size. Finish the cut with a perpendicular cut so that the strap cutter can easily enter and exit the leather.Use a ruler as you’re cutting to make sure the line is absolutely straight.

, First, you will need to set the thickness knob on the strap cutter so the piece of leather you have fits through it. After that, you can set the thickness to whatever you prefer. A 1 ¼ inch wide belt is a safe choice., Press the strap cutter up against the straight edge you just made in the leather. Slowly feed the leather into the strap cutter. Go slowly and make sure the straight edge stays pressed up against the strap cutter. Grab the leather once it comes out of the strap cutter and pull it.Take this step very slowly or you could end up with a piece of leather that is not straight and basically unusable.

, The easiest way to mark the holes is to use a belt that you already have and base your holes off of the placement of those holes. You will have five holes on total. Two holes close to the tail end of the belt, one larger hole for where the fold occurs for the buckle, and two holes after that. The holes should be placed about an inch apart.Use a pencil to mark the placement of the holes.

, Use your hole puncher to punch out the holes where you have made the marks. 5/64 is good to use for the size of the hole punches. Use your strap hole punch to cut out the longer holes., Shaving off some of the thickness in the place where you just made the holes helps the belt fold over itself for the buckle and loops. Skive off about half of the thickness. Go slowly and make shallow cuts. Don’t try to take off half of the thickness at once.You can also use a belt sander to take off the thickness, but you are more likely to get “fuzzies” with this method.

, Put the buckle in place, and fold the skived leather over itself. You do this so that you can take an actual measurement of the belt. Once the buckle is in place, measure three inches beyond the measurement you took of your waist. For example, if your waist measurement was 31 inches, then you would make a mark at the 34-inch spot. Mark the 34 inch spot because that is where the center hole will go., Use your hole punch at 9/64 and punch a hole in the spot you made. Then, make two more hole punches on either side of the center hole. Each hole should be spaced an inch apart.The extra holes allow you some space for breathing room.

, Take this time to shape the end of the belt. You can use a pencil to make a light sketch of the shape you’d like. The easiest way to get the ideal shape for the end of the belt is to use a belt tip cutter, but you can also use leather scissors., Use the scrap leather that was cut off from the belt tip to make the belt loop. Feed the leftover leather into the cutter that should be adjusted to ½ of an inch. Then, skive the leather to about half of its thickness so that bend around the belt without a problem. , To figure out the length of the belt loop, put the strap of leather around the belt as if it the belt is already buckled. Put a mark at the place where the strap is overlapping by ½ and inch. Then, you can rivet the loop to secure it or sew it., Beveling the edges gives the belt a more refined look. First, use a damp sponge to dampen the edges of the belt. Then, use a beveler and glide it along the edges of the belt at a 45-degree angle. , Using a vegetable based dye is recommended because it is non-toxic and won’t do any harm to your skin. Use a towel or sponge to rub the dye on evenly along the entire top part of the belt. One example of a homemade, vegetable dye is a mixture of walnut husks and water.

, You don’t have to, but it is better to speed up the drying of the dye because you can’t use oil on the leather until it is completely dry. Use a heat gun on the entirety of the belt until it is completely dry. If you don’t the oil will give the belt a blotchy look because it won’t absorb evenly., Leather often becomes dry and stiff when it has been worked with. Apply a thin coating of extra virgin olive oil to the top of the belt with a towel. Apply a few, thin coats. Do not use too much olive oil at once, or the belt may end up with a greasy look and feel.It’s not necessary to apply olive oil to the back of the belt.
Keep in mind that the extra virgin olive oil will darken the leather.

, Use a towel to apply a coat of walnut oil and beeswax to the front and back of the belt. The oil and beeswax help preserve the leather and keep it flexible.Use a nail to remove beeswax that may get stuck in the holes.

, Slick down the edges by applying a layer of gum tragacanth, a thickening agent made from the sap of Middle Eastern legumes. You only need to apply a thin coat to the edges of the belt. To , A wood burnisher is the best way to burnish the edges, but is can be a costly tool, especially if you don’t plan to use it often. Another way to burnish the edges is to quickly rub canvas along the edges of the belt until you feel them heat up. This method, however, can be tiring., Snapping the end of the belt together is good because it makes the belt buckle interchangeable. You will, however, need a snap setting kit or a press to put the snap in place. Put the two snaps an inch apart near the end of the belt where the buckle will be. After the snaps are set, you can put the buck onto the belt.You can also choose to rivet the leather together if you will not be removing the buckle. Just make sure to put the buckle in place first.

, The last step to making your leather belt is to secure and place the belt loop. The belt loop should already be cut and measured. Secure the belt loop by using riveting it together with micro double sided rivets, or simply sew it together. Then, slide it onto the belt, and your leather belt is complete."
"
Lay out the things needed for making the belt.,
Lay the three leather pieces side by side.,
Start braiding the three leather pieces together.,
Take part B and C and switch places, almost like a twist.

,
Repeat step three.

,
With parts B and C in the twist, B should be in the middle again.,
Repeat steps 3, 4 and 5 until the braid stops about three to four inches (7.5-10cm) from the bottom.

,
Tie a basic knot to secure the leather braid.,
Take the left part of the braid (the part that isn't  twisted and looks like a normal braid) and gently tug those loops gently.,
Tighten the knot that you secured the braid with by pulling the ends.

,
Tie a knot.,
Cut a hole where you started the braid.,
Try the belt on.",How to Make a Braided Belt," Work on a flat surface with some paper towels or a matting, to prevent messing up your workspace.;
, Sew them together, trimming them to the desired width.

, The outside left piece is A. The middle piece is B and the outside right piece is C.

,,, Switch parts B and A. A should now be in the middle. Twist A and C just as you twisted B and C. When those are twisted, A should be in the middle. Switch A and B.

,, When tying it, don't make it too tight.

, This is to create a gap on every loop between the twist part and the regular braid part.

,, This ensures that the end of the belt is connected to the belt hook.

, You can now close the belt.

, It can be worn with a variety of clothing, as it will be a fairly neutral color.

, Even though they may not be visible, these paper products are slightly abrasive and will cause small scratches in the glass or plastic. Use a lint-free cloth instead., Both products can put permanent spots on your lenses. When using hairspray, take off your glasses or shield your glasses with your hand on your forehead. Don’t allow your glasses to rest near any nail polish remover., Even though this may sound like a great idea, it’s meant for window glass without coating. It’s not meant for your lenses, which are coated with products to reduce glare. Glass cleaner can damage your lenses., Wash both sides with warm water and a small amount of hand soap. Rise well. Then dry with a lint-free cloth. Keeping your glasses clean will also help prevent scratches, since dirt can get on your lenses and then turn into a scratch when you rub them with a cloth.

Use the glue-and-paper method.",How to Repair Eyeglasses1," For an effective temporary fix, it is possible to glue your eyeglass back together to repair a break at the bridge (the part that goes over your nose).



Clean. Make sure that the two pieces you're trying to glue are clean. (Remove all glue from previous attempts. If it's ""super glue"", fingernail polish with acetone will work but it's tough on the frames)
Get your supplies in place. Gather up the following: Super Glue (Locktite, Krazy Glue, etc), pieces of glossy wrapping paper or thick magazine pages that match your frames, sharp scissors
Cut the wrapping paper into thin strips approximating the width of your frames.

Glue the paper to your frames, one strip at a time. Use a short piece of paper as a splint across a broken nosepiece or wrap a longer piece around like an ace bandage.
Wait for each piece to dry before you add the next;
"
"
Get your materials in place.,
Clean and sand the broken pieces.,
Secure the two pieces together.,
Glue.,
Drill two holes.,
Sew a tension band in place.,
Add a wrap.",How to Repair Eyeglasses2," You'll need a thread, needle, drill, sandpaper, superglue, painter's stir stick, rubber bands, waxed paper, cotton swabs, alcohol or nail polish remover and a hobby knife.

, Use sandpaper to clean and rough up the broken area to be glued. Swab the area with some rubbing alcohol or nail polish remover to prepare the surface.

, Cut a piece of a painter's wooden stir stick to fit between the temples (aka, the side pieces) of your glasses. Cover your lenses with wax paper to prevent scratching and then wrap a rubber band over one end of the stick and secure it to your glasses. Do the same on the other end.


Line the two halves up carefully and be sure the rubber bands are holding things firmly in place. If it wasn't a clean break and there are some gaps, line the pieces up as best you can taking pains to ensure there are some definite points of contact.

, Fill the joint at the break with glue; use enough to secure the bridge but not so much that the glue runs out. Squeeze out the glue slowly and neatly to avoid bubbles. As you fill in the joint, be sure that there are no gaps or voids. Use the side of a cotton swab to gently clean up any excess glue; swab it up before it has a chance to dry and get tacky. Set the glasses aside for at least an hour so the glue can dry completely.

, Choose a small drill bit appropriate for the thickness of your eyeglass frames. Take your hobby knife and dig out pilot holes on either side of the newly repaired joint. Place your glasses down on a soft cloth that's been laid on a table top and carefully drill a hole on each side of the break. The holes must be parallel so they can be used to wrap a band of thread around the core joint.

, Use a fine needle and four to six feet of thread that matches the color of your eyeglass frames to ""sew"" the two sides of the repair together for added strength. Pass the needle and thread through the two holes as many times as you can taking care not to pull too hard and put stress on the newly repaired joint. Stop when there's no more room. Fill the drilled holes with glue, soaking the thread and blotting up any excess with a cotton swab. Trim the edges of the thread and allow the glue to dry for at least an hour.

, If you want to give extra strength to your repair, you can add this additional step to your process. Do not trim the edges of the thread as above. Instead, after your glue has dried, take the remaining thread from one side and wrap it around the bridge of your glasses from front to back. Make your wrap as neat as possible; some criss-crossing may be unavoidable, but do your best to prevent the wrap from looking bulky. Leave a short end to be trimmed later. Soak the wrap with glue and let it dry for 10-15 minutes. Take the thread from the other side of your glasses and wrap it around the bridge in the opposite direction (back to front). Soak the new wrap in glue and let it cure for a couple of minutes before snipping off the two loose ends. Set your glasses aside for 24 hours before wearing.

Boil water.,
Melt the plastic.,
Insert a pin.",How to Repair Eyeglasses3," Fill a small pot with water and set the flame to ""high."" Because you're going to use heat for this repair, the frames of your glasses must be plastic for it to work.

, Once the water is boiling, hold the broken edges of the glasses over the pot and close enough for the heat to soften the edges.

, Push a short pin into one edge and then push the other edge onto the pin. While the plastic is still hot, smooth it over the pin. Never put plastic eyeglass frames directly over a flame.

Use an eyeglass repair kit.,
Try a toothpick.,
Substitute with a wire.",How to Repair Eyeglasses4," Eyeglass repair kits are readily available at drugstores and contain everything you need to make a repair--screws, a tiny screwdriver and sometimes a magnifying glass. A newer version of the kit contains longer screws meant to be easier to handle. You insert the screws into the hinges, screw them in and then ""snap off"" the bottom of the screw to fit the size of the hinge.


If you're finding it difficult to line up the hinges on your temple piece and front piece, it could because a hinge mechanism inside the temple piece hinge is holding it back. To correct this, use the hook end of a paper clip, insert it through the temple hinge hole and gently pull it out. To keep the hinge hole in place, insert a second paperclip upright and into the ""gap"" created when you pulled out the hinge hole. Line up the front piece and temple piece holes and insert and tighten the screw. When you're finished, remove the paperclip from the gap and the hinge hole will slide back into place creating a firm fit for your glasses. , When a screw falls out of the hinge that holds the front and temple pieces of your glasses together, use a toothpick to temporarily take the place of the screw. Line up the temple hinge holes with the front holes and push a wooden toothpick through them as far as it will go. Break or clip off the excess.

, Strip the paper off of a twist tie (the kind that come on a bag of bread). Line up the hinge holes and thread the twist-tie wire through them. Twist the wire in place until the temple feels secure. Cut off the edges of the wire so you don't get scratched. You can also use a small safety pin (the ones that are sometimes used with clothing price tags). Insert the pin through the holes to hold the side in place.

Use a product made especially for scratched lenses.,
Use a household cleaner.,
Prevent future scratches.",How to Repair Eyeglasses5," Apply a glass-etching product to your scratched lenses. It works by removing the anti-glare and anti-scratch coatings on your plastic lenses but leaves the original plastic lens intact. Use a glass-etching chemical on plastic lenses only, never glass. Other specialty products temporarily fill the scratches on your lenses making them less visible but leaving behind a glossy film.


Be careful not clean and polish your lenses to the point that you change the thickness of the surface. Any product or procedure that changes the surface of an eyeglass lens can also change the refraction and effectiveness of that lens. , Abrasive cleansers, baking soda and toothpaste call all be used to polish scratched surfaces. Waxy products like Lemon Pledge and Carnauba cleaner wax actually fill light scratches with wax. However, the wax will reduce your visibility and require reapplication every few days. You can also try rubbing alcohol or diluted ammonia. After treating your glasses with one of these products, polish them with a soft cloth, ideally one made especially for cleaning glasses. , Lenses are delicate and should be treated with care to prevent them from getting scratched.


Use an eyeglass case. A sturdy, cushioned case will protect your eyeglasses; place them in a case rather than in your pocket or throwing them directly into your purse.
Wash your lenses. Clean your glasses every day with soapy water and dry them with a clean, soft cloth made for this purpose.
Stay away from unfriendly products. Some products can harm your lenses and should be avoided. Don't use facial tissues or paper towels to clean your lenses and stay away from anti-bacterial soaps when you wash them. Be careful when using hairspray, perfume or nail polish remover--they can remove the coatings on lenses.

Choose frames that compliment your face.,
Get fitted so that your glasses are the right size.,
Treat your glasses as an accessory to your outfits.,
Pick a fun color for your glasses.",How to Look Pretty in Glasses1," Unflattering glasses will not make you feel like you look pretty, no matter how hard you try. It’s important to be picky when selecting glasses since you’ll likely be wearing them every day.You can have several pairs of glasses, but it’s more practical to pick one dependable pair.


Go shopping for glasses wearing a favorite shirt and hairdo so you know what to expect when wearing your glasses every day.
Pick frames that curve upwards on the ends to draw the eye upwards and give you an upbeat air.To find out your face shape, pull your hair back and look in a mirror. Use the edge of a piece of soap to draw the outline of your face and then determine which shape it is.

Round faces can benefit from frames that have sharp angles to help keep your face from looking flat.
An oval shaped frame helps to soften a hard jawline on a square or angular face shape.
Almost all frame types can compliment an oval shape, but round frames have a tendency to look heavy.
Heart shaped faces tend to have wider foreheads and narrow chins so a frameless lens or frames with edges that point upwards can work well.;
, Glasses that look out of proportion to your face won’t be flattering, nor will frames that are too small. Make sure that the edges of your frames fall just at the outer edge of your face. They’re too big if they’re wider than the widest part of your face.Wiggle the frames around your nose. If they’re too tight they’ll leave unsightly red marks and loose frames will constantly be falling off your face.
The tops of your frames should fall just below your eyebrows.Make sure you have a big enough lens to look through. Too-small lenses will make your eyes squint unattractively and too-big lenses will make your eyes look puny.

, Instead of a simple round or rectangular frame, have fun with a cat eye or coke-bottle styled frames. Glasses are a great way to express your personal style. Don’t worry about them not matching every single item in your closet because if you treat your glasses like a statement piece, they’ll go with anything.If you want to try something new but don’t have the confidence quite yet, get a second opinion from a friend.
Some opticians offer deals for buying two pairs of glasses; you can get a classic, dependable pair and have fun with the second pair.

, Black, brown, and neutral metals are classic choices for eyewear, but for a fresh and bold take, pick a funky color. A bright color will help you stand out and you will feel less drab and ordinary with your lenses.Warm skin tones tend to look good with browns and bright tones and cool skin tones look good with blue, silver, or muted colors.
If you can't decide on a colour, try tortoise shell. It flatters all skin tones and goes well with almost anything!
If you tend to wear a certain color family most of the time, pick glasses that coordinate with the majority of your outfits.
It helps to wear a favorite outfit when shopping for glasses so you know how well they’ll match your wardrobe.
Match your glasses to your hair:

Blonde hair works well with a medium brown tones, black with metallic accents, or purple and blues.
Brown hair has the most options for color as most colors work well with it.
Black hair looks good with solid black, a combination of black and white, and striking, bold hues.
Red hair shouldn’t be paired with yellow toned frames, but warm browns and tortoiseshell are great.
Grey hair works well with blues and burgundy."

Curl your eyelashes up rather than out.,
Apply mascara heavier on your roots than your tips.,
Use a concealer or highlighter on dark spots.,
Shape your eyebrows.,
Wear a bold lip color.,
Match or coordinate your eyeliner with your frames.,
Dab oil controlling powder on your nose.,
Clean your glasses every day.",How to Look Pretty in Glasses2," Use an eyelash curler to draw your lashes up and parallel with your lenses. Start at the roots of your eyelashes and hold the curler there for a few seconds. Then, crimp your way up to the tips of your lashes. Doing this opens up your eyes and makes them look bigger.


Curling your lashes prevents any mascara from brushing up against your lenses and dirtying them., As you apply mascara, brush most of the liquid onto the roots of your eyelashes. Just lightly brush the tips of your lashes with the remainder of the mascara that’s left on the wand. This will make them look fuller, keeps them from being weighed down, and will help keep the inside of your glasses clean.Have fun with colored mascara that matches or contrasts with your glasses to make a bold statement.
For fuller lashes, brush the wand horizontally across your eye.
For longer-looking lashes, hold the mascara wand vertically and brush upwards on your lashes.

, To keep your eyes from looking sunken in, use a highlighting cream to dab in inner corners of your eyes and the lower lids. A concealer that matches your skin tone will also help to light the under part of your eyes and keep them from being shadowed by your glasses.


Avoid doing too much with makeup on the bottom part of your eyes because this can draw attention to bags or crow’s feet that you might prefer to go unnoticed., Your glasses will help frame your face, and your eyebrows do the same job. Go to a salon as a treat or periodically pluck a few eyebrow hairs to keep your eyebrows from getting unruly. You want your eyebrows to rest right above your frames so that they don’t disappear.Hold your tweezers to the inner corner of your eye and line them straight up to your eyebrow. You want to tweeze your eyebrows so that they begin directly above the corner of your eye.Your eyebrow should peak right above the middle of your iris.
The end of your eyebrows should end right above the far corner of your eyelids.

, A bright or bold lip color is way to balance your makeup with your glasses. Bright reds, pinks, or even purples look fun and can also make you feel pretty and powerful. Any style of glasses works well with a classic red, and if you want to play it safe, you can go for a shade that’s similar to your own lip color to help your natural beauty pop.If your frames have a secondary color, you can coordinate your lip color to accentuate that secondary color.
Matte or cream lipstick work well with glasses. A gloss can sometimes compete with any glare that may reflect off of your lenses.

, You don’t want your eyeliner to compete with the color of your frames. Experiment with a navy or burgundy eyeliner as black can sometimes overpower your eye, especially with glasses.


Brown eyeliner is also an option and works well for green and brown eyes.
The thicker your frames, the thicker your eyeliner should be. This isn’t a hard and fast rule, but you can get away with a thick cat eye effect with a bold frame.Thinner frames will look unbalanced with extremely heavy eyeliner.
For a more drastic contrast, pick a color of eyeliner that is on the opposite side of the color wheel from the color of your frames.

, The bridge of your nose is going to be prominent thanks to your glasses, but that doesn’t have to be a bad thing. Use a powder made to cut down on face oils or a foundation powder so that your don’t have a shiny nose. Cutting down on any moisture on your nose will also help to keep your glasses from sliding down.


Mineral-based foundations can also help cut down on any shininess from oil.
A little bit of concealer can also help cut down on any red spots left from the nose pieces on your glasses.
Blot any excess powder or foundation with a tissue to prevent your glasses from sliding., Being able to see is of course important, but dirty lenses are also not attractive. No matter how put together you look with your makeup and outfit, dirty glasses are a detail that can ruin the whole look. Spritz your lenses with a glasses cleaning solution and wipe them with a microfiber cloth.Cleaning your glasses will help prevent prevent smudges from your fingertips or your hands from adjusting your frames throughout the day.
At least once a week, clean the entire frame for your glasses. Face oil, sweat, and bacteria can build up in crevices and cause you to break out.
Avoid using rough materials such as paper towels or tissue paper to clean your glasses as these can damage the glass.
You can get replacement microfiber cloths at an optician’s office.
Wipe off water or moisture immediately to avoid water spots or stains.
Make sure there’s no debris or small particles on the lenses before cleaning them or the dirt will scratch your lenses.

Pull your hair up into a bun.,
Direct focus to the upper part of your face with bangs.,
Let your hair down with a soft curl or tease.,
Keep your hair out of your face.",How to Look Pretty in Glasses3," The easiest way to instantly look chic and pretty with glasses is to tie your hair up in a bun. You can do a messy bun, a perfectly braided bun, a crazy, puffy one, or even a ponytail. This look is timeless and it draws any onlookers eye up to your face and showcases your eyes and glasses., First, pick a style of bangs that works with your face shape. Then, have them trimmed so they don’t fall underneath your glasses and into your eyes or over your lenses. You want your bangs to fall just above or around your frames so that your face doesn’t look overcrowded.


Generally a rounder face works well with asymmetrical bangs and a face with sharp chin or cheek angles can work well with tousled or softened bangs.
If you want to draw attention to the whole upper part of your face, pair bangs with vibrant glasses, mascara, and eyeliner and leave your lips and cheek makeup simple.
Bangs that are cut straight across the forehead when paired with glasses can have a fun librarian vibe, but it can also look matronly. If you’re trying to look younger as well as pretty, stay away from this look.
Longer side bangs will help lengthen your face, which may work well with squared off glasses.
Consult your hairstylist for the best kind of bangs for your face. They may have suggestions that also work well for your glasses.

, Give your hair a little volume by teasing it with some mousse or using a curling iron to add some dimension. Playing with your hair adds femininity to your look and won’t compete with your glasses.


A messy ‘do with a bright red lipstick looks fresh and adventurous with any style of frames.To tease your hair, run some styling gel or mousse through damp hair and blow dry it. Blow dry with your head upside down to give it even more volume.

, Whatever hairstyle you choose, try to avoid hiding behind your hair and glasses. A few loose strands isn’t the end of the world, but a curtain of hair across your face will distract people from your pretty eyes and face.Pull a few strands of hair back with bobby pins or a hair tie if your hair tends to flop into your face.Oil and hair product residue from your hair can also dirty your glasses, so it’s best to try and keep them apart anyways.
If you’re going for more of an edgy look, an asymmetrical cut is a fun way to cover a portion of your face, but be careful that you don’t look overdo it.

Choose the shoelace(s).,
Choose a belt design.",How to Make a Belt Out of a Shoelace1," Select shoelaces in colors and designs that you like. If you are making a single shoelace belt, then all you need is one long shoelace. If you're twisting or braiding the shoelaces to form a belt, you'll need several shoelaces.


If you can't find suitable shoelaces, consider purchasing plain white ones and decorating them with fabric paint. Use patterns, geometric shapes, animal shapes, etc. to make the shoelace more interesting.
You'll also need hair ties or elastic bands if you are braiding the laces.
Use ribbon, lace, etc. for decorating the shoelace belt.

, Consider whether you want to keep things very simple and just use a single shoelace or you would like to use a double twist or braid the belt. The latter requires basic braiding (plaiting) skills.


The braid can be a basic one or a fishtail.

Use the paracord for emergencies.",How to Make a Paracord Belt," Hold the flame of a lighter to the starting end of the paracord for several seconds, melting the rope and preventing it from fraying or unraveling.

High quality paracord should not be flammable, but some lower quality versions may contain a flammable paper core. To prevent this core from catching on fire, push back the the nylon to reveal the core and cut at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of the paper. Slide the nylon cord back up to return it to its original shape.
Note that you should not trim or melt the finishing end of the paracord yet. Work with the full length of cord to ensure that you'll have enough to complete your belt.;
, Insert the melted paracord end beneath the bar of your first belt buckle half. Wrap the paracord around this bar in an overhand direction, pulling it back up from beneath the bar again to create a full loop.When using a standard belt buckle, make a total of four loops around the bar of the buckle in this manner. Note that wider buckles will need more loops while thinner buckles will need fewer loops.
All loops should flow in the same direction and should be slightly loose so that you'll be able to manipulate them later on.
Leave at least 2 or 3 inches (5 or 7.5 cm) of excess paracord hanging out from the belt buckle bar when you finish wrapping these starting loops.

, Tie a tight, overhand knot from the excess paracord hanging from beneath the buckle bar. This knot must be tight to prevent the cord from unraveling.

Adjust the wrapped loops as needed, pulling the working end of the cord back out, so that the knot lies snug against the buckle bar. Note that the loops should still be somewhat loose.

, Grab a portion of the paracord from the working end (i.e. the loose or non-knotted end). Form an open loop from this portion of cord.

Position this new loop directly next to portion of cord wrapped around the buckle bar.
This new loop should be two to three times as long as the width of the buckle or length of the buckle bar.

, Push the newly formed loose loop beneath all four loops previously wrapped around the buckle bar. When finished, this ""through loop"" should stick out from beneath the wrapped portion and run parallel to the buckle bar.If you cannot easily push the loop through the wrapped portion of the cord, use your fingers or a thin, sturdy tool (skewer, crochet hook, nail, etc.) to loosen the wrapped loops, creating enough space for the loose loop to pass through.

, Carefully spread the loops wrapped around the buckle bar using your pointed tool. You should be able to see a layer of paracord running beneath the wrapped loops.

The paracord running beneath the wrapped loops is connected to the through loop and working end of the cord.

, Using a sturdy skewer or other pointed tool, grab and lift the under layer of paracord through the first two wrapped loops along the bar, creating a new loop large enough for your finger to fit through.

If you started with four wrapped loops, you should pull up a total of three ""finger"" loops in this manner, and each of these loops should lie between two of the original wrapped loops along the buckle bar. Otherwise, the number of finger loops should be one fewer than the number of wrapped loops you started with.
Start at the edge closest to the through loop, then gradually progress to the edge nearest the loose working end of paracord.
When finished, you should have a total of four equally sized loops: one sideways ""through"" loop and three upright ""finger"" loops.

, Slide the index finger of your non-dominant hand into the sideways through loop, then continue slipping it through all three finger loops in consecutive order.

The finger loops should twist clockwise as you thread your finger through them so that the side lying closest to the working cord faces in your direction.

, Create a new loose loop from the excess working cord, then pull it through the loops threaded along your finger.

When you first create it, this loop should be directly next to the buckle and at least three times as long as the width of the buckle.
Essentially, you're starting a second row that will be identical to the first. The finger currently threaded through your four previous loops serves the same purpose as the buckle bar in your first row.

, Remove your finger from the loops. Pull on the paracord as needed to tighten the original finger loops over the new through loop.

Tighten the loops starting from the outside and gradually working toward the inside.

To tighten the outermost loop, gently tug on the back side of the loop lying directly next to it. The same principle applies to the second and third outermost loops, as well.
To tighten the innermost loop, tug on the working side of the cord sticking out from the bundle.



, As before, ease away the newly wrapped loops to reveal the working portion of paracord. Use a sharp tool to lift paracord up from beneath and between the wrapped loops, creating the appropriate number (usually three) of new finger-sized loops.These loops form the base of your next pattern row, and the number of finger loops created here should match the number created for your previous row. They should stand upright while the previously created through loop lies perpendicular and sideways.

, Repeat the previously described pattern steps to create additional rows in the same manner. Continue making rows until the belt reaches your desired length.

Note that the final length should roughly match the circumference of your waist, minus the length of the buckle belt. For example, if your waist is 38 inches (96.5 cm) around and the buckle belt is 2 inches (5 cm) long when snapped together, then the length of the paracord portion should be about 36 inches (91.4 cm).
For each row, pull a new loop from the working side of the paracord through the four base loops, which should be threaded on your finger. Tighten the base loops over the new through loop, then pull up three more finger loops from beneath the row. The one through loop and three finger loops will be the base for the next row.

, Following the same pattern, create the appropriate number of finger loops (typically three).

Note that you should still have a through loop from your final row; you do not need to create a new one.
Pull up the appropriate number of finger loops from beneath and between the base loops of your previous row.

, Gather the through loop and finger loops together, then push them through the bar of the other buckle half.

The number of loops pushed beneath this buckle bar should match the number of loops wrapped around the bar of the first buckle half.
The connected ends of these loops will stay to the outside of the bar, but the rounded loop ends must pass through completely.

, Create a loop from the working end of the paracord, making it roughly the same size as your previous through loops. Insert this loop through the loop ends sticking up from beneath the buckle bar., As you did for the body of the pattern, tighten the base loops around the through loop.

Work from the outside in, tugging down on the back side of each loop to tighten the one before it. Repeat until all of the loops are snug.

, Cut the paracord, leaving about 4 inches (10 cm) of excess. Pull that excess cord through the final loop to create a snug, secure knot.

If you do not like the amount of paracord remaining after you knot the end, you can trim it down further. Leave at least 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) between the knot and the end, though.

, Hold the flame of a lighter over the raw, cut end of the paracord for several seconds. Pull it away once the cord end has melted down.

As before, you'll need to push back the core of the paracord if it's made of flammable material.
An adequately melted end should prevent the paracord from fraying.

, At this point, the paracord belt should be finished and ready to wear.

You can wrap the belt around your waist as you would wrap any other belt. If properly measured, it should be snug enough to serve the same purpose as any belt when the buckle is snapped together.

, Paracord belts can be unraveled in the event of an emergency, allowing you to quickly access a large length of sturdy, reliable cord.Untie the knots. If you are unable to untie them, you could slice off the knots using a pocket knife.
Unwind the paracord from the both sides of the buckle.
Working from one end of the belt, simply pull the loose end in your direction. As you pull, the belt should easily begin to unravel.
With practice, it should only take about 20 to 30 seconds to unravel the entire belt.

In the meantime, see a professional make-up artist, they can help you pencil your eyebrows in, giving the illusion of a normal shape and thickness. Don't worry about shape and colors and such, since they are professionals they'll be able to help you find temporary brow shape and color you like.


Don't pluck your eyebrows every day. Even if you see more stray hairs peeking in, plucking and removing hair every day damages your skin. Try doing it every other week.

Define brows with eyeshadow, an eyebrow pencil, or even mascara that matches your eyebrow color or is somewhat lighter.
The best way to leave brows shaped and groomed is to apply a tiny bit of Vaseline to tame them, or use a brow gel. A creamy formula fills in eyebrow color, controls, and shapes.
Take to the air. Aviator frames have made their way back into fashion. They're now described as timeless, and vintage. See if they work for you.

, A nice natural smooth lip plays up giving your eyes the attention it needs. For a smooth, kissable look apply Vaseline to your lips after you brush your teeth, and before you go to bed. Try using a gloss with shimmer during the day to give your lips that sweet hint of color and a lovable minty flavor. Apply the product sparingly, a light, sheer coat goes a long way. Also try colored lip glosses; apply over lips for that nice smooth kissable shine.

, Be careful, however, if applied incorrectly eyeliner can look tacky and can make the eyes appear smaller.


If your eye shape is naturally small, consider white pencil (applied to the inner rim of your lower lid). This will enhance the shape and the color of your eyes.
For a natural look (recommended) apply a soft shade of dark brown or black liner to your top lid as close to the lash-line as possible, Apply a matching shade of mascara sparingly, or simply go with a clear mascara.
For a funkier look, experiment with light-handed, thin lines of blue, jade or gold liner on the top lash line and a bit on the outside bottom lash line. Match this with a clear (or shimmering, if you're feeling bold) mascara, or simply go with a natural color.

Browse fashion magazines and blogs (GQ, Nylon, etc.), eye wear websites (Warbyparker.com sells affordable designer glasses), or emulate other people who have the look you admire.


Make sure the rest of your fashion complements the glasses you want. Like the perfect belt or piece of jewelry, your new glasses will add a defining touch to your wardrobe and persona.;
, Conduct research before visiting an optician to find promotions, and make sure you plan your visit on a day when you are not pressed for time. If you can, take a friend or family member to model for, and wear an outfit that is representative of your style.


Before you try on glasses, ask your optician for input when considering the right frames for your face's shape and size.
Frame color is important as it should highlight your skin, hair, and eye color. Choose bold colors for an edgy look or dark tortoise shell frames for a more elegant style.
Consider the pros and cons of plastic vs. metal when choosing your frames. Plastic frames come in a variety of colors and are cost-effective and lightweight; they also hide thick lenses well. However, they are easier to break than metal frames. Metal frames are made from different materials (titanium and beta-titanium, for example) and are generally light-weight, durable, and corrosion-resistant.
Invest in anti-reflective coating and high index polycarbonate lenses. While these features are more expensive, you will look more sophisticated in your new glasses as people won't notice scratches or an unsightly glare.

, Style your hair to make the most of the frames you have chosen. Consult with your hairdresser to see what haircut or style suits you as an individual, and be sure to wear your glasses to your appointment.

, Take care of your face to ensure that it looks its best with your new frames.


For women--get your eyebrows shaped as they can create a clean, elegant look that emphasizes your glasses; unkempt eyebrows can detract from your glasses' flair. Remember to use waterproof and liquid makeup to prevent residue from dirtying your lenses.
For men--decide whether you are going to be clean shaven or maintain facial hair. If you decide to have a mustache or beard, trim it often. Your glasses will draw a lot of attention to your face, so you want it to look as neat and clean as possible. A five o' clock shadow, however, can create a sometimes sexy ""disheveled intellectual"" look.


, You can wear designer clothing, have a trendy haircut, and groom impeccably, but remember you have to feel good to look good. Wear your glasses with confidence!

Usually the closure goes in the back. Adjust it so it stays up but is comfortable.Wrap the belt around your waist. It should sit about at your waistline.
Attach it at the back by sliding the hooks into the clasps. Choose the line of clasps that is the most comfortable for you. This step is basically like attaching a bra.
If you have trouble attaching it in the back, hook it together in the front, and then move it around to the front.;
, Pull up your thigh highs to the right height. Start adjusting the straps to meet the top of your hose.You'll want your straps to be at slightly different lengths. The ones in the back should be the longest, giving you room to bend over.
The straps on the sides should be an inch shorter, and the ones on the front should be two inches shorter than the back, all of which will help you bend easier. It also helps when you sit down.

, Each clasp consists of a rubber nub and a metal piece that fits over it. To attach it, put the rubber nub underneath the top edge of the stocking. The clasp should reach straight down to the stocking, unless it's sewn on at an angle. It should fall about an inch past the top of the stocking. Slide the metal clasp over the nub. Pull up so the nub slides into place. Repeat with the remaining clasps around the belt.When you fasten a clasp, push the rubber nub from behind so that you can see it sticking out through the front. However, don't push so hard that you tear a hole in your stockings.
The top of each clasp has a wide end and a narrow end at the bottom. Start with the wide end, sliding it over the nub, then pull up so the narrow end is surrounding the nub, holding it in place.
Be careful if you have plastic clasps. If you apply too much pressure to a plastic clasp, it will snap in two, and your garter won't be usable.

, You'll likely need to readjust once you've gotten your stockings settled to make sure they're at the right height. In addition, you'll probably need to readjust throughout the day. An easy way to do this is to check on them when you're in the bathroom.


Make sure you sit down and stand up with the garter belt on so you can see how it fits. You don't want it to have too much tension when you sit down because it might pop off.
However, when you stand up, your thigh highs should be mostly taut, as you don't want them pooling at your ankles.
Loosen and tighten the straps as needed.

, This step may seem counter-intuitive. A belt should go on the outside of your undergarments, right? Well, not if you want to use the bathroom more easily. If you put your panties on before the belt, you'll have to undo the straps, take off your garter belt, and pull down your underwear to use the restroom. Putting your underwear over the belt and straps prevents that problem.Therefore, if you're only going to wear the garter belt for a little while, it's fine to put your underwear on first.
However, if you plan to wear it all day, you might want put your underwear on last, though under your skirt or pants, of course.You can also go without underwear if you prefer.

, You may find that a garter belt you're looking at is a ""one-size-fits-all"" model. That may fit some people, but it of course won't fit everyone. A better bet is finding one that is actually in your size, as many brands make them in standard sizes. It's best if you can try it on first, though some stores may not let you do that.You want a garter belt that stays in place. If it slips, your thigh highs will slip also.
However, you don't want one so tight you can't breathe. Make sure it's loose enough to be comfortable.
Finally, look for one that is adjustable. Most of them will have several rows of hooks, much like a bra, so that you can make adjustments as needed., Plastic clasps don't grasp as well as metal. In addition, the plastic ones tend to break. Therefore, try to pick a garter belt that has metal clasps for the best possible grip., Generally, for the best hold, pick a belt that has 6 clasps. Some have only 4, and those may pop off if you plan on wearing it for more than an hour or so. Another important component to look for is elastic straps. While most straps are adjustable, elastic will allow the straps to keep hold of your thigh highs when you move around or bend over, as it means the straps have give and won't pop off at the clasp.You can even find garter belts with many more straps, up to 8 or 10, which will hold even better.
Also, thick straps are better because they're less likely twist and they provide a better hold.

, Some garter belts just cover a small area, forming a small belt across your waist. Others are much wider. What you choose is up to you. You should base it on how comfortable it is and the look you are going for, as garter belts are often used as lingerie. A wider belt will be more comfortable if you plan to wear it all day., While that fur belt might look pretty, it's not going to be comfortable or breathe well. That's fine if you're only planning on wearing the belt for a little while. However, if you plan to wear it all day, pick something like satin or cotton that will breathe better and provide more comfort., Cheap garter belts may seem like a great option, but they probably won't hold up. If you're planning to wear it often, you might want to spend a little more money to get a better quality belt."

Select a necklace that fits your waist and/or one you’d like to turn into a belt.,
Create a simple belt from a one-strand necklace that has a clasp.,
Design a belt from a contiguous strand necklace.",How to Make a Belt from a Long Necklace," Before making any decisions, you’ll need to make sure the necklace can work as a belt and/or fits your waist.


Take measurements and select something that is slightly longer. Having your waist measurements will allow you to focus on pieces that might work alone or with another strand or piece.
Consider how the necklace is made. If the necklace does not have a clasp and is one contiguous strand, you may want to either cut it so you can wrap it around your waist or integrate the necklace into another piece to create a belt.
Select several options that can be designed together to create the belt. If you love a certain piece but it is either too short or may not work alone as a belt, inspect the piece to see if it can be integrated into a belt you currently own or woven into another necklace.;
, As long as the necklace has a clasp and fits your waist you can create a classic look by wrapping the necklace around your waist and using the clasp to hold it in place.


Look for a necklace that offers several fastening options. In some cases a necklace that allows you to attach ¾ of the strand, but allow the rest of the chain to dangle downward, creates an alluring, sexy look.
Shop for other fasteners/clasps for a more finished look. While you can use the necklace clasp to hold the necklace in place, you may want to either add a jewel or even change the clasp for a more dramatic look. For example, visit your local bead store for clasp options to find something more substantial and alluring.

, This will mean, however that you will need to cut the necklace in order to create the belt. Make sure you can commit to cutting the strand before going forward.


Hold the beads in place while making one cut into the necklace. This will provide you with one long strand, which will allow you to wrap the necklace around your waist.
Tie knots at the end of the necklace wire/string to hold beading in place. This will allow you to retain the integrity of the necklace while you find/locate a fastener for your belt.
Determine how you’d like to fasten the belt. In some cases you could reduce the number of beads and add a traditional, small buckle or add a clasp.

Purchase a leather hole punch.,
Mark the location of the next hole.,
Position the belt.,
Squeeze hard.",How to Punch a Hole in a Belt1," If you want the new belt hole to be as tidy and discreet as possible, a leather hole punch is by far the best tool. These typically cost less than $10 US at a craft or hobby store.Bring along your belt when shopping, to compare the size of the punch with the size of the existing holes. The punching tool tip should fit tightly through the existing holes.
If you have many belts to adjust, look for a rotary model with a wheel of attachments in different sizes.;
, Use a ruler or measuring tape to find the distance between each hole, then measure the same distance past the last hole. Dot the leather with a permanent marker to guide your punching.









""Protecting"" the leather from the marker with tape is not a great idea, as the tape itself can cause damage.A careful dot directly where the hole will go is the safer option.
If you are making a belt from scratch, the holes are typically spaced ½"" (1.25 cm) apart for belts under ⅜"" (1 cm) wide, and up to 1⅛"" (2.85 cm) apart for belts above 1"" (2.5 cm) wide., Place the belt's marked area in between the two halves of the punching tool. Use heavy objects to keep the belt taut, or have a friend pull the belt taut in front of you.








, Squeeze the arms of the hole punch together tightly and firmly. Some thick belts may require strong hands, or someone to wiggle the taut belt back and forth as you squeeze.Let go when you feel the leather go through, and the hole should be finished.









If any leather scraps are stuck in the hole, use a toothpick to push them out.

Mark the location of the hole.,
Hold the belt in place.,
Consider an electric drill.,
Use a sharp object instead.",How to Punch a Hole in a Belt2," Use a ruler to measure the spacing between the hole, then measure the same distance past the last hole. Use a marker to dot the belt over the area you plan on punching out.


If your top priority is a comfortable fit, instead wear the belt and pull it to a comfortable position, then mark the belt where the strap tongue touches it.

, Use heavy objects to weigh down each end of the belt, with the location where the hole will be punched on top of a block of wood or other hard, flat surface.

, If you have one, an electric drill can be used to drill a hole through the belt, as long as you're careful. Use these tips to keep the hole tidy:








Insert drill bits by hand into the existing holes. Select one that fits smoothly but tightly into the hole.
Use a brad-pointed drill bit if available. If using a smooth drill bit, create a small depression for it to stand in, using a sharp knife or nail.
Drill in short bursts especially when starting the hole.
Make sure to put something, that you don't mind damaging, that doesn't move around behind the belt, that is thick enough, for when the drill bit goes through.
You can also opt to snipping the other end, once it has penetrated the outer layer a bit, instead of drilling a perfect hole.

, The tool designed for this purpose is called an awl, but any sharp, metal stick or even a Phillips-head screwdriver will work fairly well. Push the awl into the leather, then tap it repeatedly with a mallet or hammer. This method takes longer than the others, and you might end up with a messy hole.









A nail will make a smoother hole through a thin belt, but if you're looking to save time, a screw can be turned through the leather, using its threads to tear through faster.
Again, be careful of scratching the surface beneath. (Follow the precautions in the previous step.)

Choose a pair of frames based on your face shape.,
Avoid round glasses for a round face.,
Opt for wide frames if you have an oval-shaped face.,
Balance out an oblong face with longer frames.,
Choose cat-eye or wide frames for a base-down or base-up triangle face.,
Consider cat-eye frames for a diamond-shaped face.,
Avoid angular frames for a square face.",How to Look Good in Glasses (for Women)1," Once your have identified your face shape, you should look at frames that will complement your face shape. If you don’t know your face shape, there are several charts you can look up online to help you determine this. You should also keep in mind certain frame styles you should avoid.Round: If you have a round face, you have noticeable curves on both sides of your face and less defined angles, or cheekbones. The width and length of your face are mostly equal in size.
Oval: Individuals with oval faces have balanced features, and their chin is slightly narrower than their foreheads.
Oblong: If you have an oblong face, your face will be longer than it is wide. You will also have a long straight cheek line, and you may have a longer nose.
Base-down triangle: If you have a base-down triangle face, you will have a narrow forehead that widens at your cheek and chin areas.
Base-up triangle: If you have a base-up triangular face, you have a very wide top third area of your face and a narrow or small bottom third of your face.
Diamond: This is the rarest face shape, where you have a narrow eye line and jawline and broad cheekbones that are high and dramatic.
Square: If you have a square face, you have a strong jaw line and a wide forehead. The width and length of your face are the same proportions.;
, If you have a round face, you should go for eye glasses that are square or rectangle to contrast the roundness of your face. Avoid round frames and rimless frames, as these will only highlight your round face and will not complement your face shape., If you have an oval shaped face, you should look for frames that have a strong bridge and are wider than the broadest part of your face. Geometric shaped frames tend to look good against an oval shape. You should avoid glasses that are oversized and cover up more than half of your face. Big frames can throw off the natural balance and symmetry of your face., Make your oblong shaped face appear more balanced by choosing frames that have more depth than width. Look for frames that have decorative elements on the sides of the frames and a low bridge. Avoid round frames or small frames., Highlight the narrow upper third area of a base-down face with frames that have color and detailing on the top of the frames.

Frames in light colors and materials, as well as rimless frame styles, are also ideal for this face shape., If you have a diamond shaped face, you should look for cat-eye glasses or oval frames. These frames will play up your narrow forehead and chin and accentuate your cheekbones. Avoid boxy or narrow frames., Individuals with square shaped faces should look for eyeglasses that sit high on the bridge of their nose and have oval or round frames.

Play up your best facial feature.,
Choose a frame color that complements your skin tone.,
Balance your eyebrows with your frames.",How to Look Good in Glasses (for Women)2," Your eyeglasses should work with your facial features, rather than against them. If you are proud of a certain facial feature, such as your blue eyes or your strong cheekbones, look for frames that show off this facial feature.For example, you may choose blue frames to match your blue eyes, or you may look for red frames to match your red eyebrow hair. Or, you can play with contrasting color. You could match purple frames with green eyes.

, Your skin tone should also complement your frames, as eyewear that works with your coloring will often look better on you. Your skin tone has been proven to be more of a deciding factor for eyeglass frames than your eye color or your hair color.If you have a cool skin tone, go for frames that are silver, black, pink, purple, blue, mauve, gray, and dark tortoise. These frames will not wash out your complexion.
If you have a warm skin tone, look for frames that are light tortoise, gold or honey, beige, olive green, and brown shades. Avoid pastels and white and black frames.

, Give your face more dimension by making sure your eyebrows fit with the look of your frames. If you have thick, bold frames in a bright color, you may want to keep your eyebrows simple and neutral so they do not compete with your glasses. You may do very light eyebrow maintenance, like plucking stray hairs, and brushing your eyebrows out to keep them simple and clean.If you have plain frames or rimless frames, you may want to play up your eyebrows and draw more attention to your eyes.

If you wear a lot of a certain color, like purple, consider wearing glasses that match that color.
For example, you may want to choose semi-round frames if you have a preppy style.

, Conservative frames are often the best choice if you are working in a serious business environment. Oval, rectangle, and almond frames work well for a professional style. Some common colors for this style are gold, silver, brown, gray, and burgundy for women.Avoid frames in bright colors or unusual shapes unless you work in a creative and/or casual environment.

, If you have longer hair, past shoulder length, you can try curling the ends of your hair, and pinning back one side or both sides of your hair for a relaxed, casual look. This look is easy to do if you're strapped for time in the morning, and it will help show off your frames., Make sure to take your glasses with you to show your stylist the next time you get a haircut. Your hair cut may look good without glasses, but look different when you get home and put glasses on. A pair of square frames would work well with long, straight hair. If you have bangs, try a pair of light frames. In general, wear light frames with a bold haircut and bold frames with a simple haircut., Try to match the color of your frames with the basic tone of your hair. For brown or black hair, wear a dark or metallic frame. If you have blonde hair, try a pair of frames with light rims or no rims at all. Redheads can make just about any color of frames work, except white or yellow., Just because your eyelids are behind a pair of glasses doesn’t mean you should leave them bare. Makeup can enhance the style of your glasses. Show off your eyes by applying a cat-eye with eyeliner, or using eye shadow in a light color. Light eye shadow will highlight your eyes, but darker and bolder eye shadow may make your eyes appear too dark.You can also wear eye shadow that complements the color of your glasses. For example, choose a violet eye shadow if you wear yellow frames.

, If you’re getting glasses for vision correction and you’ll only have a pair or two, you may want to avoid bold looks like very thick frames, busy patterns, or bright colors. Keep in mind that you will probably wear them a lot, and you want them to be easy to pair with your outfit. Also some days you may feel like standing out and other days you may not. You may want to consider getting a pair of glasses that shows off your fun side, and one or more frames for everyday.Go with a color that compliments your face and skin tone.Try to select frames that mirror one of your best features. For example, if you have striking blue eyes, you may want to choose blue frames.
Your skin tone is the main element that will determine the best color for you. If you have a cool complexion (olive, blue or pink undertones) look for frames that also have a cool color scheme, such as black, blue-gray, silver, or purple. If you have a warm complexion (yellow or peach), look for frame colors in those tones – for example, gold, orange, tortoise, or khaki.
If your face is long, widen its appearance with frames that have color or decoration on the temples which differ from the front of the glasses. This will visually break up and widen your face., Choose a frame style that complements your face shape. If you have an angular face shape, you can balance that out with rounded frames. To the contrary, if your face is round, you can visually lengthen its appearance with angular frames. For a square face, keep frames slim and avoid rectangular lenses. If you have an oval face, you can wear many different styles as long as they aren’t extreme. However, avoid frames that are very thin, which can make your face appear longer than it is. Heart shaped faces look good with thick-bottomed frames.If you have a large forehead and a small chin, try frame styles without rims, butterfly frames, and oval-shaped frames. If you select butterfly frames – where the outside edges are wider than the edges near your nose – make sure the corners are square instead of round.
If your forehead is wide but you also have a prominent jawline, you can soften those features with oval or round frames.

, Metal is the most popular type of frame material, and there are many metals to choose from. Titanium is hypoallergenic and lightweight. Stainless steel is also lightweight, as well as strong and flexible. Aluminum is often used in high-end eyewear. Plastic frames are lightweight, available in many colors, and less expensive than other alternatives. Nylon is a great choice for sporty glasses. Compare materials and choose the one(s) you feel will benefit you the most.Factors to consider are hypo-allergenic, strong, light-weight, flexible, corrosion resistant, and the variety of patterns, colors and textures available., If your glasses are new, you should test them by moving around in them. Make sure that they don’t slide down your nose, leave indents on the sides of your nose, or cause an ache behind your ears. Any of these problems require a professional adjustment so that your frames aren’t too tight but won’t slide off."

Take selfies.,
Find inspiration.,
Acknowledge the benefits of glasses.,
Ignore critics.,
Keep your glasses in good condition.",How to Look Cool in Glasses2," Before wearing your glasses out in public, take video or photos of yourself in them with different facial expressions. Review the video or photos to help you become accustomed to the way they look on you. Think of your glasses as an extension of your personality! It’s important to use positive thinking about your glasses., Be confident when you’re wearing your glasses by finding inspiration in other people who know that wearing glasses is cool. Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Drake, Lebron James, Meryl Streep, Jennifer Aniston and Alicia Keys are just handful of public figures who wear glasses.

, If your glasses have corrective lenses, you will look much better with a clear-eyed look than if you’re squinting to see close-up or far-away objects.Eye strain simply isn’t cool: it can further damage your vision and cause other symptoms like dry eyes and headaches., Be cool in the face of criticism, if you encounter any. Any negative stereotype that exists about glasses can be outweighed by considering the real and positive statistics about eyeglass wearers. If someone is immature enough to call you a label like “four eyes,” there are many reasons not to let it bother you!


In general, people who were glasses are actually perceived as more trustworthy than those who don’t wear glasses.Job candidates who wear glasses are more likely to get hired.Approximately 75% of people in the US wear something on their eyes to better their vision. That statistic doesn’t include those who wear eyeglass frames without corrective lenses, either!, Clean your glasses. You’ll look trendier if your glasses aren’t cloudy or full of cracks. Be careful not to drop them, and don’t set them aside with the lenses down to avoid scratching them. When you aren’t wearing your glasses, keep them in a sturdy eyeglasses case. Never set your glasses down somewhere you can sit on and break them.

Use glasses as a complement to your style.,
Choose jewelry to compliment your frames.,
Style your hair to go with your frames.",How to Look Cool in Glasses3," Your glasses shouldn’t be the main focus of your look; they should add to your look. Otherwise your glasses can look costumey instead of fashionable. Your eyeglasses shouldn’t look like an afterthought, though; they are a purposeful accessory that should add interest to your appearance.Try choosing your glasses in steps. Start out with frames that aren’t overly dramatic. As you become accustomed to wearing your frames with confidence, you can slowly move up to bolder styles that still feel complimentary to your personality and style., Small, dainty earrings will add polish to your look. Avoid long, bulky, and dangly earrings. Your glasses are a fashion accessory and you don’t want your earrings to compete with them. Consider the color of your frames when selecting your jewelry.For example, try round or square stud earrings that give off a nice sparkle.
Eyeglasses with black frames can go with any color of jewelry. If your frames are tortoise or brown, consider wearing gold jewelry, If your frames are clear, silver, or a cool tone like blue or green, opt for silver metals and jewelry with stones.

, Consider taking your glasses with you when you visit your hair stylist for a cut or style, so that you can make sure it will compliment your frames. As a rule of thumb, think in opposites: if you have soft frames, go with a bold hairstyle, and vice versa. If you have wide frames, avoid hairstyles with a lot of volume on the sides – go for height on top instead. If your frames are large, avoid long, low-volume hairstyles. Try layered styles with volume on the sides. For small frames, don’t wear your hair in a style that will box in your facial features.If you have bangs that touch the top of your frames, make sure to maintain the right length of your bangs by getting them trimmed every three weeks.Avoid wearing large, floppy, overwhelming hats with glasses, unless you’re wearing sunglasses and going to the beach.

Keep your eyebrows groomed.,
Apply concealer to flaws.,
Consider mascara and an eyelash curler.,
Wear colored eyeliner and light shadow.,
Wear lipstick and blush.",How to Look Cool in Glasses4," Glasses can draw attention to unkempt eyebrows. If you shape your eyebrows, you may want to stay on top of that if you wear glasses. You can also arch or fill in your eyebrows.

, Use concealer on any flaws that can be seen through your lenses. For example, if you have dark circles under your eyes, wrinkles around your eyes, or blemishes near your eyes, use a liquid concealer that is close to your skin tone. You can top it with face powder.

, You can use volumizing mascara to give your eyelashes oomph behind your lenses. Avoid lengthening mascara, though, as it can get your glasses dirty if your lashes are rubbing up against your glasses.


Apply the first coat of mascara normally, and the second coat at the roots of your eyelashes only. Putting more pigment closest to your eyes will frame them., Avoid black eyeliner, wingtip styles, and heavy eyeshadow. You can add more definition to your eyes behind spectacles with a colored eyeliner like navy blue. Choose a subtle eyeshadow, like neutrals with just a hint of metallic or sparkle.As a rule of thumb, choose eyeliner one shade darker than your natural eye color., Consider warming up your face with blush. You can compliment thick frames with a strong lip color.If your frames are colorful and busy, or if you just want a more natural look, consider using bronzer and a neutral lipstick hue instead."

Determine if a wide belt works with your waist.,
Consider the material.,
Pick several belts to wear.,
Find a belt that matches your personal style.,
Choose where you want the belt to sit on your waist.,
Wear a wide belt with a loose top or dress.,
Wear a wide belt with a cardigan.,
Blend the belt into your look.",How to Wear Wide Belts," Wide belts tend to work best with a variety of body shapes. Wide belts can add curves to people with thin waists. In thicker waists, a wide belt can define a waistline. Wide belts can also help support and hold in extra weight around the waist., The beauty of a wide belt, is that you can find or make them out of almost any material. You could choose leather for a bold, classic look. You can also find wide belts in almost any kind of fabric. Wide belts with elastic are good choices, since the elastic will move with you and be more comfortable.


For a quick wide belt, wrap your favorite silk scarf around your waist. Adjust the width and tails of the scarf.

, Instead of choosing one wide belt, look for two or three thin belts that you can wear together.This will create the effect of a wide belt.


Ribbons also make great belts. Wrap several ribbons in various shades of the same color to create a wide-belt look., Simple straight belts in monochrome colors work with several looks. They can also help to define a thicker waist.You may want to try belts with embellishments, such as studs, beads, stones, or large buckles. Bold belts with decorative prints can also make a simple outfit really stand out.


You may need to try on a variety of belts to see what works with your outfit. The belt should enhance your look, not compete with it.

, If you place a wide belt directly under your bustline, you'll emphasize your chest. You'll also make your curves stand out more and highlight your waist.Most wide belts are worn higher above the hip bones on your waist.This can help define large midsections by breaking up your torso.If you have a shorter torso, you may find that a wide belt takes up too much of your torso. You may need to wear a slightly thinner belt., If you have a shirt or dress that's a little too large and hides your figure, wear a wide belt. The belt will define your waist and give some structure to a loose outfit.Likewise, if you're going for a thrown-together casual look, a wide belt can make the look a bit more polished.


Keep your belt at the natural waistline. If you wear the belt below your hip bones, it will help to give your torso a longer silhouette, especially with a loose dress or top.

, If your outfit has several pieces, such as pants, shirt, and jacket or cardigan, a wide belt can help pull the look together. Wear the belt over the cardigan or underneath the cardigan.


If your outfit is a bit drab or monochrome, the belt can also be a way to liven it up. Choose a bright belt or one with an unusual pattern. This can keep your look from becoming boring.

, Don't think that your belt always has to be the center of attention. Pick a wide belt in the same color as your shirt or dress. It will break up the texture and design of your outfit without clashing with it.If you're wearing a leather belt and don't want to match the color with your outfit, try matching accessories, such as your handbag or shoes. This will make your look more polished without being too similar in color.

See your optometrist about frequent headaches.,
Pay attention to how much you’re squinting.,
Assess your eyes' comfort at the end of the day.,
Discuss sudden changes in vision with a medical professional immediately.,
Replace damaged eyeglasses.",How to Know if You Need New Glasses1," Many people’s vision slowly changes over time. Essentially, your eyes and brain will be straining to correct your vision if they need more assistance than your glasses provide, leading to fatigue and discomfort. As such, even slight changes in your vision can lead to headaches if you don’t keep your prescription up to date.If you notice a gradual increase in the frequency of headaches you experience, schedule an eye exam with your optometrist to determine whether your vision is the cause.;
, You may not notice it at first, but another sign that you may be ready for stronger lenses is more frequent squinting. If you do notice yourself squinting more often, go see your optometrist for a vision exam as soon as it is convenient to do so.If you eyes and temples ache after using a computer or reading, you may have been squinting without even noticing.
At first, you may notice yourself squinting more at night. The sooner you get it checked out the better.

, If the muscles around your eyes and other parts of your head feel sore at the end of the day, this can be another sign that you’re straining to see throughout the day. While fatigue of this sort can have many causes, you shouldn’t be experiencing it daily. If you are, get a vision exam from your optometrist soon.Other, unexpected areas of your body may also be strained by weakened eyesight. For instance, you might have neck or backaches from leaning over or inwards to see things better.

, There are a few signs that you should see your eye doctor as soon as possible. For instance, if your vision is suddenly or periodically blurry, or you have trouble focusing, call your optometrist's office and let them know what's going on. They may recommend an immediate exam, or even a visit to the emergency room.Similarly, visual disturbances such as specific spots of obstructed vision or flashes of light require immediate attention as well.
If your vision is gradually becoming blurry, it's time for an eye exam, but it is not cause for immediate concern.

, Even if you haven't experienced any vision complications, you should get new glasses whenever the pair you have is damaged. Scratches or other damage to the lenses are especially important to address, as they may lead to vision complications or injury.Similarly, if your eyeglasses no longer fit as well as they used to, it may be time for either new glasses or an adjustment to the glasses you have.
If ever you have a question about the safety or fit of your eyeglasses, you can likely stop by your optometrist's office to have them look at your glasses without scheduling a full exam. Call ahead to make sure.

Get an annual eye exam.,
Be specific about any observations.,
Ask about new technologies.",How to Know if You Need New Glasses2," It’s easy to simply keep on wearing your glasses without worrying too much about your prescription over time. However, almost everyone’s eyesight naturally weakens over time. Even if you don’t think your prescription needs to be changed, schedule yourself an eye exam every one or two years at the very least.If you’re over sixty years of age, or have complications with your eye health, yearly checkups are especially important.

, You’ll likely start by sharing any frustration or discomfort you’ve experienced when speaking with your optometrist. However, it’s important to mention anything that you’ve noticed about your vision since you last saw your optometrist, even if it doesn’t seem too significant.Note things like, “I’ve realized it’s harder to see things that are moving quickly, like a tennis ball.”
If you’ve been experiencing headaches, be sure to mention where they occur in your head, and what you’re usually doing when the headaches occur.

, One of the benefits of getting regular eye exams is taking advantage of new technologies. This applies to both assessment equipment, as well as actual eyeglasses. In fact, improvements in lens design are somewhat frequent, and more and more types of lens are becoming available.Especially if you tend to use your glasses for one thing in particular, or notice issues with your vision during certain types of activities, ask your doctor something like, “Is there another type of lens I should try considering what we’ve talked about?”
In fact, you may find that your prescription is fine, but that a different type of lens will give you even better vision.

"

Account for lifestyle changes when choosing new glasses.,
Get new lenses in your old frames.,
Ask about satisfaction guarantees.",How to Know if You Need New Glasses3," Maybe your vision and your prescription haven’t changed at all, but your lifestyle has. For instance, have you changed professions and are suddenly spending more time outdoors or more time in front of a computer? In short, there are many types of glasses or lenses that are specifically useful for people who spend lots of time in one particular environment.Tell your eye doctor how you spend most of your time. This will allow them to help you choose the best glasses for you, considering your lifestyle.

, If you’re in love with your frames but worried that you might need to strengthen the lenses, don’t worry! You can often simply get new lens, as opposed to a whole new pair of glasses.You’ll need to visit your optometrist to specify your ideal prescription, and then mail your glasses off to a company that will measure and replace your old lenses with new ones.

, Many eyeglasses retailers will help you work through any issues with a new pair of glasses. For instance, you may find that you new glasses are too heavy, or that a new prescription is especially bothersome.In order to make sure you are not liable to additional expense, always ask something like, “If these end up not working out, will I be able to exchange them for another pair of glasses or lenses?”
Note that there will be a short adjustment period after getting a new prescription. In fact, you may experience headaches for a short time, as you eyes and brain acclimate to the new glasses. If discomfort persists, however, don’t hesitate to contact your optometrist.

Read about and understand the basics of Google Glass.,
Visit the #GoogleGlass and #GoogleGlassGram hashtags in Twitter so you can see what other glass users are doing with glass.

,
Invest in your own if possible.,
Brainstorm potential approach tactics.,
Hunt for your target.,
Approach the owner if you find one.,
Keep your cool.,
Remember that Google Glass demands coolness when you are wearing them.,
Practice ahead of time by following some nods.,
Enjoy the moment!,
Be prepared with commands.,
Have someone take a photo of you.,
Get proof from within Glass itself.,
Read part one again.",How to Look Cool Wearing Google Glass,",, The best way to get to develop your cool while wearing Google Glass is to get your own. This'll give you the maximum opportunities to develop your cool look. After all, you'll be an owner, and not just a borrower of Glass!


As of January 2015, Google has stopped producing the Google Glass prototype. However, they have announced their continued dedication to developing the product beyond this experimental phase.If you can't get your hands on a new or second-hand Google Glass now, you'll have to settle for borrowing a pair from someone else.

, Start thinking about how you are going to approach an unsuspecting person who has Google Glass so that you can try on their pair.


Read up on how to talk to strangers. It can be unnerving to have stranger walk up to you on the street, so try to approach the task from the shoes of the person you're approaching. Keep calm, stay friendly, and do everything you can not to put them off.

, Search the local area for any Google Glass owners that might be nearby.


Tweet out to the hashtag #GoogleGlass that you want to try a pair and where you are located.
Attend a technology workshop and see if one of the attendees or presenters have a pair you can use.

, Remember to maintain welcoming body language so you can get a chance at that Google Glass!


If all else fails and you can't design a confident approach, be like Nike and ""Just Do It!"" if you see someone nearby who has a pair, approach them excitedly and ask to try on their Glass.

, If they say no or they're in a hurry, be respectful and friendly, and walk away. If you can't find anyone to borrow a pair from, don't despair; just keep your eyes open for a good opportunity in the future. With Google planning to develop Glass more, chances are good you'll come across an owner sooner or later.


If none of the options above work, return to part one and investigate just buying your own pair.

, Be sure to project your utmost confidence when you exclaim, ""OK, Glass"" while nodding your head slightly to the ceiling to active it.

, For a simple example, think about the ""'Sup?!"" head nod that was popular in the '90s.


For more practice check out this detailed list of various head nods that you could try to up your ""coolness"" look. Be sure to choose the type of nod that best fits your personality.

, You can always choose to forgo any air of confidence and go for the crazy cross eyed look that many people have when first using glass. This looks a little bit like you are having a seizure while trying to talk to an invisible friend. It's not the coolest approach but you can rely on the fact that you are wearing Google Glass to up your coolness factor.

, For an extra coolness rating read up on simple Google Glass commands ahead of time. Then you can project stellar confidence when using them once you get a chance to try them on!

, That way, you can prove your coolness to others.

, If you are lucky enough to get Google Glass to activate with your chosen head nod style, be sure to take a picture with Google Glass and send it to a friend for proof that you were wearing them and activated them on your own.

, See if maybe it is worth the money after all!

Apply liquid to the lenses.,
Find a soft, microfiber cloth specifically designed for cleaning.,
Use side-to-side wiping motions to go over the lenses with the cloth.",How to Fix Scratched Glasses1," You can run the lenses under water for a minute, or you can use specialized cleaning solution designed for use with glasses. Window cleaning sprays also work well.


Do not yet apply any chemical that contains abrasive materials or has a high acid content (as will be mentioned in later examples). Glasses typically have layers or coatings over the lens itself. As you are polishing or cleaning, you are really just wiping this exterior coating. When you remove scratches, you are buffing or removing a small amount of the exterior layers. It is best to keep this to a minimum in the initial phases of scratch removal.;
, You will use it to clean the lenses. Do not use rough fabric. Though these may seem better designed to peel off layers of material, you really want to keep it to a minimum.


It is essential to use microfiber cloth because the incredibly small size of the fibers makes any new scratches or buffing marks so small that they are invisible to the naked eye.

, Do not use swirling or circular motions, as these can create circular smudges on the exterior of the glasses.

"
"
Apply toothpaste to the scratched lens.,
Use a piece of soft fabric to rub the toothpaste over the lens.,
Rub the toothpaste over the lens using a side-to-side motion.,
Wash off the toothpaste.,
Perform a final cleaning with a microfiber cloth.",How to Fix Scratched Glasses2," Toothpaste contains microscopic abrasive particles that can polish and grind down the exterior layers.

, Again, do not use any fabrics that are coarse or abrasive on their own; they will leave additional scratches in the lens.

, Do not use circular motions as they can create circular scuff marks.


The abrasives in toothpaste are harsher than microfiber cloth alone. Concentrating on a single area for too long could penetrate the exterior layers and damage the interior lens.

, You can use warm water or glass cleaners, or a combination of the two.

, Remove any remaining smudge marks from fingers or traces of residue from the toothpaste.

"
"
Purchase the necessary materials.,
Apply the glass etching substance using the cotton swabs.,
Let the substance remain on the lenses for no more than 5 minutes.,
Wash off the etching substance.,
Clean the glasses using a microfiber cloth.",How to Fix Scratched Glasses3," Normally, glass etching involves the use a fairly powerful acid to cut or burn an image into glass.In this particular context, it will be used to burn off the exterior layer of the glasses. You will need:


A glass etching substance. A brand known as Armor Etch produces one popular variety of the material, but there are others as well.
High quality rubber gloves to protect your hands.
Cotton swabs or some other material to use for applying the substance to the glasses.

, Do not rub the substance in, but merely apply it to the surface. Because of the strength of the acid in glass etching substances, you must work quickly. Only apply enough of the substance to cover the lens.

, Again, etching solution contains powerful acids. Over-exposure to these acids will likely damage the lenses.

, Use water to wash off the etching substance, unless the instructions call for alternatives. Wash thoroughly to guarantee that no residue from the substance remains.

, Use this to wipe and dry the lens, again using only side-to-side motions.

Wash your hands before handling your glasses.,
Do not touch the lenses while adjusting your glasses.,
Remove or protect your glasses while cooking on a stove.,
Prevent oils from your face and hair from smudging your glasses.,
Protect your lenses from inclement weather.,
Take your glasses off before going to sleep.,
Prevent your makeup from smudging your glasses.",How to Keep Your Glasses Clean1," This is especially important if you’ve been touching dirty or greasy objects. Even your fingers have natural oils on them, which will leave streaks and smudges on your lenses. Only touch your glasses and lenses when you need to, and always wash your hands first. Common sources of dirt and oils that get on eyeglasses include:The fur and skin of household pets
Food products that include flour, oil, grease, or spices
Workplace objects, including stair railings and elevator buttons;
, If your glasses have slipped down your nose and you need to push them back up, grip the frames to do this. Never push directly on the lenses, as this will transfer grease and oils from your hands onto the lenses.


Adjusting your glasses by gripping the frames will become a habit over time if you do it consistently and never adjust your glasses by pressing on the lenses.

, If you are cooking greasy foods on high heat, the hot oils will spray out of the pan, and can splatter high enough to smudge your glasses. If you need to wear your glasses while cooking, put a lid over the pot to protect yourself and your glasses from being sprayed with hot oil. If your glasses have been smudged by grease, clean them as soon as possible. Foods that are likely to splatter grease and oil while being cooked include:


Bacon or other pan-fried meats
Eggs
Anything sautéed, especially onions

, The skin on your face will naturally build up oils during the day, and these can transfer to your lenses if you push your glasses up high on your face. Similarly, natural oils from your hair can leave streaks or smudges on your glasses also.


Wash your face regularly—at least once a day—to prevent oils from building up and smudging your lenses.
If you have long bangs, these can carry oils as well, and potentially transfer that oil to your lenses. Pin your bangs back to prevent them from smudging your glasses.

, Windy, rainy, and dusty weather all present unique challenges for individuals who wear glasses. Be aware that your glasses will be smudged and speckled with dirt after being in a dusty or dirty environment, and will be streaked with water after a rainstorm. Take your glasses off in these environments, or avoid spending much time outdoors when the weather is windy or rainy.


Although rainwater will evaporate from your glasses, it will leave behind a residue which smears the lenses.
If small dust particles have stuck to your glasses, do not try to rub them off without first rinsing the lenses. Dust can permanently scratch your lenses if rubbed or pressed farther into the glass.

, It’s important that you never sleep while wearing your glasses. While sleeping, you’ll roll over and move around, and this poses a threat to your glasses. They can easily become smudged by oils from your face and pillow. Worse, you’re at risk of breaking the frame if you roll over while wearing glasses.


Even if you’re only lying down to rest, still take off your glasses. It’s not worth the risk of rolling over and snapping the frames.

, When putting on makeup, determine where your glasses’ nose pads contact the bridge of your nose. Lightly wipe that spot on your nose clean from makeup—otherwise, the makeup on the bridge of your nose is likely to smudge your glasses. Once you’ve cleaned off the makeup from the spots of contact on the bridge of your nose, clean your glasses and gently scrub your nose pads.


Because of its high oil content, makeup can be difficult to remove from your lenses.

"
"
Run the lenses under lukewarm water.,
Rub dish soap onto the lenses.,
Rinse and dry the lenses.,
Avoid products that contain ammonia, bleach, or vinegar.",How to Keep Your Glasses Clean2," At some point, your glasses will inevitably get dirty, whether from contact with your fingers, dirt in the air, or other incidental contact. If the lenses are smudged, moisten them to loosen the dirt and by running the lenses under water.It’s a good idea to wash your hands as well, so that you’re not smearing oils from your fingers onto the lenses.
Hot water can damage anti-glare treatments.

, Put a small drop on each of your glasses’ lenses, and rub the soap around to cut through the oils and dirt on each lens. Make sure to clean both sides of the lenses, not only the inner side.


You can also use hand soap to clean your lenses. Make sure that it is a lotion-free soap, though; otherwise you’ll smudge the lenses with the lotion in the soap., After you’ve washed them, re-rinse the lenses under lukewarm water. Then dry them using a clean, dry, lint-free cloth (microfiber is preferable), taking care not to rub any more dirt or grime on the lenses.

, These substances are abrasive and will strip away the protective coatings on your glasses.For the same reason, do not clean your glasses using Windex or window cleaner.


Be sure the cloth used to dry the lenses has not been laundered with fabric softener or a dryer sheet. Doing so can leave streaks behind.Never spit on your glasses, or clean your lenses using saliva. Saliva is not sanitary and often contains germs and oils which will smudge your glasses."
"
Keep your glasses in their case.,
Keep a clean, soft cloth in your glasses case.,
Remove your glasses before physical activities.,
Never lend your glasses to other people.",How to Keep Your Glasses Clean3," When you’re not wearing your glasses, keep them safe by placing them in an eyeglasses case.Without a case, glasses can easily get smudged or damaged.


Keep your glasses in their case whenever you’re sleeping. If they’re reading glasses, keep them in a glasses case (when you’re doing an activity other than reading) to prevent dust from getting on them.

, Optometrists will often give you a soft microfiber cloth with your purchase of glasses. Keep this in the case, and it will provide two benefits: keeping your frames cushioned (should you drop the case), and giving you an easy way to wipe the lenses if they become dirty.


If you get dust and water or smears of some sort on them, you can just grab your cloth out of your case and clean the lenses.
Avoid cleaning the lenses with your shirt, as the fabric will not be as clean as the microfiber cloth., Since participating in sports can involve running, flying dust and dirt, falling, and colliding with other players, it’s best to remove your glasses so they do not become smudged or even broken. If you don’t take them off, you risk damaging the lenses and frame.


Many people who wear glasses also have backup contact lenses, and choose to wear these when they’re playing sports.

, Not only is your prescription meant for you alone, but you also lose control of what happens to your glasses if someone else is wearing them. Other individuals may not know how to handle glasses delicately, and may smudge your lenses or crack the frames.

Examine the label and logo.,
Look for a model number.,
Buy from a reputable seller.,
Recognize key words.,
Follow your gut.",How to Determine Authentic Sunglasses1," Authentic logos are usually placed on the lens, arms, or inside the ear piece and use consistent size, font, and colors. Any slight error or variation could indicate your sunglasses are fake. Misspelled brand names (e.g. ""Guci"" instead of ""Gucci"" and logos are also an indication that the glasses may be fake.

, Authentic sunglasses are usually sold by an authorized website, boutique, or store. Street vendors are most likely selling counterfeit items.If the price is deeply discounted and sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Stay away from websites that do not take returns and offer no way (e.g. phone number, email address, etc.) for you to contact them.

, Words like ""high quality,"" ""cosmetic,"" ""replica,"" ""inspired by,"" are often used to when glasses are not authentic. Take note if you see any of these words being used to describe the seller or the glasses. In addition to the glasses being fake, they may shatter easily and not offer you UV protection.

, There is not one simple formula to determine if the sunglasses are authentic. Use common sense and your best judgement. Adequately research the company you are purchasing the sunglasses from. It is possible to find a really good deal on authentic sunglasses. If the price is really low, examine the other factors before you make a purchase.

Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations.,
Invest in a microfiber cloth.,
Use water first.,
Use lens cleaner only as recommended and needed.,
Understand polarization basics.,
Protect your eyewear.,
Get professional cleanings and repairs.",How to Clean Polarized Glasses," There is no universal type of polarized eyewear, and no universal way to keep them all clean. Different manufacturers rely on different techniques and materials to achieve polarization, so the specific care instructions for your eyewear should always be followed.


Check your brand’s website or go to a retailer if you need specific advice for your eyewear.
Regardless of your brand, however, it is safe to assume that the next several steps will be applicable.;
, Who hasn’t rubbed a smudge off their glasses with a shirt tail, sleeve, or tissue? Such materials can be too rough and/or be embedded with dust particles or debris that may scratch the coating on polarized lenses.Many polarized glasses will come with a small microfiber cleaning cloth. If not, they are easy to find in eyewear stores or in the eye care departments of larger retailers.
A soft, clean cotton cloth can also be used, but is not as highly recommended by manufacturers.Whatever cloth you use, make sure it is clean. Microfiber cloths can be laundered, but avoid using fabric softeners on them. They can embed undesirable chemicals and oils., Clean, warm water is the easiest, cheapest, safest, and often most effective way to remove smudges, dirt, oil, etc. from polarized glasses.


Before doing any other cleaning, remove surface dust and debris by blowing on your glasses, then (if necessary) running them under warm water.If there is salt residue (from seawater) or any other type of abrasive material on your glasses, be sure to rinse them thoroughly with water before doing any type of rubbing.Rub the lenses with your microfiber cloth while they are still wet from the rinsing, or while still under the running water. Use only as much pressure as needed to remove dirt and smudges.The old-time method of breathing warm, damp air on your lenses and gently wiping them clean is acceptable for quick, minor cleanings. Make sure the lens is moistened all over, however., Polarized glasses are often expensive, so you may be tempted to skip paying for the lens cleaner. After all, can’t you just use dish soap or window cleaner? Especially when dealing with polarized lenses, the answer is no.


Commercial soaps, household cleaners, and especially window cleaners can contain chemicals that will slowly but surely dissolve the coating on your glasses. This will leave them cloudy and less effective at reducing glare.Manufacturers of several popular brands of polarized glasses have specific recommendations for the use of lens cleaners. These include:

Buying their own branded cleaner or choosing one with a pH level between 5.5 and 8.Buying a (different company’s) branded cleaner or using another with less than five percent alcohol content.Avoiding the use of cleaners entirely in favor of plain old warm water., Without going into great detail, polarization works by filtering out horizontal glare — that is, light reflecting off of water, fallen snow, car hoods, etc.The substantial reduction in glare they can achieve helps explain why polarized eyewear is a favorite among skiers, fishermen, and professional drivers.
The effect is achieved by applying a thin coating to each surface of the lens. This coating is susceptible to scratching or dissolving without proper care.

, Although there are budget-friendly polarized glasses out there, odds are good that you spent a decent chunk of change on your pair. So always follow the manufacturer’s instructions for proper care, along with these tips:


Always keep your glasses in the provided protective case when not in use. This is one of the easiest ways to prevent scratches and the accumulation of dust and dirt.
Don’t leave your glasses exposed to extreme temperatures, which can deform the polarized coating. Avoid, for example, leaving the glasses under the front windshield, where they can bake under the blazing sun.Never “dry rub” your polarized lenses, even with a clean microfiber cloth. The friction caused by even tiny bits of dust or debris can cause damage if not lubricated with water or an approved cleaner., You may receive a cleaning and repair kit with your polarized glasses. Use these as recommended for regular cleanings and minor repairs. However, going back to the retailer or another eyewear store that will do cleanings, inspections, and repairs can really pay off.High quality polarized lenses can be quite expensive, and it is likely worth your investment to have occasional professional care done on them. Go in when something is obviously wrong or the glasses are too caked with oils, residue, etc. for you to clean yourself. Also consider going in for check-ups once or twice a year as well.

, Run your glasses under a gentle stream of lukewarm tap water. Flowing water will wash away debris that could damage lenses. Don’t use hot water, as too much heat will ruin the anti-glare coating., Dab a drop of mild dish soap, such as Dawn original, onto each lens.

Make sure to get into nooks and crannies, to clean the earpieces, and to remove oils and any other buildup from the nose pads. , Hold your glasses under a stream lukewarm water once again. Wash away the soap suds from both sides of the lenses, frame, and all other parts. Inspect your eyewear carefully to make sure all soap has been removed, as any left on will cause smearing., Gently shake away any excess moisture, taking care not to bend the frame or earpieces. Use a microfiber towel or soft, lint-free cloth to completely dry them. Avoid using towels that have served other purposes or have been stored in the kitchen. These will have likely picked up grease, dust, or cooking oil residue that’ll smear or scratch your lenses.Don’t use fabric softener or drier sheets when laundering your eyeglass cloths. These substances can smear or leave residue on your lenses.

Hold each lens with a microfiber cloth (specifically made for eyewear).",How to Clean Sunglasses1," Also inspect if any other pieces of the glasses need cleaning. Pieces to look out for are the nose and earpieces. These come into contact with hair and natural oils on your skin, which can quickly accumulate to make them dirty quicker. If they do need a quick clean, then wipe them with the microfiber cloth., Don’t be counterproductive and clean with a dirty cloth! Not only is using a clean cloth avoids transferring dirt and other residue, but it highly reduces the risks of scratching lenses when wiping off an eyeglass cleaning solution.

, It’s best to use a spray that came with the glasses when you purchased them. Sprays that are specific to your sunglasses will protect any extra coatings the lenses have on them. Try to spray from a distance that evenly coats the lenses, so when you wipe there isn’t any buildup of solution to accumulate to form smudges.

Clean your glasses every morning.,
Keep clothes or towels designated for eyeglasses.,
Use spray eyewear cleaner on the go.",How to Clean Eyeglasses with Anti‐Glare Lenses2," Developing a normal cleaning routine will prevent debris, oil, and dirt from building up. Daily cleaning makes your eyewear easier to maintain and extend their lifespan. Further, cleaning your eyewear from lenses to earpieces regularly will prevent them from becoming discolored and lower the risk of eye infection., Use specific towels or cloths for cleaning your glasses, and don’t use them for other purposes. Clean them every few days to make sure they’re not harboring any particles that could damage your lenses or anti-glare coating. Keep cloths handy when you’re on the go, but make sure to use them in tandem with tap water or a generous amount of spray cleaner.Keeping cloths with you when you’re away from home will reduce the temptation to use napkins or other paper products, which don’t work very well and can leave small particles that might cause fine scratches.

, Keep a spray cleaning solution approved for anti-glare lenses for when you’re on the go and don’t have access to tap water and dish soap. Use plenty of the solution on your lenses before you do any wiping. Really soaking them will remove dust and dirt particles.

Wet your glasses when cleaning them.,
Stay away from solvents.,
Store your glasses carefully.,
Don’t huff and wipe.,
Don’t spit shine.",How to Clean Eyeglasses with Anti‐Glare Lenses3," Never wipe your glasses when they’re dry. Even if they’re invisible to you, tiny dust and dirt particles are present on your lenses, and dry wiping will scratch them. Once your glasses are scratched, there’s nothing you can do to buff them out.It’s especially important to avoid dry wiping anti-glare lenses. Scratches are more obvious on anti-glare eyewear because they block out almost all light reflection, which helps to hide tiny scratches on eyeglass lenses., While ammonia (like Windex), vinegar, alcohol, and other solvents can be used on windows and stemware, keep them far away from your anti-glare eyeglasses. These cleaners can wear away or damage your anti-glare coating. Check with your eye doctor to make absolutely sure your eyewear cleaning solution is mild enough for your anti-glare lenses., Keep your glasses away from hot or cold temperature extremes. The heating and cooling can cause the anti-glare coating to warp and crack because it expands and contracts at a different rate than the lens. Don’t leave them out on the dashboard of your car. Always keep them in a case when you’re not wearing them, especially when toting them in a bag or purse. Try not to leave them out on your sink or vanity, since splatters from products like hairspray, perfume or cologne, and other cosmetics can damage or strip the anti-glare layer.

, Most people are guilty of exhaling on their lenses and wiping them off on their shirt. Your clothes are full of tiny bits of dirt, oil, cologne or perfume, and other damaging chemicals and particles. Further, the fabric itself can be abrasive for eyewear lenses, whether or not they’re coated with an anti-glare layer., It’s important not to be tempted to use saliva to wipe your glasses. Even if it seems quick and easy, saliva won’t get rid of the small particles that can scratch your lenses. Further, using saliva not only doesn’t work well, but there’s a slight risk that the bacteria in your mouth could cause eye infections, so be sure to practice good hygiene and avoid spit shining."

Run lenses underneath warm water.,
Put a small drop of dish soap on each side of the lenses.,
Rinse the lenses again to remove the soap.,
Hold the glasses up.,
Allow the lenses to air-dry or gently shake the water off.",How to Clean Sunglasses2," Make sure the water is at a warm enough temperature to touch — tepid or room-temperature water is ideal. Running glasses under water that is too hot could damage any coatings the lenses may have.

, Take your forefinger and thumb, and gently smear the soap in a circular motion. Rub so that the soap evenly coats each lens.

, Just let the running water remove the soap – do not rub it off with your fingers. Doing so will leave smudges on the lenses and you risk scratching the lenses if there is dust or debris on the lens still.

, Look at a light source (preferably natural lighting) through the lenses and inspect if there is any potential residue from the soap or the grime that you were originally set out to clean. You should see nothing but water droplets on the lenses., Avoid wiping the water off with any paper towels or kitchen cloths. Opt for a clean microfiber cloth.If using paper towels, do not rub the lenses. Instead, lightly dab the residue water droplets, allowing the paper to absorb them. Do this to avoid water marks.If you don't have a microfiber cloth, use a clean cotton cloth. It's vital that the alternative to a microfiber cloth is a clean cotton cloth. Any other material could hold risks of severely scratching the lenses! any cloth treated with fabric softener is not a good idea because it often leaves smudges."

Combine some rubbing alcohol and water.,
Add one or two drops of dish soap to any mixture for extra clarity once the lenses are wiped.,
Use the solution on other parts of the glasses.,
Avoid adding other household cleaning products, such as window cleaner.",How to Clean Sunglasses3," Using rubbing alcohol is a safe way to clean glasses without removing finishes, such as non-glare coatings.Put three parts alcohol for every one part of water you mix together.
Make as much as desired, and keep in a small spray bottle for future uses.
Spray and wipe with a clean cotton cloth in a circular motion.

, This works the same as cleaning lenses under running water with dish soap. Add a little bit of soap to a ready-made bottle of diluted alcohol to get that finishing clarity., Since pre-made lens cleaners are specified towards lenses only, the benefit of a diluted rubbing alcohol solution is that it can be safely applied to pieces such as earpieces and nosepieces. Give the entire frame a wipe down to get them back to their original, clean state.

, These chemicals are far too hard on lenses, running risks of damages with expensive repair costs (i.e. coating replacements). Though they may seem convenient, do not add them to any cleaning solutions you plan to make."

Think about how often you wear glasses.,
Think about your daily lifestyle.,
Determine how nice you want them to look.",How to Choose Your Glasses Frames1," This has an effect on several aspects of your new frames. People who wear glasses less often probably want to spend less money. They may also be ok with heavier frames. Those who wear glasses regularly may want to spend more money on a more durable pair. They might also want lighter, more practical frames.;
, Some of your daily activities may call for special features. Proximity to water, activity, and machinery will affect which frames you select. If you wear your glasses during manual labor, look at the glasses of those around you. The common denominator between your coworkers’ frames may give you an idea as to what works best in your job.Those who are active throughout the day should look into break and scratch resistant frames. This will minimize how often you have to get the frames repaired. It is also advisable that you pick frames with a warranty. Free or discounted repairs are a must for the active glasses wearer.

, Think about how you will use your glasses. Some emphasize practicality and price over style. Others will use their glasses in professional or social situations that call for more sleek or stylish frames. The minimalistic pairs will cost you less, but the more fashionable are more likely to accentuate your face and outfit.

Determine your face shape.,
Figure out skin allergies.,
Look at your skin tone.,
Consider your hair color.",How to Choose Your Glasses Frames2," Picking the most ideal frame for your face is not entirely up to you. Much is dictated by the natural features of your face. The most important aspect of this is your face shape. You can easily figure this out by looking in the mirror or taking a picture, and comparing it to a diagram.Round face. With this shape, tend more toward square and rectangular frames that will make your face look slimmer and longer. Avoid frameless, oval, and circular frames.
Oval. Pick frames with a strong bridge, and avoid large frames that will make your face look small.
Square. To offset the angularity of your face, tend toward rounded or round frames.
Diamond. You may not want to accentuate your narrow forehead, so don’t pick wide frames that call attention to this. Opt instead for small, rounded frames.
Heart. To minimize how large your forehead appears compared to your chin, pick frames that sit low on the nose. This makes the center of your face seem lower.

, If this is not your first pair of frames, you probably have an idea of your skin allergies. Otherwise, your dermatologist can give you a test to determine this. If you are unsure and don’t want a test, there are materials that are more likely to break out your skin than others.Plastic or synthetic. These frames are often designed to be hypoallergenic, meaning they are less likely to break out your skin. They also have a wide price range. A few examples are cellulose acetate/zylonite, cellulose propionate, and nylon.
Metal. Metal frames vary, as far as skin allergies are concerned – some are hypo-allergenic, but others may break you out. Examples are titanium, stainless steel, beryllium, and aluminum.
Other/natural materials. Wood, bone, and horn do not usually cause skin allergies.

, Most people fit into two basic categories for skin tone. To figure out if you have warm or cool skin tone, hold up a piece of white paper next to your face. If your skin seems yellowish, brownish, or bronze, you have a warm skin tone. If your skin seems pinkish or bluish, you have cool skin tone.For warmer skin tones, stick with tortoise, browns, and dark green over white, black or pastel colors that contrast heavily.
For cooler skin tones, look for more stark colors like black, white, and bright colors. The more brownish hues will contrast with your skin tone.

, This is similar to your skin – there are two main categories of hair tones. Some cool hair colors are strawberry-blonde, blue-black, and white. Examples of warmer hair colors are brownish-black, golden blonde, and gray. Apply the same rules for frame color as with your skin tone.

Figure out your optometrist’s rates for fitting your lenses.,
Look at optometrist’s prices for frames.,
Look at other glasses shops in the area for frames.",How to Choose Your Glasses Frames3," Some optometrists feature frames in their office. They may fit your lenses in these for free or at a discounted rate. Before shopping around, you should know if their rate for bringing in an outside pair of frames will put the glasses out of your price range.

, It seems that the best prices will be at specialty or discount frames shops. However, you may find that the difference between these shops and your optometrist is negligible. After the fee for fitting your lens, warranties, and other considerations, you may be better off picking frames from your optometrist.


If you only use your glasses minimally and at home, you may not feel the need to have a big insurance plan. Determine if you need to be able to get your frames repaired for free when comparing costs.

, There may be specialty frame shops that sell products much different than those offered by your optometrist. They may also be discounted enough that it vastly outweighs the benefits of picking a pair in your optometrist’s office. Don’t limit yourself to the prices and stock of one shop when picking out new frames.

Look at materials, size, weight, and features.,
Know your measurements.,
Measure your pupillary distance (PD).,
Look at the store’s policies.,
Try them on and consider returning them.",How to Choose Your Glasses Frames4," Without an optometrist or impartial observer around, you need to pay close attention to the frames’ specifications. In addition to looking at its special features, material, and size, look at the weight. Without the ability to try on glasses you find online, you will have to compare their specifications with glasses lying around the house. Weigh your old glasses using a mini scale and use it to gauge the relative weight of frames you find online.

, It is important to get frames that will fit the anatomical features of your face. Even a pair of glasses that is the right total width and height may still not fit your face. Make sure all the measurements are right for your face by taking a pair of glasses you have on-hand and using its measurements to determine the relative size of a pair online. These measurements are generally in millimeters.Eye. This is the width of each lens, from its outermost points.
Bridge. This is how far apart each lens is.
Temple. This is the length of the piece that tucks behind your ear.
B measurement. This is the height of each lens, measured from its highest and lowest points.

, This is the distance between your pupils. Since it is difficult to measure on your own, the way to get the most accurate PD is to have your optometrist measure it for you. However, there are ways you can ‘do it yourself’ at home. This might save yourself time and get a general idea of what range of PD sizes you fall into. This number is generally measured in millimeters.


The easiest way to measure PD at home is with a picture. Hold an item you know the dimensions of (like a pen) directly under your chin. Take a picture in the mirror and get out a ruler. For example, if the pen was 5” (or 127 mm) long, and appears 1” (25.4 mm) long in the photo, you know the ratio of photo measurements to actual measurements is 1:5. So, if your pupil distance was a half inch in the photo, we multiply that by 5. This number gives us the pupillary distance – 2.5”, or 60mm.

, You want to be able to try the glasses on and return or exchange them for free. Also take into consideration how this will affect your bottom line price, especially with shipping charges. You should look for a seller that offers some kind of warranty, insurance, and maintenance guarantee., This is the most important aspect of buying glasses online. It is impossible to be as accurate with your own measurements choosing a pair online as a pair tailored for you by your optometrist. The online seller may also have misleading or inaccurate pictures or specifications. Wear them for a day or so, and think about your levels of comfort and vision.

Take the bottom edge of the long side of your shayla in your hand.,
Wrap the shorter end underneath your chin.,
Add more layers if you'd like.,
Double-check that no hair is showing.",How to Wear the Hijab," Also called inner scarves or undercaps, underscarves help to cover the hair and hold the hijab in place. They can be a bandana over the forehead or an elastic headsock wrapped around the whole face. Not everyone wears an underscarf, but it makes wearing the hijab much easier., One popular type of scarf used for the hijab is a long rectangular piece of cloth called a shayla. These scarves are wrapped around the head and pinned in place. Shaylas come in an enormous variety of colors and patterns. The al-amira is another common headscarf style. These are often made of stretchy material and fit tightly around the face with no pinning required.You can use any type of scarf as long as it is big enough to cover your hair, ears, and neck. Remember that any fabric used as a covering cannot be transparent.

, In order to properly wear the hijab, your clothing must cover all parts of your body except for your hands and face. Your garments must also be loose enough so as to not reveal the shape of your body.


Many Muslim women wear an abaya with their hijab. The abaya is a long, loose-fitting dress similar to a robe. Although traditional abayas are black, they are now also made in a variety of colors.Other women pair their hijab with whatever clothing is typically worn in their culture, as long as it meets the basic criteria of modesty. This can be as casual as a long-sleeved t-shirt and loose jeans.

, Most people hold their headscarves in place with straight pins. A brooch can also be used to attach the scarf to your top near the collarbone.


Some styles of hijab do not require pins, especially if they fit very tightly around the face. Even if a looser scarf can be worn without pins, it's better to use a few to be sure it doesn't slip off unexpectedly., You will most likely have to tie your hair while wearing the hijab. Tying up wet hair can damage its roots, leading to hair loss.Covering damp hair keeps it from drying out, which can lead to a fungal infection., Don't tie your hair too tightly, which can cause discomfort or damage to your hair. If your hair is very long, consider bunching it into a tube cap underscarf. This accessory will hold your hair up in place under your shayla., If your hair is short, it will be difficult to tie back but will still need to be held in place. Gather your hair with one hand and with your other secure it in place using a few hair clips or bobby pins.Give special attention to your bangs, which can slip out easily. Group your bangs together with one hand, give your hair a slight twist, and then pin it to the side of your temple or behind your ear.

, The three main types of underscarves are each worn differently.


Wear a cap underscarf like a bonnet. Place the rim on your forehead below the hairline. Pull the cap over your tied-up hair. Tilt it so that your ears are covered. Tie the underscarf firmly at the bottom near the nape of your neck.
The tube underscarf is a comfortable option for women with long hair. Pull the tube onto your hair starting from the back of your head. Adjust the scarf so that the edge reaches your forehead past the hairline. Make sure your ears and hair are tucked into the scarf.
A full underscarf, also called a ""ninja underscarf,"" is worn similar to a hood. It will completely cover your hair and neck, allowing you to be more creative and less meticulous when pinning your shayla., You can position your shayla so that it completely covers your underscarf or let it rest an inch or two above.Scarves for hijab are sold in a variety of places, including Muslim stores and online specialty shops. Making one yourself out of fabric is also easy to do. Just make sure the material is opaque, not transparent, unless you're pairing it with a full-coverage underscarf.

, Drape the ends over your shoulders onto your front. If your scarf is thin, make sure to flatten it over your head as much as possible.To help hold things in place, you can use a safety pin to connect the sides of your shayla under your neck.

, Bring the edge towards your opposite shoulder, wrapping it underneath your chin. Wrap it loosely around the opposite side of your head and then pin it in place. The end can be thrown loose over either side of your shoulder or pinned close.


A different style you can try is to loosely wrap it around your neck instead of your head., Tuck the edge under the longer side and pin it in place. You could pin the end over the opposite side instead if you prefer.


One alternative for when your neck is already well-covered is to drape the short end loosely over your opposite shoulder, securing it with a pin or brooch.

, If you plan on adding another layer, wrap your first shayla tighter. You can mix and match colors and fabrics as a way to vary your wardrobe.Minimize your layers during the summer or if you live in a warm climate, especially if you have a lot of hair. Even light, breathable fabric can make you feel too hot when layered.

, Use a hand mirror along with the bathroom mirror to check the back of your head. You can also ask a female friend or relative to look for you. Nod your head and move it from side to side to make sure your hijab will be secure enough for your daily tasks.

Walk away from bags with a tilted pattern.,
Look for upside-down LV's on the back.",How to Spot Fake Louis Vuitton Purses1," This is best done in person, but if that's not possible, ask the seller for as many close-up photos as possible. Sloppy stitches suggest a counterfeit bag. Another indicator of a counterfeit bag is the number of stitches per inch (SPI) on the seam. SPI (stitches per inch) refers to the number of stitches in a single inch of seam. A high SPI count indicates greater overall seam strength, (and therefore a higher quality handbag). Authentic Louis Vuitton bags will have a higher SPI count than the counterfeits.;

Examine the craftsmanship.,
Look at the stitching.,
Check the lining.",How to Spot a Fake Coach Bag1," There should be little wear to the bag and the material should be sturdy. Coach products are made from expensive and authentic materials. For example, they use real, high-quality leather. So if the bag appears overly smooth and plastic-y, it's likely to be made from a synthetic like pleather, which would make it a fake.


If the bag is flimsy or it appears to stretch a lot, these are also red flags.;
, The seams and stitching of Coach bags are even and clean. Each stitch should be the exact same length. They should also be straight and not over-stitched. This means you will see only one line of thread, not multiples stitched over each other.

, Most Coach purses will have a solid-color, satin lining. However, bags without the ‘CC’ print on the exterior may have it on the interior instead. This may not always be the case, though, as some bags may not have the CC pattern on either the outside or the inside.


Keep in mind that a Coach bag should never have the CC pattern on both the inside and outside.

Take everything out of your purse.,

Keep miscellaneous items in their own pouch.,
Put things away into their designated places as soon as you are done using them.,
Clear your purse out once a week, or alternate purses weekly.,
Avoid picking up free stuff and samples.,
Consider keeping a supply kit in your car or locket.",How to Organize Your Purse," Be sure to go through all of the pockets, both interior and exterior, as well. Once you have everything out, you can use this chance to clean your purse as well. A quick and easy way to do this is to turn it upside down and shake it over a trashcan to empty out any debris.;
, How you do this will depend on what you had inside your purse and how you organize things; everyone is a little different. In either case, it might be a good idea to put similar items (or items with similar uses) together. Here are some samples of piles to get you started:Electronics
Feminine care products
Gift cards, coupons, and loyalty cards
Makeup
Medication
Wallet, money, and credit cards
Trash

, If it's been a while since you last cleaned out your purse, you might have some items that don't belong, such as: candy wrappers, a pair of extra socks you brought because it was raining, expired coupons, or receipts for items you no longer have. Throw away the items that need to be thrown away (such as candy wrappers) and put away items that don't belong (such as that change of socks).

, Take a careful look at your items. Do you really use that tablet or eReader each and every time you leave the house? Some seldom-used items are important in case of emergencies (such as feminine care products or medication) but other items (such as electronic or entertainment items) are not absolutely necessary.


This does not mean that you can never bring your electronic or entertainment items with you. Pack them in your purse only when you know that you will need them; otherwise, leave them at home.
Be selective about your makeup. Limit yourself to just one lipstick shade and one eye shadow palette. You can change them out weekly; the less you pack, the better.

, Since you are organizing your purse, you can take this time to switch it out for a new one. This will force you to be more selective about what you put into your purse. It will also prevent you from stuffing unnecessary items into it, which can lead to clutter., Pouches are a great way to keep your things organized, but they also take up space. If your purse already has pockets in it, then you can use those instead. Pockets are also great at keeping things like cell phones in one place (as opposed to rattling about loosely in your purse).Consider a purse that has a small, exterior pocket. This is great for keys, and makes them easy to grab., This includes things like your wallet, sunglasses, keys, hand sanitizer, and lip balm. If you have any pockets in your purse, consider putting the smaller items (such as lip balm) into them. This will not only reduce clutter, but also make it easier to reach in and grab what you need; you won't have to rustle through your purse for five minutes to find that tiny tube of lip balm.

, Instead of carrying a full-sized lint roller or bottle of lotion, opt for travel-sized ones instead. You will need to refill them more often, but they will save space and make your bag significantly lighter.If you can't find any travel-sized versions of your favorite lotion, consider getting an empty, travel-sized shampoo container and filling it up instead.


Many items come in travel-size, including tissues, hair brushes, and lint rollers.

, A simple pouch will keep similar items together, and prevent you from having to rummage through your purse each and every time you need something.It doesn't even have to be a fancy pouch; a plastic, zippered bag will also do in a pinch. Be sure to have a separate pouch for each set of items; you don't want to keep your coins with your makeup! Here are some items that you can put into pouches:Manicure sets
Medication
Feminine care products
Pens, pencils, post-its, and other stationary items

, Many wallets even have special slots for these types of cards. If you want to get super-organized, sort them alphabetically.See if your loyalty cards are available in app form. This can save you lots of space because everything will be stored on your phone.
Store the cards you use the most in your wallet, and the cards you use less often in a separate pouch.

, You can keep them in your wallet or in a mini, accordion-style file holder.You should also have a system in place for them, including how often you go through them and throw them away. The last thing you'd want is to hoard receipts that expired five years ago.


This step can also be used for coupons.

, If you need to take a lot of medications for allergies, pain, headaches, and so forth, consider keeping a few pills in a weekly pill box. Label each compartment with what's inside, such as: pain medication, allergy medication, and so forth.You will have to refill the pill box often, but at least you won't have to carry several bottles of medication in your purse, which can take up a lot of space.


Consider keeping this in a zippered pouch along with other care items, such as dental floss.

, Keeping all of your makeup together will not only make things easier to find, but it will also help keep the inside of your purse clean. You also want to carry the makeup you use the most often with you. This means that, instead of carrying five different eyeshadow shades, you only pack one pallet, and leave the rest at home. The less makeup you carry, the less bulk you will have.


Another option is to omit packing your makeup, and doing it at home. Pack items for touch-up only, such as lipstick, lip gloss, and powder.

, Chances are, you may have a bunch of items that you need in your purse. Instead of letting these items rattle about loosely in your purse, consider putting all of them inside one, zippered ouch. This includes things like earbuds, batteries, notebooks, etc., All it takes is a few extra seconds, but it will keep your purse looking tidy longer. If you start just throwing everything into your purses instead, it will look like a war-zone in no time.This includes putting loose change into a coin purse or your wallet.

, Both of these will help keep clutter at bay. Clearing your purse weekly will also help keep it both clean and clutter-free., This include items like lotion or perfume samples from sales people at the mall, or extra salt/sugar packets from the restaurant. These items usually end up at the bottom of purses, forgotten. Overtime, they accumulate and lead to clutter. Instead, politely decline these offers or use the products immediately., Makeup kits, first aid kits, and feminine care kits can all take up lots of space. You can save that space by keeping them in your car or school/work locker. This way, you will still be able to do your makeup, take your medication, and so forth, but you won't be carrying those items with you all the time."

Look at the 'CC' pattern.,
Look for labels.,
Check the logo tags.,
Compare the bag to pictures on the Coach website.",How to Spot a Fake Coach Bag2," Bags with the signature C design follow a very set arrangement. For example, both Cs should be horizontal, facing each other, and touching. They should also start in the center of the front panel on the bag, and be structured to where you could cut the bag in half down the middle and have matching patterns on each side.There should also be no breaks in the pattern, even at the seams and pockets.
Bags with the 'C' pattern are usually the ones that are faked, so be sure to inspect the bag carefully. There shouldn’t just be Cs all over the place
Also make sure the Cs are actually Cs and not Gs. From a distance, the difference may not be noticeable.

, Labels are commonly found on the hardware, outside of the bag, and on the inside of the bag. For example, each bag should come with the coach leather creed, which is a leather patch embossed on the inside containing the bag’s serial number. If there isn’t a leather patch, the serial number for the bag should at least be stamped on the inside, not printed.


Keep in mind that some Coach bags like the clutch, swingpack, and mini will not have a serial number.
Bags from the 1960s will also not have a serial number. Whereas bags from the 1970s and 1980s will have a serial number with only numbers, not letters and numbers like current bags., Many Coach purses also come with logo tags. These are leather tags attached to the purse with a beaded chain. The trim of the tag should match the trim on the bag, and the COACH logo should be raised, not imprinted., If anything about the bag seems off to you, comparing it to an image of an authentic version is a good idea. It can help you determine where the labels should be on that particular bag. As well as how the bag should look; what the pattern should be, the inside lining, and the logo tags.

"
"
Determine if the deal is too good to be true.,
Pay close attention to the vendor.,
Look at the wear once the bag is broken-in.",How to Spot a Fake Coach Bag3," While they aren’t the most expensive bags comparatively, Coach bags can still be anywhere between $200-$600. Even the used bags can retail for a hefty price. If a new coach bag is selling for a cheap price, that's a good sign that it's a fake. Keep in mind the actual pricing of the bag you want and compare it the one you're considering buying. Are they similar?

, If a vendor avoids your questions, looks guilty, or gives vague answers when you ask about the authenticity of a bag, it's a good sign that you should be wary. Ask if they accept returns. If they don't they may not be credible.


If the vendor has a lot of the same type of bag, this is also a red flag as it usually means they’re replicas. Inspect the material in this instance. Are the bags made of fabric or cheap leather?

, If the bag holds up and wears nicely, it shows that the bag is authentic or at the very least well-made. A broken, torn bag by the end of a few weeks shows that the bag is most likely a fake. Coach bags are made from quality materials, so frayed threads, cracked leather, and warping from use are going to take a while -- probably a few years.

If you've lost or misplaced your microfiber cloth, find a soft, clean substitute cloth. Cotton, so long as it's clean, should be suitable.It is important to use fabric that is not treated with fabric softener as that can cause streaks on the lenses.You should avoid using: coarse fabrics, like wool and certain synthetic fabrics, facial tissue, or toilet paper, as these will cause tiny scratches to form on your lenses over time.;
, These solutions are specially formulated to cut through dirtiness without doing harm to your lenses or coatings that may be on your lenses. Spritz a moderate amount of the cleaner onto your lens and wipe it clean with your soft, clean cloth.


Do not use your saliva to clean your lenses. Saliva won't clean especially well and is unhygienic., If you don't happen to have glasses cleaner on hand, you can use a drop of dish soap and warm water to cut through grime and leave your lenses pristine.Use your fingers and carefully spread the soap over the surface of your lenses. Rinse the lenses clean of soap with warm water, and you're ready to move on.

, After applying your cleaning solution, you can take your soft cloth and wipe your lenses dry in gentle, circular motions. You should try not to use scrubbing motions, which can lead to lens damage over time., Depending on just how dirty your glasses really are, you may need another application of cleaner before you lenses become fully clean. After using your cleaner or dish soap and hot water, wipe your lenses with your soft cloth., Oil and dust can collect in the nook between your nose pads and lenses, creating a cloudy film in the area close to your nose. By using a soft bristle toothbrush, dish soap, and warm water, you can bust up this grimy buildup, though you should be careful not to scrub your lenses with the toothbrush.

To make your own lens cleaner, you will need:


Dish soap
Isopropyl alcohol (or witch hazel)
Measuring cup
Microfiber cloth
Small spray bottle
Water, You should clean your spray bottle and measuring cup before mixing your glass cleaning solution. This is because any dirt or dust left behind in these can contaminate your homemade lens cleaner. This is especially important if you are using a general purpose spray bottle that might have previously contained other household cleaners.

, Now that your measuring cup and spray bottle are clean, you should measure your water and isopropyl alcohol in a 1-to-1 ratio and add each to your spray bottle.Swirl your bottle gently to mix the solution.


For example, you may want to combine 1 ounce of water with 1 ounce of isopropyl alcohol in your spray bottle.

, Put one drop of dish soap into your mixed solution of water and isopropyl alcohol. Cap your bottle and swirl its contents gently to infuse the solution with soap.

, Spray a moderate amount of your lens cleaner onto each lens. Now you can take your clean microfiber cloth and wipe away all the gunk that has accumulated on your glasses.If you don't have a microfiber cloth intended for glasses, clean cotton should do the job."

Use a clean, soft cloth always.,
Protect your lens cloth from the elements.,
Wash your lens cleaning cloth.,
Clean your lenses regularly.,
Keep your glasses in a case when you're not wearing them.",How to Clean Cloudy Glasses3," The microfiber cloth that may have come with your glasses is ideal for cleaning your lenses, but even this can become dirty over time. Using a cloth that has dust on it will cause your lenses to develop small pits and scratches over time, creating cloudiness. To avoid this, only clean your glasses with a clean, soft cloth., The more dust and grime that is on your lens cleaning cloth, the more damage you will do to your lenses over time.

Add a small amount of liquid detergent to your washing machine. Do not use fabric softener — this remains on the cloth and can leave streaks when using it on lenses.
Set your washing machine to cold.
Insert your microfiber cloth and like-cloth items into the wash.
Air dry or use a dryer on a low/no-heat setting., Over the course of a day your glasses will normally collect dust, dirt, and oil from your face and hands. By cleaning your lenses regularly with glass cleaner or warm water and a drop of dish soap, you can cut down on the overall daily cloudiness you may experience.

, This will keep dust from settling on the glasses and protect them from harm if they are knocked over.

Know the basic face shapes.,
Look in a mirror to determine the shape of your face.,
Use a dry erase marker to outline the shape of your reflection.,
Determine if your face is angular or soft.,
Choose frames that complement the shape of your face.,
Choose a frame size that complements your face size.,
Choose a color of frame that complements you.,
Choose glasses that work for what you need.,
Be unique, even if you have to break the rules.,
Compromise.",How to Choose the Right Eyeglass Frames for Your Face," While everyone's face is different, there are seven general shapes: round, heart-shaped (base-up triangle), triangular (base down), square, rectangular, oblong and oval.


Round faces tend to have full cheeks and rounded, full forehead and chin.Celebrities with round faces include Kirsten Dunst, Chrissy Tiegen, and Leonardo DiCaprio.
The phrase ""heart-shaped face"" can be a bit misleading; a heart-shaped face is really more like an upside down triangle, with a wide forehead that narrows to a pointed chin.A heart shaped face can be long and graceful or more rounded, but both tend to have high, angled cheekbones. Celebrities with heart-shaped faces include Reese Witherspoon, Christina Ricci, Jennifer Aniston, Ryan Gosling, and Bradley Cooper.
Triangular faces tend to have narrow foreheads and a wide, strong jaw (the jaw itself is often angular). Examples of celebrities with triangular faces include Queen Latifah, Minnie Driver, Kelly Osbourne, and Chris Pine.
Square faces have strong, wide foreheads and equally strong, wide chins. They are also proportionate in the length and width of the face.Famous square faces include Olivia Wilde, Rosario Dawson, Josh Hutcherson, and Nick Lachey. Rectangular faces are very similar to square, but with a longer length than width, such as Demi Moore, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.
Oblong and oval faces are very similar as well; they are both rounded and proportional, but an oval face has a more pointed chin. Examples of celebs with oblong faces include Kim Raver, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jude Law; examples of famous oval faces include Liv Tyler, Kim Kardashian, and Adam Levine.;
, Pull or pin your hair back away from your face so that you can see your face clearly.


Many faces do not fit clearly into only one specific type but have features that resemble two or even more types. In that case, you're lucky! You will more options as you look for eyeglass frames.

, Tracing carefully around the outline of your face in the mirror, with your face relaxed, outline your forehead, down each cheek to the end of your chin. Don't include your ears.


Now, without moving your face from its outline in the mirror, do it again but with your biggest exposed-toothed smile. Put these lines directly over the lines you've already drawn.
The two sets of lines will show you if and how your facial shape changes when you smile. For instance, some people with oval faces in their relaxed state might have more heart-shaped faces when smiling broadly (such as Kim Kardashian). Others, like Jennifer Lawrence, might have a strong rectangular face when relaxed, which changes to a heart-shaped face when smiling broadly.

, In many ways, this is more important than the exact shape of your face when it comes to choosing glasses. Using the lines you've drawn on the mirror, you should be able to tell if your face has hard edges and angles, or if the lines are more curvaceous.


Many people with strong angles will have them at the temples and jaw, but a strong pointed chin is also an angular face. Rectangles, squares, hearts, and some ovals will fall into the angular category.
Round, triangular, oblong, and some ovals will fall into the more soft, curvaceous category.

, In general, frames add the most visual interest and look the least cartoonish when they are a contrast from your natural features, which means that most rounded faces look best with more angled glasses, while more angled faces look best with more rounded glasses.


Soft, round faces look best with frames that have hard angles, like square or rectangular frames. These tend to make the face look longer and break up the softness of the face.If you have a very full face, you might consider horizontal rectangles, which make the face appear thinner.
Square and rectangle faces look nice with frames that balance the hard lines of the face, so look for round or oval frames. To minimize the appearance of a very heavy jawline, look for a frame that has a thin, delicate frame (made of wire and in a color similar to your skintone) so that you don't add more bulk to your face. The glasses should be slightly wider than your cheekbones to fit the face properly.Heart-shaped faces usually look nice with frames that are wider on the bottom or have some kind of detail on the lower half of the frames. Be sure that the frames are slightly wider than the forehead for a proper fit.Triangular faces look great with glasses that emphasize the top half of the frame, like half-rimmed glasses or cat-eye glasses, or two-toned frames with darker tops and lighter bottoms. Since triangular faces tend to have strong jaws, be sure that the frames are slightly wider than your jaw to balance it out.Oblong faces look better with round or curved frames, which take away from the length of the face and emphasize the width. Pick frames with the upper and lower rims of the frame equal in shape. This breaks up the length of the face. Also, choose frames that have a low bridge, which shortens the nose.
Oval faces look great in any type of frame, so choose something that fits your personality. You can play with colors and styles to fit your mood, and you can feel confident in trying out the latest fashion or go with a classic frame to ensure it will stay in style longer., Faces come in all sizes, and glasses should sit in the right position and be the right proportion to the rest of your face in order to avoid distracting from your appearance or obstructing the rest of your face.


Just like Goldilocks, be sure your frames are neither too large nor too small but just right! Glasses that are too big for your features and for your overall face size will overwhelm your appearance and look cartoonish. Glasses that are too small can look out of date or draw attention.
The top of the frames should follow underneath the curve of the eyebrows. For the most part, most people look best if you can see their eyebrows easily above the frames; otherwise your facial expressions will be obscured., Depending on your skin, eye, and hair color, different colors of frames may look better on you and bring out your features.



Determine if you have a cool or warm tone to your skin. If you have a cool skin tone (epitomized by blue eyes, pale skin, and blue veins in the skin), a frame in a cool color will complement your coloring best. Cool colors include silver and jewel tones like amethyst, ruby, emerald, or sapphire. If you have a warm skin tone (epitomized by brown eyes, tanned skin, and green veins), then you might look best in warm colored frames. Warm colors include gold and earth tones like beige, orange, yellow, and mustard. Neutral skin tones can pull of frames in any color.

, Remember that glasses can be a great fashion accessory, but for most people they are also there to serve an incredibly important function which is to help you see. If your glasses don't serve those needs, then they don't work for you.


Begin by asking a salesperson which frames will work with your prescription (for instance, some people with very high prescriptions must choose frames that have wide frames to hold the lenses, so thin wire frames might not be an option).
Ask a salesperson to measure your head and show you which glasses will fit you and which will not. Having a good, comfortable fit will help you feel confident in your choice.

, Your sense of style and personality can really come out in your glasses, and you should not feel confined to certain shapes or colors if something else is more your style, or if your big personality is best expressed in a different shape or style.


If that means choosing big square glasses on your big square face, do it! Olivia Wilde has famously pulled off that look, and because she was confident in herself, she made those glasses look like they were made for her.
Similarly, Ginnifer Goodwin has a very round face, but paparazzi have taken pictures of her in equally round sunglasses on many occasions and she pulls them off without a hitch.
When Daniel Radcliffe made round glasses hip as the character Harry Potter in the popular movie series, his character started out as a round faced young boy and eventually grew into a more square-jawed young man. He was able to pull off the round framed glasses both ways.

, Instead of following the so-called ""rules"" about face shapes, decide what elements of the rules are important to you and what parts you are comfortable bending or breaking altogether.


For instance, if you have a round or soft-edged face, instead of avoiding round frames altogether, pay attention to the size of the glasses and avoid small, delicate round frames. Any larger frame will tend to look better on a round face, even if its a rounded frame, since small frames can get lost on a round face. Choose a bold, thick frame to help add interest.If you have a more angular face, instead of avoiding angular glasses altogether, try choosing a pair of angled glasses with a thin or delicate frame, rather than a big square pair with thick plastic. You can even choose a color like bronze or copper to help it blend with your skintone."

Sunglasses to Match Warm and Cool Skin Tones;
,
Before choosing your favorite pair of shades, you must have an idea about your skin tone.,
Sunglasses to Match Other Types of Skin Tones


Apart from warm and cool, there are a few other ways to classify our skin tones.,
For People with Fair Skin Tone – You have a naturally bright skin tone which is perfect for sporting bright and gorgeous colors.,
For People with Wheatish Skin Tone – If you are wheatish, then you are really lucky to get your eyes styled up in almost all types of sunglasses.,
For People with Peach Skin Tone – Here is another skin tone that is absolutely incredible for sunglasses lovers.,
For People with Dark Skin Tone – If you have a dark skin tone, try to stay away from deep bright hues that do not go with your complexion well.,
Therefore, follow the tips and get ready to show your style with perfect sunglasses.

",How to Choose Sunglasses That Go Well with Your Skin Tone,", Usually, we can categorize our skin tone in two ways: warm and cool. Check which type you possess by having a glimpse at the base of your arm during hours of daylight. Here is how to identify the tone of your skin and pick the best suited shades accordingly:


Warm Skin Tone: Yellow undertone with greenish veins. Those having warm skin tone should go for golden-based frames. Yellow, brown, red, ivory, orange, olive, etc. would also be good choices for you.
Cool Skin Tone: Rosy undertone with bluish veins. Sunglasses having blue-based frames are the best for people of cool skin tone. Some other hues that would work great for you are green, black, grey, pink, silver, purple, etc.

, We can just divide them into fair, wheatish, peach, dark, etc. and there is no need of checking the undertone for this purpose. It is simple to select the right pair of sunglasses depending on such classification and the following list will made your task even much easier.

, Pick some cool eye-wear designs in bright hues like red, orange, green, blue, yellow, etc. These would make you look fashionable and also appeal to the essence of your natural skin tone at the same time.

, From serious dark shades to peppy bright tints, you can go for any sort of frame or lens. We will recommend you to choose something from black, deep blue, purple, dark red, brown, etc.

, People with a peach skin tone can wear a wide range of shades. However, pastels and their varieties suit them the most. A few wonderful choices for peach-skinned people are grey, chocolate brown, beige, olive green, etc.

, Light-colored frames and lenses can boost your appearance greatly. So, you must stick to black, brown or golden sunglasses to look your best.

Think about where you will wear them.,
Consider the frame material.,
Understand the advantage of a wraparound-style.,
Factor in the fit with your other sports gear.,
Consider a floating frame.,
Pay attention to altitude.",How to Choose the Right Sunglasses for Your Sport1," If you are buying your glasses for a specific sport, such as cycling, this should be easy for you; however, if you plan to use these glasses for a variety of sports then you need to consider what demands and expectations you will place upon this product. Try to think of it in terms of percentages: I will use these glasses 50% for running, 10% for boating, and 40% for leisure.;
, Are you playing a sport where weight matters? If this is the case, then you will need to go with a lighter frame. Do you expect your glasses to fall on the ground at least once? Then you need a frame that can withstand some ‘abuse.’ Do you care about cost? If so, your frame choice may be more limited.The standard plastic frame is a cheaper option. It is a bit heavier and less aerodynamic; however, a well-made plastic frame can last for quite a while. Acetate is a plant-based frame material that mimics traditional plastic. Its layered construction creates a strong frame that is usually rather lightweight.If you are concerned about the environmental impact of your purchase, you may want to go with a castor frame, which is made from castor plants. These frames possess similar qualities to acetate ones with the added benefit of being eco-friendly.
For the ultimate in flexibility, look into a nylon or nylon-hybrid frame. These frames are designed for sport and can bend yet retain their original shape. Traditional nylon frames are also cheaper than a hybrid option.
Metal frames are not usually chosen for sports as they offer less flexibility and can potentially cause injury when broken. If you do decide to go with metal you will most likely need to choose between aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel., This type has a head-hugging design that allows for less light to penetrate inside the frame. It also tends to grip your head tighter resulting in less movement, even when participating in a sports activity.


Some sport sunglasses also have a foam insert that allows you to have extra seal/coverage for sports, offering wind protection too.Wraparound sunglasses generally have a higher ‘base curve’ meaning that they follow the angles of your face closely. Standard non-sport sunglasses generally have a shallower ‘base curve’ as they draw away from your face and let additional light in. Note that if you have a high prescription you are at greater risk of having troubles adapting to glasses with a high base curve., If you are participating in a sport that requires other head gear, such as a helmet, you need to consider how your sunglasses with work with, or against, these other items. Ideally, everything that you wear should function together to provide you with maximum safety, performance, and comfort.


For example, if you are a cyclist, your new sunglasses will need to fit well with your helmet.If you are a motorcyclist, you need sunglasses that fit under your face-shield or act as independent protection with an open-faced helmet.To ensure the proper fit, it is probably a good idea to bring your helmet or other gear with you when trying on your sunglasses. Move your head around to check for motion. Look out from all angles to check for an obstructed view.
Layers upon layers of gear can make things hot. Don’t forget to consider how much ventilation your sunglasses will provide. Some of the most protective pairs can also feel rather smothering in higher temperatures., If you are participating in a watersport, investing in a floating frame might be a very good idea. These frames are made of lightweight material and are designed to stay on the surface of water (usually for quite a while) after falling off., When you think of UV ray protection, special lenses probably come to mind; however, in snow sports, UV rays can reflect off snow and infiltrate the gaps in frames. Specialized frames designed for high-altitude sports minimize this damage by including shields on the side and over the bridge of your nose. The shields can actually improve your ability to look around without facing glare.High altitudes are another consideration for additional awareness of UV exposure as the higher you go, the thinner the atmosphere, and greater the UV exposure.

Protect your eyes from harmful rays.,
Pick a lens material.,
Familiarize yourself with the advantages of various lens colors.,
Consider mirrored lenses.,
Purchase a pair of glasses with polarized lenses.,
Wear photochromic (transition) lenses.,
Consider hydrophobic lenses.,
Purchase interchangeable lenses.",How to Choose the Right Sunglasses for Your Sport2," Look for a lens that promises to block at least 99% of UVA and UVB rays. Most sports sunglasses come with this protection, but beware of cosmetic eyewear as it may not. This protection is especially important if you plan to wear you glasses for long periods of time.Cheap sunglasses that don't protect from UVA and UVB rays ay actually be more damaging than wearing no sunglasses at all, because they actually allow more harmful rays into your eye., You have a handful of options here: glass, polycarbonate, plastic, or polyurethane. All of them possess particular advantages in terms of visual clarity, durability, and cost. You will want to try on a few different lens types before making a final decision.


Glass lenses are often less attractive to athletes because they are more likely to break or chip if dropped. They are also a bit heavier, which can be an issue in weight-class sports; however, they do provide excellent visual clarity.Plastic lenses offer a similar visual appeal as glass without some of the breakage issues; however, they do scratch easily without a resistant coating. This can be a cheaper option for athletes looking for a pair of limited use or back-up glasses.
Polycarbonate lenses are a very popular option among sports enthusiasts. They are light and impact resistant. For optimal performance, add anti-scratch and anti-reflective treatments to these lenses.
Trivex NXT (NXT Polyurethane) lenses are the top-of-the-line choice. They are almost as clear as glass without the breakage concerns. They are lightweight and include the highest-level sunglasses technology. However be prepared to pay more for these lenses., Lenses come in all the colors of the rainbow. The color that you pick should depend on the sport that you play, the weather conditions of the sport, and the performance advantages that you desire. Be aware that you may also need to try on several lens colors before you find one that you prefer.Green provides some glare and contrast reduction. It is well-suited for general use, high-altitude sports, or boating/sailing.
Yellow is a popular lens color and it improves visibility in murky, low-light conditions. It performs especially well early or late in the day. This lens is suitable for aviation, tennis, and biking.
Blues and purples are often favored for fashion reasons and they also reduce glare and elevate color differentiation. They are often worn by golfers.
Gray is a solid, generic use lens color suitable for most outdoor sports. It is easy on the eye, reducing fatigue. It also provides true color awareness and is good to wear for almost all weather conditions.
Pink and red lenses lessen eye strain and increase depth perception. They are especially suitable for severe, snowy weather conditions. Many alpine and racing athletes prefer these lens colors.

, These lenses work to reduce glare. If your sport takes place on a highly reflective surface, such as the snow or sand, mirrored lenses can minimize the negative effects. These are also useful if you want to shield your eyes from your opponent. The reflective surface gives little to no indication of your eye movements.Because this is a mirrored coating be aware that your lenses may be more susceptible to getting scratched.

, These lenses are slightly more expensive, but they combine many admirable qualities. They block additional UV rays and they reduce glare from bright surfaces, such as a snowpack. Those persons participating in racing or fishing sports often choose these types of lenses as they improve the track and water visibility., This is a lens treatment that can be applied to almost any type of base lens, i.e. polycarbonate, glass, etc. These lenses adjust to changing light conditions. They grow lighter in low light. Their pigment/shade level increases in bright light, to resemble traditional sunglasses. These are especially useful for sportspeople operating in variable light conditions.Be aware that the transition between tints is not immediate and can be a bit slow in lower temperatures., This is a great add-on for watersports. It is an extra coating applied to the lens that repels water. Water droplets will essentially slide off the lens instead of pooling on the surface.Premium anti-glare coatings also have water, oil and dust repellent properties.

, Some frames allow you to customize your lens options depending on the weather conditions, the sport, etc. This is a great, but somewhat expensive, alternative if you like to play a wide variety of sports in varying settings. Also, if one set of lenses is damaged you can simply replace it and continue on."

Keep your budget in mind.,
Read online reviews.,
Solicit recommendations from friends.,
Schedule a personalized fitting.,
Consider purchasing a warranty.",How to Choose the Right Sunglasses for Your Sport3," Know what you can reasonably spend before you start looking for sunglasses. There are frames and lenses to fit all price ranges, so this will help you to stay realistic. For example, if you can afford to spend $150 on cycling glasses, this is a realistic possibility with a bit of research., Many online magazines and blogs provide lengthy descriptions and lists of the best sports sunglasses currently available. Read personal product reviews as well on retail sites to see what consumers think about particular pairs. This research will also give a good idea as to pricing.If you are shopping for sunglasses for a particular sport, such as cycling, you may want to search “cycling sunglasses reviews” for the best results.

, If you see a fellow athlete with a nifty pair of sunglasses, ask them where they purchased their pair. Talk with your sports peers and fellow competitors about the pros and cons of various sunglasses options. You will soon find that a few particular brands/types stand out for your particular sport.


For example, you might say, “I really like your sunglasses. Where did you get them? How do they work for you?”

, If you choose to buy in-person, you can go to a nicer eyewear store and make an appointment with a specialist. They will listen to your unique eyewear needs and help to direct you to particular products. They make also tell you about various coatings that are particularly useful in sporting environments.


Once you have the sunglasses on, move your head around to see how they fit. Try to simulate the action and movements of your sport. For example, if you are a soccer player, you may be looking up and down a great deal. Make sure the glasses stay snug throughout this process.
Many eyeglass shops, especially optometry locations are able to adjust your glasses, and the optician can make adjustments to ensure that your glasses are snug and stay on your face.

, Some retailers offer warranties on higher cost pairs of sunglasses. If you play a sport where your glasses may sustain some damage, you might want to consider purchasing a warranty as an investment.

Wipe off the lens.,
Wash the lens with a cleaning solution.,
Remove particles with a blower.,
Avoid excessive cleaning.",How to Care For a Monocular1," A monocular has two lenses: the ocular lens (which you put up to your eye) and the objective lens. You should keep both clean to ensure maximum visibility. Cloth wipes are best for delicate, coated lenses, like those on a monocular. You can use a microfiber eyeglass cloth, a cotton ball, or a cotton rag.


Paper products, like tissue or toilet paper, can scratch your lens. Do not use these to clean the lenses.;
, You can make your own cleaning solution for your monoculars by mixing one part rubbing alcohol to one part water. You may also add a drop of dish detergent. Using a cotton ball or cloth, rub this solution on the lens. Mop the solution off with a damp cotton ball, and wipe it with a dry one.You do not want to rinse your monocular or else you risk getting water inside the scope. This can damage it.
Do not use window cleaning solutions as these may damage the coating on your lens., Sand, dirt, and other particles might become stuck around the lens. To help keep the lens clear, you can blow debris off using a special lens blower. These blowers are usually bulbs that release a gentle puff of air when squeezed. To help this process, you can also use a clean, soft paintbrush to wipe away the particles., Cleaning the lens too often can damage or scratch your lens. It can also wear away the coatings on the lens. To avoid this, only clean the lens when you are unable to see clearly through it. If it is not obstructing your view, you may not need to remove dust."
"
Avoid touching the lens.,
Use the strap.,
Store it in a waterproof bag.,
Leave the cap on.,
Use the monocular when you are not moving.",How to Care For a Monocular2," Fingerprints can leave smudges on the lens. Every time you touch the lens, you risk damaging it.To prevent the need for extra cleaning, keep your fingers off the lens.

, Most monoculars have either a neck or wrist strap. If you are using your monocular during an activity such as kayaking, hiking, or hunting, you should secure the strap to your body. This will prevent your monocular from dropping and breaking.

, If you have a non-waterproof monocular, you can still take it out near the water if you are careful. Protect your monocular by keeping it in a sealed ziplock bag or dry bag while it is not in use., If your monocular came with a cap, you should make sure that it is capped while you are not looking through it. Even if you have a strap securing your monocular, a cap can prevent damage from wind, sand, dirt, and water.

, When you are looking through your monocular, you should be sitting or standing still. Do not use it while walking, paddling, or driving. Not only might you collide into another object, damaging your monocular, but you may also end up injuring yourself. This is particularly true while focusing or adjusting your monocular.

"

Wipe the monocular dry.,
Remove salt deposits from the lens.,
Place the monocular in its case.",How to Care For a Monocular3," If your monocular does become wet, you may be able to dry it off. After use, gently wipe the monocular down using a dry cloth or rag. Be careful around the lenses; you may want to use a cotton ball for these. Afterwards, let it sit out in a dry place until it has completely dried. Only once it is dry should you return it to its case.If water gets inside the monocular, it may fog up during use, particularly if you are in a warm place. Air out your monocular in a dry area for a few days. This may solve the problem. Water inside the monocular may cause dirt to interfere with the optics or encourage the growth of fungus, which can block your lens. If this happens, you will need to replace your monocular., If you have taken your monocular out on the ocean, your lens might be coated with brine or salt. This can cause blurriness in your lens, and it may scratch the coating.It is best to remove the salt before you put your monocular away. To remove salt deposits, dampen a cotton ball, and squeeze out the excess water. Gently rub the salt off the lens. Wipe it dry with a clean cotton ball.Make sure it is completely dry before you put it in its case.

, When the monocular is not in use, you should place it in a case. If your monocular came with a cap, make sure that it is secured on the monocular. Put the case in a dry area that is free from dust.Sometimes monoculars come in storage bags instead of cases. You can still store it safely in the bag, but make sure that the bag is closed when you store it so that dust does not enter it.

Try on different colors.,
Consider photochromic lenses.,
Go for medium darkness.,
Invest in several pairs.",How to Choose the Right Sunglass Lens Color1," You might find that certain colors are more comfortable for your vision than others. While shopping for new sunglasses, you should try on pairs with various lens colors. Many opticians and sunglass stores will carry lenses in various shades that you can try on. You may find that there are certain differences between these colors, such as:


Gray, brown, and green lenses are neutral. They decrease glare and eyestrain without distorting colors.
Yellow, amber, and orange lenses increase contrast, but they may distort color. They also block out blue light, which some believe may be harmful for the eyes.
Red or rose tinted glasses increase contrast, but they distort color more strongly than other shades.;
, Photochromic lenses are those that change colors based on how much light they are absorbing. These glasses can adjust from bright conditions to dim ones, although they do take a few minutes to adjust. They are also more expensive than a normal pair of prescription glasses, although they eliminate the need for a separate pair of sunglasses.If you wear prescription glasses, you might consider investing in a pair so that you do not have to switch between glasses in middle of activities such as driving.Typically, photochromic glasses will darken into neutral colors such as gray.

, You should aim for a tint that is about medium darkness; if you can see your eyes when looking in a mirror, they may not be dark enough.You do not need to buy the darkest lenses unless you live in a very bright area. Darker lenses do not necessarily block more UV rays, but they may make it more difficult for you to see. It is important that you get glasses you can see clearly in., If you need different types of colors for different activities, you might consider buying a few pairs of glasses in different shades. You might have one pair for driving and another for sports. If you play several sports, you might find that you have a different pair for each activity."
"
Think about when you use sunglasses.,
Factor in your local weather.,
Match your sunglasses to your sport.,
Ask your doctor for advice.",How to Choose the Right Sunglass Lens Color2," The type of activity you’re doing may determine the right color of sunglasses for you. Consider when you wear your sunglasses most. While every shade of sunglasses will protect your eyes from UV rays and help you see during bright days, certain colors may improve the efficiency of certain tasks.


For driving, gray and brown work best to block out colors. Yellow and amber are not recommended because they may distort the color of traffic signals.For pilots, gray, green-gray, or brown lenses are recommended.If you need glasses for boating or fishing, try wearing pink or rose-tinted glasses., Think about the climate where you live. Different colors or shades will be more effective in different types of weather. If you live in a tropical area, you might want a color that is better for bright sunny days. If you live in the north, you might find that you need a good pair of sunglasses for snowy weather.


Brown, amber, and gray are great for sunny or overcast days.
Greens are good for most weather conditions, including rain.
Yellows are great for foggy or hazy conditions, including heavy air pollution.
Reds, pinks, blues, and purples are good for snowy and misty conditions., Certain colors may give you an edge if you play sports. Finding the right color lens for your sport can help filter out obtrusive colors and help you notice minute details. Some good options include:



Tennis: gray, brown, or yellow are best.Golfing: yellow, amber, and brown are good for general games. Red and rose may be good for the putting green but not on the fairway.Skiing: amber, yellow, or orange are are generally recommended.Rose colored lenses may help in low-light conditions..

Running: Brown, yellow, or rose are good options, although neutral colors such as gray and green work well too.Baseball: amber, brown, or green are recommended., If you have any eye conditions—such as glaucoma or cataracts—, you should speak to your doctor about what color lens is right for you. You may be advised to find a neutral lens that will block out harmful UV rays without distorting color very much, or you might be recommended a yellow or amber lens to improve your contrast.


For glaucoma, mirror coatings can be helpful. These are shiny outer coatings that reduce glare but do not distort colors. They come in almost every color, but unlike normal lenses, the color of the mirror coating has no effect on your vision.If you have macular degeneration, amber lenses may help while outdoors. While driving, you should stick with gray lenses, however."
"
Consider your complexion.,
Stay classic with a neutral tone.,
Add some flash with a mirror-coated lens.,
Try soft, pastel lenses.",How to Choose the Right Sunglass Lens Color3," If you have a cool complexion, you will want a different color lens than someone who has a warm complexion. Determine your skin tone. If you have pink or blue undertones, you have a cool complexion. If you have yellow undertones, you have a warm complexion.


Cool complexions might want to choose blue, purple, rose, gray, or green tinted lenses.
Warm complexions may want to choose red, yellow, brown, amber, or orange colored lenses., If you want a vintage or classic look, you should stick to neutral tones such as brown, gray, dark gray, or green. These colors do not go out of style, and they draw the attention to the shape of your glasses instead of to the tint., A mirror-coated lens has a shiny outer layer that gives your sunglasses a polished gleam. Mirror coatings can reduce glare without distorting any color. You can choose almost any color for your mirror-coating without it affecting your vision. Some even come in multiple colors.You can buy glasses with mirror coating already applied or you can ask your optician to fit your frames with mirror-coated lenses.

, If you do not like how dark sunglasses are, pastel lenses are another option. These stylish lighter shades may not block out much light, but they will give you a cool, summery look.Lighter shades can still block out UV rays so look for a pair that is labeled as providing 100% UV protection.Some shades that you might consider are:


Light orange
Rose
Lavender
Soft blue
Light gray

Choose Transitions Drivewear to meet your driving needs.",How to Buy Transition Glasses," As with all medical fields, you will have to provide a medical history review before you begin your eye exam highlighted with questions about any vision problems that you have.Several factors determine the frequency of eye exams such as age, health, and risk of eye problems. If you fear any problems with your eyes get them checked immediately to prevent any further damage.If you have children under the age of three, your pediatrician will exam for the common problems of lazy eye and crossed eyes. Children should get their first comprehensive exam at six months, then again at three years of age or as recommended.
If your child has no eye issues and there is no preexisting history, then have their eyes checked thoroughly by the first grade. If your child’s vision remains healthy get an eye exam once every two years.
Adults in their twenties and thirties with no eye problems should get an eye exam every two years. Have your eyes check more frequently if you wear glasses, have a risk of eye diseases such as diabetes, or have a family history of eye problems.;
, Visual acuity determines if you need prescription eyewear. You will have to identify letters of the alphabet on the Snellen chart or a screen located at twenty feet in front of you to determine if you need glasses or not (hence the assessment of 20/20 vision — you can see perfectly with both eyes at a distance of twenty feet).The familiar chart has lines running horizontal with letters of the alphabet. As you move down the chart the letters get smaller.
Each eye is tested separately. 20/20 vision does not mean you have perfect eyesight, only that you can see acutely from a distance of twenty feet.
If you are unable to clearly see objects close to you it is called hyperopia or farsightedness. The opposite, myopia or nearsightedness means you cannot clearly see objects far away.

, The optometrist may dilate your pupils in order to screen for glaucoma, macular degeneration and other diseases of the retina. Glaucoma is difficult to detect so you should always get your intraocular pressure (Tonometry), or the fluid pressure inside your eyes, examined at the optometrist’s office.After receiving eyedrops, your doctor might perform an applanation tonometry test to measure the amount of force needed to briefly flatten a portion of your cornea.
Or, a non-contact tonometry test could be given. The optometrist will puff air into your eye to measure pressure.
In either case, if your eye pressure is higher than average or your optic nerve does not appear normal, your optometrist might need to perform a pachymetry test that uses sound waves to measure the thickness of your cornea.

, Numerous other minor tests might be given to check the overall health of your eyes if some problem was detected during the other routine tests.An eye muscle test will examine the muscles that control eye movement. Here, the doctor will look for poor eye control or coordination. Typically a pen or small light is used and your eyes must follow the motion of the moving object.
A refraction assessment uses light waves that should bend as they pass through your cornea and lens. If the rays do not focus neatly on the backside of your eye, you might have a “refractive error” that will require corrective glasses or lenses.
Checking your peripheral field of vision is conducted by looking forward without moving your eyes and determining how far to each side you can detect movement. This will determine your overall field of vision. You often take this test for your driver’s license.
Retinal examinations evaluate the functionality of your retina, optic disk, and underlying layer of blood vessels.

, After all of the testing, you will sit down with your doctor to get the results and have an opportunity to ask questions about your eye health.If you need corrective lenses, this would be the time to ask your optometrist about the benefits of purchasing Transitions lenses.

, Of all five senses, eyesight is the sense that you depend upon the most. Despite this, few people insure their eyes or get eye exams, almost taking their sight for granted.One of the greatest adversaries to your eyes is the sun. With dangerous UV rays, glare, and carcinomas, the sun damages the eyes considerably over time.
Carcinomas of the eyelids, like squamous and basal cell, spread rapidly and are typically found in people who have a history of sun exposure. Melanomas are linked to intense, intermittent sun exposure and if not treated promptly can prove lethal.
Transitions lenses adapt to the sun’s brightness and protect the eyes from potentially fatal damage by darkening the lenses of your glasses.

, Constant adjustment to changing light can cause eyestrain and fatigue. Your lenses have to filter all the sunlight that comes into contact with your eyes making them work hard and wears them down quickly.Although eyestrain by itself does not have long-term consequences, it can severely aggravate your eyes making you tired and reducing your ability to concentrate.
Transitions lenses protect your eyes allowing them to stay relaxed and comfortable throughout the day.

, Glare and squinting are related but glare is far more dangerous, especially if you are driving or walking along a road. Glare, caused by excessive sunlight, forces you to either squint or look away because it is blinding. Without proper protection, this distraction can cause a serious accident.Good vision is important to safe driving. Driving without protection against glare — from the road, snow, or other cars — is a treacherous proposition. Make sure you use the sun visor, keep your windshield clean, rest your eyes from squinting, and look into Transitions Drivewear sunglasses, which cuts glare considerably.
Drivewear lenses rapidly adapt to glare while you are driving your car making them the perfect answer for driving safely. Most windshields are treated with UV protection, so most normal Transitions lenses may be less effective behind the wheel (as they respond to UV light, which will already be filtered by the windshield). Drivewear, however, uses ambient light and will get darker depending on light conditions., The earlier you begin to protect your eyes against the sun the better. In other words, it is never too early to protect your vision. Children are even more susceptible to the harmful effect of UV radiation than adults. Children under the age of ten have a greater chance of getting photokeratitis, which is sunburn of the eye, and UV-related retina problems because their eyes are not as efficient at filtering UV rays as adults' eyes.Without proper eye protection, your child could suffer red eyes due to sunburn, non-stop tearing, burning or itchy eyes, or severe eye pain and spasms.
Transitions eyewear blocks 100% of UV radiation, providing safety for your children’s eyes.

, Transitions lenses are made for nearly all types of glasses (prescription and nonprescription) and brand names. There are different types of lenses for age, sports, and lifestyle. They can be worn everyday inside or out.Transitions lenses are designed to fit a wide range of frames, styles, sizes, and prescriptions. You can use them in Bell, Callaway, Nike, and Oakley sunglasses if you prefer designer brand names.
Whether you work inside or outside, Transitions lenses can go from dark to darker depending on the amount of sunlight and are available in helmet shields, which can go from clear to dark depending on the intensity of the UV light.
Transitions lenses utilize photochromic technology to shield your eyes from the sun and are available for all ages.

, These lenses are best used if you move regularly from indoors to outdoors and need your prescription glasses to quickly transition from light to dark or the opposite.Best suited for outdoor comfort with full clarity indoors.
Good for reducing glare, eye fatigue, and eyestrain, helping your eyes to relax and provide effortless clear vision.

, These lenses provide darker everyday adaptive lenses while maintaining a comfortable dark shade indoors. Since these lenses provide superior darkness, they are best for outdoor activities. They will tint behind a windshield.Best suited for prescription lenses that provide comfort for people who are sensitive to light and enjoy outdoor activities.
These lenses respond well to light behind windshields while driving.
If you work or live in an environment with harsh lighting, the light indoor tint will provide protection as well.

, These lenses will darken and polarize immediately upon UV light exposure by adapting to changing light. Water, glass, and glare will appear more transparent providing both eye and health safety, even in the most intense sunlight.These lenses can start out completely clear and non-polarized indoors and transition to polarized, dark lenses once outside.
The polarized effect in these lenses allow for crisper vision and enhanced contrast and sharpness.
If the majority of your time is spent outdoors, then these lenses will provide the most protection.

, These are effective in blocking glare in any outdoor condition or situation. They have a unique ability to adapt to the ideal shade of darkness in response to daylight conditions, even behind the windshield of your car.It is recommended by the manufacturer that because of this innovative technology, these lenses should only be worn during daylight hours and taken off at night for your own safety.

Avoid geometric, square frames that may accentuate the sharp angles of your face. Also avoid color accents on the bottom of the frame, since these may draw unwanted attention to your chin.





;
, Most other frames flatter this face shape fairly well, however.


Avoid frames that are excessively large.







, These help create the illusion of a shorter face. Also consider broad glasses with accented top rims and decorative details at the temple, since these features add width.


Avoid small, short frames that look out of proportion.







, Horizontal shapes and rectangles are especially useful in making your face look thinner. Also consider frames with temples that connect at the top of the frame to help create the illusion of face length.

Create a professional, business-oriented look by selecting conservative shapes like ovals and rectangles.

,
Add to the professional look by sticking with traditional colors.,
Show off your creativity or youthful style with funky designs and visual detail.,
Consider a less traditional color, like blue or green, for a fresh, youthful appearance.,
Use your eyeglasses to show that you are young at heart, if not in age, by selecting frame shapes that subtly uplift the face.",How to Choose Eye Glasses2,", For men, consider silver, gunmetal, brown or black frames.

Examine your skin tone.,
Consider your eye color.,
Look at your hair color.,
Average your three tones together to determine your overall coloring.,
Search for frame colors that coordinate well with your natural coloring.",How to Choose Eye Glasses3," Individuals with pink or blue undertones have “cool” toned skin, while individuals with yellow or peach undertones have “warm” toned skin. Olive skin falls between warm and cool, since it is a mix of both yellow and blue undertones.

, Determining the warmth or coolness of your eye color can get tricky, since the spectrum of possible eye colors covers such a wide range.


If you have blue eyes, determine how close they are to pale blue-gray. Most blue eyes are considered cool, but the closer they are to gray, the warmer they get. Another option is to go with a peach or orange color which will make your eye color pop.
If you have brown eyes, determine how close they are to black. Most brown eyes are considered warm, but extremely dark browns often qualify as cool toned.
If you have green eyes, determine whether your eyes are blue-green or yellow-green. Blue-green shades are cool toned, while yellow-green shades are warm.

, Cool tones include strawberry blond, platinum, blue-black, white, auburn, salt-and-pepper, and ash brown. Warm tones include golden blond, brownish black, brown-gold, carrot, or dusty gray.

, If you have more warm tones, then you likely have warm coloring. If you have more cold tones, you likely have cool coloring.

,


Think gold, copper, camel, khaki, peach, orange, coral, off-white, fire-engine red, and blond tortoise if you have warm coloring.
Lean toward silver, black, rose-brown, blue-gray, plum, magenta, pink, jade, blue, and dark tortoise if you have cool coloring.

Get an eye exam.,
Shop at inexpensive stores that either specialize in eyeglasses or that have an eyeglasses section if you need emergency lenses because an old pair broke or got lost.

,
Consider going to an optometrist or boutique if investing in a quality pair.,
If you have a weak prescription but still want glasses, try shopping online for them.",How to Choose Eye Glasses4," Before you invest in a pair of eyeglasses, you must have an accurate prescription for your lenses.

,, These options usually cost a little more, but the quality of service and product may be worth the price.

, Many of the inexpensive eyeglass sellers don’t carry glasses weaker than +/- 1.0. If you have a +/- 0.5 prescription and you don’t want to pay a high price for your glasses, you’ll find many options online.

"
Only buy what you need.,
Shy away from brand names if your budget is low and you don’t need to get the latest styles.

,
Look for coupons.,
Check with your medical insurance.",How to Choose Eye Glasses5," Lenses come with a number of added features, such as scratch-resistant coatings and color-changing features meant to offer ultraviolet protection. While many of these features do effectively provide what they offer, they are also largely unnecessary. If you have a tight budget, skip the extras and stick with a basic prescription lens.

,, If you purchase your eyeglasses from a department store or popular eyeglasses chain store, you may be able to find coupons in magazines or online.

, Many carriers cover a portion of the cost for eyeglasses if you buy them at specific places. Depending on your coverage, you could have more or less choice available to you.

Determine your needs.,
Decide how often you will wear augmented reality glasses.,
Decide your budget.,
Research the options.",How to Choose a Pair of Smartglasses," Decide whether you simply want social integration, want to design or want to view immersive video. Depending on what you're looking for, the options and styles will vary.
, Some are designed to be worn frequently, and therefore won't obstruct your view; others are designed specifically for gaming or other virtual reality activities, but can't easily be worn outside of those settings., The more bells and whistles your smart glasses come with, the more expensive they will be., There are a few different kinds of smart glasses:

Augmented Reality glasses usually consist of a processor, display, lens(s) and frame. Information is then provided in supplement to what the wearer is seeing. These glasses project information into the line of sight of the wearer without fully-obstructing vision. 3D optical head-mounted displays (OHMD) are optical head-mounted displays in which computer powered glasses present information and graphics in a holographic, 3D display. These glasses are designed for artists, engineers and designers and not intended for daily use like standard augmented reality glasses.
Head-mounted video displays (HMVD) are glasses that fully obstruct vision and are designed for immersive video and gaming experiences. Often equipped with gyroscopes and accelerometers these glasses are designed to immerse the user in 3D world. These glasses are designed primarily for entertainment as opposed to design or supplemented reality.

Pick polycarbonate or Trivex lenses.,
Decide between plastic and metal frames.,
Keep in mind the overall look.",How to Buy Glasses for Kids1," Ideally, children's lenses should be made of polycarbonate or Trivex. These materials are are less prone to damage from being dropped. They're also safer, since they’re less likely to shatter. Since they’re lightweight, they are great for strong prescriptions and make thick lenses more comfortable for kids.Generally, stronger prescriptions mean thicker lenses. Choosing smaller frames typically reduces the thickness of the lenses, making them more wearable and reducing blurriness in your child’s peripheral vision field.
Polycarbonate and Trivex lenses protect against potentially harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays.
Untreated polycarbonate lenses scratch easily, so make sure the lenses are specially coated by the factory to reduce scratching.
Glass lenses are rarely available for kids, and should not be selected for children's glasses. Not only is glass heavier, it is also a hazard since it can break easily. The sharp pieces of a broken glass lens can damage the eye.;
, Since they’re durable, less expensive, and lightweight, plastic frames are often considered more suitable for children; however, manufacturers are producing more and more metal frame options that are just as affordable and hardy. Sometimes, kids also enjoy the more mature look that metal offers, and some will opt for frames similar to their parents’ in order to look more like an adult.Other frame designs include flexible hinges or a memory metal which will bounce back to its original shape if bent or twisted. These can be especially good frames for kids who may not be as careful with their glasses.If your child has ever shown evidence of being allergic or sensitive to nickel or other metals, ask their optometrist about hypoallergenic materials.

, Considering fashion can be especially important when choosing materials and frame sizes for kids. Whether they have to wear their glasses at all times or only for certain activities, many kids get teased about their glasses. Function should take priority over fashion, but make sure your child is involved in the selection process.Extra cool features, such as photochromic lenses that darken automatically in the outdoors, might make your child want to regularly wear their glasses. There is an added benefit to these lenses, which is that they reduce exposure to harmful UV rays that can lead to cataracts or some cancers later in life.Don't go too far for coolness, however. Steer your kids away from frames that are too expensive, as kids are apt to break or lose their glasses.

Get the bridge fit right.,
Consider temple styles.,
Invest in spring hinges.",How to Buy Glasses for Kids2," Since kids' faces and noses are still growing, it's often difficult to choose glasses with the right bridge fit. If the bridge doesn’t fit properly, the glasses will keep sliding down your child’s nose. Metal frames usually have adjustable nose pads that allow easy fitting with growing noses.Kids are likely to just look over the frame instead of pushing them back up into place. This is bad for their vision, especially since the way their brains process sight is still developing.
Your child’s eyes should be centered vertically and horizontally within the lenses to reduce distortions or the risk of developing other vision problems, so it’s important they sit on the nose securely., The most secure temple style for younger kids wraps all the way around the back of the ear and keeps the glasses from sliding down or completely dropping off a child's face. Typically called cable temples, they are great for babies, toddlers, and young children who are required to wear glasses at all times.If your child doesn’t have to wear glasses at all times, cable temples aren’t ideal since they’re a bit more awkward to put on and take off.
If you opt for a more conventional temple style, ensure the earpieces don’t hang too far down past the ear. Your child should be able to sit back comfortably against a headrest without it bumping and shifting the glasses out of place.An optician can help adjust the glasses after they are made to help make sure that the frames fit well.

, Since children can sometimes be careless or rough with their glasses, spring hinges can help avoid the need for replacing or fixing damaged eyewear. They allow the earpieces to flex away from the lens frames, avoiding damage or breaks. Although they are usually a bit more expensive, they can be a great investment in the long run.Spring hinges are particularly recommended for toddlers and youngsters who are likely to play with their glasses more or mishandle them.

Shop around.,
Look for warranties.,
Keep a backup pair.",How to Buy Glasses for Kids3," You don’t have to buy expensive eyewear at the optometrist’s office. They are required to give you a prescription, and you can use that prescription to shop around and find a better deal;however, don’t buy eyeglasses for your child without a prescription, and make sure the product you do buy matches their needs precisely.


Be wary of ordering kid’s glasses online, as online purchases are less likely to correctly match your child’s prescription and are typically less impact-resistant, making them less durable., Ask retailers about any warranty plans they have available. Look for plans that allow you to replace glasses for no additional charge or for as little cost as possible. Warranties are especially valuable for younger children and for those wearing glasses for the first time. When looking for a warranty, keep the following in mind:


Check to see how much it costs for replacements with and without a warranty plan. If it costs more to replace one lens than to get the warranty plan, it's worth getting the warranty.
Make sure the warranty covers replacements if lenses get scratched from normal wear and tear. It is common for a scratch coating and non-glare treatments to come with replacement warranties.

, It’s smart to purchase an extra pair for your child, especially if they play a sport or might be likely to play rough. Having a backup is particularly important if your child has a strong prescription and needs to wear glasses at all times. In addition, you might be able to land a discount if you purchase both the pairs together.Consider getting a pair of prescription lens sports goggles that are designated for rough play and activities.
If your child's prescription has not changed significantly, use the previous pair of glasses as a back-up.
You can also ask your child’s eye doctor if you can have an old pair tinted so they can be worn as sunglasses.

Order your frames online.,
Consider your family history.,
Consider your vision.,
Consult an optometrist.",How to Buy Glasses That Fit," To order glasses that fit from an optometrist, you’ll need to have an up-to-date eye examination on file with their office. This usually means an exam that was performed within the last year. If you haven't had an exam in the last 12 months, you’ll need to schedule one.Prepare for an eye exam by scheduling it with your eye doctor.
The professional opticians will measure you for your glasses while you are in the office for your examination.
The eye exam will also include questions about your medical history, measuring your visual activity, measuring pressure in your eyes, and a check regarding the overall health of your eyes — usually involving the use of lights so the doctor can look inside your eyes.;
, Different face shapes work better for different frame shapes. Think about the shape of your face — is it oval, round, square, or heart-shaped? This will help guide you toward the right frame shape for you.For example, oval faces work well with frames that are slightly wider than the widest part of the face or with walnut shaped frames.Square faces work the best with narrow frames that have more width than depth.
A round shaped face looks best with narrow, angular frames that help lengthen the face. Rectangular frames also will provide balance for round faces.
Heart-shaped faces should be paired with wider frames that have detailing on the lower half. Lighter colors are also usually best for frames.
There are tools online that can help you choose frames based on the shape of your face. Try this one from Frames Direct: http://www.framesdirect.com/landing/a/face-shape-guide.html?affiliate=73


, One of the perks of buying glasses from an optometrist rather than online is that you can actually try on the glasses and see how they look on your own face before you purchase them. Spend some time browsing the various shapes and styles in the store.


Another perk is that the optician can accurately measure the distance between your eyes, which is an important measurement to get ideal vision with your glasses.Ask the optician for advice if you are having trouble deciding. They are trained in how glasses should fit and feel (like being able to see at least some of your eyebrows over the tops of the frames).In addition, they can help you to choose a lens, such as transitions or polycarbonate, according to your needs.

, When your glasses arrive at your optometrist’s office, they will call you in to come pick them up. While you are in the office, the opticians will make sure that your new glasses are fitted perfectly for your specific measurements. They are trained professionals and know how to make little tweaks and adjustments to ensure a perfect fit.When considering the fit, you should make sure the glasses don’t slip off of your face when you look down. They also should not press too tightly behind your ears.
If at any time you feel like the fit is wrong, you can return to your optometrist’s office for adjustments. Most optometrists offer free fitting adjustments while the glasses are in their warranty period — usually this lasts for one year.

, If you want to order glasses that fit from an online boutique or manufacturer, you’ll need to know your exact prescription for the lenses. You wouldn’t want to order a pair of glasses that you can’t see out of because you didn’t know your correct prescription.If you haven’t had glasses before, you should go to an optometrist and have a full eye examination so that they can tell you what your prescription is. If you have been to the eye doctor recently, just call them up and ask them for a copy of your prescription.
Specific glasses prescriptions are usually good for about one year. After that, you may want to consider having your eyes re-examined so that you’re able to order glasses with the correct prescription.

, For glasses to fit perfectly, you’ll need to know what your frame size is. You can find these measurements on your existing glasses (if you like the way they fit) or go in and get measured at a store that sells glasses. On your existing glasses, these measurement numbers can be found either on the temple part of the arms of the glasses or on the bridge that runs across the nose piece. The important measurements (in millimeters) include:Lens size. This is a two-digit number ranging from 40 – 62.

Bridge size. This is a two-digit number ranging from 14 – 24.

Temple size. This is a three-digit number ranging from 120 – 150.

, If you don’t have any current glasses to find your frame size, or if you can’t afford to get measured at the optometrist, you can try to guesstimate what size frames you’ll actually need. You can use these measurements as a basis for your estimate. These figures are starting points for total width, which includes the lens width (multiplied by two) added with the bridge width – this equals the full width of the frames across your face:Small/Narrow face: 125mm – 129mm

Medium face: 130mm – 134mm

Large face: 135mm – 139mm

Wide face: 140mm – 145mm

, Find a reputable manufacturer or glasses boutique that you want to order from. Spend some time looking around to choose the frames that you want. To make sure you like the style, you can go to an actual brick-and-mortar store and try on similar styles before you place your online order.
Some online optical providers also offer tools that allow you to upload a photo of yourself which they overlay the glasses on so you can virtually see what they would look like on you.

, Poor eyesight is typically genetic. So if both of your parents wear glasses, it is reasonable to assume you’ll need them eventually too. Keep this in mind as you consider whether or not you need glasses.Ask your family members how old they were when they first started wearing glasses.

, Think about whether or not your vision seems to have changed over the years. Do you have more trouble viewing specific things than you did in the past? This is a sign that you need glasses.Specifically consider whether you have trouble viewing things that are far away or that are up close, as these are the two biggest problems with eyesight that people typically have.

, The ultimate way to determine whether or not you need glasses is to get an official eye examination from a licensed optometrist. They will perform tests on your vision and on your eyes in general to determine if glasses are a necessity for you.An optometrist, in addition to whether or not you need glasses, will also be able to tell you if there are any medical problems with your eyes.

Evaluate your desired application.,
Ensure that the safety glasses fit properly and comfortably.,
Make sure that the safety glasses do not restrict vision or movement.,
Check the safety glasses for compatibility with any other personal protective equipment.,
Determine how easily the safety glasses can be cleaned.",How to Buy Safety Glasses," The type of safety glasses required will differ based on your application. In a chemistry lab, for example, goggle-style glasses should be worn that fit snugly against the wearer's face and secure with a strap. This style provides complete protection from spilled or splashed liquids that may be hazardous. Athletes should look for safety glasses that are secured tightly with a strap. For general construction use, standard plastic safety glasses can be purchased inexpensively at hardware stores.


Some applications will require a highly specialized type of safety glasses. Welders should wear full welding shields that provide face protection from sparks and have filtered lenses to protect eyes from intense radiant light. Technicians working with lasers will also need filtered lenses to protect from intense light.;
, The safety glasses should not become easily dislodged when performing routine work tasks; they should not have to be adjusted often. Long-term comfort is an absolutely essential characteristic. Workers wearing uncomfortable safety glasses will be more likely to take them off periodically or avoid wearing them altogether. Ensuring a comfortable fit is especially important if you are buying the glasses for your employees for whom you are responsible.

, Safety glasses with inconveniently placed frames or easily smudged lenses may restrict vision. This will prevent the wearer from properly executing their work and avoiding hazards, and may lead them to remove their glasses.

, The position and shape of the safety glasses should not interfere with the functioning of any other PPE, such as hardhats, earplugs, or respirators. All of your PPE should fit comfortably when worn together.

, Safety glasses that smudge or dirty easily will be less useful and pose more of a hazard to the wearer. Before purchasing safety glasses, smudge them with your fingers and clean the smudges away. They should clean away easily with a small amount of rubbing.

Choose a scarf that matches your skin tone.,
Pair your scarf with a season or style.,
Keep your accessories simple.,
Decide which colors and fabrics go well with a particular scarf.,
Consider popular ways that people wear silk scarves.,
Consider finding a square scarf.",How to Wear a Silk Scarf1," Like any clothing, make sure that your scarf matches your skin tone. For example: match cool blues with cool skin tones, and warmer reds with a warm skin tone.


You can tell whether you have a warm or cool skin tone by matching jewelry to your skin. Silver goes better with a cool tone, and gold goes better with warm.
If the scarf matches silver better, it's a cool tone. If it matches gold, it's warm.;
, Find a scarf that fits the mood of the season, or find a scarf that highlights the style you're trying to pull off.


If the scarf is warm-toned and brightly-colored, pair it with white and summer-styled pieces.
If the scarf is dark and black try to wear it with edgy outfits.
If a scarf is earthy or golden in tone, go with an autumn theme look.

, If you are wearing a silk scarf, try not to pair it with a loud hat or necklace. When you're wearing the scarf, you're already wearing a big accessory. Try something more subtle, like sunglasses or a headband, instead.

, Don't mix loud patterns (flannel, paisley, clashing silk fabric, etc.) with the silk scarf. Printed scarves are great, but try to avoid wearing shirts with prints that might clash with your scarf. Try to wear clothing that complements the scarf and your mood:


If it is a white scarf, do not wear a white V-Neck. If you aim to add color and contrast to your outfit, this may defeat the purpose of wearing the scarf.
If you feel lazy, wear a neutral color such as beige or black.
If you feel springy, wear a bright pink or blue cotton V-Neck to project your mood.

, Look around you for inspiration. Some styles are best suited to summer, and others to winter. Try these tips:


Knot it round the neck, loosen it up a little, and tuck it into a high-neck jumper for a fashion-forward undone look.
Use the scarf as a cover-up for your bathing suit around the pool or beach.
Pair the scarf with a leather jacket. Tie the scarf around your neck, then put on the jacket so that the scarf is peeking out of the top.
Use a silk scarf when you're wearing a skirt. Pair it with a solid-colored long-sleeve top. Wear it with nude-colored high heels to make you look elegant.

, While scarves come in multiple lengths and shapes, the shape of the square silk scarf is the most versatile.

, First, twist a square scarf into a straight fold or bias band fold. Let the scarf hang around your neck equally on each shoulder. Take one end (A) and bring it towards the other (B). Let A pass under B. Bring A upwards to make a knot. Finally, adjust both the ends so that they hang equally downwards.

, Fold the scarf into a triangle. Hold the two ends of the folded side, then wrap around the neck. Bring them forward from the opposite sides and tie a knot. Take one layer of the scarf beneath and toss it over the knot. Adjust a little to make the scarf even, and your neck wrap is all organized!

, Fold the square scarf according to triangle fold or bias band fold and let it hang around your neck equally on each side. Cross over both the sides. Give the sides another cross. Bring both the ends towards the back of the neck. Pass one end through the other as shown to tie a simple knot.

, Fold a square scarf in half into the shape of a triangle. Take the broader end (A) and start rolling it towards the narrower end (B). Roll A halfway through the scarf. Take the scarf and hang it over your shoulders. Tie a simple knot to complete the look.

, Begin with a square scarf folded into a straight fold. Let the folded scarf dangle around your neck. Cross both ends over each other and let one end (A) pass from under the other (B) to form a kind of loop. Take A again and let it pass through the knot as illustrated to form the stylish knot.

Pick a color that matches your shirt.,
Pair complex designs with simple ones.,
Create exciting contrasts of texture.,
Experiment with tight and loose ties.,
Avoid uniform, ""samey"" outfits.",How to Wear a Scarf With a T Shirt1," Pairing colors that complement each other and avoiding colors that clash is an essential part of putting together an outfit. When you're working with scarves and T-shirts, there are just a few basic color rules that you may want to keep in mind. See below:When in doubt, use a color wheel.Shades that are directly across from each other on the wheel are complementary — that is, they look good together.
Almost anything looks good paired with a neutral color. These include white, black, grey, and some shades of brown and tan.
You can also pick a patterned scarf that incorporate the shirt color somewhere in the pattern. Sharing a color with your shirt makes your scarf look like it was meant to go with it.;
, If you have a scarf with an intricate pattern, wear it with a simple, one-color shirt. Alternatively, if your shirt has a complex graphic or pattern you want to show off, wear it with a simple scarf. Balancing areas of simplicity and complexity ensures your outfit is never ""too much"" to look at.A good policy is to start with a solid color shirt and make this your base. Your base shirt can be long or short sleeved and can have whatever neckline you like since the scarf will most likely be covering the neckline. Pair this base with a patterned scarf that uses the same color, a complementary color or mostly neutral colors.

, Color and complexity aren't the only factors in play when you're making your outfit. Different shirt and scarf fabrics have different visual textures based on the material and the size of the stitching. Pair textures together to create areas of visual contrast so that your scarf stands out from the fabric around it.


For instance, if you're wearing a cotton T-shirt, you might want to pair it with a thick wool scarf with large stitching so that it contrasts with the shirt. You probably wouldn't want to pair it with a scarf made from material that's similar to the T-shirt.

, The way you wear your scarf around your neck can affect how your overall outfit looks. Wearing a scarf loosely draped around your neck tends to direct the eye downwards — a good choice if you're wearing pants or a belt that you'd like to attract attention to. On the other hand, tighter ties that position the scarf around the neck attract attention to your face by isolating it from the rest of your body.


In the section below, you'll learn a few basic ways to tie your scarf that you may want to try out.

, This is the main faux pas that you'll want to avoid when pairing a scarf with a T-shirt. Scarves that are the same color or texture as your T-shirt are not generally a good idea. Since they have little contrast with your shirt, it's difficult to see where one begins and the other ends. To avoid this homogenous look, be sure to incorporate at least some contrast into your outfit.

Make this a casual and trendy outfit by pairing it with a fitted t-shirt and jeans.;
, Wrap the scarf around your neck so that both the tail ends are hanging in the front. Then, simply tie a knot like you would to tie your shoes. You can tighten this knot to sit at the base of your throat or you can leave it looser for a more relaxed look. Knotting your pashmina during the winter will keep your neck especially warm.You can also try a more complicated knot such as a hacking, twisted, or chain link knot.

, Tie the two ends of your pashmina together to create a loop. If your pashmina has fringe, use a few pieces of fringe to make a double knot. If not, use the corners of the rectangle to tie two knots at the two places where the corners meet. Then, place this large loop around your neck so that the knots rest on the back of your neck. Double the loop around to create a large circular scarf with no ends hanging down., Wrap the scarf around your neck so that the two tails are in the front, with the right tail hanging a little longer than the left tail. Take the right tail and wrap it over and around the left tail, so that it is back on the right side.

Tie your scarf in a half-bow.,
Tie your scarf in a complete bow.",How to Wear a Scarf1," Of one of the most basic and attractive ways of wearing a scarf is just wrapping it in a loop around your neck. Wrap the scarf around your neck to create a single loop, with the tail ends loosely draped in the front. Pull on the loop a bit to loosen it up and create a more casual appearance. If you’re trying to beat the cold, you can wrap the scarf multiple times around your neck.;
, For a slightly more intricate play on a basic loop, knot the tail ends together after wrapping your scarf around your neck once or twice. Loosen up the knot so that it doesn’t fit too tightly, and so the ends lay better. If you want, you can twist the ends into the loop to hide them completely or you can leave them to hang down.

, If you don’t want to worry about your scarf becoming un-looped but still want something basic, wrap your scarf in a hacking knot. Fold it in half length-wise, and then drape this over your neck. Pull the two tail ends through the loop you just created and adjust the fabric to flow well over your body.

, Take the hacking knot a step further to create a figure-8 knot. Fold your scarf in half and drape it around your neck. Take a single tail and and pull it through the loop draped on the other side of your neck. Then twist the loop 180 degrees to create a second loop, and pull the second tail end through that. Pull apart the fabric and adjust the way it sits on your chest., If the figure-8 scarf isn’t quite enough for you, continue the process to ‘braid’ your scarf. Create a hacking knot around your neck, and pull a single tail end through the loop. Then, twist the loop 180 degrees to form a second loop. Pull the second tail end through this loop, and then twist the loop another 180 degrees to create a third loop. Continue this pattern until you run out of fabric to braid.

, Take the hassle out of dangling scarf fringe by making your scarf into an infinity scarf. Lay your scarf out flat on a table, and fold it in half lengthwise. Tie each set of corners together (and if your scarf has fringe, tie the centers together) to create a large loop. Then wrap this around your neck with the ties along your nape. If the scarf is long enough, double up the loop to create multiple layers and to make it a bit shorter.

, This style goes well with a buttoned up blazer or jacket over the top. Wrap your scarf around your neck with both tail ends in the front. Tie them together in a knot at your preferred height, and then knot the ends again. Continue knotting them until you run out of fabric and are left with a long ‘chain’ of fabric.

, Place your scarf around your neck so that both the tails are in the front, draped across your chest. Adjust the scarf so that one of the ends is slightly longer than the other. Tie the longer end into a knot on itself, but don’t pull it tight. Then, slide the end of the other tail through the center of the knot you just formed. Move the knot up or down to your liking.

, Wrap your scarf around your neck so that one side is twice the length of the other. Wrap the longer end around the the shorter one a complete time to create a loop. Then wrap it around the short end again, and pull it through the neck hole from the center of the end. Picking it up from the center should create a small, flat-ish loop that can be pulled and draped over the shorter (now longer) end of the scarf. The tail end of the loop will be hiding behind it.

, Wrap your scarf around your neck with both tail ends in the front. Loosely tie these ends in a regular knot in the front, and then follow the traditional bunny-ear method of tying a bow. Keep the bow big and loose for the most casual appearance."

Grab both loose ends and thread them through the section formed by the fold. Slip your head into this loop. Pull on the loose ends to tighten and pull on the looped section to loosen.

, Lay the scarf over one shoulder. Pull one end of the scarf to gather lots of slack. Take this end of the scarf and coil it loosely in a coil around your neck. Continue coiling until you only have a little slack left. Let the loose end of the scarf hang down over your other shoulder. Pull the loose ends to tighten and pull on the coil to loosen.

, Grab the scarf by both ends and press your neck into the middle point. Wrap one end in a complete circle around your neck, keeping it fairly tight against your skin. Repeat with the other end if you have enough slack. Let both loose ends hang down over your torso. Pull the loose ends to tighten and pull on the tight wrapped section to loosen.

, An infinity scarf is a loose loop of material meant to be worn around the neck. Unlike a normal scarf, it's not made from a long, skinny strip, but a single continuous loop. You can loosely drape it around your neck or double it up several times for a much tighter ""tie"" — it's up to you!

Play around with different scarf tying ideas.",How to Wear a Burberry Scarf," Burberry makes scarves for both men and women. You can pick any scarf from either line regardless of your gender, but keep in mind that the size, patterns, and materials used for women's scarves are easier to pair with most women's clothing, while those used for men's scarves are easier to pair with most men's clothing.


Women's scarves are available in rectangular and square styles. There are also poncho and wrap style scarves, as well as short fur collars. “Heritage” style scarves tend to present subdued, classic looks.
Men's scarves are also available in rectangular and square styles. There are also long blanket style scarves, as well as ""heritage"" style scarves, which tend to have a more classic appearance, just as they do in the women's line.;
, There is no single material used for Burberry scarves. Some are softer and more elegant, while others are a little more durable. The type of material you choose can change the overall tone of your ensemble.


Women's scarves come in cashmere, silk, and fur. There are also blends that combine one or more of these materials with other materials, like wool, linen, or cotton.
Men's scarves come in cashmere, wool, linen, cotton and silk.
Note that light, flowing materials like cashmere and silk tend to create a more elegant appearance. Fur is also a luxurious material. Wool, linen, cotton, and their blends still have chic and class, but they do tend to look a little less formal and may seem more versatile.

, The color and print will also change the tone of your ensemble. Classic prints are usually easier to pair with other clothes, but statement prints can add greater flair and personality to your look.


The checkered pattern is one of the most classic prints for both men and women. It can be found in range of colors, including everything from bold reds to neutral tans.You can also find solid prints, especially if you look in the heritage scarf collection.
Other patterns you might find can include abstract combinations of straight and curved lines, ruffles, large florals, vines, leaves, tropical florals, map prints, color blocks, and geometric shapes.

, Cooler weather is scarf weather. A Burberry scarf is best matched with clothes you would wear in cooler weather, like jackets and sweaters. As such, this wardrobe addition will usually see the most action during autumn and winter, with a few appearances in the spring, as well.


When wearing a coat or jacket, opt for a more stylish variety than a casual type. Trench coats, pea coats, leather jackets, blazers, and sports jackets are all fair game. A Burberry scarf, with all its class, tends to look better with styles like these than with fluffy down ski coats, though.
You can wear a Burberry scarf without donning a coat or jacket, but keep in mind that your outfit should still look appropriate for cooler weather. You can work with both short and long sleeves, but long pants or long leggings typically work better visually than shorts, capri pants, or short skirts.

, Since most Burberry scarves have a luxurious appearance and an interesting print, it generally works best if you avoid wearing other prints or accessories that might compete for attention. When too many separate components of an outfit stand out, they can clash.


Wearing a bold print scarf with a bold print blouse, for instance, might create an ensemble that is far too busy to please the average eye.
Similarly, your accessories should work with the scarf, not against it. A simple yet stylish hat will usually work great, as will a classy pair of bootsIf you opt for jewelry, position the bling away from your scarf. Bracelets and rings work better than earrings, but earrings still work better than necklaces.

, Tuck the scarf beneath a coat or jacket, hiding most of it underneath the other piece. If the color or print of the scarf stands out well enough, you can add a chic yet subtle bit of flair to otherwise drab-colored outerwear.


The way you wear your jacket and the way you tie your scarf can change the nature of this highlight. On days when you feel like leaving your jacket open, tie your scarf in a way that allows the ends to drape down over your front, thereby allowing more of the pattern to show through. On chillier days when you need to keep your coat buttoned up, tie your scarf in a way that keeps the majority of material at the neck.

, Even though it's best to avoid wearing a bold Burberry scarf with other bold prints, there are ways for you to mix patterns to create greater visual interest. Typically, it can be done if one or both patterns are somewhat subdued.


Pinstripes are a famously subtle pattern and can be paired with other patterns more easily than most. Consider wearing a pinstripe shirt or jacket with a classic checkered Burberry scarf.If you're feeling a little bolder, you could even throw on a floral print scarf with your pinstriped jacket.

, Burberry scarves made from luxurious materials like cashmere and silk are easy to wear without outerwear. When you choose to wear your scarf in this manner, make sure to coordinate the colors and patterns with those of your entire outfit.


Cashmere and silk scarves are easy to pair with business attire or chic daytime weekend wear.
You can match casual materials, like linen and wool blends, with your outfit in a similar manner, but they tend to work best with outfits that are well arranged yet still fairly casual. A sweater paired with dark jeans might work well for these varieties, for example.

, Another way to create visual interest when wearing a Burberry scarf is to pair together different materials with different textures. To prevent the ensemble from looking too loud or outrageous, though, it is best to do this when you are working with solids or subtle prints.


For instance, try wearing a smooth cashmere scarf with a stiff wool coat, or a wool blend scarf with a cashmere sweater.
You can also mix masculine and feminine elements. Try throwing a silk or cashmere scarf over a leather jacket., You can wear a Burberry scarf with a dressy outfit, but you can also wear one with a fairly casual—yet well put together—outfit. In fact, the same scarf will usually work with both types of apparel.


If you have a black checkered Burberry scarf, you can wear it with a pea coat and pinstripe dress pants one day, then wear it with a fitted t-shirt and black jeans the next day.The day after that, you could wear it over a sweater with skinny blue jeans.

, When done, the ends should appear very short or should not appear at all.


Drape the center of the scarf around the front of your neck, letting the ends fall behind your shoulders.
Bring each end over the opposite shoulder. The end first draped over your right shoulder should be brought back to the front over the left, and vice versa.
Adjust the loop to your desired looseness.
Wrap each end around the inside of this loop multiple times until the ends are either dramatically shortened or completely hidden.

, Loop the scarf loosely around your neck once. Both ends should hang down along the front of your torso.


Drape the center of the scarf around the front of your neck. Allow the ends to fall behind your shoulders.
Bring both ends to the front of your body again by pulling them over the opposite shoulder.
Adjust the loop to your desired looseness.
Cross the ends over and tie them into a loose overhand knot. Position this knot so that it lands out at or just below the bottom of the loop.

, With a hacking knot (also called a European loop), the scarf ends will drape down the front of your torso, but the loop around your neck will be slightly more snug.


Fold the scarf in half.
Drape the folded scarf around the back of your neck, bringing the fold and the ends to the front of your body.
Slip both ends into the loop created by the fold.
Pull the ends further through the fold to shorten the loop around your neck, adjusting to your desired snugness.

, If you have a long scarf with a fashionable print, you don't have to tie it at all. Instead, loosely drape it over your shoulders so that both ends can be seen from the front.For warmer, casual materials, like cotton or wool, keep both ends fairly symmetrical.
For lighter, dressier materials, like cashmere, consider letting one end drape down below the knee while keeping the other end just below your waist.
You can also change the appearance slightly by holding the scarf down at your waist with a wide or narrow belt.

, For the most part, any tying style that will work for any other square or rectangular scarf will also work with a Burberry scarf. If your favorite tying style is not described here, try it with your Burberry scarf and determine for yourself whether or not you like the results.

Wear a modified ascot.,
Make a pleated wrap.,
Create a faux-infinity scarf.,
Tie your scarf in a flowing loop.,
Scarf-braid your scarf.,
Tie your scarf bandana-style.,
Create a sliding knot.",How to Tie a Scarf1," If you have a scarf that isn’t too long or with fringed ends, doing a plain wrap-and-knot is a great option. Drape the scarf around your neck, and tug the ends so that one is hanging down about twice as long as the other. Take the long end of the scarf and wrap it around your neck, bringing the tail end back to the front; it should be even with the other tail end. You can now leave the ends dangling, or tie them together in a regular knot, leaving the ends to dangle.;
, Possibly the most common way of tying a scarf, the hacking knot works well for scarves that are a bit on the longer side. Take your scarf and fold it in half, so that you have two tail ends together and a loop on the other end. Wrap this around your neck, and pull the two tail ends through the loop. Adjust the ends and the loop to your like, and you’re done.

, If you’re wanting to showcase your scarf in the front, this is a great tying option. Wrap the scarf around your neck so that both the ends are hanging down the front. Then, tie them together in a loose knot near your chest. Tie the ends together in a second knot, leaving it loose. The ends should dangle down the front, and you’re finished.

, Wrap your scarf around your neck, and tie a loose knot near your collarbone. Then, just as you would with shoe-laces, tie the ends of the scarf together in a big floppy bow. Adjust the bow so that it lays how you like, and move it so that it is either off to the side or directly in front. Your scarf-bow is finished!

, If you have a square silk scarf (commonly found vintage), you can create an ascot-style scarf. Fold your scarf in half to form a large rectangle. Place the downward point on your back, and bring the two even points to the front. Tie the two ends together in a double knot very near your neck.

, You can create a voluminous neck-tie by pleating your scarf prior to wrapping it. Lay it out flat on a table, and then accordion-fold it to create a folded stack of fabric. Hold the pleats in place, and wrap the scarf around your neck. Tie the ends together in the front, and let the pleats go. The ends should maintain some of the original folding, appearing full and fluffy in the front. Adjust to your liking, and you’re finished.

, Lay your scarf out flat on a countertop, and then fold it in half so that the ends are lined up. Tie the corners of the scarf together, creating a large loop. Place this loop around your neck with the ties at the back, and then loop it around your neck a second time. Adjust the fabric so that the infinity scarf is sitting correctly, and you’re done.

, Similar to tying an infinity scarf, creating a long-flowing loop of fabric allows you to showcase the print of your scarf. Lay your scarf out on a flat surface, and tie the corners together to form a loop. Place this loop around your neck with the tied ends at the back. This style looks good when the bottom portion of the loop is tucked behind a wide waist belt and paired with a matching cardigan or jacket.

, Start by folding your scarf in half so that you have a loop on one end and the tail ends on the other; wrap this around your neck so the loop and ends are even. Pull one of the tail ends (not both) through the loop. Then, twist the loop 180 degrees, and pull the second tail end through the loop. Twist the loop below the second tail 180 degrees again, and then repeat the process until the ends are too short to braid., This style of knot works best for square scarves made of silk, although it can be done on others. Lay your scarf out flat, and fold it in half diagonally to form a triangle. Place the scarf so that the triangle is in your front, covering up your chest. Then, wrap the two triangle ends around the back of your neck and back to the front, tying them in a knot. Tuck the tied ends of the knot under the triangle of fabric, and you’re finished.

, Another style that works well with a long scarf, tying a sliding knot is relatively simple and an attractive way to style your scarf. Wrap your scarf around your neck so that the two ends are hanging evenly on either side of your body. On one end of the scarf, tie it in a knot onto itself, but leave it slightly loose. Pull the end of the second tail through the center of this knot, and you’re done! Slide the knot up or down the scarf to put it in your preferred location.

Wear your scarf as a shrug.,
Wear your scarf as a shawl.,
Drape your scarf over your hair as a headwrap.,
Turn your scarf into a headband.,
Wear your scarf as a belt.",How to Tie a Scarf2," If you’re looking for a little extra coverage without a bulky sweater, try tying your scarf around your shoulders as a shrug. If your scarf is square, fold it diagonally in half to form a triangle; a rectangular scarf does not need to be folded prior to wrapping. Then, drape your scarf around your shoulders so that the two ends are held open in the front, and the bulk of the scarf is resting on your shoulders/back. Tie the ends together in a small knot in the front, and adjust the fabric a bit.

, If you have a beautiful pashmina or a long, wide scarf with a pretty pattern, try wearing it as a shawl. Open the scarf so that it is completely flat, and wrap it around your back and arms so that the entire pattern is exposed. Drape the ends of the scarf loosely over your shoulders, and tug at the fabric a bit to loosen it up. You can turn this style around so that the ends are draped in the front if you would like, but this doesn’t leave as nice of draping as the original steps indicate.

, Whether you’re trying to protect your hair from the elements or you just want to show off your scarf on your head, you can create a lovely loose headwrap using a small silk scarf. Open the scarf up so all the fabric is exposed, and place this over your head so that the ends are near your shoulders. Tie the ends of the fabric together under your chin or near the nape of your neck under your hair.

, If you have a pretty square scarf, you can easily transform it into a headband. Lay the scarf out flat on a table, and then fold it in half diagonally to form a triangle. Starting on the widest side, roll/fold the fabric in 1-inch sections to create a long, narrow strip of fabric. Then wrap this around your head to form the headband.

Choose plaids with neutral, understated color palettes and you can pair them with almost anything in your wardrobe.

, If you have a large piece of fabric or a fuzzy throw at home that you think would work as a scarf, go for it! Any large, square or rectangular piece of material can be repurposed as a blanket scarf. Tie it in your favorite configuration and no one will ever know it’s not meant to be a scarf."

Use the bag with care.",How to Make a Paper Purse," One side will be the outside of your purse, and one side will make the lining. To make a more realistic-looking purse, choose paper that is patterned on one side and solid-colored on the other.

For the neatest cut, cut a paper trimmer or paper cutter. If you don't have one, use a metal ruler and craft knife.
For the rest of this tutorial, the double-sided scrapbook paper will be referred to as ""DSP."";
, You will end up with one 4½ by 12-inch (11.43 by 30.48 centimeters) strip of paper, and one 4½ by 7-inch (11.43 by 17.78 centimeters) strip of paper., Lay down a strip of double-sided tape along one of the narrow edges of your first piece of DSP. Peel off the backing, then press the narrow edge of the other piece of DSP on top.

Do not overlap the two pieces by more than ½-inch (1.27 centimeters), or the body of your purse won't be long enough to wrap around the bottom of your purse.
Set the taped DSP aside when you are done.

, Cut two ¾ by 11-inch (1.91 by 27.94 centimeters) strips of paper first. Then, cut two more ¾ and 8½-inch (1.91 by 21.59 centimeters) strips.Choose a color that contrasts with your DSP, but that also goes well with it. Neutral colors, such as black or white, are great options.

, Be careful not to overlap the ends by too much, or your border won't be long enough to wrap around the top of your purse; ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) will be plenty. Repeat with the remaining two pieces. When you are done, you will end up with two, very long strips of paper.

Set the border pieces aside when you are done. You will be attaching them to the body of the bag towards the end.

, Use the same color as you did for the border pieces in the previous part.You will be folding this into a box shape to make the bottom of your purse., Score a vertical line, going from top to bottom, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the left side edge. Repeat this for the right side. Score a horizontal line, going from side to side, 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) away from the top edge. Repeat this for the bottom edge.

For the neatest scores, use a scoring board. If you don't have one, lightly draw the lines using a pencil and ruler first, then fold along those lines a few times to make a crease.
When you are done, you will have a large rectangle in the center, and four skinny rectangles at each edge. You will also have four squares, one in each corner.

, Orient the rectangle horizontally first, with the long edge facing you. Then, using the vertical scores as guides, cut a 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) long slit into each corner, right along the score line. These slits will make little flaps so that you can tape the bottom of your bag together., Fold both side edges down towards the center, and run a bone folder along the creases. Repeat for the top and bottom edges., Place a few strips of double-sided tape to the back of each flap. Then, press each flap against the inside walls of the box. You will end up with something that looks like a how-box lid.

Set the bottom of the purse aside when you are done.

, For a fancier touch, you can crop or round the corners, but not by much. Use the same color as you did for the border pieces., You'll be using these un-scored ends to attach the handles to the bag.It will also mimic the look of a real bag., Draw a line of glue to one side of the score, then fold the handle in half. Leave the 1½-inch (3.81 centimeters) bit at each end un-folded and un-glued. The handles will be flat and skinny along the middle, with curved ""cups"" at each end.

The smooth part of the cups will be on the front/outside of the handles.
The curved, ""V"" part of the cups will be on the back/inside of the handles.

, Place the flat, folded part of the handle on the edge of a bone folder. Place your thumb on top of the paper. Use your free hand to pull the paper downward, between your thumb and the bone folder. Repeat this step for the other handle.

This is the same technique used for curling ribbon.
Set the handles aside when you are done.

, Take the DSP strip you made at the beginning, and flip it over so that the side you want to be on the inside of your purse is facing you. Place a long strip of double-sided tape along the bottom edge. Place another strip along one of the short, side edges., Start from the short edge that does not have any tape on it. Carefully wrap the body of the bag around the bottom of your purse, pinching the corners as you go. Finish off by pressing the taped side edge down. Run your finger along the seam to seal it.Make sure that the bottom of the DSP strip aligns neatly with the bottom of your purse.

, Run a strip of double-sided tape along one of the border strips first, then wrap the strip around the top, inside edge of your purse. Repeat this step with the other strip, but this time on the outside of your purse.This gives your purse some design as well as strength.

Make sure that the top edges align neatly.
Don't align the seams on the border pieces with the seams on the body of your purse. You will create less bulk this way.

, Take your first handle, and turn it so that the back is facing you. You should see a ""V"" at each end of the handle. Place a strip of double-sided tape onto the bottom edge of each end. Repeat this step for the other handle., Take the first handle, and position it on the front of your purse. Make sure that the bottom edges of the handle align with the bottom edge of the border. Press the taped ends to the front of your bag. Flip the bag over, and repeat for the other side., Place a drop of glue onto the bottom corners of your front handle. Next, press a small, flat-backed gem, pearl, or metal stud onto the glue.Repeat this step for the back handle.

You can also use glue dots instead of glue.

, Because this bag is made out of paper and tape, it is very fragile. It is meant mostly for decorative purposes, although you can use it to store paper cards and other supplies on your desk. You can also use it as a fancy gift bag."

If you have holiday fabric you are off to a great start.,
You will need to choose two pieces of fabric.,
Create your holiday themed design on the outer background fabric before you assemble it.,
You will need batting for the middle layer.,
There are many purse patterns on the internet.,
When you are satisfied with your themed purse, make a 1"" binding going around the top of both sides of the purse to add durability and to later attach the handle(s).,
Now is the time to make a handle too.,
Return to your purse design, making sure all the layers still line up.,
Make a closure by taking a small strip of fabric about 8"" long 3-4"" wide.",How to Make a Holiday Themed Purse," But if do not have holiday fabric, you can use plain fabrics that suggests the holiday such as ""red and green"", ""stars"", or ""gold and silver"". Surprising, Goodwill and thrift stores now have a good bit of fabric, but you could use old sheets, or a piece of clothing you no longer want. Remember, this is budget sewing!;
, One piece of fabric will be for the main part, (background fabric with holiday design) and another piece of fabric for the lining (the fabric inside of the purse). You will need some additional small pieces of fabric for creating your design. Example: Cut out designs of trees, stars, gifts, etc. and a long piece of fabric, folded for a handle.

, You can applique these shapes using a raw edge look (un-finshed) which is done by cutting out a shape. You may find it easier to iron fusible (Example:Wonder Under(r)) to the back of the small fabric, cut it out, peel off the white paper and iron it on. Applique the cut shapes onto the background with a sewing machine using a zig-zag stitch. If sewing by hand, use a short length straight stitch or blanket very close together. You can embellish with beads later.

, Batting will give your fabric a lift. Sew around the shapes and evenly in the background. You could use commercial batting for this, but you can use flannel or anything soft for the quilted portion. This part will not show. This will create a ""sandwich"" of purse's design on the background fabric, the batting (middle)and the lining (inside the purse.) Each layer needs to be cut to the same size. Follow a pattern or use a rectangle as a simple shape about 12"" by 24"".

, If you don't use a pattern, cut dimensions of fabric about 12"" wide and 24"" long, basically a rectangle. If you fold this in half, you will get a square, and have both the front and back sides of your purse to design. Pay attention on both sides of the folded fabric as to which way you will be carrying the purse with the handles on top. You don't want your artwork to be upside down.

, Binding is made by attaching a 2 and1/2"" strip of fabric ironed in half and sewn down on the open side to the correct side of fabric. The folded edge is flipped over the top and re-sewn to secure.

,  It can be a two handled or a longer over-the-chest type bag. To make a handle, decide on the length you want and cut it about 18"" to 22"" for a double handle and 24"" to 30"" for a single.  Cut the fabric about 5""-6"" wide and carefully fold in both sides of the width and press with an iron. The cut edges are folded inside and then folded in half again.  Check to be sure your folded handle is an equal width by matching the length of the handles top and bottom. Sew straight lines using your sewing machine end to end about four times for strength.

, The fabric which has the design, will be sewn along with the batting on three sides. You will also sew the same size lining on three sides. Pin these together and either pull the lining out from a small hole in the purse or just insert the lining inside of the purse right sides together, and carefully center the lining along with the handles and closure with a basting stitch and then go to the machine and secure it properly.

, Make this like you did following the steps to making a handle, but this time the thick fabric is folded so it comes a point.  The point is made by folding the fabric over the top twice and close together. (Picture the shape of a man's tie.)  Sew at the top where it overlaps and again about 1-1/2"" down. You will be sewing this in place when you do your handles.  On the opposite side you will sew a big button and slip the pointed closure over the big button.  Make sure it is snug so items will not fall out.

,, You can do this using a sewing machine and a straight stitch, or by hand using a blind stitch. You can even use a blanket stitch and some embroidery thread in a contrasting color for a rustic-chic touch.

If you don't want the stitching to be visible, consider folding some ribbon over the seams, and either gluing or blind-stitching it down.
If you don't know how to sew, you can simply glue the edges down using hot glue or fabric glue.

, Iron along the fold to make the crease. Make a loop out of thin, round, elastic cord, and stitch it to the top of the flap. Stitch a rustic-looking button to the corresponding spot on the body of the clutch.How much elastic cord you use will depend on the size of your button; you need enough to stretch over the button.

If your placemat at a lining, use a seam ripper to open up some of the stitching at the top-center of your flap, and tuck the elastic cord into the hole. Topstitch the hole down using a matching thread color.

Focus the glue on the edges of the flaps. If you need to, place a heavy book on top of the flaps until the glue sets. Do not glue the upper part of the flaps down., This will give you a crisp corner and make your clutch look more professional. Place clips over the corners until the glue sets., Use your bull clips to keep the clutch together., Working one side at a time, remove the bull clip, and glue the bottom flap down, focusing on the edges. Replace the bull clip, and do the other side.

You can remove the clips once the glue has dried or set.

, You can use a self-adhesive Velcro square, or use hot glue (or fabric glue) to attach a regular one. Find the corresponding spot on the body of your clutch, and attach the matching Velcro square.

For a more professional clutch, use a magnetic clasp instead. Follow the instructions on the package that came with your clasp.

, Glue some tassel or fringe trim all along the curved edge of the top flap. Close the top flat, and continue gluing down other types of trim. Feel free to mix and match; you can have one row or many. For a truly unique touch, combine pompom trim with braided cord trim. Use bright colors that contrast with your placemat."

Check the lining of the bag.,
Look for the manufacturing country.,
Inspect the CC pattern, if applicable.,
Check the material.,
Check the stitching.,
Look at the fixtures.,
Look at the zippers.,
Don't fall for the terminology.,
Check the price.,
Check the vendor.",How to Detect a Faux Coach Handbag from an Authentic Coach Handbag," All authentic Coach purses will have the signature Coach logo on the inside, close to the top near the zipper. The logo will be in either patent or traditional leather. If it's not there or is in a different material, it's a fake.;
, The credo patch is a serial number stamped on the inside of a Coach bag, although some smaller purses or bags, such as the ""clutch"", the ""swingpack"" and the ""mini"" do not.The last 4 to 5 digits of the serial number, which consists of both letters and numbers, will indicate the style number of the bag.


Beware of serial numbers that aren't stamped into the fabric and instead printed only in ink. Real Coach bags are stamped and some such as the Legacy series are inked with a ""gold-tone ink"",; fake Coach bags are often only inked.
Some older Coach bags, especially those from the late '60s, do not have serial numbers. Coach started making serial numbers in the '70s.

, If the outside of the bag has the distinctive CC pattern, the inside of the lining will most likely not have the pattern. If the inside has the CC pattern, the outside of the bag will likely not have the pattern. Sometimes, neither the inside lining or the outside material contain the distinctive CC pattern.


A sure sign of a fake is the existence of a CC pattern on both the inside and the outside. A real Coach bag will never contain the pattern on both.

, ""Made in China"" does not mean the bag is fake. Coach does make some of its bags in China, among other countries, although the original company hails from the United States.

, Check the pattern of the Coach bag for irregularities. The following may be signs that the Coach bag is not authentic:


The CC pattern is in fact only a C pattern. The CC pattern should always contain two rows of vertical and two rows of horizontal Cs, not one.
The CC pattern is slightly crooked. In authentic Coach bags, the CC pattern is aligned perfectly both horizontally and vertically.
The edge of the horizontal ""C"" and the edge of the vertical ""C"" do not touch. In authentic Coach bags, the horizontal ""C"" touches its vertical counterpart.
The pattern breaks on any front or back pockets. In authentic Coach bags, a pocket will not cause a break in the CC pattern, although some side seams are almost impossible to continue the pattern on.
The pattern breaks in the middle of the two seams on the front of the bag. In authentic Coach bags, a seam will not cause a break in the CC pattern.

, Coach bags are made with the finest quality materials. If the cloth seems like canvas, the ""leather"" looks faux/shiny, or the outside is obviously plastic leather, don't buy it. It's most likely a cheap remake.

, If it's sloppy-looking and crooked, there's probably a good chance it's fake. The same goes if there's a logo on the front of the purse.


Each stitch should be of uniform length, should follow a straight line, and contain no ""over-stitching,"" or sewing stitches over an edge to prevent fraying or loosening.

, Many fixtures of Coach bags, including metal hardware, should contain the Coach logo. Note, however, that some newer models do not contain the Coach label on the fixtures. If in doubt, check an authentic model bag to see if the fixtures do in fact contain the Coach logo.

, Look for two things on Coach zippers:


The pull on the zipper will be made of either leather or a series of rings. Zippers that don't match this description are usually fakes.
The zipper itself is usually branded with the letters ""YKK,"" a high-quality manufacturer of zippers. Usually, but not always, Coach zippers that don't contain the letters ""YKK"" are fakes.

, Steer clear of any coach bags that are ""Designer Inspired"" or ""Grade-A Replicas"". Bags advertise this so that they can avoid getting in trouble. (In other words, a lawsuit.) The same goes for many other fake ""designer"" things.

, If the price seems unreal, even for a Coach bag, you are most likely being fooled by a clear knock off. Counterfeiters try to make money off cheap knock offs of sought-after items, and if it seems like they're pulling your leg, they probably are.


The same goes for very cheap Coach bag. Absurdly cheap Coach bags are either flawed, have condition issues, out of vogue, or fake. If the price seems too good to be true, it probably is.

, Vendors in the mall and off the street are most likely selling fakes. Online bidding forums like eBay commonly sell off fakes for real-item prices. Faux sellers can be anywhere, but those are the most common places they're at. Your best bet at getting the real thing is at a Coach retail store, Coach.com, or a department store purse section at stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, Bloomingdale's, and/or JC Penney.


If buying from a vendor such as eBay, check the seller's feedback rating. If the seller has a less than reputable feedback rating, that could be a sign that something is fishy. Browse their specific ratings to see if anything sounds amiss.

Decide what kind of handbag you need and buy or make it.,
Consider what you need to carry in your handbag every day.,
Consider where you are taking the handbag.,
Think through your hygiene and beauty routines.,
Remember some body spray or hotel sized soap; not everywhere is clean and good-smelling!,
Review any medication you take, and add that to your handbag, as necessary.,
Consider tucking in a few comfort or entertainment items.,
Be sure to include a wallet or purse containing money and an ID.,
Miniaturize and consolidate.,
Avoid packing too much.",How to Know What to Carry in Your Purse," Try to find something that looks small but has lots of space.;
, What items do you use (or find you need) frequently? Make a list of the items, or just gather them up in one place.

, Specifically, what do you need to have to go there and do whatever you have planned?

,


Evaluate how much makeup you use each day. If you wear makeup every day or go out a lot, you may want to put a makeup bag in your handbag, and make sure you have a small mirror with you. Otherwise, see if you can keep it to the basics.
Tissues and a hairbrush are always useful even if you don't wear cosmetics.
Would you use a toothbrush, toothpaste, or dental floss more often if you had them at hand all the time? Think about it; it really could improve your mouth health.
Mints. It's good having a pack of mints after you ate some garlic snacks or anything that smells.

,


Don't forget the hand sanitizer and a sanitary napkin or tampon. Always bring a second pad or tampon to change it. Many handbags have an inside zippered pocket where you can carry personal items discreetly. Or buy a little zipper bag for extra security.
If you buy a handbag without multiple compartments, it is very helpful to buy a small pencil bag or makeup bag to keep all your beauty products in inside your handbag. This way your smaller items such as lip glosses do not leak in your handbag or roll around to where you can not find them. Having this smaller bag creates more organization and creates easier access.

, Your local drugstore will have plenty of options for carrying your selection of medicines.


If you are prone to headaches or cramps, you may want to keep a small container of pain reliever in your handbag.
If you wear contacts, keep your case and eye drops in your handbag. Consider taking your glasses as well, in case your contacts fall out at a time when you can't put them back in, or if you can't find the fallen contact.
Carry any medications that you or your family will need in case of emergencies, such as asthma inhalers or injections to control allergic reactions.
Your handbag may not be the right place for a complete first aid kit, but you may still want to carry a few small basics, such as a couple of band-aids and some tweezers.

, Would you like a small, packaged snack or a hand-held fan for hot summer days? A paperback novel? A notebook and pen? A miniature craft kit or drawing kit? Go easy on items like these, and choose only the ones that are most important to you.

, Also, make sure the handbag contains keys for your house and car (though keys are always safer when kept in a trouser or coat pocket). The same goes with money--if you're going to carry money in your handbag, don't carry too much in case it gets stolen.

, If you like to read, could your books travel electronically in your phone or PDA without adding weight? It might be a good idea to bring a book instead of a Kindle in case your handbag is stolen. Could you carry a multiple-use object, such as a four-way pen or multi-tool? Can you carry just a few basic colors of makeup in one or two compacts and leave the rest at home?

, If you have a complete first aid kit, you need to take it out. Remember; it's just a handbag, not a suitcase.

Decide where the bag will go.,
Find a strong support beam.,
Drill a hole into the support beam.,
Hang the bag.,
Evaluate the security of the bag.",How to Hang a Heavy Bag1," Think about the space in your home. Do you have a basement or work room? The amount of space you have will determine where you can put the bag.


You can choose between a ceiling mount or a wall mount. For an optimal workout, most people suggest being able to move 360 degrees around the bag. This helps you work on footwork, movements, among other things.If the bag isn't in the middle of the room, it could potentially break something or rebound off the wall and come back at you, causing injury.
Most people suggest mounting a heavy bag to the ceiling in a basement or garage.;
, Support beams are narrow beams that run along the ceiling with spaces between. Generally, the space between support beams is 16"", but they can be as wide as 24"". Most people want to hang their bag from the ceiling for better mobility. When doing this, make sure you plan on attaching the heavy bag to a strong support beam. The beam must be able not only to take the weight of the heavy bag, but also the impact as it swings.One of the easiest ways to find a support beam is to use a stud finder.


Another way to find the support beam is to use the knock test. Knock along your ceiling; if you hear a hollow sound, there's no support beam behind it. When you hit a support beam, the sound will change and no longer be hollow since you are knocking on a piece of wood.
You can also measure from the wall to find the support beam. Place a tape measure against the edge of the wall and measure 16"". Continue measuring in 16"" increments until your desired placement. Knock against the wall to double check the placement of the support beam.
Installing a heavy bag on the ceiling can cause serious damage to your house if done incorrectly. That is why it is so important to find a beam strong enough. Hanging the heavy bag on the rafters or ceiling joints can destroy the drywall.Overhead ceiling beams that are used to hold heavy bags should be able to support more weight than the bag.

, Place an eyebolt into this hole. Twist the eyebolt into the hole with your hand at first, and then tighten it with a wrench.Avoid using hooks instead of eyebolts, since heavy bags can easily fall off hooks., Attach the chains to the corners of the bag. They should be included with your heavy bag. An s-hook should also be included, which you should connect to the chains. Finally, attach the bag to the eyebolt.

, Hit the bag a few times to make sure it is securely held in place. Rehang the bag if the attachments appear weak or fragile.

Add some glitter and metallics!,
Add keychains.,
Paint your bag.,
Replace the straps with thick chains.,
If it's a cloth handbag, add some badges to it.",How to Jazz Up a Handbag," Tie a cool scarf on to the handle of your handbag. You can choose between the prints of your scarf. There's floral, animal print, striped, plaid. Even a plain but bright colored scarf looks great. ;
, That will add some chic bling to your handbag.

, Great choices are that you can sew on lace (A classic choice) or sequins (Total bling). Maybe beaded trim by the yard.

, If you want a personalized handbag, you can try buying a plain one and personalizing it yourself, by following the steps above. If you want one that is already personalized, look online, ask for advice, check for sales, and know what you like.

, You can use stick ons, but be careful -- they can easily fall off. You can also simply just buy a bag with glitter or sprinkle some glitter.

, Make sure the colors can easily compromise with the handbag, and pick ones that stick to the purpose.

, If your leather bag has lost its shine, a coat or two of paint will revive it. Depending on the texture you want you can either use spray paint or acrylic paint. Use spray paint for a cleaner look. For more texture, apply the acrylic paint using a sponge. Paint your bag black or brown for a classy look. You can even paint it gold or silver. It will look like a brand new bag, and you'll keep up with the latest trends.

, That will add more flair to the handbag.

, You may want to add badges of your favorite sports team, or just maybe smiley emoticon badges.

Choose a beautiful fabric for your clutch.,
Cut your fabric and lay it out.,
Cut and iron craft fuse to your main fabric.,
Fuse fleece to your fabric.,
Flip your fabric around and sew a seam.,
Flip your fabric right side out.,
Line up the seams of your fabric.,
Sew a 3/8 inch seam.,
Flip your fabric inside out and sew.,
Create the bottom corners.,
Stitch the corners again and apply glue.,
Lift up on the frame and finish your clutch.",How to Make a Clutch Purse1," It may be best to use a thick fabric here like drapery because it will provide a thicker lining for your clutch, but you can choose cotton if you found a pattern that you really like. Purchase half a yard or so of this fabric from your local craft or sewing store.You'll also need some lining fabric to line the inside of your clutch. You can choose a simple white color so that it doesn't show through your fabric, or if you are using a dark fabric, you can choose a darker color or a fun pattern. On top of those fabrics you'll need a metal clutch frame hardware for your clasp and some fusible fleece. You should be able to find all of these items in the sewing section or craft department of a craft store.;
, Take your fabric and place it on a table with the decorated side of the fabric face down. Then, cut your fabric so that it is 13 inches tall by 13.5 inches wide. Cut an identical piece of lining fabric -- 13 inches tall by 13.5 inches wide., Take a piece of craft fuse and cut it so that it is a little bit smaller than your main fabric. Think about taking off a fourth of an inch on each side. Then, fuse it to the backside of your fabric with an iron. Make sure it is spread evenly across your fabric., Once you have fused your craft fuse to your main fabric, you will take a piece of fusible fleece and cut it 10 inches wide and 13 inches tall. Then, fuse it to your craft fuse, so that it is evenly spaced on your fabric. It should be the exact height as your main fabric, but there should be about a 1.75 inch gap between each edge of your main fabric and the edge of your fleece., Turn your main fabric over so that the design is on the front and the fused fabrics are on the back. Then, take your lining and place it on top of your fabric. Sew a half inch seam straight across the top of your fabric and the bottom of your fabric.You want to place your fabric so that the 13.5 inch sides are horizontal and the 13 inch sides are vertical. Make sure you sew a seam along the 13.5 inch sides of your fabric, which should be the top and bottom of your fabric if you have placed it correctly on the table.

, After you have sewn two of the sides, turn your fabric right side out so the design is now facing outside. Then, iron your fabric nice and smooth to remove any wrinkles. Face your fabric so that the two seams are on the top and bottom of your fabric.

, Take your fabric, and fold it in half so that the two seams line up with each other. The decorated side of your fabric should be on the outside of your fold. Once you have created your fold, the left and right side of your clutch should be open (not yet sewn), and your fabric should be much wider than it is tall.Once you have done this, pin the top of your fabric with paperclips or pins to prepare to sew. Space the paperclips or pins about an inch away from the left and right sides of your fabric.

, After you have placed two pins or paper clips on the top of your clutch to hold it together, sew a seam along both open sides of your clutch. Simply, sew a 3/8 inch seam from the top to the bottom and then trim the sides an eighth of an inch. Then, clip a tiny corner at the bottom right and left corner of your clutch, through the stitching. Start from the stitch and clip upwards at a diagonal, towards the edge of your clutch., Because you still have a raw edge on your fabric you'll need to flip it inside out. Sew another 3/8 inch seam along the two sides of your fabric that you just sewed. This will get rid of the raw edge when you flip your fabric right side out. Then, once you've sewn both sides clip the bottom corners again., Flip your fabric right side out again, so that the decorated fabric is on the outside. Then, place it on the table so that side seam is pressed out flat. Push the corner out and then measure about an inch and a half and mark it. Then, stitch that seam, cut it to an eighth of an inch and repeat on the other corner. Then, once again turn the fabric inside out.To create this stitch you basically want to place your clutch on the table so that instead of lying it flat on its side with the seams on the right and the left, you want to place the bottom of the clutch on the table, and press the two side seams flat towards the middle of the clutch. When you do this, you should create a triangle on both sides of your clutch with the seams as the height of each triangle. The corner you want to mark and sew is the top point of each triangle.

, Now that your clutch is inside out, stitch the corner again. Then, flip your clutch right side out and you'll end up with the final shape of your clutch. Apply glue to the inside frame of your clasp, starting about half an inch from the edge. Draw a bead of glue to the other side of the frame, about half an inch away from the edge.Do one side and then attach it to one side of your clutch, wrapping tape around it to hold it as the glue dries. Then, repeat on the other side of the clasp frame. Your glue will need to set a few hours to completely dry. Make sure you use a multi-purpose cementing glue. These are usually found in small tubes.It's helpful to mark the borders on your clutch, where you want your clasp to be. Sometimes it takes a little bit of work to attach the clasp to the clutch, so be patient as you fit the fabric into the frame.

, Once the glue has completely dried on your frame, lift up on the sides of the clasp frame (the part of the clasp inside your clutch). As you lift up the sides, invert the sides of your clutch. Then, remove the tape, close your clutch, and you are finished!"

Purchase a mount.,
Find the 3 or 4 ceiling joists or support beams.,
Drill holes into the ceiling joists.,
Attach a 2x6 hardwood board to the ceiling.,
Attach the mount to the hardwood board.",How to Hang a Heavy Bag2," These range from inexpensive to very pricey. Most mounts come with all the nuts and bolts needed to install them. You can find mounts at sporting goods stores or online.

, You can find ceiling joists or support beams by using a stud finder. Make sure that you find ceiling joists in an area that allows movement. Your bag will be mounted on a middle joist.


Joists are usually placed 16"" apart. If you don't have a stud finder, you can use a measuring tape to measure from the edge of the wall, marking every 16"". In some houses, the joists may run up to 24"" apart. Use the knock test to double check. If you knock on the ceiling and hear a hollow sound, there is no joist. If the sound is not hollow, you are knocking against a ceiling joist.
Choose a place in the ceiling where the joist meets with a cross beam if possible. You can center the mount to the crossbeam for added support.

, Use a level to make sure that the holes you are drilling are straight across the joists. When you drill the holes, make sure to drill them into the center of the joist.


You will need 3-inch wood screws. The threads on the screw need to catch and thread into the ceiling joist.
Choose a drill bit so that the holes in the ceiling are sized so that the drilled hole is slightly larger than the shank of the wood screw, not the threads.

, This is going to be the base for the mount. The 2x6 should be long enough to span all the ceiling joists and support the screws. Attach the board to the ceiling using the newly drilled holes and wood screws. You want to connect the board to the ceiling at each joist.


If you have a crossbeam, center the wood along the crossbeam. This will be where you will hang the bag.
You can use a 2x4, but a 2x6 or higher will provide more support for your heavy bag.

, Most mounts include all hardware needed to attach the mount to the ceiling. You may need a screwdriver, drill, or other tool to attach the mount. You should attach the legs of the mount in the center of the middle ceiling joist.


Make sure to never install the mount into drywall.
Try sticking a heavy bag chain or spring between the mount and the chains. This reduces vibration, and can possibly save your drywall."
"
Use a wall mount.,
Buy a free stand.",How to Hang a Heavy Bag3," If hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling worries you, try attaching it to the wall. Most athletic stores sell wall mounts that include all hardware needed to attach it to the wall. This method is only recommended for masonry walls. Otherwise, you might cause damage to your house.


The bracket of a wall mount is screwed into the wall close to the ceiling.

, If hanging a heavy bag from the ceiling or wall is impossible, there are many free stands available. Some even have wheels for added mobility. Free stands must be weighed down to prevent movement during use. Heavier bags usually require around 300 pounds of weight to prevent movement, although lighter bags may be held down with as little as 100 pounds.


If you're using a free-standing rack, simply attach the chain on the heavy bag to the S-hook on the rack. No installation is required.

Fold and sew your lining fabric.,
Iron out the top edge of your clutch.,
Flip your clutch right side out.,
Sew along the top edge of the clutch.,
Fold your clutch over and finish.",How to Make a Clutch Purse2," For this clutch, you will need three different fabrics: two for for the outside of your clutch and a fabric for the lining. All fabrics should be quilting weight cotton fabric. To be safe, you may want to get a yard of each fabric. You will also need fusible interfacing, and then any tools you like to use to sew, like a rotary cutter, pins, a ruler, etc.


For a really cute clutch, use two different designed fabrics that work well together for the outside of your clutch. You could use fabrics of the same color, or different colored fabrics. Both fabrics will show, so make sure you like the way they look together.
Because you will have lining, you can choose to use any type of fabric. Just make sure the fabric you choose is durable and will hold the items in your clutch. Quilting weight cotton is good because it is heavier and will hold its shape better, but there is flexibility here., For your main fabric, measure and cut a piece that is 12.75 inches by 19 inches. For your second fabric (this will be the flap in the envelope) cut two pieces each measuring 12.5 inches by 5.5 inches. Then, the lining needs to be 12.5 inches by 28.5 inches. And finally, measure and cut the interfacing to 12.75 inches by 29 inches., Place your main flap fabric on the table with the decorated side face up. Then, place your flap fabric on top of your main fabric with the decorated side facing down (the right sides of the fabrics should be touching each other). Then, line them up so the long side of the flap fabric (12.5 inches) and the short side of the main fabric (12.5 inches) are together. Sew a quarter inch seam along the top of the lined pieces, or the 12.5 inch side.Make sure you don't sew along the 5.5 inch sides of the flap fabric. You want to leave those open and only sew along one side of the fabric.

, Place your other piece of flap fabric at the other end of the main fabric, with the right sides of the fabric facing each other and the two 12.75 inch sides lined up. Sew another quarter inch seam along the top of the fabric, leaving the two 5.5 inch sides and the middle 12.5 inch side open.At this point you should have your long piece of main fabric with the two flap pieces on each end of your fabric. You should be able to see the right side of your main fabric, but only the wrong sides of your flap fabric.

, Flip your flap pieces over so that the fabric is one long line. Then, iron the seams so that they lay flat. Turn your fabric over so that the wrong side faces up and the right side is down. Place your interfacing shiny side down on the wrong side of the fabric you just created. Line it up and press it down so it adheres to the fabric., Once you have pressed the interfacing on your fabric, fold it in half, so that the two flap pieces meet and the interfacing is on the outside of your fabric. The decorated side of your fabric should not be showing. Sew along the right and left sides of your fabric with a quarter inch seam, starting from the flap and moving towards the end of your main fabric., Take your lining fabric, the piece that is 12.5 by 28.5 inches, and fold it in half with right side facing in, so that you have a piece 12.5 inches by 14.25 inches. Then, sew along the 14.25 inch sides with a quarter inch seam., Take your clutch at the open end and turn over the top edge, where the flap fabric is, about a quarter of an inch. Press your fold down and iron it out so that it stays in place. Do the same with the top edge of the lining, keeping it with the wrong side out and right side facing in., Take your clutch and turn it so the fabric is on the right side. Iron out your fabric to remove any wrinkles, and press down the seams. Then, place your lining inside your clutch, by pushing down the corners of your lining into the corners of your clutch. Make sure you leave the lining inside out. Position the lining so the top of it sits about an eighth of an inch below the top of your clutch.At this point, the right side of the lining will show when you look in your clutch. This is why it could be fun to use a cute color or pattern for your lining so that when you open up your purse you don't just see a white or black lining.

, To attach your lining to your clutch, you'll need to sew a top stitch. Start at the right or left seam of your clutch and sew a straight line along the top of your clutch, about an eighth of an inch from the edge of your fabric. Then, sew another line, starting again at a seam, about a quarter of an inch from the fabric edge. This will attach your lining to your fabric., Take your clutch and fold it over so that you can see about three quarters of an inch of the main fabric at the top of your clutch. Then, fill it with your items and you're done!


If you want extra security for your clutch, you can add a button or two to the top of your clutch so that you can button it closed while you are holding it. However, the fold in the envelope should be long enough that nothing should fall out of your purse easily.

Fill a sink or tub with cool water.,
Use a laundry soap which is created for delicate fabrics.,
Submerge your bag in the soapy water.,
Work the water and detergent into the handbag.,
Rinse your bag with clean, cool water.,
Dry your handbag by releasing water and lying it flat on a towel.",How to Get a Smoke Smell out of Fabric Handbags1," Warm water can shrink or damage the fabric of your handbag. Fill the sink or tub with enough water to fully submerge your bag. Leave room to work the fabric with your hands., Soap with bleach will fade the colors in your bag. Harsh chemicals wear on the fabric. Delicate soaps are created to protect your fabrics from damage and fading.Dr. Bronners and Woolite are a couple of examples of soaps to use with delicate fabrics.
Use about a tablespoon of detergent and mix it around in the water before adding your bag to make sure the soap is dispersed in the water.Check for a care instructions label inside your handbag. This will give you information on what kind of soap to use on your particular fabric, as well as warnings if you should not wet the fabric., Make sure that every pocket of your handbag is empty, then push the entire bag under the water until it is fully submerged.


If you are worried about the effect the soap may have on your fabric, test it on a small part of your bag before submerging the bag in water. Choose a portion which is least visible, like the inside or bottom of the bag.

, Using your hands, gently knead the bag for several minutes to work the water and detergent into every part of the bag. Let the bag rest in the water for another several minutes to soak up the detergent., Completely drain the sink or tub, then rinse it clean to be rid of all of the detergent and dirty water. Refill the tub with cool water and swish it around to rinse it completely.Repeat this process several times until you feel all of the detergent has been rinsed from the bag and it does not look or feel soapy.

, Lift the bag out of the water after the final rinse. Gently squeeze out as much excess water as you safely can without damaging the bag. Reshape your bag and lie it on a clean towel until it is dry.Try rolling your bag in a clean towel to remove more of the excess water after squeezing it out. Use another clean, dry towel to lie the bag flat and allow it to finish drying on its own.

Find a bag or container which is larger than your handbag.,
Add an odor absorbing material to the container.,
Leave your bag overnight in a closed container with the odor absorbing material.",How to Get a Smoke Smell out of Fabric Handbags2," You will want enough room in this container to fit your bag and leave extra space for air and movement.Try a large paper or plastic bag, or a large storage container.
Be sure that you can seal the container with your handbag inside.

, There are a couple of items useful for absorbing odor, which can be found in your home. Choose one which works best for your needs and add it to the container to take the odor out of your bag. You will want to dispose of this material after you use it.Unused, ground coffee is great at absorbing odors and does not need to be shaken onto your bag. Simply place a bowl of coffee grounds in a paper bag with your handbag. You can wrap the grounds in a coffee filter to keep the grounds from getting into your bag.
Place half a cup of baking soda in the container with your bag and shake it until your handbag is covered with baking soda.

, Be sure to give the odor eater time to absorb the smoke smell from your handbag. This will take at least one night to clear the smell of smoke out of your bag.If the smell of smoke persists, replace the coffee or baking soda with a fresh batch and leave it for another night.

Find a place where you have good air flow.,
Hang a rope or string in an airy space.,
Attach your bag to the rope using clothespins.,
Leave the bag in the air overnight.",How to Get a Smoke Smell out of Fabric Handbags3," The best option for airing the smoke smell out of your handbag is hanging it outside. If this is not an option, you can create air flow using a fan., If you already have a clothesline, you can use that. You may need to create a clothesline by stringing a sturdy rope between two secure items. Tie the rope with a secure knot to avoid slipping once you add the weight of your bag.

, Clothespins are your best option for hanging the bag without damaging the fabric. Hang the bag as flat as possible to allow the most surface area to catch the air flow., You will want to give the bag at least a day to fully air out the smell of smoke. If the smell still remains after the first day, consider trying to increase the air flow with a fan, and leave it to air out for another day."

The certificate is often placed in the inside of the bag near the main label., You should find both stickers located in the interior of the bag. One will show the country of the sale, so a U.S. sticker for an American retail sale. The second sticker will state that the bag was produced in Italy. The printing on the stickers should be clear and not blurry.If there is a possibility that you will return this bag, make sure to keep these stickers intact and in place.

, Most sellers will provide you with a separate written guarantee stating that everything sold in their shop is authentic and legitimate. You can also visit a store’s website and look over their sales policies. Be wary of accepting a simple verbal guarantee or an informal written notice."

Compare your bag to the official Versace website.,
Look over the hardware.,
Look over the seams and stitching.,
Smell it.,
Pay attention to packaging.,
Look for a clear logo on the bag or box.",How to Know if a Versace Bag Is Real2," Go to the main Versace website and browse around to find a digital image of the bag that you are interested in. If the bag is vintage, then browse the internet and locate at least a few comparison images. Get the photos and do a one-on-one comparison, paying particular attention to small details, like the appearance of the lining., You should be able to fasten the bag’s zippers and clasps with little effort and without scratching the metal surface of the hardware. The hardware should also be one uniform finish. Be particularly wary if you see dull spots on an otherwise shiny finish.Versace does not use plastic hardware parts. All hardware on your bag should be a matching metal.It is a good idea to lightly tug on each piece of hardware to make sure that it is properly sewn into the bag. The hardware should not move or be attached to the bag with glue. If you are buying online, ask for a close-up photo of the hardware and where it meets the bag.
Any designs on the hardware will likely be etched into the surface, not printed.

, The stitching should be even, barely noticeable, and straight. Glance over the stitching to see if you notice any loose or frayed seams as that is a sign of a fake bag. The seams on an authentic bag may also be protected with a light wax casing, which is sometimes removable post-purchase.The threads should all be the same color, unless they are purposefully contrasted.
Pull very gently at the sides of the bag where the seams are located. They should not give at all, which is a sign of durability.

, If your bag is leather, it will likely have a light leather fragrance. Otherwise, your bag should not smell at all. Any indications of a rubbery or chemical smell is a sign that your bag is likely fake. Be aware that any fragrances that touch your new bag may be absorbed., If you buy your bag new from a store or online, it may come in a box with a dust bag. The bag is used for storing the bag when not in use. The hardware of the Versace bag itself will not be covered with plastic or another layer. This is a common sign of a counterfeit., The Versace logo should be consistent across all of the packing materials and markings on the bag itself. Look for a crisp, clear logo on all printed materials and etching, instead of printing, on the handbag."

Buy directly from a Versace store or outlet.,
Buy from a high-rated online seller.,
Check out the seller’s website.,
Ask the seller questions.,
Ask for more photos.,
Pay attention to your instincts.",How to Know if a Versace Bag Is Real3," This is the best way to buy a legitimate Versace bag. You can find a location of a store near you by going to the Versace website. There are primary stores and outlets selling older season merchandise as well. Or, you could buy a bag directly from Versace online.


If you decide to the buy the online route, it may be a good idea to at least visit a store in person to look at the bags firsthand.Try to stay away from generic designer bag outlets. These stores, whether online or in person, are often not affiliated with the brand itself. This makes it more difficult to determine authenticity.

, You want to find a seller who has been in business for a while and who has gotten a good number of positive reviews. On sites such as eBay, look for narrative reviews that describe how the quality of the bag matched up to the photos provided. It is also a good idea to buy from a site where the sellers are held accountable for negative reviews., If you are looking for the main Versace website, pay attention to the final URL to make sure that you’ve reached the correct site. Sometimes fake bag sellers will use websites with typos or other subtle errors. You should also click on each of the website’s links and portals to make sure that they are accessible and accurate.For example, a blank “Support” page is a clear red flag that the site may be trafficking in fake goods.

, Whether you buy in person or online, a seller should be able to answer any questions that you have about the Versace bag. Ask about the sources of their bags. Ask about how long they’ve been in business. Discuss any warranties and the return policies. Keep asking questions until you feel comfortable with your purchase., Start off by saying that the photos they’ve provided are good, but you’d like just a few more images. Request that the photos show specific parts of the bag, such as the zipper areas or the threading at the bottom of the bag. Request both close and distance shots.Check to make sure that the photos you’ve been given are not on another website or elsewhere. Also, look for signs of doctoring, such as blurry spots or obscured areas.

, There are many ways to purchase a Versace bag and it is best to pause for a moment if you have any doubts about the seller, bag, or price. If the purchase price seems unbelievable, it should arouse your suspicions and require some extra checking. Just wait a bit and continue to do your research. Consider your efforts as an investment toward making a good final purchase.


Versace does have seasonal sales, but these deals will not generally lower the price of a bag by half or more. When in doubt, contact a Versace store directly to ask for a price comparison.If a seller mentions that the bag is cheaper due to a flaw, this is likely not the case. Many brands, such as Versace, will destroy flawed bags instead of selling them.

",How to Clean a Vera Bradley," You should find out if your bag is made of washable materials. If there are no care instructions, go online or call manufacturer for information before ruining your bag.
, Dust it down to remove any dust, specks, fluff, etc. This is a good time to consider whether spot washing might be a better solution than a whole wash

, Use only cold water.

, This is the only addition that you need - no detergent

Wipe down your bag once a week with a microfiber cloth.,
Dry the surface immediately after using a damp cloth.,
Wipe gently and with the grain of the leather.,
Avoid using bleach, vinegar and baby wipes.",How to Clean a White Leather Purse1," If your bag is pretty clean, use a dry microfiber cloth to wipe it down weekly. To remove minor dirt, mix a drop or two of mild soap and 8-12 ounces of warm water together. Lightly dampen the microfiber cloth with the solution and wipe the dirt off the leather., After using the mild soap solution, go back over the surface with a dry microfiber cloth to ensure no water is left standing on the leather's surface. Avoid using soggy paper towels for this. Microfiber is the ideal material because it won’t crumble and wicks away moisture quickly., To avoid damaging the leather, always wipe the bag lightly. Wipe in the same direction as the grain of the leather. Use smooth, uniform strokes. Be sure to wipe the parts you touch the most, such as the handles, strap and clasp. These areas are easily soiled by the natural oils on your hands., Some commonly suggested “home remedies” involve using these substances. Don’t use them. The chemicals in these products can damage the surface, dry out the leather and cause grease stain issues."

Match the tie clip to the outfit.,
Choose the type of clip (slide clasp or pinch clasp) based on the weight and width of the tie.,
Select a clip that is between 1/2 - 3/4 the width of your tie.",How to Wear a Tie Clip1," A metal tie clip in plain silver or gold is generally a safe, stylish choice. You may opt for a colored, textured, or embellished clip to add a little panache to your look. Consider how the clip could influence your outfit: a pattered clip can make a plain outfit more interesting, while a simple metal clip may tone down a busy-looking tie.Try to match the clip to the metal details of your outfit—a watch, jacket buttons, cufflinks, belt buckle.If you don't have any metal to match (maybe you are skipping the jacket, so no buttons or cufflinks), go with silver. It compliments just about every outfit and complexion.Keep the occasion in mind as well. A loud tie clip probably isn't appropriate for a sombre event like a funeral.
Tie clips should not be worn with a vest, waistcoat, or buttoned cardigan. These items of clothing already hold your tie in place, making a clip redundant.;
, A pinch clasp will ensure everything stays securely in place, but may cause a skinny or lightweight tie to wrinkle, and it may not lie flat against your shirt.Instead, opt for a slide clasp to keep your skinny tie smooth and flat. With wider and heavier ties, a pinch clasp will work best., Never wear a tie clip that is longer than the width of your tie. It's considered a major fashion faux pas.This is one of the only real ""rules"" when it comes to accessorizing with a tie clip.


A traditional tie is about 3-3 1/2 inches at its widest point. Look for a tie clip that is about 1 3/4 inches long.A classic skinny tie is usually between 2-2 1/2 inches wide. Your tie clip should be between 1 1/2 -1 3/4 inches.Super skinny ties are between 1 1/2 - 1 3/4 inches wide. Choose a clip no longer than 1 1/4 inches long.Try holding the clip against your tie where it falls at the third or fourth button of your shirt. If it looks too long, you'll need a different clip.For a retro look, you can get away with a tie clip that is the exact width of your tie, but no longer."

Throw away trash once a week.,
Vacuum out crumbs and dirt.,
Compartmentalize items into separate pouches.,
Minimize the contents of your purse to essentials.,
Have designated locations for money and receipts.",How to Clean a Purse1," One of the most important steps to take towards keeping a clean, organized purse is frequently checking for and discarding half eaten snacks, gum wrappers, and expired coupons. It’s easy to let scraps of trash build up in your purse, but try to throw them away more regularly., Even after you’ve gone through your purse and thrown out any trash, the inside lining of your purse may be dirty. Use a small, gentle vacuum to suck out the particles of food and dirt that may have collected in the bottom.








, By keeping potentially messy items in separate pouches, you can easily find items and also avoid stains.You could have a pouch for snacks, writing utensils, makeup, and more.

, Try not to keep items in your purse that you only need from time to time. If you don’t use it nearly every day, it doesn’t belong in your purse. If you must have it, try to have the smallest, lightest bottle or container of it.


For instance, you don’t need a full-sized bottle of perfume in your purse.

, As soon as you leave a store or restaurant, don’t just throw your change and receipts loosely into your purse. Having specific locations within your purse to keep these items is essential to staying organized.

Address spills as soon as they occur.,
Try white shoe polish on tough stains.,
Sprinkle baby powder on oil stains.,
Use a professional leather cleaning product on major stains.",How to Clean a White Leather Purse2," The faster you remove the spilled substance, the less likely it is to stain the leather. Blot spills immediately with a dry microfiber cloth. You may want to tuck a small microfiber cloth into your purse for emergencies., This works particularly well on ink stains, since they are extremely difficult to get out. Buy a white shoe polish product at a shoe or department store. Squeeze the container until a small amount of the polish comes out. Cover the stain completely with it. Gently buff the area with the sponge applicator tip to cover the stain., If you’ve discovered an oil-based stain on your leather bag, sprinkle enough baby powder on top of the spot so that’s completely covered. Leave it on overnight. The next day, brush away the baby powder with a dry microfiber cloth. The stain should be gone. If not, reapply and give it another day.If the stain persists, you’ll need to have your bag cleaned professionally.
Never use water on an oil-based stain., You can buy these specially formulated products at department stores and shoe shops. They may cost a little more than a solution you can mix up at home, but these products are very effective. Apply the cleaner directly to the stain.In most cases, you will not need to rinse the bag because the leather soaks up the cleansing cream. Check your particular product's instructions to confirm.If your product does call for wiping, do so very gently and with the grain of the leather. Rough scrubbing can drive the stain more deeply into the leather.

Avoid touching your purse after you’ve used hand lotion.,
Keep your bag in a dust-free space when not in use.,
Store your bag out of direct sunlight.,
Condition the leather every few months.",How to Clean a White Leather Purse3," This is a very common cause of oil-based stains on leather purses. When doing a routine wipe-down, check the handles and clasps particularly, since the natural oils from your hands may also cause oily stains., Dust can settle on the white leather and affect its appearance. If your leather bag came with a dust bag (many designer purses do), store your purse inside it when you aren’t using it. If you don’t have a dust bag, an old pillowcase or garment bag will work., The sun’s rays can damage the leather's surface. Make sure you store it in a non-humid area with no direct sunlight. Stuff the bag with newspaper while in storage. This will help the leather bag keep its original shape., Wipe the leather down first with a dry microfiber cloth to ensure there’s no lingering dust or dirt. Rub a small amount of the conditioner onto the surface of the purse. Allow it to sit for several minutes, which allows the leather to soak up the hydration. Gently wipe the conditioner off with a clean microfiber cloth.Regular conditioning will keep the leather supple and prevent cracking.
Leather conditioner products can be purchased at shoe and department stores.

Open the clip (if it's a pinch tie clip) and slide both the front and back of your tie, plus the placket of your shirt into the clip.,
Clip the tie between the third and fourth buttons of your shirt, or around the middle or bottom of your sternum.,
Add a little flair by blousing the top of your tie.",How to Wear a Tie Clip2," (The placket is the strip of fabric that you button through).All three should be sandwiched together in the clip.









Make sure the tie is actually clipped to your shirt. The purpose of the tie clip is to keep your tie securely in place, so if you just slide the tie through the clip and don't anchor it to anything, your tie will still flap freely and get in your way.

, Placement is the other ""rule"" of wearing a tie clip—too high makes the tie clip useless (your tie will still flop around or fall in your soup when you lean forward), too low looks awkward or hides the clip behind your jacket.When adjusting the tie clip, make sure that it is un-clipped, so as not to stretch and damage the material of the tie and the dress shirt.
Check that the tie clip is perpendicular to your tie. It should always be straight across, not angled up or down.If necessary, adjust your tie so that it lies flat against your shirt with no bunching or puckering.

, Take the top half of your tie and pull it up slightly, so that it's not pulled tight against your chest. It should puff up and forward slightly. This adds some depth and personality to your look, and may make the tie feel less constricting.

Trickier stains might require the careful use of a brush instead of a cloth., Condition your purse with leather conditioner once every couple of months to keep it from cracking and drying out.

, Contrary to popular belief, putting your leather purse in the washer with a little bit of oil soap and then putting it in the dryer for ten minutes usually does the trick. This is great for a general cleaning, but other methods should be used for stain removal and other issues."

, Try to keep your stroking motions in line with the leather's grain.This will help protect the integrity of the leather.








, Don't worry about drying the bag just yet.








, Avoid speeding the process up with a hairdryer. If you are in a hurry, consider setting the bag down in front of a fan. Cool air will be less damaging to the bag than hot.

, Use a soft cloth to apply the moisturizer. Rub the moisturizer on using circular motions. The moisturizer will help keep the leather soft and supple. Do not substitute regular hand lotion, which can stain and degrade leather.

Gently brush the cornstarch off the following morning using a soft-bristled brush.









If you can't find cornstarch where you live, use corn flour instead.
Some people find that placing their purse under a light bulb helps the cornstarch absorb the oil better.If you are working with suede, you may need to dampen the area with steam afterward, then brush the rest of the cornstarch off., If you got mud on a leather or patent leather purse, wipe it off immediately. If you got mud on a suede purse, wait for the mud to dry first, then use a soft- bristled brush to buff it out.

, If you got wax or gum on your purse, stick your purse in the freezer for a few hours. This will cause the wax/gum to harden. Once the wax/gum hardens, pull your purse out of the freezer, and peel the wax/gum off. You may need to scratch off the excess wax/gum with your fingernail.

, Simply dampen a paper towel or cotton ball with hydrogen peroxide, and gently dab the affected area. Eventually, the stain will come out. This is most effective on suede.








, The longer they sit, the more difficult they will be to remove. Try to soak up the ink stain using a Q-tip dampened with rubbing alcohol. If you are working with suede, you may need to buff the area with a nail file.








If your bag is made out of finished leather, do not use rubbing alcohol. Instead, use a white ""magic"" eraser sponge. Finished leather handbags do not darken with water."

Wear a snapback classically.,
Look hip with an urban style.,
Achieve a European look.,
Figure out your desired look.,
Look at the color and style.,
Try on the snapback.,
Wear clothes that complement your snapback.,
Remember your age.,
Consider the outing.,
Be who you are, not someone you aren't.",How to Wear a Snapback," Wearing a hat with the brim facing forward is the most classic way to wear a snapback, but it doesn't have to be boring. Typically hats are worn like this at sporting events with team names, numbers, or logos on the front of the hat, but you can also wear a snapback like this as a fashion statement.For a girl, the classic look to follow this snapback is wearing your hair in a ponytail or a braid. This style helps achieve a cute, sporty look that complements your outfit, but you can also wear your hair down, or in any other style if you desire.
For a guy with long hair, your hair can be worn down or pulled back into a ponytail or a bun.
Clothes that complement this look are t-shirts, sports polos, or outfits that look pretty casual.;
, Snapbacks are often popular to wear in this kind of style, helping to create a hip-hop, urban look that portrays confidence and attitude. Some people wear snapbacks facing backwards, but others might consider that outdated or a fashion no-no. You can wear your hat similarly to that of a classic snapback, but your style that goes along with it is really what gives you that urban look.








Try throwing on a pair of sunglasses and a casual, but hip jacket. The look you want to achieve here is cool and casual, but still fashionable. You generally also want to aim for a very flat-brimmed hat, as this well help you achieve the best urban look. Another, less common, option for an urban look is to where your snapback facing forward, but with a slight tilt.
For girls, achieving an urban look plays a lot into your style and the type of hat you choose. Pick a hat that's somewhat edgy with a wild print, bright color, or embellishments, and wear your hair in a loose braid or down.
Guys should also choose a hat that's somewhat edgy with a brand logo or a bright color. You can pair this with a white t-shirt and some bling, or you can go for a more relaxed look with a vintage T denim jacket, and dark shades.

, Snapbacks are popular in European cultures, where the style is very chic and simplistic. Choose a hat with bright colors and wear it facing forward, but with the brim pointed upwards, where the hat is resting on your head at an angle. Then, pair with skinny jeans, a stylish hair cut, and some hip European style sneakers. If it's a cold month, consider throwing on a scarf or sweater.








The key to achieving this look is really the hair and clothes. If you wear the hat like this but pair it with a t-shirt and shorts, people won't know what look you are trying to achieve. Europeans often wear muted colors with little pattern, and usually pair outfits with a nice jacket (like leather) and some stylish shoes. Also, the majority of stylish men in Europe have fashionable haircuts, with the hair on the top of the head longer and usually gelled to one side, and the sides cut short. Styling your hair to look European can also help improve your European look.Girls can follow this similar style, by wearing their hair down with tightly fitted jeans and a jacket, and can throw in some stylish jewelry.

, Snapbacks come in all different styles, so before you choose a snapback, you'll want to figure out what look you are trying to achieve. Snapbacks can be worn to support sports teams, as fashion statements, or to represent a certain brand (like Vans). Whatever look you're going for, make sure you choose a snapback that represents you.









Snapbacks have made a comeback due to their appearance in hip hop culture, and because of that they have a certain edginess. This gives you flexibility on what kind of snapback to choose, meaning you don't need to fit in a box when wearing a snapback. If a hat pops out to you, but it's not your typical style, buy it anyways! Snapbacks can help represent individuality, so throw caution to the wind and defy those stereotypical norms.

, Because snapbacks come in all different colors and styles, it can be challenging to choose a snapback that will fit many outfits. However, the great thing about snapbacks is it's really more about the way you wear them, and not necessarily the color of the snapback that complements your outfit.









You may still want to choose a snapback that goes with your general style: if your usual look is more sporty, then choose a snapback with your favorite team, or if you tend to dress edgy or have an urban style, choose a snapback with embellishments or even a fun, bright color.

, Before you purchase a snapback, you'll want to try it on to make sure it fits your head well, and that you like the way you look in it. Most snapbacks come in a one size fits all, because they have adjustable snaps on the back, but different brands may fit differently on your head, so find a snapback that feels comfortable and fits well., As previously mentioned in going for a specific look, the key to great style with a snapback is wearing an outfit that complements your snapback, or wearing a snapback that complements your outfit. These are some tips, but know that there is always flexibility in your style:









For guys and girls, snapbacks can be worn with casual clothes. Whether you are wearing a t-shirt and jeans, a sports jersey, flannel, or a stylish jacket, a snapback can be paired with may different outfits to help the outfit come together. For a more urban look, you might consider wearing a graphic tee and a snapback that has a logo on it.
Try color coordinating but not too much. Your outfit can really come together if you have a hat that goes well with the colors in your outfit, but you don't want to be too matchy-matchy. Use a bright colored hat to compliment neutral colors in your outfit, or wear a hat that matches the color of your jewelry, shoes, or another accessory. Never wear all of the same color, and try to match your hat with the style of your outfit: you probably don't want to wear an embellished, super colorful hat while wearing a t-shirt for your favorite sports team.
Play up different hairstyles. For a girl there are a lot of different options for snapbacks, like wearing your hair down, throwing it in a pony tail and looping it through the back of your snapback, or wearing it in a braid. For a guy with short hair there obviously aren't many options, but a guy with long hair can wear his hair down, or throw it in a bun (which is a popular style today for longer hair) or in a ponytail.
Wear a great pair of sneakers. Stylish sneakers really go well with any snapback, so choose a colorful pair or a subdued pair, and wear them frequently with your snapback. Closed toe shoes look the best with snapback hats, so you might avoid wearing sandals or open toed heels -- it doesn't really produce the same look.

, Unfortunately not all fashion accessories can be worn at all ages, the snapback being one of them. In some countries, like Europe, boys and men often share the same style, but in countries like America, wearing a snapback at an older age can make it seem like you are stuck in the past or don't know how to best dress for your age.


You can still be quite stylish at an older age, and you can definitely still wear hats, but wearing a snapback is generally common among teens and young adults, so you might try sticking to styles that complement your age instead of making it look like you are trying to look much younger.
If you really want to wear a snapback, you definitely can. Some people want to stand out and don't want to fit in with societal norms, which is totally fine, but just remember that others may not consider it the best style option.

, Snapbacks are great fashion accessories that can really boost your style, but should only be worn at appropriate times. If you are attending a formal event, or going to a job interview, avoid wearing a hat as this can often be too casual. There are other ways to show your style and uniqueness, so before you throw on your snapback, think about the place you are going and the people that will be there.

, Before you wear a snapback, make sure you are wearing it for the right reasons. You want to feel comfortable in your snapback and it should complement your personality. If you're going to feel insecure in the snapback you have chosen or feel like a poser then maybe it's best to save the style change for a later time or choose a snapback that better fits you.









The point is, snapbacks require confidence, and if you don't feel confident in one then it will likely be noticeable. Wear it because it fits you, not because you are trying to fit into a certain group of people.

Brush the suede to remove fibers and dirt.,
Rub a clean eraser over stained and scuffed areas.,
Use a suede leather cleanser on your bag.,
Apply some vinegar or rubbing alcohol to a clean cloth.",How to Clean a Suede Purse1," The first rule of cleaning a suede purse is to avoid using any water on the suede fabric because the water will discolor your suede.Don’t wet the suede at all or even use a damp cloth on it.


If you feel like a little moisture is necessary, then you can hold your suede purse above some steam. For example, you could hold the suede purse above a mug of hot water for a few seconds and then brush it clean. However, do not allow the purse to become wet.;
, A brush is the best tool for cleaning suede. You can use a brush to do a basic cleaning on your suede purse, or use it as a spot treatment for stains. Brush the suede going in one direction to clean away dust and dirt from your purse. You can also use small back and forth motions to take care of stains.


You can use a nail brush or get a special suede cleaning brush., A clean pencil eraser can also be a useful item for cleaning a suede purse. You can rub a pencil eraser over any minor stains, scuffs, or discolored areas to help restore them to normal.Make sure to use a clean, never used eraser to do this.

Get the right size.,
Fix your current hat to fit better.,
Pick the right hat.,
Shape your hat.",How to Wear a Cowboy Hat Properly1," The first step to properly wearing a cowboy hat is making sure the hat is the right size and fits your head properly. Cowboy hats should typically fit snug around your head. If you are buying one, know your hat size ahead of time but also try the hat on before you buy it.;
, You may have a hat already that is just barely too big but not big enough that you would want to get a smaller size. You can fix this. You can buy foam strip that is specifically made to put into hats to make them fit tighter. Depending on how much you need, and the shape of your head, you can either put this foam all the way around, or you can put a little in the front and back, just on the sides, or even just the front or just the back.


Figure out where your hat is fitting too loosely. If the whole hat is sitting too low on your head, you probably want to put some sizing foam around the whole hat.
There should be a band around the inside of the hat that you can flip up and place the foam strip under. Then flip the band back down before wearing the hat.

, You have a lot of options when it comes to cowboy hats. The main material choices are felt (made of beaver or rabbit pelt), leather, and straw. Felt hats are warmer so they tend to be worn more in the cold seasons. Straw hats are better for staying cool during dot days., Most cowboy hats can be conformed to a certain shape by gently bending and squeezing them. How exactly you do this will depend on the material of the hat itself. You want the front and back of the brim to be fairly flat. Curl the sides so they stick up just slightly. You don’t want to curl them too tightly. You can also gently dent the sides of the crown of the hat. No tools are required for this. Simply use your hands."

Consider a neutral color.Bright colors and prints tend to look a little juvenile and will make your style significantly less chic.,
Keep it unadorned.,
Gravitate toward loose-fit styles.,
Remember, any rule can be broken depending on the occasion.",How to Wear a Beanie," Leave the beanie a little loose on top and in the back. Push your bangs beneath the hat, especially if they are a little greasy or flat., If you plan on being out in the cold for an extended period this will help keep you warm and stylish. The beanie will be mostly pulled down and snug as a result, and it should cover your forehead, ears, and neck. This style can work especially well if you let your bangs loose in the front of the beanie.

, For a fun little twist on the everyday, wear the hat over your forehead. The excess material of the hat can either stand up (this style is more fashionable on men than women), or you can give it a slight fold in the back. This style, called the ""Peter Pan,"" causes the beanie to sit a little higher on your head and keeps it off your neck. The hat will only cover part of your ears as a result, though. This style works well with both hidden bangs and revealed bangs.This can create a more dramatic effect by choosing a beanie the contrasts your hair color. For dark hair a light colored beanie, and a dark beanie for lighter hair.

, If you want a look that seems a little more stylish than usual, wear your hat in a looser style further up on your head and leave your bangs out. Sweep them off the the side a bit for a playful twist.


If you have short enough bangs, you can let them hang straight down over your eyebrows. The beanie will flatten your bangs out, though, so this style tends not to work if you have longer bangs that would come down over your eyes. It also works best if you have long hair rather than short or medium hair.

, The easiest thing to do to your hair when wearing your beanie is to simply leave it down. Leaving your hair down prevents any strange bulges from appearing underneath the fabric of your hat, and it also provides you with extra warmth on your neck and ears for the chilly autumn or winter winds.

, You can either braid your hair or leave it straight, but if you do decide to wear your hair back, make sure that the ponytail sits low on your head or to the side to keep it from creating an uncomfortable bulge beneath your hat.

, This will allow the beanie to cover some or all of your hair without it looking misshaped or lumpy. Beyond choosing the right beanie many beanie styles work as well with curly hair as they do with straight hair.It is quite stylish to pull your curly hair back so the beanie pulls down over your forehead. Then let your curls release playfully from the back of the beanie.
You can also pull the beanie behind the scalp line to create an attractive tangle of curls with your bangs.
If you are trying to contain the curls try a head wrap to hold your hair close to your head with a beanie pulled down over the top of the wrap. Neither the wrap nor your hair would be visible.

, Guys fashion tends toward a more subdued style. Sequins, bead work, and decorative stitching can be a bit too difficult for men to comfortably pull off. Knit patterns can work, but the color palate should relate inversely to the complexity of the pattern. The more intricate the pattern is the more subdued the colors should be.Choose neon colors if you are hunting or otherwise participating in winter activities that require you to be very visible. If your hanging around in a coffee shop, or going on a date leave the neon colored beanie at home. Neon colors are generally appropriate for practical rather than fashionable purposes.

, Depending on the hairstyle you wear certain approaches to head wear will be preferable. If your hair tends to be done up in the front let it peak out from the beanie. If you put a lot of time into your hair make sure you have some visible. Remember though the beanie might unsettle your hair if you normally wear it with out product, so it is perfectly acceptable to cover the entire top of your head with the beanie.

, Wearing the beanie with out rolling the edges is a trendy way to wear a beanie. Generally, when wearing a beanie this way you will pull it down to cover part or all of your forehead.

, This is a traditional style for wearing a beanie. Roll the brim once, making a cuff of two to three inches. This is a normal presentation for heavier knit beanies, but will also work with lighter beanies that fit loosely. This style reduces the overall size of the beanie, and typically allows some hair to be viable underneath the hat.

, This style thickens the cuff, and reveals more of your hair. You typically would wear the hat farther back on your head allowing your hair to be prominently displayed.

, Men tend to have an easier time pulling this style off, and it can be quite dramatic. The bulk of the fabric will simply be standing on end off you head. this is a fun and very young look, so if you are aiming at serious or respectable then this look might be a step too far.

, If your hair is especially curly or has a lot of body, a beanie with extra material in the cap will allow you to tuck your hair in without leaving it flat and lifeless.

, So as with any fashion advice the rules can easily be broken. Just be careful to keep your intentions in mind. If you are dressing for a job interview or a date being traditional is generally a virtue. (That, of course, depends on the date.)

, Black, white, grey, brown, or tan works best, and neutral colors are more versatile overall. If you do want a color, opt for a classic color, like red or blue, and choose a gem tone or a bold color without gravitating toward neon shades.

, Avoid styles with pompoms, beadwork, or zippers. A simple knit beanie looks classic and stylish, but styles with decorations or embellishments tend to look a little less sophisticated. If you do opt for embellishments, look for a subtle embellishment like decorative brown buttons.

, Beanies with elastic in them tend to tighten around your forehead. Aside from being uncomfortable and leaving a red line across your skin, a tight-fitting beanie tends to look a little less fashionable., For very casual events, like an outdoor football game, poofs or other adornments can be fun additions to your look. What matters most is that you feel comfortable and happy with your look.

Pick the right outfit.",How to Wear a Cowboy Hat Properly2," You need to make sure that your hair does not get in the way of your hat sitting properly on your head. If you have short hair, this won’t apply to you. For longer hair, it can be a good idea to slick your hair back so it lays smoothly. Don’t pile your hair up on your head in any way. If you need to tie it in place, a ponytail that hangs straight down is the best option., One of the most basic rules is making sure that the hat is on your head correctly with the front to the front. Most cowboy hats have a small bow on the inside lining around the headband. The bow should be in the back of your head. If your hat does not have this bow, a general rule is that the hat will be narrower at the front., Positioning your hat in different ways can affect the way you look in the way. If you want to appear casual and friendly, tilt the front of the hat up just slightly so you can see about half of you forehead. To look more serious, or almost mysterious, lower the brim to just above your eyebrows. Slanting the hat slightly to the left or right will give you an appearance of being confident, almost to the point of looking for women or for trouble.

If you are going to wear a cowboy hat, boots are pretty much a must. It’s going to look wrong if you try to go out with some sneakers on.
You should also tuck in your shirt and most likely wear a nice black or brown leather belt. Fancy belt buckle is optional.

Women usually position fedoras so they are jauntily askew, rather than sitting squarely on the head. To do this, tilt the brim so the hat is positioned over your eyebrows. If the brim tips down over your eyes when you move, the hat is too big.

If you don't want to commit to an embellishment, try tying the ribbon around the hat. Then you can swap out your ribbon for different colored sashes or bands, depending on your outfit.
The brighter the color of your fedora, the fewer embellishments you should add.

, Pairing your fedora with a leather jacket will give you a rock and roll edge. Try wearing a t-shirt or flannel shirt under your jacket for a 90’s grunge vibe.If you don’t have a leather jacket or don’t want to buy one for ethical reasons, try using a faux leather jacket instead.
Make sure whatever jacket you end up choosing fits you well. You want the jacket to be tight, but not too tight.

, For a cozy weekend look, try rocking your fedora with an oversized, cable-knit sweater.Add boyfriend jeans on the bottom and a soft, worn-in t-shirt for a casual, comfortable look.


You can also try substituting the sweater for a flannel shirt or solid hoodie.
Fedoras look great with layers, so feel free to start with a tank top, add a cardigan and throw a vest over that.

, Try wearing your fedora with a dress that has a loud print. For optimal fun, experiment with mixing prints, like a polka dot dress and a striped jacket.Be careful not to go overboard with the patterns. You don’t want to distract from your hat.
Try wearing a pair of patterned pants on the bottom with a solid tee on the top. The solid will help balance out the patterns and allow your hat to be the star of the show.

If you hold your head up high and exude confidence, your classy style will be sure to turn heads. Don’t be surprised if after you start wearing a fedora, others you know start wearing them, too. It’s a good thing to be a trendsetter!

Choose a hat with a smaller brim if you have a diamond shaped face.,
Wear hats with larger brims if you have an oblong face.,
Choose a pointed hat if you have a round face.,
Choose a hat that has curves if you have a square face.",How to Wear a Wide Brim Hat1," If you have an angular face with wide cheekbones, then you most likely have a diamond shaped face. Wearing a hat with a smaller brim and pinched crown like a fedora or trilby hat may be good options for you., An oblong face is longer than it is wide. Most people with oval faces also possess a round chin. Wear Fedoras with wider brims or western hats to pull attention off the length of your face. Avoid hats that have narrow brims.

, If your face is as long as it is broad then you have a round face. Try on asymmetrical hats because they create contrast with your symmetrical face. Hats with a high crown and peaked or a slanted brim look best on you. Avoid hats with tall rounded crowns or a rounded brim because it will bring attention to the roundness of your face., If you have wide cheekbones and a large jaw, then you probably have a square face.

Generally, symmetry in your face is regarded as attractive, so your goal when choosing frames should be to create a proportional appearance between the left and right side of your face as well as the top and bottom. Four of the most common face types are:Round faces tend to have full cheeks and a soft, rounded chin. The height of your face, if you are round shaped, will be about the same as its width.Square faces have a strong jawline. You should notice that your features that are sharper and more angular. Lastly, if your face is square shaped, your forehead should be wider than the lower half of the face.Oval faces have relatively balanced features while being taller than wide. If your face is oval, you should notice high cheekbones and a chin that is thinner than your forehead.Heart shaped faces are most noticeable by a characteristic broad forehead and tapered chin that comes to a point. You should also notice that your cheekbones are relatively high on your face.;
, Glasses that are too big for your face will throw off your facial symmetry and make onlookers wonder why you didn’t choose a more flattering shape for your frames. You should use your frames to help balance out the less distinct features of your face or to detract attention away from your more prominent features. Some suggestions for the four most common face shapes include:



Round shaped faces can benefit from frames that have strong, noticeable details. The lens shape should be wider than tall. Nose pads are also a must, as these will keep your frames from accentuating your already round cheeks too much.

Square shaped faces should consider frames that soften your natural sharp angles in the jaw and elongate your relatively short facial height. Frames that are wider than they are deep are an excellent choice, as well as lenses that are wide and thin.

Oval faces are usually considered to be naturally balanced. To preserve this balance, you should find glasses with frames that match the wideness of the broadest part of your face. You might also find that frames with a walnut shape keep your facial features nice and balanced.

Heart shaped faces will benefit from frames that are wider at the bottom than the top. Add to this style of frame a rimless border and you should notice a lighter look in your glasses that lessens the natural wideness at the top of your face., Thick lenses are not only heavy and bulky, but these can also lead people associate you with nerdy pursuits. Even if your vision isn’t very good, you don't have to suffer with noticeable, thick lenses. Thanks to technology you can purchase lightweight lenses, sometimes referred to as featherweight lenses, which will be much thinner and elegant than your normal ones.


Lightweight lenses make use of a special kind material to create thinner, lighter lenses. The most common material used in this process, polycarbonate, is light, resistant to damage from impact, and relatively affordable compared to other lightweight lenses., If you can afford multiple pairs of glasses, you can get creative with your use of color. You can match the color of your frames with your outfit, the weather, and even your mood. However, for a more all-around good look, you should choose either a “cool” color or a “warm” color.


Cool colors are blue based while warm colors are yellow based. Of these two color bases, most people will fall into either one of these two categories. Approximately 60% of the US population are considered to be better suited by cool tones than warm.
Your skin tone can also have a significant impact on the color of your base tone. Warm skin tones tend to have a color described as “peaches and cream”, while olive colors are considered cool.
Examples of warm colored frames include: camel, khaki, gold, copper, peach, orange, coral, off-white, red, blonde tortoise.
Examples of cool colored frames include: black, silver, rose-brown, blueish gray, plum, magenta, pink, blue, amber, darker colored tortoise., One common feature that you might forget to consider is your skin quality. If your skin tends to be oily, shiny frames can draw attention to this and have a negative impact on your look. A matte finish will suit shinier skin types best. In addition to the shine of your skin, you’ll also need to account for the fullness of your hair.


Many people’s hair becomes thinner as they age, but your glasses can steal attention away from your hairline. Choose bold, thick frames to return attention to your eyes, and strong, sharp angles to firm up weakness in the jawline., Even the smallest and most delicate frames and lenses will cast at least a small shadow around your eyes. This can make your eyes look dark or tired, especially if you have a problem with dark circles under your eyes. To brighten up the area around your eyes, you can:



Use concealer. This way your complexion will appear more naturally balanced, and the dark spots under your eyes less dark. Remember to use a little concealer on the lid of your eye as well!
Make use of natural skin-brightening techniques. Using a masque of natural ingredients to improve the coloration of your skin might mean you don’t have to spend money on more expensive, cover-up products., There are many kind of eyeliner you can use to restore attention to the eyes hiding behind your lenses, but gel liner is considered to be one of the best. This is especially true if you wear lenses for nearsightedness. These kind of lenses can make your eyes look smaller than they actually are.Avoid dramatic eye makeup, as it can look too busy when combined with the border of your frames. A prominent smokey eye can leave your eyes looking to dark around their perimeter. , It can be irritating when you have to clean your glasses every few minutes to wipe away oil transferred from your eyelashes to your lenses. To keep this from happening, you should curl your lashes. This has the bonus effect of giving you a bright, alert, and attentive eye appearance.


Lengthening mascaras should be avoided if your lashes already brush against your lenses. Instead, you might have better luck with product that adds volume or thickness. Focus your application on the roots as opposed to the tips of your lashes.
Prevent mascara from coming off onto your lenses by using a creamy formula that is waterproof. You may also have difficulty with mascara flaking off onto your lenses if you’ve owned it for longer than three months.
When curling, you can achieve the best results by focusing your efforts on the base of your lashes. Don’t clamp too tight or you may make your lashes curl too intensely. Following this, you might use an eyelash curler on the midpoint of your lashes to give an impressive curl., This is especially important if you’ve chosen a pair of frames that are thick. Give your brows a full appearance with an eyebrow pencil and add shape and definition to create better balance between this feature and your chosen glasses.

, A little bit of blush to your cheeks. This will bring warmth to the overall appearance of your face. Strong or bold frames can be balanced by stronger tones on the lips and cheeks, though you should be careful not to apply too much product. Lip color, especially, can either complement your bold choice in frames or create contrast, depending on the requirements of your outfit and the day., You might feel self-conscious wearing your glasses, especially if you’re new to wearing them. But the truth is that many famous people who are considered attractive wear glasses these days.With the right style of frame, color, and a classy pair of specs, you might even end up looking hotter in your glasses than you did before you had them!


Confidence has been found to give individuals a boost where looks are concerned. Although you might not think your mindset has an influence on how people perceive your appearance, you might only need to improve your confidence before people start thinking you look smokin' hot in your glasses., You'll look even more attractive when you eat right and keep yourself physically active. Being healthy will improve your mood, self-image, contribute to a healthy weight, all of which will likely help you gain confidence and become hotter in the eyes of others. To improve your overall healthy, you might:Join a sport or physical hobby, like riding a bicycle, walking daily, yoga, and more. Daily physical activity will make you feel better about yourself, even if you don’t notice any large changes in your physical appearance., Dry and frizzy hair often appears poorly maintained and un-stylish to others, so you should replenish dry hair when necessary. Your hair color also contributes to the overall color balance of your face and the resulting color of your lenses, so you should keep it healthy and clean.



Try new hair styles if you're not satisfied with your current look. Consider your style according to your face shape and pick out a look that adds balance to your shape in the same way you did for your glasses.

, Finding your ideal style can take time and effort. You’ll have to try on many different looks and outfits. You may even want to bring a friend so you have a second opinion, but you can also ask the employees at the places you shop for their opinion as well.


Style and fashion are a matter of taste. Men might want to check out how to dress well as a guy for some direction on looking your best. Women, on the other hand, might look into how to dress yourself and look good doing it.

, Shower as regularly as you need to. For most adults, this will be daily or every other day, although many younger children likely won’t need to shower as frequently.Use deodorant, moisturize so your skin to keep it healthy, drink plenty of water to stay hydrated and improve your skin complexion, and wear clean clothes.For a more complete idea of what you should do to keep good hygiene, you should check out how to have good hygiene (boys) or how to have good hygiene (girls).

Clean your glasses regularly.,
Take care when removing your glasses.,
Use a case.,
Wear protective lenses over your glasses when engaging in dangerous activity.,
Remove your glasses during activities that may cause damage.",How to Avoid Scratching Eyeglasses1," If you want to avoid scratches and other damage to your lenses, make sure to clean your glasses on a regular basis. Use the right materials when cleaning your glasses to assure you avoid scratches.


If you use chemical sprays or lens cleaners, be careful when you spray your lenses. Spray from an appropriate distance, as outlined on the cleaner container, and always use sprays specifically designed to clean lenses. Never use household cleaners like Windex.Use the right cloth. Paper towel, tissue, and napkins should not be used to dry lenses. These can cause tears and other damage to the frames. You should also avoid using the corner of your shirt. If you use fabric softener on your clothes it can cause streaks on your lenses. You should only use 100% cotton wipes made explicitly for cleaning lenses.Air dry your glasses when you clean them. This prevents materials from getting caught on your lenses, which can lead to tears and other damages.;
, Oftentimes, glasses get scratched when they're dropped. It may be helpful to use two hands when removing glasses so you can remove the frame straight off your face and not bend the sides. Grip your glasses firmly when removing. Remove your glasses slowly. Not only can dropping glasses cause scratches, you could also potentially bend the frames through hasty removal., Always use a glasses case. When you're not wearing your glasses, do not simply leave them lying around. Always use a protective case. You can ask your eye doctor for advice on the most durable type of glasses case.Cases come in a variety of forms. Try to go for a sturdier case, made of leather or hard plastic, that closes completely. Cases of flimsier plastic or fabric that do not close do not provide as much protection.

, If you work with tools or engage in sports activities that could cause damage, wear protective goggles over your glasses. Invest in ski goggles or protective shields for construction work. Try on protective goggles before purchase to make sure they're roomy enough to safely conceal your glasses., Taking a nap during the day, playing with your dog, or roughhousing with your kids could result in damage to your glasses. Take your glasses off during these activities and place them in their case.

If you have a bifocal lenses, the line should sit at the lower eyelid. If you have a trifocal lenses, the top line should sit at the bottom of the pupil.;
, If your glasses look crooked or tilted heavily to one side, it is likely the result of crooked temple arms. One way to test the temple arms is to lay your eyeglasses on a flat surface. Both of the temple arms should rest evenly on the flat surface. If they do not, you will need to adjust them.If your eyeglasses appear level on your face but sit crooked when resting on a flat surface, this may mean that one of your ears is higher than the other. The temple arms should be bent to accommodate any differences in ear height., Look for the height at which your eyeglasses rest when on your face. If the lenses rest too high up or too low down, it is likely a problem with the nosepiece and you will need to make an adjustment to this part of your glasses., Your glasses may sit centered on your face and at the correct height, but still feel a little bit loose or a little bit tight. You can adjust the tightness/looseness of your glasses by bowing the earpieces outwards or inwards, depending on your needs. The ideal place to make this adjustment is right at the hinge. Bowing the earpieces of the glasses outwards will relieve any unnecessary pressure to the sides of your head or temples while bowing earpieces inwards will help them fit more snugly to the side of your head., You may find that, despite everything else looking well-fitted, your glasses are still sliding down your face. If this is the case, you can simply make adjustments to the screws that attach the arms to the lenses of the glasses., The temple arms extend over and around the ears and hold the frame in place. After determining what adjustments need to be made, you will need to consider the style of glasses you wear, as correcting the problem differs from plastic to wire frames.For wire frames, gently bend the arms with small pliers until they are straight. Put the glasses on and observe in the mirror to see if they are correct.
For plastic frames, the plastic on the lower arm must be heated by a warm air source, such as a hair dryer, to make the plastic pliable. Slowly move the plastic upward with your hands until it is in the desired position. Be careful using the hair dryer as you could melt the plastic.
Another way to bend plastic frames is to run them under hot water for 15 to 25 seconds before trying to make adjustments. The arm should become pliable enough to adjust, but be careful. The plastic can snap even when heated., Check the curvature of the earpieces. If the eyeglasses are pinching or digging into your ears or the side of your head, bend the earpiece section of the arms outward. If the glasses are too loose and the glasses are slipping down off your nose, twist the earpieces inwards towards the head. Again, how you achieve this depends on the type of frame you have.For wire frames, this adjustment can be made with pliers, or even your bare hands.
For plastic frames, you will need to make the plastic pliable using either heated water or air, before bending the earpiece section of the frames.

, Doing this will fix glasses that are sliding down your nose and will keep the lenses secure within the frames. This fix will require a very small screwdriver. These small screwdrivers are usually found in standard eyeglass cleaning and repair kits.Take care not to over tighten the screws, or you risk damaging the plastic or metal that they are holding in place.

, If the eyeglasses sit too high on your face, the nose pads need to be moved further apart. If the eyeglasses sit too low, then pinch the nose pads closer together. Try to make sure you bend each of the nose pieces together or apart at equal distances to keep the symmetry of your glasses., Never make huge, drastic adjustments to your glasses all at once. It can often be harder to bend eyeglasses back into a proper position after a repair than it is to make the original adjustment. Make minor adjustments, check the glasses, and continue making minor adjustments until they are corrected., When making repairs to plastic frames, always apply the least amount of pressure possible to make the necessary adjustments to the glasses. Exerting too much force to heated plastic can cause the frames to snap. Then your glasses will be permanently destroyed., When using pliers to make adjustments to your eyeglass frames, wrap the ends of the pliers in tape. This will help you avoid permanently scratching the frames of the glasses. There is no way to fix these scratches, so while your glasses may fit properly, they will look like a dog chewed them up.

, There are some styles of eyeglasses that are made with materials that can’t be adjusted. Frames made of titanium, memory plastic or aluminum alloy are made so that the frame is resistant to bending, manipulation or adjustment., While simple adjustments to make your eyeglasses fit better can be carried out at home, there may come a time when it is prudent to simply buy new glasses. If you have made multiple adjustments to the frame, nose or earpieces, and the glasses still don’t feel right, it is probably time to bite the bullet and buy some new glasses. After years of use, some glasses simply can’t be saved.On a side note, it is suggested that you get your eyes checked at least on a yearly basis to make sure the prescription in your lenses is still ideal for your vision.

Aim to protect your eyes first and foremost.,
If you want your sunglasses to protect you from these risks, look for pairs that block at least 99% of UVB rays and at least 95% of UVA rays.,
Don't buy sunglasses if they're labeled as ""cosmetic"" or don't provide any information on UV protection.,
Select a size.,
Use the shape of your face to help you pick your sunglasses shape.,
Make sure the sunglasses fit properly.,
Note that the color of the lenses doesn't just affect your fashion statement, it affects how well you detect contrast and differentiate colors.,
Check for distortion.,
Choose scratch-resistant lenses.",How to Pick Sunglasses," Excessive exposure to UV radiation can cause a variety of problems for your eyes such as cataracts, burns, and cancer.;
, Also look for the amount of cover the sunglasses provide. Look at how much you can see around the frames––will the sunglasses let in sun from the top or sides?


Are you getting these sunglasses for sports or spending significant time outdoors? Choose ones with a nice close fit, possibly with rubber grips on the arms. If they are for fishing or use on water, polarization is a must; polarized glasses provide more sun protection.

, Look for scratch resistance, many lenses have very fragile coatings. If you are spending much money, you want them to last. Fortunately damaged lenses can be replaced for most models.], Sunglasses come in all shapes and sizes! Generally, finding a contrast between your face shape and the frame shape will look good. For example, if you have a round face, more angular frames will work well, and if your face is more square, a rounder softer frame shape will look good. Here are a few popular styles:


Mirrorshades - Mirrored coating on surface. Used a lot by police officers in the US. They usually come in an aviator or wraparound shape.
Aviators - Teardrop-shaped lens and thin metal frames. Often used by pilots, military personnel, and law enforcement personnel in the US. Good with any face shape, but best with an oval shape.
Wayfarers/Spicolis - Popular in the 1950s and 1960s. Worn by Audrey Hepburn in the 1961 movie Breakfast at Tiffany's.
Teashades - Popularized by John Lennon and Ozzy Osbourne. They're not very effective at keeping light out of your eyes, though.
Wraparounds - Associated with athletics and extreme sports.
Oversized - Associated with models and movie stars. Glamorous, darling.

, The following face shape matched to sunglasses style is recommended:


Oval face: The oval type usually has the ""perfect face shape"", and can wear any style of glasses. Avoid frames that are either too thick or too thin. Don't choose frames wider than your face width.
Square face: Because this face shape has very straight, pronounced jawline and edges, choose round glasses to balance out these features. Make sure the frames are not too thick. Try to choose wider sunglasses and avoid rectangular glasses with sharp corners.
Round face: A round face has plumper cheeks and chin. Choose polygonal or square sunglasses that have an angle design to balance this out. Look for thicker frames.
Long face: Choose larger lenses and the polygonal frame to modify a long face. Popular retro glasses and sports glasses can be considered.
Flat face: Choose darker lenses and frames to highlight the contours of the face. Bright colors can also make expressions more vivid!

, Try them on and make sure they don't pinch around your head. The weight should be evenly distributed between your ears and nose, and your eyelashes shouldn't touch the frame or lenses. Glasses should be your stand on the bridge of the nose and ears; if they feel inclined to one side, you need to adjust them. In addition, use the measuring rule that an ""eyelash is less than the lens"".


If your sunglasses don't fit well you can go to an eyeglass shop to have them adjusted.
Make sure that the lens area is not too small, so that it will be able to block sunlight.

, Some colors enhance contrast, which can be useful; however, this is often at the expense of color distinction, which can cause problems (when you're driving, for example, and need to be able to clearly differentiate the colors of a traffic light). Some sunglasses even come with interchangeable lenses so you can change the color easily, depending on what you're doing.


Gray lenses reduce light intensity without affecting contrast or distorting colors.
Brown lenses partially enhance contrast by blocking some blue light. Good for snow sports.Also generally good for hunting in bright light, against open backgrounds.Amber/yellow lenses significantly enhance contrast because they block most or all blue light, and that makes them popular among hunters who benefit from that contrast when looking at targets against the sky. They're bad, however, for any activity that requires color recognition (like driving!). Good for snow sports.
Red/orange lenses are good for snow sports but only on overcast days.If you're a hunter, orange lenses are good for clay targets against open backgrounds.Violet lenses are good for hunters who need to see clay targets on a green background.Copper sunglasses will mute the sky and grass against a golf ball.Blue and green sunglasses enhance contrast with a yellow tennis ball., Hold the lenses up to a fluorescent lamp. As you move the sunglasses up and down, check that wave distortion doesn't happen. If it doesn't happen, this is a good sign.

, Scratched up sunglasses are useless sunglasses. Lenses made from NXT polyurethane are impact-resistant, flexible, lightweight, and have great optical clarity, but they're expensive.


Glass is heavier, expensive, and will ""spider"" if broken.
Polycarbonate is not as scratch-resistant and provides less optical clarity than NXT polyurethane or glass, but it's more affordable.
Polyamide is a less used material, which provides glass like optical clarity, without the danger of shattering.
There are significant differences in scratch resistance of polycarbonate lenses depending on the hardcoat finish applied during construction.
Acrylic is also affordable, but it's the least durable and optically clear. They are also weak when exposed to heat and often deform. The best choice is glass or resin material.

Look at different styles of hats.,
Choose the material of hat that you want.,
Consider your budget.,
Choose a color based on your skin tone.,
Wear the right clothes with your hat.,
Have the confidence to wear a wide brimmed hat.",How to Wear a Wide Brim Hat2," There are many different varieties of wide-brimmed hats on the market. Take a look at different brands and styles of wide-brimmed hats and figure out a style that you like. Look online or visit a hat store to get an idea of what styles you like. Think about where you live and how the hat will be received from others around you. For instance, cowboy hats are commonplace in the south and midwest but are far less common in northern states.


Popular examples of wide-brimmed hats include boater hats, skimmer hats, fedoras, trilbys, gambler hats, derby hats, and cowboy hats.Bowler hats have a two-inch brim with a rounded top. This style was popular in 1800’s and early 1900’s.
Western hats, sometimes known as cowboy hats were worn in the Midwest. These hats have characteristically wide brims.
Derby hats are usually worn by women and have elaborate bows and are usually worn at derby racing., Wide brimmed hats use a variety of different materials for different kinds of hats. Decide on the type of material you want, based on style and climate. Materials like wool, leather, and fleece are good for the cold weather while materials like straw, bamboo, and linen are best for hotter weather.Try on different styles of hats to see what kind of material feels best on your head.

, Take a look at budgetary constraints and decide how much you would like to invest in a hat. It's typically advised to purchase a more expensive hat made of a finer material instead of buying a cheaper hat made of synthetic material if you plan on wearing it often.Kentucky derby hats can cost anywhere from $135 to thousands of dollars per hat.Bucket hats are often constructed of cheaper materials like polyester or cotton., Decide what color you want your hat to be and what works well with your skin pigmentation and undertones. Determine if you have a warm, cool, or neutral skin tone. To find your undertones, look at the veins in your wrist under light and determine their color. You have a warm tone if you have dark brown or dark blonde hair and a green or golden undertone. You have a cool tone if you have very dark hair or light blonde hair with a blue undertone. Neutral toned people fall somewhere in the middle and often have hazel eyes with warmer toned hair.


People with a warm tone look best in blues, greens, golden yellows, and creamy whites.
People with cool skin tones look best in bright blue, lavender, ruby, gray, and navy.
People with neutral skin tones look best in light peach, red, yellows, and off-whites.

, When you wear a wide-brimmed hat, it's important that you select the right clothing so that it doesn't come off like you are trying too hard. Try to select outfits where the hat accentuates the overall look. Don't try to plan an outfit around your hat. For men, make sure that the rest of your clothes are fitted well and not loose or baggy. For female clothing, this means wearing longer and looser clothing the larger your brim gets.A denim jacket, white t-shirt, and slim fitted jeans work well with a fedora or bowler hat.
A flowing dress, sandals, and sunglasses go great with a derby hat.
Wearing a baggy sports jacket or suit can make you look childish in a wide-brimmed hat.Make sure that your hat color does not clash with the colors that you're wearing on the rest of your body.

, While wearing a wide-brimmed hat may have been normal in the 40s and 50s, they are much less worn today. If you do decide to wear a wide brimmed hat, make sure that you wear it with confidence. Remain self-confident and own your look instead of fidgeting and touching your hat constantly.If you can't feel confident when wearing your wide brimmed hat, consider choosing another option for your hat.

Measure your head with a measuring tape.,
Determine the size of your hat based on your measurements.,
Check if the hat fits.",How to Wear a Wide Brim Hat3," Take a measuring tape and wrap it around your head to determine its circumference. Place the measuring tape 1/8 inches (3.17 millimeters) above your ear and across your forehead. Make sure to pull the tape firmly to your head but not too tight.


If you don't have a tape measure, you can download and print a tape measure online.
You can also ask a professional hat maker or seller to measure your hat size for you., Take a look at a hat size chart and correspond the measurement of the circumference of your head with the chart. While many hat brands will be similar sizes, they may differ fractions of an inch which can make it harder to find a hat that fits. Many hats are also broken down to their metric measurement, typically ranging from 54 to 65.For instance, a 22 1/4 inch head circumference is a 7 1/8 sized hat in the US and a size 57 if you use metric measurements.For Stetson hats, a size 7 1/8 is a medium.

, When you finally decide on a hat, make sure that you try it on to ensure that it fits. The sweatband inside of the hat should fit comfortably around your head. The top crown of the hat should not touch the top of your head.If the hat is too big and you can't find a suitable size in the style you want, you can apply felt pads to the inside of your hat.

Use precaution when consulting YouTube videos.,
Take caution when wearing glasses with scratched lenses.",How to Avoid Scratching Eyeglasses2," If you notice a tear in your glasses, take your glasses to the place of purchase. See if there is anything that can be done.


Depending on your prescription and the level of damage, your eye doctor may be able to make repairs to your lenses.If your eyeglasses are insured, you may be able to get replacement lenses depending on your insurance policy and how the glasses were damaged., While there are many YouTube videos in existence that provide instructions on removing scratches, be careful when consulting them.

Ask to get a scratch-resistant coating on your lenses.,
Go for glass over plastic.,
Consider switching to contacts.",How to Avoid Scratching Eyeglasses3," When filling a glasses prescription, ask your doctor about scratch-resistant coating. While this won't protect against all possible damages, it will make scratches less likely to occur during day-to-day wear., Glass has gone somewhat out of fashion in recent years; however, glass lenses are less likely to accrue scratches than plastic.


Glass is a harder than plastic as a surface. Plastic lenses are softer and more likely to scratch in response to day-to-day wear and tear.When purchasing your next pair of glasses, ask for a glass lens over a plastic one.The disadvantages of glass lenses are that they are heavier than plastic lenses and the lens can shatter if hit with a projectile.

, If you're worried about scratching eyeglasses, consider switching to contact lenses. Contact lenses are easier and cheaper to replace in the event of damage. Ask your eye doctor about switching to contact lenses if you want to avoid scratches and other damages.


Contacts can provide greater peripheral vision and do not need to be removed as often during day-to-day activity.
Contacts might not be a great option for you if you're forgetful. It can be harmful to leave contacts in overnight for too many nights on end. If you're squeamish about putting things in your eyes, contacts might be tricky.
Many people switch back and forth between contacts and glasses depending on their comfort.

Ask the seller if the items is 100% authentic by and if you find the item isn't authentic they will refund your money, shipping and handling.,
Check the sellers feedback.,
Beware of extremely new sellers.,
Report anyone selling fake goods as the real thing or by having item descriptions that turn out to be false once you learn the real story from the seller.",How to Avoid Purchasing Faux Designer Sunglasses at eBay," Most official resellers who sell genuine sunglasses would let you know that what they are selling is authentic. So look for guaranteed authenticity.;
, Brand new sunglasses are always packed in a box and supplied with cleaning back and warranty card. Don't trust any seller who doesn't provide those items. The one and only case a seller can lack some of these items is when the sunglasses are not brand new and that can't be a good deal anyway. The vendor is highly unlikely to have a good explanation in any other situation.

, Don't fall for that trick; they say that so they don't get in trouble.

, Authentic sunglasses package usually has labels on every item supplied in it. For example Oakley has the ""Genuine O Software"" label sewn on the cleaning box.

, Since many fraud sellers are aware of what a buyer is going to look at first, they try to either fake a box supplied or use a box from a different model.

, Replicas are often packed in original boxes, the glasses themselves will have barcode labels torn off.

, Once you have it, look at the designer site and verify the model number is authentic, a current style, appropriate color, etc.

, Another good replica indicator is the price. It shouldn't be far away from the average eBay value. For example, usually Oakley sunglasses are sold for over 50 USD. Anything below this price should be treated more carefully.

, Consider research the work required to get a good deal when you find it. In the age of Internet every sunglasses company has its own website. You should take advantage of it. Browse the official website and make sure the model listed on eBay matches official one in color. It's amazing how many vendors sell wrong colored sunglasses.

, They may be copy and pasting the photo but selling you something that only looks similar. Make sure that the vendor doesn't use official photos. Well, in that case you should ask to email you a few real photos. When you get the pictures, look carefully for anything unusual.

, Some people use stickers with the designer logo and attach it to the lens to give the appearance of being legitimate. Fraud vendors build fake authority by doing that. Don't buy it.

, That word is just screaming that it's a fake item.

, If you're not sure about authenticity of the sunglasses you've bought, get them checked by manufacturer. Most of them provide this service totally free if you mail your glasses to their head office. Also any official dealer would verify the sunglasses for you as well.

, Official vendors won't avoid providing authenticity proof. Don't bid if the seller doesn't reply to request like that.

, If they say no, you should beware.

, See if they deal with real items or have been accused of selling fake items.

, They may have been kicked off or banned.

, By doing your part to police the opportunist you can make auction sites better for everyone.

Take them off using two hands, instead of one.,
Don't put your glasses on the top of your head.,
Try not to push them up on your nose by sticking your finger on the nosepiece (right between your eyes) if they're wire-framed.,
Purchase a microfiber optical cleaning cloth.,
Use a prepared solution to dissolve any spots.,
Buy an eyeglass repair kit.,
Have them adjusted once or twice per year.,
Keep your glasses in a case when you aren't wearing them.",How to Maintain Eyeglasses," This keeps the earpieces straight and in the right alignment. Taking them off one-handed stretches them out and makes them loose.;
, This can distort the shape, and there's a greater chance of them falling off and getting damaged that way.

, This causes stress on the nose pads, and the center part of the frame, and if they're any color but silver, it wears the finish off them. This can be very conspicuous at that spot. Instead, grasp the lenses by putting your thumb at the bottom and fingers at the top, and then move them to where you want them to sit on your face.

, These are generally available at optometrists, chemists and supermarkets for a few dollars. To clean them, hold your glasses firmly in one hand. Rinse the glasses with clean water to remove any dust or dirt particles. Take the cloth in your preferred hand and gently rub both sides of each lenses until you can see no smudges. Breathe on them gently so that you can see any spots you missed in the fog, and wipe them quickly, before it evaporates. Never use the following:


Clothing - dirt trapped in the fibers can scratch the lenses
Paper towels or tissues - these fibers scratch lenses
A dirty microfiber cloth - when you're not using the microfiber cloth, put it in the eyeglass case; if it collects dust, it'll scratch the lenses, rather than clean them

, Still not happy? Buy some glasses lens cleaning spray, available from the same places. Spray a small amount on both sides of each lens, and repeat the above.

, These are available at the counter of some markets, major drugstores, eyeglass vendors, and optometrists' offices. Sometimes the screws that hold the arms on can come loose, which prevents the arm from 'gripping' the sides of your head as well. You can either get a tiny screwdriver and tighten them yourself, or visit your optometrist and have them do it for you.

, This goes with the above step. If you go back to where you got them every six months to one year, they will most likely adjust your glasses free of charge. The optical technician will examine them for wear and tear, tighten any loose screws, check the fit again, just as if it were the day you bought them and make them just like new. Any replacement parts needed are usually supplied for free, too, or for a nominal charge. Often, any optical dispensing place will do this for free whether you bought them there or not.

, Get one free from your optician, or buy one. When you take your glasses off, put them in the case to keep them from getting scratched. The best ones are the ones that open and close, rather than the ones you slide the glasses into. Even the act of slipping them in can rub against the lenses and cause minute scratches, which your eyes perceive as haze. Any particles, scratches, or tiny hairline fissures will make it harder for you to see perfectly through your glasses, especially at night or in darkened rooms (light will travel along those scratches, creating halos and prisms). If you aren't putting them in a case, at least make sure the lenses are up, away from any surfaces.

Create or reuse a pair of glasses frames.,
Cut out clear plastic to use as lenses.,
Color one lens red and one lens blue.,
Tape the lenses over the eye holes.,
Adjust your monitor's hue and tint.,
Use these glasses to view red and blue 3D images.",How to Make Your Own 3D Glasses1," The sturdiest option is a pair of cheap glasses or sunglasses from a drugstore or dollar store, with the plastic lenses popped out. At that point, you're not saving much money compared to ready-made 3D glasses, so many people prefer to use poster board, cardstock, or ordinary paper folded in half.


A sturdy poster board such as oak tag will last longer than other paper options.Cutting and folding the glasses frame is pretty intuitive, but you can print, cut out, and trace this template onto heavier stock if you prefer.;
, Just about any type of clear plastic should work. Whichever you choose, cut it out to be slightly larger than the eye holes in the glasses frames, so you have room to tape them together. Here are a few commonly available options:









Cellophane. This is the thin, flexible plastic sometimes used as ""windows"" on food packaging, or to wrap CD cases.Transparency sheet for overhead projectors. You can buy these at office supply stores.
A hard CD ""jewel case"" itself. This should only be cut by a competent adult, due to the risk of shattering. Score the plastic repeatedly and lightly with a utility knife until there is a deep groove, then bend lightly to snap it apart.Acetate sheets (also called acetate film) are available at art supply stores or theatrical/stage lighting stores. These already come in red and cyan, so you can skip the coloring step.

, Use permanent markers to color one side of each lens. These glasses work best when you use cyan instead of blue, but blue is a more common marker color and works pretty well.









If the color looks patchy or inconsistent, smudge it together with your finger.The room should look darker when you look through the lens. If it's still pretty light, color the other side of the lens as well., Red goes over the LEFT eye, and blue goes over the RIGHT. Tape the lens to the frame, and take care not to tape over the lenses themselves, or you'll get a fuzzy image.








, Try on the glasses and look at your 3D image. If you are viewing a TV or computer screen and you don't see the 3D effect, adjust the monitor's hue and tint settings until the blue on the screen becomes invisible through your right lens. It should be obvious when this happens, since the image will suddenly ""pop"" into 3D.

, Anaglyph glasses are the oldest form of 3D image technology. The same image is drawn once in red and once in cyan (blue–green), slightly offset. When viewed through glasses with the same colored lenses, each eye can only detect the image of the opposite color. Because your two eyes are detecting what looks like the same image from slightly different perspectives, you interpret it as a real 3D object.


Some 3D DVDs (but not BluRay) and games that advertise ""anaglyph"" or ""stereoscopic"" modes will work with these glasses. Search online for ""anaglyph"" videos and images to find more 3D content.
Most 3D TVs and movie theaters use different technology. If a 3D screen or image contains any colors besides red and cyan, these glasses will not help you.

Learn about polarized glasses.,
Make your own polarized glasses.,
Understand synchronized glasses.",How to Make Your Own 3D Glasses2," One type of 3D glasses commonly used in theaters uses polarized filters for lenses, and special projectors that polarize light.Think of the polarizing filter as a barred window: light oriented (polarized) vertically passes between the bars and reaches your eye, while light oriented horizontally can't get through the bars and gets reflected away. With the ""bars"" over each eye pointing in different directions, each eye picks up a different image, and your brain interprets the two images as a single 3D image. Unlike the red-blue glasses, this image can contain any number of colors., Making these glasses at home is probably more expensive than buying a pair, especially since any theater experience or TV that relies this technology probably comes with a pair of glasses. But if you're interested in the project, purchase a sheet of ""linearly polarized"" or ""plane polarized"" plastic film.Rotate the film 45º from the vertical, then cut out a lens. Rotate the film another 90º in either direction, and cut out the second lens. This is the most common design, but you may need to rotate the lens while looking at the 3D image to see what works. Just make sure to rotate both lenses at the same time, since they should always be made from film oriented exactly 90º apart.

The actual explanation of polarized light is more technical than described above. Modern 3D glasses usually use circular polarized light, which doesn't require the viewer to keep his head still while watching. To make these lenses at home, you would need one sheet of counterclockwise circular polarized plastic, and one sheet of clockwise polarized plastic (also called left- and right-handed).This is more expensive than linear filters., Sometimes called ""Active 3D,"" this technology requires advanced design that can't be copied at home. In order to send a different image to each eye (which is the cornerstone of all 3D technology), the television monitor switches rapidly between two different images, many times per second. The special glasses you wear while watching are synchronized to the television, and each lens alternates between dark and clear at the exact same time, using tiny liquid crystal cells and an electrical signal.This is considered one of the most effective 3D glasses for comfortable, long-term use, but it's just not feasible to make these in your basement, let alone the television set programmed to synch with them."
