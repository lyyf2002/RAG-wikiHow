Buy 3 types of fleece at the craft store or online.,
If you bought more than the minimum amount of fleece, cut 3 pieces of fleece with fabric scissors or a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat.,
Align the 3 pieces of fabric exactly.,
Place the top, middle section of the fleece beneath the presser foot.,
Lay the fleece strip on a craft table.,
Cut slits on the opposite side.,
Fluff the fringes of the scarf so that all 3 layers show.",How to Make a Fringed Fleece Scarf," If the fleece is 60"" wide, you will only need 1⁄3 yard (0.3 m) of each color, as long as the store clerk cuts straight, since each piece will be the exact cut of your scarf. You should choose fleece that has a similar thickness and pile. Each of the colors will show when the fringe is complete, so make sure they are complimentary colors. Buy complimentary thread for your sewing machine.;
, They should be 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5 m) long and 1 foot (0.30 m) (0.3 m) wide.


You can easily make a themed scarf by using red, white and blue for the fourth of July or red, green and white for Christmas.

, Pin them in place.

, With a close stitch, sew down all 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5 m) of fleece. Take care to sew straight and evenly, with a back stitch on both ends.

, Cut a slit in the side of the fleece every 1 inch (2.5 cm). Make sure to stop just before the center line.

, Again, be careful to cut short of the sewed center line.

, It should become more full and ready to wear.

A crochet hook in a size that is appropriate for your yarn. Check the yarn label to find the recommended hook size.
Scissors
A darning needle or plastic crochet needle to finish off the scarf at the end.;
, To create the start of your foundation row, you’ll have to create a slipknot to slide onto the crochet hook. To do this:Wrap the end of the yarn (several inches from the tip) around your left index finger in a loop.
At the top of your finger/loop, you should tuck the center section of the yarn in a 2nd loop through the first.
Slide this off of your finger, and tug on the top loop that you just slid through in order to tighten the slipknot.
Place the knot on the end of your crochet hook, and adjust it by pulling the strings to tighten/loosen the knot.

, To make a chain, loop the working end of the yarn over your hook in front of the slipknot. Then, pull this yarn through the slipknot to make your first chain. Chain 13 stitches and then chain three more for a total of 16 stitches.The extra three stitches will be your turning chain. These stitches provide some slack to start the new row. You will need to chain three before each new row for the entire scarf.
Be careful not to make the chain links too tight or too loose. Try to keep them all at about the same size and tension.

, After you have your chain of 13 plus three, count back from the hook to the fifth chain from the hook. Then, double crochet into this chain.To double crochet, loop the yarn over the hook, and then insert the hook into the chain. Then, yarn over again and pull the yarn through the first stitch. Then, yarn over again and pull through two stitches. Then, yarn over again and pull through the remaining two stitches. This will complete your first double crochet stitch.Continue to double crochet to the end of the row.

, For the second row, you will need to chain three again for your turning chain, then skip the first stitch, and then double crochet. Continue to double crochet to the end of the row.Repeat the same sequence for the next row and all rows after until the scarf is the length you want it to be.

, After your scarf is the length you want it to be, you will need to finish it off. To finish the scarf, complete the last double crochet stitch, and then pull the loop to widen it so that it is at least a few inches long. Cut the loop in the center, and then pull out the cut yarn attached to the skein (ball of yarn). Then, pull the tail to tighten the knot that this will create.


You can also tie a second knot through the last stitch to secure the tail even more.
To hide the tail, thread the yarn through the darning or crochet needle and then weave it into the edge of the scarf. When you get close to the end of the tail, tie the yarn through another stitch to secure it and trim off the excess.

, The yarn you sue can change the whole look of your project. To make this scarf something you will want to wear for years to come, be sure to choose a special type or color of yarn.


For example, you could use a smooth yarn, or one with texture. You could choose a solid color yarn, or one that is multicolor. Check your local craft store for the best variety of yarns and choose one that appeals to you.

, Adding a border to your scarf is one easy way to embellish it and it will give you an opportunity to practice a new stitch or master the one you used for the scarf. To add a border, tie the end of your working yarn to a corner of your scarf and then begin working in the stitch along the long edge of the scarf. Loop all the way around the scarf one, two, or three times, and then finish the border the same way you finished the scarf. Some border stitches you might use for the scarf include:


Single crochet
Double crochet
Triple crochet

Petal cone edging (intermediate level)

, Surface stitches allow you to easily add details to your finished crocheted project. You can use surface stitching to add stripes, dots, and edging.To do a surface stitch, you will need to have some contrasting yarn and a crochet hook. Then, you will need to anchor the yarn to the place on your scarf where you want to begin the surface stitch. For example, if you wanted to add dots, then you would start an inch or two in from the edge of your scarf. If you wanted to add edging, then you would start at a corner of your scarf.
To add surface embellishments, work with the top stitches of your scarf. Do not go all the way through the garment. To do edging, you will need to go all the way through the stitches on the edge of the scarf.

, Adding fringe is another neat way to embellish a scarf. To add fringe to the ends of your scarf, cut some yarn into equal sizes. Then, line up a few strands and insert them through one of the corner stitches. Line up the ends so they are even and then tie the strands in a knot to secure them.


Repeat the process for every stitch all the way to the end of the short side of the scarf, and then repeat again to add fringe on the other end.
One easy way to ensure that all of your fringe is the same size is to cut a piece of cardboard so that it is the length you want your fringe to be. Then wrap the yarn around and around the cardboard several times. Then, cut the yarn along one edge of the cardboard., You can embroider onto a crocheted project to embellish it as well. Try embroidering your crochet with your first initial or with your first and last initial.


To do this, thread a darning needle or crochet needle with a contrasting color yarn.
Then, insert the needle through one of the stitches, and bring it back through to the same side.
Tie the yarn to anchor it to the scarf.
Then, begin to stitch in and out of the scarf to create your desired letter.
When you are finished, tie off the end and cut the excess yarn.

Repeat the process on the other side.,
Cut your thread again.",How to Make a Ruff," You will want thread, a neck or wrist band, a needle, scissors, and a lighter. It's helpful to have all your materials prepared before you begin. You'll also need a ribbon, but first you have to figure out some dimensions.;
, Using a cloth tape measure, try to get an accurate measurement of your neck or wrist. If you’re making a ruff for your neck you might need to get someone to help you. This will inform your measurements as you make the material.

, Linen, Felt, or grosgrain are all good choices. Your ribbon’s length will depend on your neck size or wrist size, depending on what kind of ruff your making. You should add an extra 2 inches (5 centimeters) to account for the wearer’s shirt collar beneath the ruff.For example, you might get a ribbon that is 17 inches long (for a 15 inch neck) and 3 inches wide. This will create a ruff that is about 2.5 inches tall.
The width of your ribbon will determine how high your final ruff will be.

, Take a pair of scissors and cut the edge of the ribbon to make a smooth cut. Then, with a lighter, tea light, or another flame, gently heat the end of the ribbon until it begins to melt. Once it begins to melt, stop. This seals the end of the ribbon so that it does not fray later., Make light marks so that they are not obviously visible later; you will not be washing your ruff. Some recommend making only tiny dots. Use a ruler and fabric or mechanical pencil. Go lengthwise and make marks every few inches or centimeters, according to your chosen height. Do this on both edges of the ribbon. If you want a three inch tall ruff, you should choose a tightly woven linen fabric In this case, there should be tiny dots every 3 inches along the longer length of the ribbon.

, It is a good idea to use a thread that is the same color as your ruff. Take your needle and thread and pierce through a corner of your ribbon very near where you have your tiny marked dots. Knot your thread.


Switch through twice, going down and back to make sure your ruff is secure.

, Skip over your first tiny mark and go to the second one. This is where you will start. Take the shorter end of your ribbon and fold it over your mark. Now sew through the tip of your fold. Pinch your ribbon together, and stitch through the tip where the mark is. Try to do this gently so as not to disturb the ribbon in your fold.


Leave the loop as loose as possible. You shouldn’t pull your thread extremely tight. This will give you room to adjust your ruffles when you’re done. Don’t worry about leaving your ruff too loose, because you can always tighten and re-knot later.

, Skip the next adjacent mark after your first fold and go to one after that. Take the shorter end and fold it over your mark. Now sew through the tip of your fold again.

, For every other mark, make a fold, pinch the ribbon, and sew through the mark at the tip. Remember to keep things loose and adjust at the end. Once you're done cut your thread. Knot the end of your thread and cut it off securely. This keeps the ruff together on one side.


Don’t worry about the mess. When you let the ruff go from your fingers, it’ll look like a mess, not pleats. Just keep sewing, it will come together. , Now you need to repeat the process to sew together the other side of the ribbon. You should see your other tiny marks on the other side of the ribbon that you have not sewn yet; use those to guide your sewing. You follow the exact same process that you used to make the first side.


Adjust your ruffles as you like to get the shape and look you desire

, This is the trickiest part of making a ruff, so don’t get discouraged if it takes a few tries. Set the neck band or wristband of your shirt up against the ruffle exactly how you plan to sew it on.

, The plan is to pierce your needle and thread through one corner of the neckband as close as possible to where your thread on the ruff is. You want to pierce your needle and thread through your ruff at the top of the first ruff loop. You also should be behind the first thread you used to make the ruffles. Loop your thread and needle back to the starting position for the next ruff loop.


Pull tightly to bring your ruff and band close together.

, Going down the ruff, sew each loop in that manner: using your thread and needle to bring the ruff and band close together, then going forward to the next loop.


Sew in a straight line, not zig-zags. Zig-zag threading will look less authentic
Cut your thread once you've finished. Knot the end of your thread and cut it off securely.

, Once again, now you’ll have to sew the other side. This should be a little easier because your ruff is already attached to your band at the proper places; you only need to secure your band on the other side. Follow the same strategy.

, Knot the end of your thread and cut it off securely, just like you did on the first side. You’re done! Congratulations.

Make a slipknot.,
Pull yarn through the loop.,
Create a new loop.,
Pull more yarn through the newest loop.,
Repeat as needed.,
Secure the end.,
Consider tying the ends together.",How to Crochet a Sashay Scarf1," Tie a slipknot with a loop large enough for your thumb and two fingers to fit through. Keep a tail measuring 5 inches (13 cm) long.


To make a slip knot:

Cross the skein side of the yarn over the tail end, creating a large loop the size of your fist.
Insert your hand through the loop and grab a nearby section from the skein side of the yarn. Pull this section through the original loop, drawing up a second loop as you work.
Tighten the first loop around the second loop by pulling on the tail end of the yarn. This secures the second loop in place and completes the knot.


For this scarf, you'll actually be using a process known as “finger crochet.” The stitches you need to make are so large that you will need to use your fingers to make them instead of a crochet hook.
While most sashay projects require you to spread the sashay yarn out into a net, for this project, you will use it as thick regular yarn.
The finished scarf will usually measure around 110 inches (279 cm) in circumference, but the exact measurement can vary based on how tight you make the chains.;
, Insert your thumb and one or two fingers into the loop of the slipknot. Grab the skein side of the yarn close to the loop, then pull it back through to the front side of the loop.


Essentially, you are making chain stitches with your fingers. This entire scarf will end up being one large chain.
Note that the number of fingers you use will change the size of this scarf. Two fingers will produce a thinner, longer chain, while three fingers will produce a thicker, shorter change. Either option will produce a suitable result, though.

, Continue tugging on the yarn you pulled through during the previous step until the first loop tightens slightly around its base, creating a new loop.

, As before, insert your thumb and one or two fingers through this second loop. Grab the skein side of the yarn from the back, then pull it back through to the front. Continue pulling until it forms a loop at the front.


Try to create the same stitch width you used for the first stitch. The easiest way to maintain a consistent stitch width is to use the same number of fingers—one or two—when grabbing the yarn for each stitch.

, Repeat this process as often as possible until you almost reach the end of the skein of yarn, leaving only 5 inches (13 cm) of yarn left.

, Quickly tie off the end in a simple knot to prevent the chain from unraveling.


You do not need to use a slipknot or any other special type of knot here. A simple, standard knot is all you need.

, You can wear the scarf as is, but you should consider tying the ends together to make it more versatile and easier to handle.


Simply tie the tails of both ends together, forming a long infinity scarf that you can play around with each time you wear it.
Alternatively, drape the scarf around your neck in your desired position before tying the ends. Knot the ends around the back neck area of the scarf to secure your desired positioning. Wrap the ends around the first knot a few more times before tying it off again, then weave any remaining ends into the folds of the scarf.
This step completes the project.

Chain one.,
Chain five.,
Single crochet in each chain stitch.,
Chain one.,
Single crochet across the row.,
Repeat as desired.,
Hide the raw edge.",How to Crochet a Sashay Scarf2," Unravel a piece of yarn that is roughly the same length as your forearm. Stretch out that strand width-wise until it looks like netting.


Note that the bottom edge is the thinner, decorative edge. Usually, this edge has metallic thread running through it. For this project, you will only crochet into the upper part of the yarn netting. The bottom edge gets left alone and forms frills.
The upper part of the yarn netting resembles train tracks. You will only work with the larger holes of these tracks, leaving the smaller holes alone.

, Place the hook into one of the large holes along the top edge of the yarn, roughly 6 inches (15 cm) in from the raw edge.


Note that you do not need to attach the yarn to the hook using a slipknot, as you would with most standard crochet projects.

, Skip over one hole in the netting, then pick up the yarn along the side of your next large hole, moving down through the net instead of moving across. Pull this loop through the first hole to complete one chain stitch.


Place a stitch marker under both top loops of this first chain.

, Make another five chain stitches in the same manner. For each chain, skip over the next hole in of the yarn mesh and work your stitch from the loop after that.


This will create your foundation chain.
Turn the work over when you reach the end of this chain.

, Skip the first chain in your series, then work one single crochet into the second chain from your hook. Single crochet in each of the remaining four chain stitches, as well.


To make a single crochet for this project:

Insert the hook into the next loop you need to work.
Use your need to grab the side of the following loop from the back of the yarn, then pull that second loop up through the front of the first. There should be two loops on your hook at this point.
Wrap the side of the next loop on your hook from the front, then pull this portion of yarn through the first two loops on your hook. This completes one single crochet stitch.


Place one chain marker at the beginning of the row and one at the end of row.

, Make one chain stitch, then turn the work over before advancing to the next row.


For each chain, skip over one large hole in the netting and pick up the yarn of next large hole after that. Pull this loop through the first first hole and the yarn on your hook to complete the stitch.

, Work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row. Chain one at the end of the row, then turn the work over.


As before, mark the first stitch and last stitch of this row.

, Repeat the previous step until your scarf reaches the length you desire.


For each new row, work one single crochet into each stitch of the previous row. Chain once at the end of each row, turn the row over, and advance to the next row. Follow this pattern for the rest of the scarf.
Note that the finished work will be about 4.5 inches (11.5 cm) wide and 36 inches (91.5 cm) long.

, When you reach the end of your scarf, trim the yarn, leaving a 6-inch (15-cm) tail. Tuck the loose end inside the two nearest ruffles, then use a sewing needle and matching thread to tack the end in place.


This step completes the project.

Fold and stitch.,
Chain along the bottom edge.,
Fold and stitch.,
Slip stitch across.,
Repeat five more times.,
Fasten off the shawl.",How to Crochet a Sashay Scarf3," Unwind a stretch of yarn roughly the same length as your forearm. Use your fingers to spread out the yarn so that it looks like netting.


The bottom edge is thinner and usually has metallic thread running through it. The upper portion looks like train tracks with alternating small and large holes. For this project, you will only be crocheting into the large holes of the portion.

, Fold the raw edge of the yarn diagonally under at a 45 degree angle. Slip stitch the loops of the fold to the loops of the main yarn underneath, working from the top edge to the bottom edge of the main piece.


Note that you do not need to attach the yarn to the hook with a slipknot, as you would do with most crochet projects that use standard yarn.
To slip stitch for this project:

Insert the hook into the indicated loop.
Grab the side of the next loop from the back of the yarn, then draw it back through the loops already on your hook. This completes one slip stitch.


You'll need to slip stitch four or five times, working with a different loop each time, as you work across from the top to the bottom.

, Work a chain stitch in the next large hole along the thin bottom edge. Repeat 49 more times, creating a total of 50 chain stitches.


When finished, the chain should be about 10 inches (25.4 cm) long.
For each chain stitch in this series, insert the hook through the next hole and pick up the yarn from behind that. Pull this loop through the first first hole and through the yarn on your hook to complete the stitch.

, Turn the work, then fold the skein side of the yarn under at a 45 degree angle. Slip stitch across the wide edge from the bottom to the top of the yarn.


Slip stitch as you did earlier: insert the hook into the next loop in the series, then use it to grab the side of the next loop from the back. Pull this second loop through the first, then draw it through all the loops on your crochet hook to complete the stitch.
This diagonal fold should match the diagonal fold you made at the beginning of your chain.

, Make a slip stitch in each loop across the thin edge of your work until you reach the end of this edge.


Insert the hook into one of the loops along this edge, then pick up the loop lying next to it. Pull this second loop through the first using your hook.
Continue at this pace and in this manner until you stitch across the entire thin edge.
These slip stitches are roughly 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) apart. If you want the ruffle to be fuller, pick up every other loop along the thin edge. If you want a more subtle ruffle, pick up every loop, instead.

, To create the rest of the shawl, repeat the previous two steps five more times, or until you work through the rest of the skein.


Start each row by turning the work over and folding the skein side under at a 45 degree angle. Slip stitch across the fold to hold it down.
Slip stitch across the bottom of the previous row as before, working into every loop or every other loop (repeat the same pattern as before). Continue slip stitching you reach the end of each row.

, End the work along one of the vertical sides of the shawl. Turn the work, then cut off any excess yarn, leaving a tail measuring 1 inch (2.5 cm) or so. Use a sewing needle and matching thread to tack the end in place.


This step completes the project.

Enter keywords in the search box at the top of your session that accurately describe the handbag you are seeking. For example, if you want to locate a red purse by a specific designer, enter ""red,"" followed by the designer's name.
Refrain from indicating the terms ""purse"" or ""handbag"" in your search criteria. Some sellers may favor one term over the other, resulting in fewer search results depending on the phrase used.;
, EBay will then display items being sold that match your search criteria with the prices and photos for each handbag.

Stock photos have a professional appearance and may have a unique or all-white background that indicates the photos have been modified with the use of software. If stock photos are displayed, you will not have the ability to view the handbag's true appearance and condition.
Check to see if photos display the handbag from all angles. This will help you determine the handbag's condition and features.
Look for photos that display the front, back, and sides of the handbag, the inside lining, labels, zippers, stitching details, handles or straps, and the designer's stamp or brand-name.

Buyers that have purchased counterfeit handbags or received handbags in a different condition than advertised may leave negative feedback for the seller.
In some cases, buyers may leave neutral feedback if they purchased a counterfeit handbag, but were refunded for their purchase. Neutral feedback comments will be indicated by a grey icon shaped like a circle that contains a white dot in the middle.

, This will allow you to determine if you can return the handbag to the seller or be refunded if the item is unsatisfactory or counterfeit.


You may not want to purchase items from a seller who indicates that all sales are final or that returns will not be accepted. If you are unhappy with your handbag, you may not be eligible for a refund from the seller or from eBay.
Review policies that indicate restocking fees will be charged when you return an item. Some sellers will charge you a restocking fee based on a percentage of the final selling price. For example, if the seller's policy indicates a restocking fee for 30 percent of the selling price, and you want to return a handbag you paid 400 dollars (293 euros) for, your refund amount will only be 280 dollars (205 euros).

, For example, if a handbag looks appealing, but some details are questionable, such as the color, the manufacturer will be able to confirm if they ever released a handbag of that style.


To locate the manufacturer's contact information, visit the website of the handbag's manufacturer or visit the manufacturer's retail store if one exists in your local area.

Understand the difference between a knock-off and a genuine bag.,
Be store wise.,
Be realistic about the price.,
Ask the vendor if the bag is real, a copy, or a fake.,
Know the signs of a fake or knockoff bag.,
Check the hardware, if it does not look like authentic hardware, feels light, has rough edges, ect.,
Check the zipper manufacturer, usually the underside of the zipper will have a logo.,
Don't confuse a designer bag with making a purchase of value.",How to Tell if a Designer Bag Is Fake," Knowing the difference enables you to make an informed choice about the purchase of any bag.


A genuine designer bag is made by the original well-known designer; it can also be made by a less-known designer but the main focus is on high-end designers. The bag's logo, charms, attachments, etc., are all part of the original design down to the exact positioning and number of such features. Tags, signatures or marks stating the designer's name form an integral part of the bag's overall design and authenticity. Price is determined by what the consumer is prepared to pay for a designer label.
A legal knock-off/imitation is ""designer-inspired"" but not a direct copy. Provided such a bag does not claim to be the original designer's bag and does not attempt to use the trademarked symbols, logos, or features. In most cases, it can legally imitate the style and colors of an authentic designer bag while taking care of any defining features deviate in evident ways in order to avoid copyright. Although it may suggest the bag's similarities to the brand that it's inspired by, it won't claim to be an actual designer bag. Without close inspection, the additions can be easily mistaken for the real thing, sometimes causing you to spend too much on it in the belief of the original designer's bag. However, if you know what to look for, you should be able to spot the differences.
Illegal, fake bags put themselves across as being the genuine designer's bag, right down to the very last logo, tag, charms, etc. Fakes copy everything about the designer bag, and pass themselves off as the original brand with no attempt to distinguish themselves as look-alikes. Prices for fakes can vary considerably from cheap to trying to sell the bag for high amounts. It is illegal to make fake merchandise, and while buying it, doing so supports illegal activity.Be aware that designer-inspired bags can carry the blessing of the original high-end designer where adequate compensation has been paid and contracts exchanged allowing for lower-end knock-offs in chain retailers, etc. Usually the store will proudly say something along the lines of ""as licensed by X brand for our store"".;
, The best place to purchase a designer bag is to go to a renowned store to for designer bags. Suitable stores include stores that carry the same name as the brand and quality department or boutique stores. The staff should be knowledgeable when questioned about the pedigree, quality, and guarantees concerning the bag.


Assume that any designer bag being sold at a flea market or street vendor is suspect. Designer labels do not authorize street vendors to sell designer bags or purses. It would be a rare occasional find to have a cheap designer bag being thrown out at a flea market; it's possible but improbable.
Know all you can about designer bags if you're purchasing from estate sales, thrift stores, online auction sites, etc. Apply the following steps to any purchases of designer bags made at such places.
Ask trusted fashionistas you know where they purchase their designer bags from. They'll be wise to the good stores.

, Designer bags cost a lot of money because they are well crafted and they're status symbols. If the price is too good to be true, then it is, and the bag's a fake.If you do buy legal knock-offs, be sure you don't pay much and double check the quality!

, Judge for yourself the ring of authenticity from the answer; keep your emotions in check and your common sense at the forefront. Sellers who avoid answering questions or are evasive have something to hide.Ask if you can return it if it's faulty or fake. Naturally, don't expect street vendors to agree to this!
Ask if there are any certificates of authenticity accompanying the bag.

, There are numerous signs that can point to a bag's lack of authenticity:The stitching: Look closely at the stitching of the bag. Sloppy, slanted, and uneven stitching is a sign of a poorly made, and therefore, a fake bag. Designer bags will always have quality stitching because it is part of the designer's reputation to produce a quality item.
Check the tags or labels. Check the inside tags – are they stamped into leather or hand-stitched? An obvious fake will have no name on the inside tag. Check outside tags as well because many designers include authenticity labels on the outside of the bag.
Check the material. If it's leather, it should smell like leather. If it's supposed to be durable canvas, it should be strong and well stitched. The material can tell you a lot about the bag's quality. If the real bag normally has a pattern inside then the fake bags with mainly have just one colour throughout the inside.
Check the logo. Logos are often a slip-up area for copies. They may have spelled the name slightly differently, such as Carter instead of Cartier. And, the more popular the ""knocked off"" bag, the greater the need to be careful because it's easy to be taken advantage of. When you look at the stitching on the sides and you see the ""LV"" it should be continued onto the other side of the bag and this also goes for the other symbols on the bag. And most knockoff Chanel bags have interlocking Os instead of Cs, which actually makes it legal to sell but is, of course, a fake. They snip it to make it look real when it comes out of a dust bag.
Look for a serial number. This is a stamp inside that says the brand (it may not be in all bags). Often times the serial number is still fake, but will look different and be a different font.
Check the lining. If the interior sounds like paper rubbing together, then it's not the real thing. A real designer bag will be lined, and often with leather. Again, check the stitching of the lining if relevant, and observe if it is double stitching ( not always the case).
Look for color variations. Although some variations will be blatant, others may be very subtle. Be sure to have a close inspection.
Notice wear break-in. Although this is post-purchase, how your bag wears in can be a sign of its authenticity. For example, the leather on the handle, after a few weeks, should look like a good worn leather jacket does. It should have an ""aged look"". Stitching should stay intact and not begin to fray. Zipper handles that fall off early on indicate a fake.

, it may be a fake.

, Many handbag manufacturers use the same high quality zipper manufacturer on all of their bags.

, With a designer bag, you're buying the label as much as the bag and it may not be to your budget's benefit unless money is not an issue. Always check the bag, designer or ordinary brand, for its quality before its style. That way, you'll soon learn that even some designer ranges make compromises that aren't acceptable for the price asked. It hardly makes sense to spend $1000 on a plastic bag with a designer label over a well-made ordinary label leather bag at $200. Investigate and keep your head in charge of your wallet, not your fashion-hijacked heart.


Look for young, up-and-coming designers whose designs show incredible promise but aren't yet fetching huge prices. They may be selling online through a site such as Etsy, on consignment in a quality clothing or gift store, or in a local craft market, etc. Learn how to spot quality and style and support a new designer.

Allow the scarf to soak for 8 hours or overnight.As the silk soaks, you’ll notice that it becomes more translucent so it can take the color more easily.

, When you’re ready to dye the scarf, you need the oven to be hot enough to help the silk absorb the color. Set the temperature to 175°F (79°C), and allow the oven to fully preheat., After the scarf has soaked overnight, pour out the water from the baking dish. Leave just enough water so the silk is barely covered and pour 2 cups (474 ml) of white vinegar into the dish.If you accidentally spill out too much water, just add it back in so the scarf is mostly covered.

Start with about 8 to 10 drops of food coloring, and add more until you achieve as bright or deep a color as you’d like.Be creative with the food coloring.

Make sure your bucket bag will be able to expand in all directions to hold what you need.
If you cannot fit all of your current items in your bucket bag, consider downsizing or finding multi-functional items such as folding brush and mirror in a single compact.;
, If you are looking to carry your bucket bag during the day, try to pick a bag that matches the dress code in your office or school. This may mean picking a solid color bag or doing away with certain embellishments like tassels or large accessories.If you work in a more conservative office or attend a more conservative school, this may mean choosing a solid color bag such as a black or brown leather or canvas bag.
If you work in an office or attend a school that has a less restrictive dress code, simply make sure that your bag does not have too many embellishment or accessories. Opt for fun patterns or buckles over jewels or sequins.

, Think about what type of fabric you want for your bag based on both your personal taste and the bag's use. A synthetic leather or treated canvas, for example, may be better for those in climates where it's likely to rain, as they resist water better.Consider fabric combinations, as well.

Go boho.,
Dress up your work look.",How to Accessorize with a Bucket Bag2," If you are wearing an outfit with more gray scale or earthen tones, use your bucket bag to add a pop of color to your look. For black and white outfits, most any color will work. For neutral tone outfits, find a more vibrant version of a color you're already wearing.If, for example, you have an outfit that already has browns in it, choosing a copper or ochre color bag will add color without clashing with your garments.

, Bucket bags are great to carry into the office because they can often hold all you need them too, but don't look as serious or stern as a briefcase. Pair your bucket bag with a blazer your favorite blouse and trousers combination to add a bit of fashion to your daily look.For office looks, a structured bag tends to work better.

If wearing a wing collar shirt, tuck the wings of the collar behind the bowtie.",How to Wear a Bow Tie," The self-tie is highly recommended. Clip-on bow ties are mainly for children, and while the ready-tie might do for a beginner, wearing one at a formal event is considered a faux pas.Be warned: people can spot the difference.;
, Most bow ties sold are adjustable, but for style purposes, the fixed-size bow tie is preferable. The main advantage of a fixed-size bow tie is that the width of the finished bow will be directly proportional to your neck size. In addition, fitted models will avoid excess fabric and clasps, which may be visible when worn with a wing collar shirt.Adjustable bow ties – The neck strap on the tie will have an adjustable slider or hook and holes with pre-marked measurements. Adjust the tie to match the collar size of your shirt. The tie should be snug but not too tight.Fixed size – To be certain you have the correct size, have your neck measured by a tailor or buy a tie that matches the size of your shirt collar. The tie should be snug but not too tight.When tied, the bow should fall between the outer edge of your eyes and the width of your face., Bow ties come in several different shapes. The style you pick is mainly about personal taste.


Butterfly – Also know as the “thistle”, this is the bow tie people are most familiar with. When the tie is laid flat, the ends are shaped like a butterfly. The butterfly works best with winged collars.Big Butterfly – A larger version of the butterfly, most often used on very formal occasions. It also works best with winged collars.Bat Wing – Also known as the “straight” or “narrow” bow tie. When laid flat, the ends look like cricket bats or oars. The bat wing is more modern and less formal, though still suitable for black tie events. They work better with standard collars.Diamond Point or Rounded Club – These ties have pointed or rounded ends, which when tied gives them an added asymmetric look. They are less common, but can still be worn for formal occasions., The fabric and color you choose for your bow tie depends largely on where you will be wearing it. The more casual the occasion, the more freedom you have in choosing your bow tie., This is the most formal type of dress, reserved for state dinners, and very formal balls or evening weddings. Your bow tie should be white and pure silk. Its texture should match the lapel of your tuxedo jacket., Black tie events include the opera,formal dinners, and evening weddings. Traditionally, men should wear tuxedos and black bow ties.Again, the tie should be pure silk, and its texture should match the lapel of your tuxedo., For these less formal occasions, a colored or patterned bow tie is permissible,and you may also experiment with different fabrics., A bow tie makes a statement all by itself, so it’s best to keep things simple.


Stick with navy, black, or gray suits, and blue or white shirts. Let your bow tie make the statement.Because bow ties cover a small area, you can be bolder with design than with a traditional tie.Stripes are a safe place to start when trying patterns, but don’t be afraid to experiment with polka dots or paisley.Consider wearing your bow tie with a more tightly fitted jacked. A bow tie and loose jacket might make you look too much like a professor., A bow has become a staple of hipster chic, but even for the non-hipsters among us, a bow tie can spice up a shirt and blazer or a simple button down shirt. They give you an intellectual look, combined with an old-timey aesthetic and just a hint of mischief.Make sure to wear your bow tie with a slim-fitting shirt. An ill-fitting shirt combined with a bow tie will make you look stodgy.Experiment with different materials, such as bow ties made of linen, cotton, wool, flannel, denim or even wood (yes, wood!)not shiny silk, which is more appropriate to formal attire., Be sure to practice a couple of times before you need to wear your tie. Like any other tie, tying a bow tie properly takes a little practice. Don't be discouraged if you don't get the perfect tie at first.

, The interfacing should be ironed on to the “wrong” side (the back side that won’t show) of two of the pieces of fabric.









Most interfacing requires being covered with a damp cloth then ironed on with the bumpy side facing the fabric.
Read the directions on the interfacing to ensure proper ironing.

,

Generally, try to match your shirt and tie before you worry about your suit.,
When in doubt, pick a neutral, solid-colored dress shirt.,
For a bolder (but more difficult) look, choose a pastel or bold-colored shirt.,
Pick a striped or patterned shirt for complex color interactions.,
Pick a tie that's darker than your shirt.,
For solid-color ties, pick a color that fits your purpose.,
For patterned ties, pick a tie containing a color that's similar to your shirt's.,
Avoid picking ties with patterns that are the same as your shirt's.,
Opt for ""serious"", formal colors.,
When in doubt, opt for dark, solid-color suits.,
Consider lighter solid-color suits for use with pastels and dark ties.,
Avoid pairing a patterned suit with a similarly-patterned shirt or tie.,
Try to choose a suit that keeps the number of colors in your outfit to no more than three.","How to Match Colors of a Tie, Suit, and Shirt"," While, in an ideal situation, all three items of clothing will match, it's usually more important for your shirt and tie to match each other than it is for either to match your suit. Why? Because you can easily take your jacket off, while you're stuck with whatever you choose to wear in terms of shirt and tie. So, if you have any say in the matter, try to prioritize your inner garments, rather than your suit.;
, if you're ever unsure of which dress shirt to pick when you're putting together an outfit, you can't go wrong by picking one that matches with everything such as ""white"". When it comes to dress shirts, white, the most neutral color of all, is the easiest color to work with, as it goes with nearly all ties and suits.


Other mild, pale shades of color, especially light blue, are also highly versatile and offer a variety of options when it comes to ties.

, Next in line after white and light-colored shirts are pastel shirts. These colors are fairly light, but not as neutral as colors like white and light blue - pastel shirts give the wearer a chance to pull off striking - or clashing - combinations. Finally, bold, richly-colored dress shirts offer truly unique possibilities. Paired with an appropriate tie, they can give the wearer a more sophisticated look, but can look showy or ridiculous when paired with inappropriate ties.


Black shirts are the exception to this last point - they're a dark, bold color, but, like white shirts, they're very versatile and go with most types of ties.

, Of course, not all dress shirts are a single, solid color. Many dress shirts are patterned with thin stripes (usually vertical but sometimes horizontal), while others bear dots, complex stitching, or other patterns. Generally, the larger and more complex a shirt's pattern, the more attention-grabbing the shirt is, but the more difficult it is to match to a tie and suit.


For most formal or semi-formal occasions, you'll want to choose a shirt with a modest pattern. Thin vertical stripes of neutral colors (like white and light blue) are a safe bet, though small repeating patterns like dots are also fairly manageable (especially when at least one of the colors in the pattern are neutral ones).
Shirts with more complex patterns, like intricate stitching across the chest, are sometimes best worn without ties, as the pattern and the tie can compete for attention.

, Ties are attention grabbers. When paired with a complimentary shirt, a good tie will catch the eye of someone scanning a crowded room and direct his or her attention to your face. Accomplish this effect by choosing a tie that stands out against your shirt. Usually, this means picking a tie that's a darker color than the shirt itself. For whites and other neutral colors, this means that almost any tie will work. However, for dark or bold-colored shirts, this can be more difficult.


Picking a tie that's lighter than your shirt is occasionally a viable option as long as it stands out against your shirt. For instance, if you're wearing a black shirt, all ties except black ones will be brighter than your shirt, so you may want to pick a tie that strikes a bold contrast - for instance, a white one.

, Solid-color ties are fairly versatile - nearly any shade of solid-color tie looks good on a white shirt, while conservative shades like navy blue and black can look great on bolder-colored shirts. Generally, you'll want to pick a solid-color tie that's as eye-catching (or not) as your occasion warrants. A red tie on a white shirt, for instance, will create a striking (but not clashing) contrast that's sure to get attention.


Don't pair a boldly-colored solid-color tie with a shirt that's also boldly-colored unless you're sure the combination works. Avoid extreme contrast - a cherry red tie and a bright green shirt, for instance, will be difficult to pull off.

, If you opt for a patterned tie, a good way to ensure it matches your shirt is to ensure its pattern contains a color that's the same (or nearly so) as the shirt's somewhere in the pattern. In this case, assuming the colors within the tie's pattern don't clash with each other, your tie should match your shirt effortlessly.


The exception to this rule is that you shouldn't wear a tie with a small, repeating pattern whose background color is the same as the color of your shirt, as this creates little contrast.
For example, if you're wearing a light-blue shirt, you might choose a plaid tie featuring mostly shades of dark blue and a small amount of light blue.

, Rule number one when it comes to matching ties and shirts is that like does not necessarily go with like. Patterned ties should not be paired with shirts with similar patterns. In these combinations, the interaction of the two patterns can create a bizarre, distracting effect not unlike that of an optical illusion. Additionally, a tie that's patterned similarly to the shirt underneath is not likely to stand out against the shirt itself.


For example, you won't want to wear a plaid tie with a plaid shirt, a thin-striped tie with a thin-striped shirt, and so on.

, When it comes to suits, formal colors are your friends. Most people can't pull off playful, brightly-colored suits. This isn't to say that no one can - just that it takes tons of charisma and can make you look like a goofy game show host if it backfires. Most people are best-suited (no pun intend) to colors like black, grey, navy blue, and (sometimes) brown when it comes to formal pants and jackets.


Not only are these colors more dignified (and thus a better choice for classy, formal events), but also easier to match with most shirts and ties.

, As with shirts, when it comes to suits, simplicity equals versatility. Solid-color suits that are black, grey, or navy blue will work with most shirt and tie combinations. In addition, these suits are appropriate for a variety of occasions - from joyous events like weddings to somber ones like funerals. Most men should have at least one suit of these colors.


Match a dark-colored suit with a neutral shirt and a dark-colored tie for a universally-dignified look. Brighter ties can work well with dark suits but can appear informal if too bright.
Note that some sources claim that darker blues don't pair well with black or navy blue suits., Not every occasion requires a dark, formal suit. Tan, pale grey, lighter styles of tweed, and sometimes even white are possibilities when it comes to light-hearted or celebratory events. Try to pair these types of suits with pastels and/or dark ties for contrast.

, As when dealing with patterned shirts and ties, it's a wise idea to avoid pairing a patterned suit with any clothing containing a similar pattern. The most common suit pattern is pinstripes (very thin vertical stripes) so, usually, this means avoiding striped shirts or ties, especially if their stripes are vertical and thin.


As a general rule, try to avoid wearing three patterned garments. In other words, make sure one of your garments is a solid color. It's difficult to pull off three different patterns in the same outfit - if your look backfires, you may end up looking like a clown.

, Finally, you may want to pick a suit that doesn't add any new colors if your outfit is already packed with color. Using your suit to add color to an outfit that has plenty is a bad idea - usually, the effect this produces is that of a muddled mess.


To be clear, neutral shirt colors like white and similar shades of the same color on ties don't count toward this ""three color"" rule. For example, if you're wearing a dark blue plaid tie, the different shades of dark blue in the plaid pattern don't count as separate colors.

Set up the ironing board.,
Put the iron on the appropriate setting.,
Lay out your tie.,
Saturate a pressing cloth.,
Cover the tie with the pressing cloth.,
Iron the tie.,
Hang the tie to cool when you are finished.",How to Iron a Tie1," Put the board on a flat surface so that it is steady and will not flip over while you are ironing. Make sure that it is clean and dry before setting your tie down., Read the label on the tie to figure out what material it is made out of. Most irons are labeled with fabric settings such as silk. If your tie does not say which material it is made from, play it safe and use the lowest setting on your iron.Silk and polyester ties should use a cool setting.Wool ties will need a medium-hot setting.Cotton and linen ties can use a hot setting., Make sure your hands are dry, and then lay your tie face-up across the ironing board. Smooth out the tie the best you can.Make sure the tie is not stained, because if you iron over a stain it may permanently set-in and ruin the tie., Ties are typically delicate, so you do not want to press the iron directly onto the tie fabric. Instead, you need to wet a clean, white cloth.Make sure that the cloth is damp, but not dripping with any excess water. Any drops of water that fall onto a tie could potentially leave a water stain. Keep wringing out the cloth until it does not drip any water., The purpose of the pressing cloth is to protect the tie fabric from coming into direct contact with the iron. Lay the pressing cloth completely over the area of the tie that you iron.

, To safely iron your tie, you will gently move the iron over the pressing cloth, and let the steam produced from the cloth work to release any wrinkles from the tie. Never let the iron rest in one spot.Using gentle pressure, start from the bottom, and work your way to the top. Iron small sections at a time as you move the iron from the edges inward to prevent creases.
When you have finished one side, flip it over, and repeat the process. Make sure your pressing cloth is still wet. If it feels dry, get it wet again, and wring it back out., Before storing your tie or wearing it, make sure that it has completely cooled off, or it may wrinkle again."
"
Use bathroom steam to release wrinkles.,
Make a ""tie-roll"" to remove wrinkles.,
Untie your tie when you are not wearing it.",How to Iron a Tie2," If you want to avoid the iron, hang your tie in the bathroom as you shower. The steam should soften the fibers to help reduce wrinkles., Try rolling up your tie, and then lay it in a clean space with the flat side down for a couple of hours. Then, unroll your tie, and the wrinkles may have released., It may be tempting to loosen your tie, slip it off, and throw it on the dresser while you go relax. Try not to do this because this will cause major wrinkles, kinks, and maybe even permanent damage to your tie. Always undo your tie completely, and then hang it up on a rack, or lay it out flat when you are not wearing it."

The ideal length for a necktie should hang at about the middle of your belt. Taller individuals will likely need a longer tie, while shorter individuals may need a smaller one. To test your tie length, you should:Hang the tie around your neck.
Align both ends in front of you.
Adjust the thick end of the tie to hang at the middle of your belt.
Verify the thinner end does not exceed the thicker end excessively.;
, Ties generally come in four different thicknesses: 2 in (5 cm), 2½ in (6.4 cm), 3 in (7.6 cm), and 3¼ - 3½ in (8¼ - 8.9 cm). Thicker neckties will suit thicker framed individuals who have a wider front, while thinner ties will generally suit thinner frames.


Average sized individuals will most consistently pair well with 3 in (7.6 cm) ties.
Your tie should never be thicker than 3½ in (8.9 cm)., When shopping for ties, you might not be able to tell at a glance whether or not a tie is on the thick or thin side. In this case, you can use a dollar bill to check the width. Hold your tie against the side of your dollar bill with Washington's portrait. If the tie stretches from the left side of the dollar bill to Washington's left eye, the tie is 3 in (7.6 cm) long., Narrow ties differ from thin ""skinny"" ties in that narrow ties taper to a much lesser extent than 2½-in skinny ties.Narrow ties can come in a wide range of sizes, though are usually on the thinner side.


These ties can look good with thinner cut and narrow cut shirts.

, Ties that are 2 in (5 cm) or thinner are generally considered to be ""fashion statement"" length. Skinny ties are usually the same thinness for the entire length of the tie.


Use skinny ties as flashy accents for your outfits when going out., Simple, single colored ties create high and low contrast pairings easily. High contrast combinations are between colors more distinct from each other on the color spectrum. As an example, red ties and white shirts form a powerful, high contrast combination. Low contrast combinations are formed by color pairings that are closer on the color spectrum, like a darker green tie and a brown suit.Complementary colors are those that are similar on the color spectrum. The color spectrum can be recalled with the acronym Roy G Biv, which stands for:Red orange yellow Blue indigo violet.

Solid black ties should be saved for formal or black tie events.
White ties are traditionally reserved for weddings to match the white dress of the bride., This will create the effect of having an all-tied-together outfit. Light haired and skinned individuals match well with pastel colors and combinations of monochromatic colors. Darker hair and complexions pair well with both high and low contrast tie colors, while those who are dark haired and fairly complected should stick to defined, high contrast combinations., Mellow greens can also give a refreshing, healthy appearance. These solid colored ties should have simple, regular patterns, and should be paired with other blue clothing. This tie/suit combination will convey a sophisticated look without drawing too much attention to you., Men are more likely to have colorblindness, usually between the colors of red and green, and if you are trying to coordinate an outfit with either of these colors, you might need the help of someone who isn't color blind. As many as 8% of men of European heritage are color blind., A white shirt will show off just about any tie you wear, but colored shirts can be a little more complicated. Shirts that are a single color without any pattern can be coordinated in most cases according to the following color scheme:



Blue shirt: burgundy, gold, navy, red, and yellow ties

Pink shirt: burgundy and navy ties

Tan shirts: brown, deep green ties, If you plan on wearing a blazer, the primary color of your tie should compliment the color of your jacket. Ties that have accent colors the same as or complimentary to your shirt will integrate all elements of your look into one, stylish outfit., You can create a trendy, stacked effect by using larger checked patterns in your tie and smaller checked patterns in your shirt. Coordinate this look with pants of a similar color scheme and you'll have a look that'll impress., When your patterns start blending, your look can become muddied and lack definition. Patterns that are similar, like stripes, can be made distinct by using a heavy, thicker pattern in your tie and a lighter, thinner pattern in your shirt., Use a similar color scheme between your tie and shirt to integrate the two together, and then offset your tie with a unique pattern. This will break up the regularity of the stripes in your shirt, and some tie patterns to consider include:


Box patterns
Pin dot patterns
Polka dot patterns
Paisley patterns, There's always an exception, but some styles mesh poorly and should be avoided. Generally, you should avoid patterns that are so similar the shirt and tie blend together, or are difficult to distinguish. Some specific combos to avoid:


Polka dot shirts and plaid ties
Madras check shirt and broad-striped tie
Awning strip shirt and narrow-striped tie, This can cause the two differing patterns to seems connected and intertwined, sometimes creating harmony between even drastically different patterns. This works especially well with high contrast base tie colors, with matching accents, like a pink tie with tiny, patterned brown accents worn with a brown shirt."

Submerge the cap completely.,
Allow the hat to soak for several minutes.,
Put on the hat and wear it until it dries.",How to Shrink a Fitted Baseball Hat1," Take a deep cooking pot and fill it with water. The pot should be spacious enough to hold the cap you’re attempting to shrink without overflowing. Set the eye of the stove to a medium heat and allow the pot to start warming up.You might also be able to perform this step in a sink, though using a pot will give you greater control over the temperature of the water.;
, Heat the water until it begins to emit a small amount of steam. The water should be hot enough to shrink the cap, but not so hot that it might burn you or damage the cap’s materials.Do not allow the water to come to a boil. In addition to potentially causing burns, water that is too hot might cause the cap’s bill to warp and lose its structure.

, Place the cap into the hot water. Force it down until it soaks up enough water to stay submerged on its own. You should be able to dunk the cap in the water by hand, but you can also use a pair of kitchen tongs if you prefer.


If you don’t plan on reshaping the bill later, you can hold it out of the water entirely, wetting only the cap’s crown.

, Give the cap a few minutes to begin undergoing to the effects of the hot water bath. The heat will cause the cotton fibers that the cap is made of to constrict and cling more tightly together, effectively shrinking the entire hat.Soak the cap until the fabric of the crown begins to “billow” a bit; this is a sign that it has loosened up sufficiently to be refitted.

, Safely remove the cap from the hot water and shake it remove excess liquid. Once the hat has cooled, place it on your head and wear it until it dries through. The damp hat will be extremely pliable, and as it dries it will conform to the shape of your head.Drying a hat this way will likely take all day. For best results, heat the cap early in the day and then wear it as you go about your business.
Hang the hat up by the bill overnight using a clothespin to prevent stretching or warping as it continues to dry.

, Stand up straight and use a tailor’s measuring tape to measure your neck starting from the base of the back of your neck and ending in the front where your collar sits at just around your Adam’s apple.








Place an index finger between the tape as well to give yourself some breathing room., Bow ties are one size fits all, but they have ways to adjust the length either with a slider or button holes.Most bow ties will also have pre-marked neck measurements informing you how to size them based on your neck measurement.Move the slider or buttons based on your neck measurement.








, Like tying a regular necktie, one end of the bow tie needs to drape over your chest longer than the other. Position the bow tie so that one end hangs roughly 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) lower than the other end.








As with a regular necktie, it doesn’t matter which side the longer end is on; however, you’ll be doing most of the work with the hand on which the shorter side of the bow tie starts, so keep that in mind.

, You should cross the tie near your neck so that the loop around your neck is just large enough to work with but not loose; you don’t want your bow dangling in front of your chest.








, With one hand hold the point where the two ends cross over the front of your collar. Take the dangling portion of the longer end and pass it behind and then up over the point of intersection.








At this point, you can pull both ends of the bow tie to make it as tight around your neck as you will be comfortable with.
Once you have the bow tie at the proper tightness, toss the longer end back over your respective shoulder. You won’t need it for the next step., Lift up the shorter end—which is still dangling—and fold it over on itself at the widest part of the bowed shape.Lift the whole portion and turn it 90 degrees, so it faces horizontal.This will form a loop that points to the same side as the shoulder over which the longer end is resting. Hold this fold together at the skinniest part of the bow tie, which should be just in front of your Adam’s apple.









This will be the front loop of the completed bow tie, so it should already have the general shape of the finished product.

, Take the longer end off your shoulder and drape it over the skinniest part of the bow section you created in the last step.








, Grab the left and right sides of the horizontally folded end and pinch them together in front of the dangling end.The top of the dangling end will now be held between them.








, There will be a small gap behind the bow portion that you can see while you have it pinched forward. Fold the draping end of the bow tie on itself like you did with the short end and pull the loop from the fold through the hole.It will now form the back half of the bow.









The gap will be between the loose knot from step two and the where you draped the longer end of the bow tie in step four.

, Pulling at the flat ends of the bow tie will simply untie it like pulling on the dangling strings of shoelaces, so make sure you tighten the bow tie by pulling gently at the looped portions.








, As soon as you finish, the bow tie will likely be crooked, but you can easily twist the loop at the front and back bows to get it into the proper position.









This may require pulling the flat ends slightly to loosen the bow tie, then repositioning it before tightening it again. Make sure the tie is fastened tightly.

, Your bow tie is now perfectly tied and positioned, so you can put down your collar and finish getting ready.








, Since you can’t double-knot a bow tie like you can your shoes, they loosen over the course of wear and can even come untied. Check your bow tie periodically to ensure it’s still tight and perfectly positioned.

Turn on a hot shower.,
Put on the fitted cap you want to shrink.,
Get in the shower.,
Wear the cap as it dries.",How to Shrink a Fitted Baseball Hat2," Turn on the shower in your home and wait until the water is comfortably hot. Again, the water should not be too hot, as it will be in direct contact with the cap and can ruin the hat’s construction if the temperature is too high or the cap is allowed to soak too long.Showering in a hat or pair of boots you wish to break in is a trick that has been used for a long time with great results.

, Take the cap you’ll be modifying and put it on. You should position the hat the way you most frequently wear it so that it loosens and dries in the right shape.

, Hop in the shower with the cap on. Shower as you ordinarily would, or simply wait 3—5 minutes for the rigidity of the hat to break down and assume its new shape. Make sure the crown of the cap is thoroughly wet so that it can be stretched out uniformly.If you decide to simply take a regular shower while wearing the cap, be sure not to get soap or shampoo on the hat as it soaks. Washing your cap should be performed separately with the right products.
Let most of the water fall on the crown of the cap to avoid potentially ruining the bill.

, Leave the cap on as you go about your day. Shake out excess water before putting on your other clothes so that the cap doesn’t drip. The cap should dry within a day, or less, depending on environmental conditions.


Wearing the cap on a clear, warm day will allow it to dry most efficiently. If the weather outside is cold or rainy, do not wear the cap out. Instead, allow it to sit right-side-up under a fan or in front of an air conditioning vent and check on its progress periodically.

Place the cap in the washer.,
Wash on regular heat.,
Let the hat dry on your head.,
Throw the cap in the dryer.",How to Shrink a Fitted Baseball Hat3," If you have access to a washing machine, you can use it to easily shrink a cap made from polyester or another synthetic. Load the cap into the washer by itself or with other clothes. Use a small amount of laundry detergent to clean the cap as you shrink it.If you’re washing the cap by itself, make sure to set the washer to the smallest load setting so that the wash and rinse cycles don’t use too much water.
Putting the cap in the washer with other clothes will cause pressure and friction to work on the cap, breaking it in better.

, Set the washer to a normal wash cycle using regular water heat. Synthetic materials like polyester shrink easily when exposed to heat, meaning a standard washing is often all that it takes to bring a garment down a half-size or so. Allow the hat to go through the complete wash cycle.If you only need to shrink a polyester cap a little bit, you can remove the cap from the washing machine after the initial wash cycle.

, For caps needing only minor sizing adjustments, a standard wash should do the trick. Put on the cap and let it air dry on your own crown for a customized fit.


If the polyester shrunk a little too much due to the heat from the wash, wearing it as it dries can stretch it out to an optimal fit.

, Assuming the cap is considerably looser than you’d like it, you might follow up the wash with a run through a machine dryer. This will expose the cap to more intense heat to ensure shrinkage while also drying it much faster and more thoroughly. Put the cap through a timed drying cycle on medium heat. The constant heat of machine dryers is notoriously harsh on synthetic fabrics, so if you need to shrink a cap quite a bit, this may be the best way to go.Washing and drying a synthetic cap regularly will most likely cause it to shrink quite a bit more than a gentle soak or hand wash. If the hat shrinks too much, try putting it on while it’s still somewhat damp. The fibers should stretch out as the cap becomes worn in.
Keep an eye on the hat as it dries. Synthetic materials have been known to scorch if exposed to heat for too long."

Understand the various parts of the tie.,
Size it up.,
Remember textures.,
Match colors.,
Look in the mirror.,
Match patterns.,
Stay classy.,
Take care with weekend wear.",How to Choose a Tie," Knowing a quality tie when you spot it, is dependent on knowing what you should look for. The following elements of the tie are things to check:Look at the lining of the tie. The purpose of the lining is to make tying the tie easier and to prevent it from wrinkling. The lining should be made from 100 percent wool. The more gold bars on the lining, the heavier the lining.
Feel and look at the fabric of the tie. If you're after silk (the ideal tie fabric), make sure it is by feeling it. Silk is smooth; other fabrics mimicking silk tend to feel brittle. A quality tie will be made from three pieces of fabric, while a cheaper one will be made from only two.
Check for hand rolling: A hand-rolled and hand-stitched hem keeps a much better shape than a machine-made one.
Look for the slip stitch. This can be pulled to gather the tie together. This helps to maintain the shape of the tie.
Note the bar tack. This is the piece that supplements the slip stitch and keeps the two ends of the tie from separating.;
, Pick a tie that hits the top of your belt buckle and measures between 2¼ and 4 inches (5.5cm - 10cm) wide.


For a classic look, choose a width that corresponds to the width of your jacket’s lapel.
A tie should not be too loose or too tight; both ends of the spectrum are incredibly uncomfortable, so be sure it fits well around your neck.

, Wear wool ties with tweed or heavyweight jackets, and silk ties with business suits. For a deeper color quality on silk ties, make sure they’re woven, rather than screened.

, When it comes to colors, there are literally thousands of colors available in mens' bow ties, striped ties and paisley ties, more than you can imagine. First of all, you have to decide which color of tie will go with your overall attire and the occasion. Select a tie that has the colors of your suit and shirt as well as at least one other color to provide an accent. For formal occasions, choose a solid colored tie that’s darker than your shirt.


A solid tie is the most versatile of all neckties because it is appropriate with everything.
A dark tie is appropriate for business wear. Pairing it with a khaki or blue shirt evokes military uniform authority.A black tie goes with everything and is suitable for all occasions from funerals to work. It's also ideal for hiding stains.
Younger men, or men living in warmer climates, tend to prefer colorful ties (and shirts).Look for a tie that goes well with your dress shirt. This tie will be kept for best. Make sure it has a nice balance or color to it so that it looks good.

, Frame your face. If you have dark hair and a dark complexion, go with a bright tie; if you’re fair, choose a darker tie. If your hair and skin tone contrast, wear a tie that contrasts with your skin tone.

, As with the colors, there are different patterns too available in the various online tie stores. Always determine the occasion before buying a patterned tie; since wedding is a formal affair, a formal solid color tie is the best option to go with. Pick a pattern that complements your outfit. If your shirt’s pattern is pronounced, choose a subtle tie; if your shirt is muted, your tie can be a bit flashier. The following pattern information is helpful to know:Repeat pattern: This is the most common style of tie and includes paisley, shapes, animals, workplace logos, rope patterns, and more.
Dots: The smaller the dot on the tie, the more formal the tie is. Be wary of large polka-dots because these can come across as clown-like.
Striped: These are known as rep or regimental ties. They originated in the need to display the colors of British clubs or army regiments. In Britain, the stripes run from high left to low right, while in America, the stripes run from high right to low left. Just to be different, of course.
Woven: A woven tie is usually produced only in one color. The weave texture is the pattern. One example is silk grenadine. Woven silk ties are considered formal and conservative.
Checks: Checked ties make a bold statement. This can be toned down however, with the addition of a checked shirt or tones that match up with the checkers

, Thanks to the latest fashion trends, even men are getting numerous styles in accessories which are also true for the neckties. There are traditional ties with a broader formation and this is best for the men who are broad shouldered and muscular. When in doubt, stay subtle; while a tie can be the focal point of an outfit, it’s an accessory and shouldn’t pull the focus away from you.

, The addition of a tie to casual weekend wear is something to be done with discretion. You don't want to dress it up too much as casual shirts aren't supposed to look as if they're about to go to the office or the annual director's dinner. The way around this is to wear a simple, classic tie over casual shirts with a simple but bold pattern. To go really casual, wear a plain t-shirt (or one with a subtle design) with a loose tie.

Fold the fabric.,
Prepare your hair.,
Tie the patka around your head.,
Wrap the pagh around your head.,
After you've created three or so layers over the front of your head, build layers around the top.,
Alternately, instead of creating top layers, just spread the cloth open at the top and tuck it into the bottom of the turban.,
Tuck in the remaining loose end.,
Fold the fabric in half and place it against the back of your head, holding the ends in front of your ears.,
Tie a knot with the fabric in the middle of your forehead.,
Twist the ends of the scarf around your head until you run out of fabric.,
Pull the fabric back across your head.",How to Tie a Turban," Fold the page over four times length-wise, making sure that the ends are aligned. Ideally, your fabric should be about 6 yards (or larhs) long, so that you have enough room to fully wrap the fabric around your head. The fabric you start with should be made of cotton and should be as thin as possible. When you fold it four times, it should be about 2 inches (5 cm) wide.


The easiest way to correctly fold the fabric is to get the help of a friend or family member. Your friend should hold the fabric out on the other side of the room, and you both should fold it in the same direction at the same time.
This is the fabric you'll use to make your patka, the wrapping under the actual pagh. The actual pagh will be wrapped as you go along.;
, If you have long hair, tie it up in a bun at the top of your head near the front, right above your forehead. Fasten your hair with a rubber hair tie. To tie your hair in a bun, simply flip your hair over your head with your face looking down, grab your hair so it's all in one long ponytail, and then lift it up to the center of your head, so you can then begin to twist it a bit and then wrap it around in circles around itself, starting inside a circle and working your way out until you have wrapped all of your hair around the top of your head in a bun.


You can even use some bobby pins to secure your hair in place, if it's extra long.
If you have shorter hair, then you won't have to do anything special to get it ready.
It's important to keep your bun secure enough that it stays in place, but not to have it so tight that you give yourself a headache. Once you tie your turban, it'll be hard to go back and change your hair.

, This is the piece of fabric that goes underneath the pagh, serving as a base. Some people more casually refer to it as an ""under pagh."" Wrap it around your head as you would a bandana, tucking in any loose ends. Tie the patka at the front top part of your head where your bun is. Keep in mind that it doesn't have to look perfect, as long as it holds your hair in place, since it won't be visible to people. Here's how you should go about tying it around your head:









Hold out the cloth in front of you. It should be held out without being folded over, so it is about 1 foot (30 cm) wide.
Flick it over your head, so the bottom is just below your hairline and the top covers your hair and reaches out behind it, toward the base of your neck.
Cross the opposite ends of the patka at the base of your neck. Take the right corner in your right hand and cross it over the left corner in your left hand. The right side should only have a few inches or centimeters remaining, while the left will hang long behind you, now on the right side.
Bring the long side out in front of you, so it hangs over your right shoulder. Fold it in half and then wrap it up, over your right ear and above your forehead, past your left ear until it now hangs back off the left side.
Repeat the wrapping process 3-4 times, until you have wrapped the patka around your head with only a small part remaining. Just wrap the second later just above the first wrapped layer and so on, so that you keep wrapping it higher and higher over your head, taking care to leave your ears free.
Tuck the last few inches of the patka into the back of your turban, from the top down, until the only part that hangs loose is the original end of the right side of the patka.

, The fabric should be wrapped around diagonally. Start with the fabric being lower on one side and higher on the other side, and continue to wrap it around about 6 times, slightly adjusting the position each time so that it is elevated on the opposite side by the end. This is similar to how you wrapped the patka, though this time, you will cover your ears as you wrap it around your head. Here's what you need to do:


Hold out the end of your fabric in front of you. Fold just one inch (2.5 cm) or so of it over the top, and then wrap it over your head, just as you did with the patka.
Cross the ends of the fabric just around the place where your hair meets your neck, just as you did before.
Wrap the pagh around your head, moving from one side of your head to the other. On top, you should build at least three rows from your hairline to the middle of your head, while continuing to create one thick uniform layer around the back of your head, between your ears from the back.

, Wrap the pagh around the top of your head at least three more times, moving upwards with each wrap, so you create a thicker layer near the top of the head. When you can't wrap the fabric anymore, take the leftover end to the back of your head.

, Instead of creating top layers, you can focus on creating layers around the front and back of your head, leaving the top open. Then, when you're almost done, just cover the top by either spreading the cloth open at the top until it reaches the bottom layer by pulling the first fold out from underneath the fabric and then pulling it over the top part of your head that is uncovered.








, This should be the last step whether you've wrapped the pagh all the way around your head or if you've spread the cloth to cover up the top of your head. The loose end should be tucked in at the back of your pagh. Once you do that, your turban should be in the desired shape. You can carefully run your hands over it to make sure it has the smooth, round shape you were going for.








, First, fold your cloth to create a scarf that is about 6 inches (15 cm) wide. Then, place it against the back of your head and bring out the front parts of the scarf so that they are out in front of your ears. You should be working with at least 5–6 feet (1.5–1.8 m) of cloth.


It can help to bend your head down a bit to get the back of the fabric against the back of your head.

, Just tie an ordinary knot, or even two, for extra security. Just keep in mind that you don't want the knot to look too bulky, or it'll stick out when you're done.

, Start from the base where you tied the knot and continue twisting until you've wrapped both ends of the fabric around your head. Wrap them one layer at a time, from the layer able the initial knotted layer until you've covered the back of your head. The layers in the front should move higher and higher, while you can just wrap around one layer between the back of your ears repeatedly. Twist the fabric and keep wrapping it around your head until you've almost run out of fabric.

, Tuck it underneath the scarf in the back, and make additional adjustments if necessary. For this version of the headscarf for women, you'll need to cover all of your hair. If you prefer to leave some of your head peeking out the top, then you can just leave a space when you wrap the fabric around your head.


You may want to use bobby pins to help keep the turban in place.

, Pull the folded edge of the shemagh over your forehead, positioning it somewhere between your hairline and your eyebrows.









The excess material should drape over the top of your head and down the back, not in front of your face.
If you have tied a bandana in the past, then a good way to think of this initial position would be to act as though you are preparing to tie a really large bandana.

, Pull the right side around to the left so that it wraps completely under your chin. Pull the end over your shoulder and toward the back of your head.









Hold this end in place with your left hand while working with the left side to prevent it from loosening. A shemagh needs to be fairly tight in order to be effective.

, Grab the leading or folded edge of the left side with your right hand and pull it all the way across your face, toward your right side. Unlike the right side of the shemagh, this left side should drape across your nose and mouth, not under your chin.









Pull the right end over your shoulder and toward the back of your head, as well.

, Use a tight overhand or double knot to secure the shemagh in place. This knot should be at the back of your head, roughly around the back center, and it must be tight enough to keep the shemagh on your face.









Do not tie the knot so tightly that you make it difficult to breathe or turn your head, but make sure that the material is taut against all parts of your neck, face, and head.

, Adjust the shemagh as needed so that the material covers the top of your head and lower half of your face without covering your eyes. After this step, the shemagh is complete.









One major advantage of this wrapping style is its versatility. You can pull the bottom off your face to create a simple headwrap, or you can pull both the bottom and top portions down so that they sit around your neck, creating a scarf.

Choose a point roughly three-quarters of the way along the folded edge. There should be more material on the right end than on the left.
If you have ever tied a bandana, a good tip would be to hold the shemagh over your forehead as though you were getting ready to tie a really large bandana.

, Wrap the left side, or the shorter side, of the shemagh under your chin and up toward the back of your head.









Hold this piece still with your right hand. Do not tuck the end into the rest of the shemagh fabric yet.

, With your free hand, pull the right side or the longer side across your face so that it covers your nose and mouth.








, Continue to wrap the longer end of the scarf by bringing it up and over the top of your head. The edge should drape completely over your head, and the end should roughly meet the end on the opposite side.









One hand should still be holding the first end taut against the side of your head while your other hand maneuvers this second end around.

, Tie two overhand knots to secure the shemagh in place.









Do not tie the knot so tightly that you make it difficult to breathe or turn your head, but make sure that the material is taut against all parts of your neck, face, and head.

, Adjust the shemagh as needed so that the material covers the top of your head and lower half of your face without covering your eyes. After this step, the shemagh is complete.









A primary disadvantage of this wrapping style is that the shemagh cannot be easily pulled down off the head and turned into a scarf. This is a secure wrapping style, however, and provides your head with greater protection than the traditional or casual wrapping style mentioned here.

As you bring the shemagh around your neck, hold the ends up to keep the material taut against your face.
For this style, you should not tie the shemagh behind your neck. Instead, the two ends should only cross over each other once. While still keeping the two ends secure and taut, bring each end back over the shoulder opposite its original side so that both are positioned over your chest. Do not let go of the ends yet.

, Tie the two ends in front of you, still holding them taut. Hide the ends under the long end or remaining corner of your shemagh.









Use a single knot at the approximate center of your neck.
The knot should be tight enough to hold the shemagh in place but not so tight that you have difficulty breathing or turning your head.

, If you are wearing a jacket, blazer, or other form of outerwear, unbutton or unzip the top portion and tuck the ends of the shemagh underneath. Partially button or zip the jacket back up to hide these ends and create a tidier appearance.

Wear when dry.",How to Make a Wizard Hat1," Place the point of the compass in the middle of the bottom edge and draw a half-circle using the attached pencil.

Cut this shape out with scissors after drawing it.



 


The exact size of your hat should vary based on the size of the intended wearer. For a toddler or young child, make the radius 9 or 10 inches (23 or 25 cm) long. For a slightly older child, use a radius of 11 or 12 (28 or 30 cm) inches.





;
, As you shape the paper, keep the bottom edge level with your working surface so that it can rest perfectly flat on that surface. Hold the overlapping edge together using double-sided tape or glue.


If you use glue, you might need to use a stapler to hold the bottom edge of the cone in place as the glue dries.

, Each fringe should be about 1/3 inch (1 cm) long and 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart. Fold these fringes so that they stick out from the bottom of the cone.


You will use these fringes later to attach the brim of your hat to the main conical portion.

, On a new sheet of construction paper, draw a line that is equal in length to the diameter of hat's opening. Draw a circle around this line, then draw a bigger circle around that. Cut out the larger circle and the smaller circle, and use the large ring left behind as your brim.

Measure the inside diameter of your cone several times and at several places. Use the smallest measurement you get when deciding on the diameter of your brim.






When drawing the inner circle of your brim, place the pointed end of the compass on the midpoint of your diameter line and set the compass to half the diameter's length. Draw around the line, making sure that your perimeter touches both ends of the line.






After drawing the inner circle, set the compass so that your new radius is 3 inches (7.6 cm) larger than the radius of your inner circle. Use the same center point and draw a larger circle evenly around the smaller inner circle.






You can discard the inner circle after cutting them both out. You only need the outer ring for your brim.







, Slide the brim over the top of the hat and onto the fringes at the base. Glue or tape the brim to these fringes from the underside.

The brim should fit snugly on the fringes of the cone. If you cannot slide it all the way down to these fringes, however, carefully cut away extra paper from the inside ring of the brim and try again. Repeat as needed until the brim lies flat on top of the flaps.






The easiest way to attach the brim to the fringes of the hat is to apply glue or double-sided tape to the bottom inner ring of the brim before sliding it onto the flaps.







, If you have stickers or other pre-made decorations you plan on using, skip this step. Otherwise, sketch several stars and crescent moons onto a sheet of shiny aluminum foil and cut them out using a sharp pair of scissors.If you do not want to use aluminum foil, you could use plain construction paper, instead. For an added touch, decorate plain paper embellishments with glitter or sparkly paint.






You can also paint decorations directly onto the hat instead of cutting out shapes from other material.







, Apply glue to the back of each decoration and arrange them at random over the cone body of the hat.

, Once all the glue is dry, the wizard hat is ready to wear and show off.

Attach the brim to the bottom of the hat.,
Decorate as desired.,
Show off your wizard hat.",How to Make a Wizard Hat2," Situate a fabric pencil inside a compass, then set the compass so that it matches your desired height measurement. Draw a half-circle onto the interfacing and cut it out with sharp scissors.


Usually, a 9 to 10 inch (23 to 25 cm) hat is tall enough for toddlers and young children, while older kids and young adults might need a hat 11 to 12 inches (28 to 30 cm) tall, if not a bit taller.
When drawing the circle, place the fixed leg of your compass in the middle of the bottom edge of your interfacing. Draw a half-circle around this point, extending out and around the bottom edge from above. Note that the flat edge of your half-circle will be twice as long as the shape's height.
If you have your heart set on a specific height, add another 1 inch (2.5 cm) to that measurement for a seam allowance.

, Roll the interfacing so that it comes to a peak at the top part of the curved edge. Keep the bottom flat against your working surface as you work.


Once the opening at the bottom of your hat appears small enough to rest on the intended wearer's head, pin it in place and test the cone. If it rests securely on the wearer's head, move on. If it does not sit on the head well, though, widen or narrow the opening as needed to improve the fit.

, Once you achieve a perfect fit with your cone, carefully cut away some of the excess interfacing from the inside of the body. Remove just enough to get rid of any excess bulk.


Leave at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of overlapping material inside the hat.

, Unpin the trimmed interfacing and lay it flat onto your intended fabric. Pin in place, then cut out a piece of fabric that matches the outline of your interfacing exactly.

Make sure that the adhesive side of the interfacing faces your fabric as you cut the fabric out. The adhesive side is usually the glossy side.






Choose a fabric type you feel comfortable working with. Synthetic satin is cost-effective and has a traditional look, but the edges can fray easily and some hemming will be required. Felt has a less traditional look, but it is both inexpensive and easy to work with since it does not fray.







, Carefully press the interfacing on the fabric using an iron set to low heat. Press as needed until the two pieces of material are securely attached to each other.


If you are using a synthetic material, you will need to use a low heat setting and work as carefully as possible to prevent the fabric from melting.
Read the exact instructions for your interfacing before attempting to iron it on. While the procedure is generally the same for each type of interfacing, some may require slightly different steps.

, Roll the material back into a cone and pin in it in place. Hand stitch the side of the cone using a neat back stitch.

Alternatively, you could glue the edge in place with hot glue if you want a no-sew option.






If you are working with a fray-resistant fabric like felt, you do not need to worry about hems. If you are using a material that frays, however, you should hem the side edges with a 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) seam allowance before rolling the hat into a cone.







, Measure the opening at the base of your cone. Use a compass fitted with a fabric pencil to draw a circle of the same diameter onto a piece of interfacing. Draw a second circle around the first that is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) wider. Cut out both circles so that you are left with a large ring of interfacing.

Pin the interfacing to your fabric with the fusible side facing down. Cut the fabric out, as well.






Note that you should add an extra 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) to both the inside and outside of the ring if you are using material that frays, like satin. This extra fabric will be used as a seam allowance for a hem.







, Use a hot iron to fuse the interfacing onto the fabric. Make sure that the pieces are securely joined before continuing past this step.


Use the same heat setting, time, and pressure to fuse the brim material as you used when fusing the material for the body of the hat.

, If you are using a material that frays, fold the inside edge and outside edge under by about 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) each. Pin in place, then carefully back stitch by hand to secure the hem.


Skip this step if you are using felt or another fray-resistant material.

, Return to the conical body of the hat. Use sharp scissors to cut 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) slits around the entire body, each one spaced roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart.

, Slide the brim onto the hat so that the inner ring rests flat on top of the flaps at the cone's base. Hot glue or stitch each of these flaps onto the ring from the underside of the hat.

Unless the bottom edge of the cone has frayed significantly, you should not need to hem it before attaching the brim. The glue or thread used to secure the brim onto the hat should prevent the lower edge from fraying, thereby negating the need for a separate hem.






As you sew the brim onto the hat, keep your stitches as flat as possible. Do not pull the thread too tightly or the fabric will bunch up., The basic structure of your hat is done at this point, so all you need to do is decorate it to your liking. Some ideas include:

Cut out stars and crescent moons from yellow felt and hot glue the shapes onto your hat.






Cover the seam with a strip of decorative ribbon, or wrap a long piece of ribbon around the hat in a spiral.






Look for small patches, beads, or craft embellishments to glue, sew, or iron onto the hat in a random pattern.







, After you finish decorating the hat, put it on and wear it proudly.

Learn your organization's dress code.,
Align your beret properly.,
Keep an appropriate hairstyle.",How to Shape a Beret1," Although the following can be used as a general guide for uniform berets, you will need to know any unique rules you may be required to follow.


If you're wearing a beret for fashion, there is really no limit to how it may be worn (as long as it's sitting on top of your head). The most popular casual method of wearing a beret is to wear it without a fold and tilted so that the brim sits diagonally across your forehead. Usually casual berets need no shaping other than fuzz removal.;
, This typically means to wear your beret with the brim straight across your forehead. The United States Army requires the edge to sit one inch above the eyebrows. If your organization requires a ""flash"" insignia, it should be aligned over your left eye.Excess material will be folded and draped towards the right side of your head. This is typically why a beret must be shaped, as it will most likely resist holding this shape when brand new., Do not wear hairstyles that may distort the shape of the beret, such as high buns or ponytails.Your bangs should not extend below the front brim of the beret.Some organizations, such as the United Kingdom's Royal Air Force, require that those with long hair keep it in a hairnet most closely matching their hair color.

Green construction paper that’s at least 12” x 18”.
Pencil.
Scissors.
Glue.
Red feather.
Ruler.

, Take your paper and fold it over into a rectangle that’s 9” x 12”.









You should fold the paper so that the crease is on the 9” inch side while the open ends are on the 12” long side.

, This is the same process from the first method above.








, Now simply cut out the shape of your hat.









Start at one corner that’s opposite of your crease and cut along your outline.
You should have somewhat of a triangular shape here with a flat, non-creased edge at the bottom, which is where your head will go.

, Now take the bottom part of your hat and fold up the paper to create the brim of your Peter Pan hat.









Make a nice crease by pressing your finger along the fold.
To make sure that both folds are of even height, flip your hat over after the first fold and fold the second flap up to match.

, Connect the edges from the base of the hat, where the brim is, all the up to the tip.









The slight folding over of the edges will give your Peter Pan hat a nice rounded, more natural look.
If you want to glue them together you should now apply it to the edges. While any type of glue should work, something like a safe rubber cement, which has a brush might be the easiest method.
You can also simply staple the open edges together.
Or, if you want to add a bit more flair to your Peter Pan hat, you can sew the edges together like in the first method.

, Simply make a small cut on the side your hat for your feather.









Alternatively, you place the stem of the feather inside your brim crease and glue or staple it in place.

Fit the beret to your head.,
Remove the lining.,
Remove any fuzz.",How to Shape a Beret2," If the beret is adjustable, place it on your head and adjust to the right size. Be sure to complete this step before getting the beret wet, since a wet beret can stretch or shrink. If you are unable to adjust your beret to fit snugly on your head, you may need one of a different size., Cut out the black inner lining of the beret, but be careful not to damage the fuzzy outer layer.Removing this lining will help you more easily shape the beret. Keep in mind that not all berets will have this component.

, This is typically done after you've finished shaping your beret. However, if your beret is already visible pilled before being shaped, shave it before wetting in addition to after it's dry.In the case of casual berets, this may be the only step you need to take. There are many ways to remove fuzz from your beret:


Use a disposable razor. This is the easiest and most common method. Gently run the razor in a single direction over your beret. Make sure not to go over the same spot multiple times, as you risk wearing down the material too much.Carefully clip with scissors. This method is best if there are only a handful of obvious pills. Clip them off at the base, placing the scissors flush with the beret. Use cuticle scissors for the most precise control possible.
Burn off the fuzz with a lighter. Hold the lighter in place and carefully run your beret just over the flame without touching it. Instead of ""shaving"" the entire cap, go over just the areas with visible fuzz. Although this method can damage your beret if done improperly, it is sometimes considered to be the traditional way to de-pill a military beret. Exercise caution when using a lighter."
"
Wet the beret.,
Wring out the excess water.,
Shape the beret.,
Allow the beret to dry on your head.",How to Shape a Beret3," Soak the beret in warm water. If your beret has a flash, keep it away from the water as much as possible.Note: Using hot water on the black rim will shrink the beret. If your beret is slightly too large, using hot water is a good idea. If your beret already fits your head snugly, be sure to avoid hot water.

, Get rid of all the extra water you can by gently wringing out the beret. It will still be damp, but make sure there is no more dripping water., Place the damp beret on your head. Pull the beret up to make it stand. If your organization uses the standard beret shape discussed in Method 1, pull all excess fabric down on the right side of your head by folding it with your hands. Repeat this action several times, making sure the fabric on top is completely smooth.

, Doing this will keep the beret from shrinking too much and will form the beret more closely to the exact shape of your head. If necessary, you may need to hold the fold down with one hand until it becomes secure. You may take the beret off if it's still slightly damp after a few hours."

Pick a style that seems appropriate for your scarecrow in terms of shape, but don’t worry about other features like color, since it will be covered with burlap in the end., Unroll a large swath of burlap and center your hat on top of it, right way up. Trace a circle (or whichever shape matches that of your particular hat) around the hat. Make it large enough for the circle to cover all of the hat’s exterior, with at least a few extra inches between the brim and your circle., Use fabric scissors to cut the circle free from the roll of burlap. If you're worried about making your circle too small, err on the side of caution and go for one that's too big. The excess can be repurposed later on if you need to trim it off., First, drape your burlap circle over your hat and center it. Make sure it’s long enough to hang over the brim by a few inches on all sides. Then lift the burlap’s loose end and apply glue to a swath of the hat’s brim. Press the burlap down into the glue to stick the two together. Then:Use pins if needed to secure glued areas in place so the burlap doesn’t move around as you work.
Continue applying beads of glue along the brim and pressing the burlap into it until you have completed the whole brim.
Secure the burlap with pins if desired to keep it in place while the glue dries.

, Cut out a new length of burlap. Make it long enough to wrap around the hat's crown and then overlap itself by an inch or so. Glue the back of one end to the burlap circle, wrap the length around the crown, and glue the back of the free end to where it overlaps the first end., Cut out some small squares of burlap from your roll. Or, if you needed to trim any excess material from your circle, cut some squares from that. Glue these “patches” where desired to accentuate the scarecrow’s patched-together look."

Cut out a circle of felt for your hat.,
Shape your hat.,
Glue the pleats into place.,
Make a hat band.,
Add “straw.” Stick real straw in between your band and your hat, or make your own if needed.,
Glue the band, straw, and flowers to your hat.",How to Make a Scarecrow Hat2," How large of a circle you need depends on the size of the head in question, so use a cloth measuring tape to determine how far down from the crown you want the brim of hat to hang. Double that figure and use a ruler to trace two perpendicular lines of equal length in an X-shape on your unrolled fabric. Then trace a circle connecting the ends of each line and cut out the outline of your circle.Don’t worry if your circle is less than perfect. Scarecrows aren’t known for flawlessly tailored clothes.

, Drape the felt circle over the head in question. Create pleats running from crown to brim along the back and sides of your hat by pinching the material into a crease for each pleat and then folding it over slightly. Secure each pleat in place with strips of masking tape where your brim begins.If the hat is for yourself, you may need to ask a partner to help with this step to make life easier.
Alternately, you could try using an inflated ball that’s roughly the same size and shape of your head., Remove the felt from the person’s head. Apply beads of hot glue with a glue gun under the fold of each pleat. Leave your strips of tape in place to hold the pleats together until the glue dries., Place the hat back on the person’s head once the hot glue has dried. Cut a length of fabric (either the same felt as before, or any other that you want to use as an accent) that’s long enough to wrap their head where you want the brim to begin. Tape the band in place, then remove the hat.As before, a partner may make this step easier if the hat is for you.

, Cut thin strips of cardstock paper. Then fold each one accordian-style to create a crinkled look. Line the band with them as desired.Regular printer paper might hold up for a while if you’re only wearing the hat once, but otherwise go with cardstock. Since it’s thicker than regular paper, it will stand up longer.

, Use your hot glue gun to add beads of glue between the headband and hat. Make sure to cover any straw behind the band, too. Then, if desired, glue the back(s) of one or two flowerheads to the front of the band to add a touch of farm-and-garden to your hat."
"
Prepare your bag.,
Shape your hat.,
Trim away excess paper if desired.,
Decorate.",How to Make a Scarecrow Hat3," Cut a large brown paper bag open along one corner. Spread it flat on your worktable. Try to smooth out any creases as best you can., If you’re making the hat for someone else, drape the bag over their head and center it. Smooth the paper over their skull where the hat will cover it. Make new creases and fold them over to create pleats where needed. Then wrap wide tape around the bag to act as a hat band and hold its shape. If you’re making it for yourself:Do the same over an inflatable ball that’s roughly the same size and shape as your head.
If using a ball, you may need a partner to hold it still while you tape.

, Give the brim of your hat a look over. If there’s more paper than you’d like between its edges and the tape-band, cut away the excess with scissors. Then remove the hat from your model., Cut a length of fabric to tie or glue around the tape for a more eye-catching hat band. Stuff that with straw or crinkled cardstock paper. Cut small squares from your excess paper or another paper bag, glue these to the hat where you please, and use markers to draw stitches around their edges to transform them into patches."
"
Steam the hat.,
Pop the brim up and steam all around the brim.,
Use your fingers to mold the hat.,
Wet the hat.,
Let the hat sit and dry out.",How to Fix a Squashed Straw Hat1," You may want to try steaming the hat first. The most common way to steam a straw hat is to use a steamer or the steam setting on an iron. You could also take the hat to a hat store that has an industrial steamer, but it's usually not necessary.


Apply the steam around the entire brim of the hat first. The steam will loosen the fibers. The steam will help the hat regain its natural shape.
You could use steam from a pot of boiling water if you don’t have a steamer, but be very careful around boiling water.If the steam seems like it’s saturating the hat too much, stop for a few minutes before restarting the process.;
, Keep the steam about 6 to 8 inches away from the straw hat so the steam doesn’t damage it or hurt your hands. Pop the brim back down.


After directing the steam around the brim, put steam throughout the inside of the hat’s crown.
The steam should start popping the dents in the hat back out. You don’t want the steamer or iron to actually touch the straw though.
Continue steaming until the hat is damp. Don't worry that you are getting too much moisture in the hat because the moisture is what will help straighten it out.

, After you wet it or while you are steaming the hat, push everything back into shape, constantly molding the straw with your hands throughout the steaming process.


Pull the fibers apart with your fingers as you mold the hat. You could also use a spoon to mold the hat’s shape while it’s steaming instead of your fingers.
After you’ve steamed the hat, put a bowl, folded towel, or other object inside the hat. This will help its crown further regain its shape.
You may need to wear garden gloves or oven mitts when steaming the hat. It can be dangerous to be around hot steam, so be very careful that you don't burn yourself by getting too close to it.

, If steaming the hat doesn't work, you may want to wet the hat instead. This approach can especially work with a squished straw hat brim. Spray the hat with water. It should dry back in shape because the moisture will make the straw more pliable.


Just spray the hat with a misting of water. If that doesn’t work, you may want to dip the hat’s crown into a bowl of warm water. You don’t want the hat to be too dry or the straw could crack.
Make sure it’s evenly wet by turning it around and around in the bowl.After wetting the hat, you will want to mold it back into shape with your fingers or another object.
It might worry you to get a straw hat wet, but don't worry about that. It's one of the most common ways to reshape a hat.

, When you're done steaming or wetting it, you need to give the straw hat a chance to dry.


Start the steaming or wetting process all over again if the hat still hasn’t regained its perfect shape.
It depends on the hat and amount of damage. Some hats only require one steaming or wetting, but other hats may need to go through the process a second time.
Try for one steaming or wetting if possible, though, because you don't want to constantly reshape a hat.

"
"
Roll up a towel to mold the hat.,
Put a round object inside the hat.,
Iron the hat.",How to Fix a Squashed Straw Hat2," Instead of wetting or steaming the hat, you could try molding it back into shape. You could moisten the towel for good measure. The moisture will help the straw relax even more. Basically, the towel is going to substitute for your head.


Now, put the straw hat on top of the rolled-up towel. Let it sit there for a while to help the straw hat reform into the right shape.You want to make sure that you roll the towel widely enough and that you put the hat as far into it as you can. The towel method is a good choice if you’re on vacation and don’t have access to other hat-sized objects.
You could also stuff the hat with tissue paper or with pieces of crumpled up newspaper., Instead of a towel, you could put a bowl inside the hat or any other round object that will snugly fit inside the hat. This should help it take a head-like shape again.


Weights, clips or strings can also be used to hold down the hat, so that it starts to take its original shape.You could use any round object for this purpose, but you want to make sure that it fits perfectly inside the hat’s crown or it won’t help.
If it’s too big, it could damage the hat or actually make it more misshapen. Any object that is the right shape to fit inside the hat's crown should work.

, Rest the brim of the hat wrong side up on the edge of an ironing board. Place a damp cloth onto the brim. Set the iron to a fairly hot temperature.


Press the iron around the brim over the damp cloth. Press very gently and quickly and do not let the iron rest on the brim. This is very important or you could burn the straw.
Rotate the brim to move it around in its entirety. Iron the tops. The tops require careful treatment depending on their style. Be very careful when using an iron on straw. If you don't put the damp cloth between the iron and straw, you could burn the hat.
Take care not to get the hat crushed or squashed again, as the straw is already weakened from the first squash. Each time the hat will become less resilient until the individual straws begin to snap and loosen.

"
"
Buy a head block.,
Place a heavy object over the hat.,
Keep the hat protected.",How to Fix a Squashed Straw Hat3," These are Styrofoam heads that your hat can sit on when you aren't wearing it. This is the best way to regain the hat’s shape because it’s literally a fake head.


These aren’t as tough to find as you might think. You actually can buy them from many beauty supply stores because they are often used for people to store wigs. Just ask for a Styrofoam wig head.
After you wet or steam the hat, put the hat on the Styrofoam head block. Position it so that it’s sitting firmly on the block. Or just regularly store your hat on such a head block when you aren't wearing it.
You could insert pins through the brim into the Styrofoam to maintain the shape. Shape the brim with your hands.

, You want the object to sit on top of the hat’s brim in order to keep it flat and from curling up.


For example, you could take a small wastepaper basket or an ice bucket and put it on top of the hat, leaving it to sit against the brim for a few hours. The item needs to fit on top of the entire crown of the hat.
The weight of the basket or bucket should press the brim back into flattened shape. You want to make sure the basket or bucket large enough not to squish the rest of the hat, though.
This method is designed to flatten out a squashed straw hat brim, not to fix the dents in the crown of the hat.

, It’s a good idea to make sure that your hat doesn’t get too squished in the first place. There are ways you can keep your hat’s shape protected.


When traveling, carry your hat in a hat box or simply wear it on your head. Jamming a straw hat into a suitcase is a recipe for disaster.Avoid flexing the hat repeatedly, or it could become misshapen and some of the straw could even crack. You don’t want to weaken the hat’s crown or brim too much.
To clean light straw hats, you could use ½ teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide mixed with ½ teaspoon or warm water. To clean dark straw hats, mix ½ teaspoon of ammonia with 1/3 cup of water. You could also rub the hat with a piece of velvet that you’ve held in steam for a little bit.

Print or draw a fez pattern.,
Measure your head.,
Cut some string.,
Tape your paper down.,
Draw a curved strip.,
Draw a circle.",How to Make a Fez1," You can make your own fez pattern with a little effort, but if you find it difficult to get the dimensions right or would rather save yourself the trouble, you can find a free pattern online and use that.


Print the pattern on standard printer paper.
You can search for a pattern online. Search Pinterest or other similar sites.;
, Use a cloth measuring tape to find the circumference of your head. Position the end of the measuring tape just below the curve of your skull, roughly 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 cm) above the top of one ear. Wrap the tape around your head keeping it as parallel to the ground as possible while you work.Note that this measurement needs to be somewhat precise so that the hat sits snugly on your head, but also keep in mind that a measurement that is too tight will prevent the hat from sitting on your head at all., Once you know the circumference of your head, multiply it by 1.273. For example, if your head measurement was 21.5 inches multiply 21.5 by 1.273 to get 27.37. You can imagine the shape you are going to draw for the body of your fez as part of a giant perfect circle. If the circle was a pizza, the piece we are trying to make would be the crust of one slice. Since we only need part of it, we don't have to draw the whole circle, just figure out its radius. We do that by multiplying your head measurement by 1.273. In this case, the radius is 27.37. Next, cut a piece of string that is that length. In this example, you would cut a piece of string 27.37 inches long.Make sure you use something that won’t stretch a lot.
Birthday ribbon is a good alternative if you don’t have any string or twine.

, Before you start drawing your pattern, be sure to tape your paper down to the table or cutting board so that it doesn’t move around while you are working. One piece of scotch tape at each corner should be enough.Your best bet is to tape the paper down to a cutting board. This way it will stay secure after you draw your shape and be ready for you to cut it out right away.

, The curved strip will form the side of your fez. The longest part of the curve will need to equal the circumference of your head plus an additional 1/2 inch seam allowance. Take the length of string you cut and hold one end of it on the table perpendicular to the paper. Tie a loop in the other end and slide a pen or pencil inside. Place the pen at one edge of the paper. The string should be stretched from the point on the table and run at an angle to the pen. Now, keeping the string taut, slide the pen like a pendulum across the paper, letting the string guide you. This will work like a homemade compass and allow you to make a perfect curve that will match the size of your head. Do the same thing for the top of the shape, making the second curved line 5 inches above the first.Make sure to keep the string tight while you draw your line or you’ll end up with an uneven shape.
Keep your pen straight up and down while you draw. Tilting it will give you a distorted line.

, On a standard piece of printing paper, draw a perfect circle with a radius of 2-5/8 inches (6.67 cm). The best way to do this is with a compass that you can buy at a place like Walgreens or Office Depot. Cut the circle out.


This pattern piece will be used for the top of the fez.

"
"
Pin the pattern to some felt.,
Cut out the pattern shape.,
Repeat with a second piece of felt.Remove the pattern from your outer felt and pin both the top and side patterns to a second patch of felt.,
Repeat with interfacing.",How to Make a Fez2," Place the side pattern piece on a large piece of felt. Keep the felt and the paper as flat as possible, then slide straight sewing pins into the paper and material to hold the pattern in place. Repeat with the top pattern piece and another patch of fabric.


Use as many pins as necessary to secure the pattern to the felt, but also keep in mind that pins cause the pattern to wrinkle and bunch up, so using too many could slightly distort the shape of the felt once you cut it out.

, Use sharp sewing scissors to cut out the felt pinned to the pattern pieces.


Keep the scissors steady and rotate the felt as you cut. This will help you make a cleaner cut.
Keep the sides of the scissors blunt to the edges of the paper pattern. Doing so can prevent the the scissors from cutting at an angle and making the resulting felt piece too narrow or too wide.
Note that this first batch of felt will form the outside of your hat.

, Cut these felt pieces out, as well.


This felt will form the inner lining of your hat.

, Interfacing is a textile used on the underside of garments to help them maintain a rigid structure. Remove the pattern pieces from the second batch of felt and place them on a piece of heavy interfacing. Interfacing can be purchased at fabric or hobby stores.Pin in place, then cut the interfacing out according to the dimensions of the pattern pieces.


Interfacing is necessary since it gives the hat body and structure. Without it, the entire hat would likely collapse into itself after you sew it all together. Use a heavy interfacing for best results.

Create a loop of embroidery thread.Hold your non-dominant hand out straight, keeping the fingers together.,
Tie it off.,
Cut the looped ends.,
Tie the top.,
Join the ends together.",How to Make a Fez3," Using your dominant hand, wrap a bundle of embroidery thread around your non-dominant fingers 20 to 30 times.


The final tassel will be about four times as thick as the width you produce here, so keep that in mind as you wrap the thread around.If you find it difficult to use your fingers or if you want a larger tassel, wrap the embroidery thread around a heavy piece of cardboard or cardstock, cut to your preferred dimensions. Note that the tassel will be about half as long as the width of your cardstock.

, Carefully slip the embroidery thread loop off your hand. Tightly wrap both loose ends of the thread around the center of the loop several times. Tie these ends together with a tight knot.Note that you need to be careful about where you wrap the thread. If you do not wrap the loop in the precise center, your tassel might be lopsided.

, With a sharp pair of scissors, cut the looped ends on either side of your knot. Rearrange the loose ends of thread so that they all come together below the center knot holding everything in place.


You should already see the tassel shape forming at the conclusion of this step.
If the ends of the tassel seem uneven, carefully trim them using your scissors until they are all roughly the same length., Cut a separate length of embroidery thread. Wrap this thread around the top of the loose ends, just a little below the knot, cinching that top portion together.This piece of embroidery thread will need to be about three to four times as long as your tassel.
You will need to wrap the thread around a dozen times or more.
Tie a small knot at the base of the wrapped portion when done. Let the ends of the thread hang down into the tassel, trimming them to size., Presently, you should still have two unconnected pieces of embroidery thread hanging off the knot. Tie these pieces together as close to the ends as possible, forming a loop.Snip off any excess thread hanging from this top knot so that the knot looks less noticeable.
Set the tassel aside until you are ready to add it to the hat.

Iron the interfacing to your top felt.,
Pin and sew the two side pieces of felt together.,
Pin and sew the two top pieces of felt together.Just like with the side pieces, you should have two top pieces at this point, your outside piece, which has the interfacing on it, and your inside piece.,
Match the two ends.Now you are ready to take your side piece and sew the ends together forming the round shape of your fez.,
Sew along the edge.,
Attach the top piece of felt.,
Snip around the inside top.Make small cuts into the top circle of the fez with the hat still inside-out.,
Attach the tassel.,
Admire your work.",How to Make a Fez4," Spread out the side piece of your top felt on a flat surface. Note that the side facing you will be the inside of your hat. You’ll be constructing much of the hat inside out in order to hide the seems. Place the interfacing on top of the felt and pin in place with a few straight pins. Then iron the interfacing onto the felt according to the manufacturer's instructions. Repeat this process with the top of the fez, as well.Make sure that the glossy side of the interfacing faces the fabric. The glossy side is usually the adhesive side.
Use a low heat and a thin press cloth when ironing the pieces together. Do not use direct heat and do not use a high heat setting since doing either action may cause the felt to burn.
Iron around the straight pins initially. Once the fabric and interfacing feel securely joined, remove the pins and iron over the spot to adhere the interfacing there.
Let cool when done.

, At this point you should have an inside and outside piece for the side of your fez. Spread out the outside piece of felt with the interfacing side flat against your working surface and the outer side facing you. Lay the inner felt on top, matching the edges precisely. Pin in place using straight sewing pins, then sew around both curved edges of the fabric with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance. A seam allowance is the area between the edge and the stitching line on two pieces of material being sewed together. Do not sew the two straight ends of the fabric together.
When done, pull the two pieces of felt and the interfacing through one of the open ends. The interfacing should now be hidden on the inside of the joined fabric, and the side of the fez is now right-side-out.

, Place the top piece of felt on your working surface with the interfacing lined side down. Set the inner felt material down on top, matching up the edge as closely as possible. Pin in place, then sew the pieces together, using a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.


Leave a small 1 inch (2.5 cm) gap in the side of the circle as you sew the pieces together. Remember, you are initially stitching these pieces together inside out to hide the seems. Leaving this small gap in the circle will allow you to pull the top piece of the felt right-side out once you’ve finished sewing it together. Do not sew the circle all the way around.
When done, turn the circle right-side-out by pulling the material through the open gap. The interfacing should now be on the inside of the piece.
Close up the hole you left to pull the piece right side out. Carefully fold the remaining open edge inside the circle. Stitch closed.

, Lay the side piece of felt on your working surface so that the outside faces you. Fold it in half, bringing the two straight ends together. Line the edges up evenly and pin in place.

, Stitch along this pinned edge with a 3/8 inch (0.9 cm) seam allowance. Remove the pins when done.

, Stand it up on the larger of the two openings, and place the top felt on the smaller of the two openings. At this point, your fez is still inside out. Pin in place, then sew the top round of felt onto the side with a 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) seam allowance.


When pinning the top felt onto the side, make sure that the inside of the top piece faces you.
This part can be tricky to sew. Keep the round top piece facing down, lying along the sewing machine, with the side of the fez extending up and into the air.

, Use sharp scissors for clean cuts. These slits prevent the fez from bulging out at the top as you wear it.


Make sure that these slits go up to the line of thread but not through it.

, Thread a needle with standard, all-purpose thread. Bring the thread up from the inside top of the fez, straight through the center. Wrap the thread through the loop of your tassel before bringing your needle back through the top of your fez. Knot the thread on the inside of the hat.


You can make this connecting thread as long or short as you want it to be based on where you want the tassel to hang.
Note that if the fez is still inside-out as you work. The knotted side of your thread should face you and the tassel should be hidden.

, Turn the hat right-side out again. Straighten out the edges and the tassel, then try your fez on. With this step, the project is now complete.


Note that the fez should stay on with no assistance. If it wants to slip off, however, you can use bobby pins to help hold it in place.

, You can use a compass or even a large plate to draw the half circle. If you are using a plate, put the plate on the paper, and trace around it using a pencil. Make sure that the flat side of the half circle is along one of the edges of the paper.How big you make you hat will depend on what sort of hat you want.


If you want a birthday hat, make the half circle 12 to 16 inches (30.48 to 40.64 centimeters) wide. The final hat will be 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) tall.
If you want a clown hat, make the half circle 18 to 20 inches (45.72 to 50.80 centimeters) wide. The final hat will be 9 to 10 inches (22.86 to 25.40 centimeters) tall.
If you want a princess or wizard hat, make the half circle 22 inches (55.88 centimeters) wide. The final hat will be 11 inches (27.94 centimeters) tall.

, You can use a pair of scissors or a craft knife to do this. If you are using a craft knife, be sure that you have something underneath your paper to protect the surface you are working on, such as cardboard or a craft cutting mat.

, Roll the two flat edges of the half circle towards each other until they meet. The curved part of the half circle will become the brim of the hat. Put the hat on your head (or your child's head) and keep pulling the ends past each other until the hat fit.

, Once the hat fits your properly, take it off and staple the bottom edges together.

, Run a thin line of glue along the inside seam, and hold the paper together until the glue dries. You can also use double-sided sticky tape; simply cut a piece of tape that is the same height as the hat, and place it along the inside seam of the hat.

, To help the hat sit more securely on your head, you will need to add some thin elastic. Poke a small hole into the hat, about ½ inch to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) up from the base. Poke a second hole on the opposite side of the hat. Cut about 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) of thin elastic. Push or thread each end of the elastic through one of the holes, and tie a knot.Try the hat on and place the elastic strap under your chin. If it is too loose, take the hat off and pull one of the elastic ends further inside the hat. Tie a knot and try the hat on again. Once the hat fits, cut off any excess elastic string. Leave about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) of string above the knot. You can make the knot more secure by putting a drop of tacky glue or hot glue over it.

, Cut two pieces of ribbon that are about 24 inches (60.94) long each, and glue them to the inside brim of the hat. The ribbons should be facing opposite each other. This is perfect for a princess hat.Try the hat on, tie the ribbons into a bow, and trim off the ends if they are too long.

, Put the hat onto a headband, and make a mark where the bottom of the hat touches the band. Take the hat off. Run a thick line of hot glue just above the marks you made. Quickly put the hat back onto the headband and hold it until the glue sets.This works better for smaller, shorter hats (such as the birthday hats) than taller hats (such as the princess or wizard hats).

, You can personalize your hat by adding some decorations to it, such as stickers, pompoms, and rhinestones. This section will give you some decorating tips as well as ideas on how to make a princess hat and a wizard hat.

, Wizards love to study the stars, and their hats should reflect that. Make your cone hat more wizardly by adding stars to it. You can use star-shapes stickers, or you can paint on stars using star-shaped stencils.


If you are painting the stars on, consider using glow-in-the-dark paint.
Consider adding a star to the top of the hat. Buy a flat, wooden star (or cut one out from poster paper) and paint it with glow-in-the-dark paint. Once the paint has dried, attach the star to the top of the hat using some hot glue.

, No princess hat is complete without a veil. Measure out a length of tulle fabric (it should be at least twice as long as it is wide) and cut it with a pair of scissors. Gather one of the narrow ends and tie it off using a rubber band. Cut the point off of the cone hat (no more than 1 inch) and poke the rubber-banded end of the tulle into the hole. You can secure the tulle on the inside of the hat with some hot glue.


You can also use long strips of ribbon instead.
Consider decorating the brim of the hat by adding some trim.

, You can make your cone hat fancy (or a princess cone hat even fancier) by gluing some trim to the bottom rim. Take a measuring tape and measure the circumference of the hat, and remember the number. Measure out the trim according to that number and cut it. Attach the trim to the bottom rim of the hat using hot glue or tacky glue. Here are some ideas for what you can use for trim:


Tinsel
Marabou feather boa, or any other thin boa
Rickrack or ribbon
Crepe paper
Pompoms
Glitter

, You can add long strips of colorful crepe paper to the top of your hat to make a simplified princess hat. You can also add shorter lengths of crepe paper or curling ribbon along the bottom brim to mimic hair. Be sure not to add the crepe paper along the entire brim, or the wearer won't be able to see!You can make the curling ribbon (the type used on balloons) by running it along the edge of a scissor blade. Hold your thumb over one end of the ribbon, and give it a small, downward tug.
Attach the crepe paper to the inside rim of your hat using tacky glue. Attach the curling ribbon to the inside rim of the hat using hot glue.

, You can make your hat appear more amusing by gluing some glittery pompoms to the point. Simply snip off the tip of the hat, and then add a drop of hot glue onto the hole. Immediately place a sparkly pompom onto the glue.

, You can make a plain hat more colorful by adding shapes to it. You can do this by sticking on some stickers, cutting shapes out of paper and gluing them on, or using stencils to paint on some shapes with acrylic paint.

, Use white glue to draw some designs on the hat, then shake some glitter onto the hat. Be sure to turn the hat so that you entire design gets glittered. If you plan on using more than one color, then add the glue and glitter for the first color and let it dry before adding the glue and glitter for the next color.


Draw some fun designs, such as stars, dots, zigzags, and spirals.
Draw a squiggle along the brim to make a fancy trim.
If you are making a bunch of hats for a party, consider making the hats more personal by writing the person's name in glue, and then using their favorite color in glitter.
If you want to make the entire hat glittery, then use spray-on glitter instead. Shake the can for a few moments and hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface. Spray on a light, even coat and wait for it to dry completely before apply a second coat.
Try working over a sheet of paper or a paper plate. That way, when you are done, you can roll the sheet of paper or the paper plate into a funnel, and pour the glitter back into its container.

, You can give your hat some extra bling by sticking some rhinestones or sequins onto it. You can use some stick-on gems used for scrapbooking, often found in the sticker section of an arts and crafts store, or you can hot glue some craft gems or sequins onto the hat.

, For a fun, whimsical hat, add some pipe cleaners. Bend some pipe cleaners into random shapes, but leave the bottom inch (2.54 centimeters) or so un-bent. Snip the point of the cone hat of, and tuck the pipe cleaner ends into the hole. If necessary, secure the pipe cleaner ends from the inside using tacky glue or hot glue. You can use one pipe cleaner or a bunch of pipe cleaners. Here are some more ideas:


Bend pipe cleaners into zigzag shapes.
Wind a pipe cleaner around a pencil and gently pull it off, creating a springy coil.
Bend the end of the pipe cleaner into a fun shape, such as a star or a swirl, while leaving the rest of the pipe cleaner straight.
Wind two differently-colored pipe cleaners together for a candy cane effect. You can then use them as any other pipe cleaner.
Make your pipe cleaner shapes extra wacky by hot gluing a tiny pompom to the end. This works especially well for the springy, boingy shapes.

, If Christmas is right around the corner, you can turn any red cone hat into a Santa hat by gluing a white, fluffy pompom to the tip, and cotton balls or fake fur along the bottom brim.

, If you are making your hat for a party, try to keep the theme or season in mind when decorating. Here are some examples and ideas to get you started:


If the party has a fish theme, then make some blue hats and decorate them with fish and bubble shaped stickers. Spread some glue along the brim of the hat and sprinkle sand over it. Glue several long strips of green crepe paper to the point of the hat to mimic seaweed.
If the hat is for a baby shower, and the theme is pink and white in honor of the baby girl, then make some pink party hats, and add a trim of white Marabou feather boa to the brim. Top each hat with a white pompom or feather poof. You can also use pink paper with white stripes or polka-dots instead of plain pink paper.
If the hat is for a Halloween party, you can make some some orange and black party hats, and add some spooky touches. Glue black tinsel along the bottom brim, and glue some plastic spiders to the point of each hat. You can also attach the plastic spiders to some string or pipe cleaners, and glue those to the point of the hat.

, It will not be as durable, but it will be easier to find the color you want. Keep in mind, however, that construction paper will may be too small to make larger hats, such as princess or wizard hats.

, Cardstock is sturdy and comes in many colors, but it may not be large enough to make the bigger princess and wizard hats. It usually comes in 8.5 by 11 inches (21.59 by 27.94 centimeters) or 12 by 12 inches (30.48 by 30.48 centimeters).

, You can easily add a pattern to your cone hat by stamping a pattern onto it. Simply find a stamp design that you like, and an ink pad. Press the stamp into the ink pad, wriggle it a bit to make sure that everything gets coated in ink, and then press the stamp onto the paper. Keep doing this until the entire paper is covered in your new design.


Keep in mind that most ink pads are made with translucent ink. This means that the original color of your paper with show through. For example, if you try to use a red stamp on a yellow poster paper, you will get an orange design.
For best results use white paper and any color ink, or black ink and any color paper.

, You can make your cone hat look more interesting by covering the poster paper with wrapping paper. Simply roll out a length of wrapping paper and set it pattern side down. Apply spray on adhesive to the back/white side of the wrapping paper, then place the poster paper down on top of the adhesive.


To protect the surface you are working on, consider covering it with newspaper or a plastic tablecloth.

, You can make a cone hat fit for a princess (or wizard) by covering the poster paper with fabric or felt. Simply cut a sheet of fabric the same size as your poster paper and lay it right-side down on a flat surface. The wrong side (or the back) of the fabric should be facing you. Apply a thin, even coat of spray-on adhesive, then place the poster paper onto the fabric.

, If you simply cannot find the perfect color of poster paper, you can make your own by painting it. You can either use a large, flat brush and acrylic paint, or you can use spray paint.


If you are using acrylic paint, apply the paint in a thin, even layer. Wait for the paint to dry, then apply a second layer. This reduces the brush strokes.
If you are using spray paint, hold the can 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the paper and apply a thin, even coat. If you need to apply a second coat, wait for the first one to dry, then reapply.

, You can use a picture editing program to design your own pattern and then print it out on a sheet of printer paper or cardstock. You can create all sorts of designs, including zigzag, stripes, and polka-dots. Try to use bright, and contrasting colors such as neon green and red.


If you are using cardstock and making multiple hats, then feed the cardstock one sheet at a time into the print so that the printer doesn't jam.

, If you want to make an extra glittery hat, you will have to finish making the hat first, then use spray-on glitter to cover the entire hat. If you try to add the glitter first, then you may not be able to glue or tap the hat close because of all the glitter. To apply the glitter to a finished hat, shake the spray can, then hold it 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 20.32 centimeters) away from the surface of the hat and apply a light, even stroke. Wait until the paint has dried completely before applying a second coat.

, If you are making the hats for a party or an event, then try to choose colors that match the theme of your party. Here are some examples:


If you are making hats for a New Year's Eve party, try using black, gold, and silver. You can also make black hats and use gold and silver trim.
If you are making hats for a party whose theme colors are turquoise and white, then try making turquoise hats with white or silver trim. You can also make turquoise hats with white stripes or polka-dots.

Decide how clean you want your hat.,
Clean your hat gently after each use.,
Remove dust and lint with a lint roller.,
Use wet wipes once a week.,
Store your hat properly.,
Wear a bandana or a do-rag underneath.",How to Clean New Era Hats1," Most people want to keep their New Era hats looking fresh off the rack. If that's you, you'll need to use gentle cleaning methods and proper storage to keep it safe. If you don't really care how new your hat looks, but just want to keep it from looking sweat-soaked and gross, you can disregard a lot of the more particular details, and just wash it as you would other clothing items.


Don't soak new hats you want to keep looking fresh for as long as possible. Wait until it gets really soiled and already starts looking old.
If you're not trying to keep your hat looking brand new, just toss it in the water to soak. Better yet, just toss it in the washing machine. Easy and done.;
, Every time you take off a New Era cap, it's a good idea to clean it up gently to make sure dust doesn't accumulate. This is especially true if you've got a white one. It doesn't need to take more than a minute or two.









If you can't dust your hat every single time, try to do it at least once or twice a week. Dust can work its way into the fibers of the cap, staining it over time, which will result in the need for deeper cleaning methods.

, The best way to keep your hat looking fresh every day is to run a lint roller over it, to remove the dust and the grime of wearing it. These are usually only a few bucks at most clothes retailers.


Some lint rollers have sticky sheets on the outside, which you can peel off after they get too nasty and hairy. Others will have thick bristles that go one way, but not the other. These are the best lint rollers, because they'll last a longer time and won't leave sticky residue on your hat.
Some hat places will even furnish hat brushes, specifically for this purpose. If they're really expensive, opt for the lint roller, which is basically the same thing.
DIY lint roller: Use the sticky side of tape, then toss it.

, Plain wet naps or wet hand wipes are excellent for doing little spot treatments on your New Era cap to keep it from developing stains before they become worse. Use one wet wipe to thoroughly wipe out the inside and go over the outside of your hat, about once a week, or more if you wear it every day.


Focus especially on the end of the brim on the side of your hand that you use most often, and the inside where you sweat. Fingerprint stains will tend to form on the brim where you grip the hat to take it off, and sweat stains can penetrate the fabric and be really difficult to get out.

, If you're just tossing your New Era on the dresser, or on the floor, it's going to pick up more dirt there than on your head. Plus, hat racks are dust traps, especially if you've got one right by the front door. If you want to be really protective of your New Eras, keep them in a box, with some tissue paper wrapped around them to keep them from getting too dusty. Fresh and clean every time, no cleaning required.

, If you sweat in your cap, you can keep the band from getting sweat-stained and requiring cleaning by creating a barrier underneath with a do-rag that fits tightly around you scalp, helping to hold your hair in place, keeping its oils from staining the hat, as well as keeping the sweat from penetrating the hat, at least as deeply.

Measure your head with a tape measure.,
Add one inch onto your measurements.,
Outline the shape of the band on thick white paper.,
Cut out the band you outlined.",How to Make a Chef's Hat1," Before you start working on the pleated, fluffy upper part of the chef’s hat, you first have to make the band that serves as the base of the hat. Use a tape measure to measure the circumference of your head so you can customize the hat especially for you and don’t end up making one that is too big or small.Measure your head by wrapping the tape measure around your head directly above your ears, where the brim of the hat will lie.;
, After you measure your head, add one inch (2.54 cm) on to the measurement number. It’s a good idea to make the brim a little bit larger than the size of your head so that it isn’t too snug.

, Take a piece of Bristol board, cardstock or stiff, white paper and draw a long rectangle using pencil, with the measurement that you calculated as its length. Decide how tall you want the brim of your hat, then use that number as the width.You can alter the band’s height to make the band taller or shorter, depending on your preference. Anywhere between 2 and 8 inches (5 and 20.3 cm) is generally a good height for the brim.

, Use a pair of sharp scissors to cut the rectangular band out of the paper. Try to cut in straight, even lines to make the hat look crisp and professional."

Tape plastic wrap over the sticker.,
Fill the sink with cold, soapy water.,
Scrub stains gently with a soft toothbrush or a clean cloth.,
Go over it once more with cold water.,
Air dry the cap.,
Consider washing the cap in the dishwasher.",How to Clean New Era Hats2," If you want to keep your hat looking like its just from the store, you want to keep that sticker looking as clean as possible. Water will ruin it very quickly, making it peel and flake off. If you're trying to clean the hat up without messing up the sticker, a big of cling wrap from the kitchen will do the trick.


Cut a piece of plastic wrap big enough to cover the sticker by a few centimeters on each side, then tape it in place. Make sure the tape seals the plastic thoroughly.

, It's important to use cold water on a new hat, which keeps the dye from seeping out, though you can feel free to use hotter water on older hats that have been washed already.


If you want to find out if your cap will bleed if you toss it into the washing machine or the dishwasher, do a little spot treatment with a white cloth. Wet the cloth with hot water and blot at the colored area of the cap. Does any color come off? Keep washing it in cold. If not, you're safe.

, Probably the most effective way of gently but firmly getting into any stains–sweat, oil, or otherwise–is to use a brand new, soft-bristled toothbrush, wetted slightly in the cold water. Move the brush in tight circles, scrubbing away the stains gently.

, After you clean the cap with soap, re-wet the toothbrush with plain water and gently go over it again to try to keep working the stains out. If you prefer, you could also switch to a wet-wipe, or a cloth to cover more territory.

, It's very important to set up the cap like you want it to look and let it air dry for about 24 hours before wearing it. If you've gotten the cap fairly damp, it can loose some of its shape, and start to look saggy and old, which is what you want to avoid. Set the clean cap up with the brim flat, and the top of the hat supported with


Consider getting a cap mold to help hold the shape of the hat. These are commonly available at hat stores and other clothing retailers, only cost a couple of bucks, and help you hold the shape of your hat long term, especially while drying. If you've got an adjustable cap, keep it adjusted to the size you wear.
While it might seem quicker, putting the hat into a clothes dryer will ruin the shape and crispness of the hat faster than anything else. The heat will soften the structure of the hat, making it much more pliable. Let hats air dry.

, One of the easiest and quickest ways of washing any baseball cap is to put it into a cap mold, set your dishwasher to a cold setting, and run it through about a half cycle by itself. Remove the hat about halfway through the cycle and let it air dry.


Make sure your dishwasher is extremely clean if you try to do this, and only do this for older hats that won't bleed.

Consider getting an official New Era cleaning kit.,
Store the hat on the pump-mold.,
Use the cleaning brush each time you wear the hat.,
Spray with shaping spray.",How to Clean New Era Hats3," New Era kits are sold with all the basic supplies you'll need to keep your hat looking clean and new. The kits typically retail for about the price of the hat, making them somewhat pricy, but include cleaning spray, shaping spray, a cleaning brush, and a pump-mold that you can use to maintain the shape of the hat when you're not wearing it.The value of these kits is pretty debatable. If you have a big collection of hats you want to keep looking new, it might be worth it, but if you've just got a few, it's probably fine to just use the basic cleaning methods described above.

, The pump-mold can be altered to shape the size of the hat you're wearing. You can set the mold by placing your hat on top of it, and inflating it to the size you want to keep the hat. Squeeze the pressure-ball to inflate the pump. Once you get it to the right size, it'll work on all your hats.








, After you remove the hat, place the hat on the pump-mold and spritz it with a gentle mist of cleaning spray, then gently comb the brim and cap of the hat with the cleaning brush to keep it looking nice.








, After you clean the hat, apply shaping spray while the hat sits. 2-3 pumps of shaping spray is usually enough. This will allow the hat to stay firmly molded and looking fresh for as long as possible.









The cap freshener spray is available for much less money, if you want to opt for the most important part of the package. You can usually get it for abut ten bucks, or try an off-brand cap-cleaning spray for regular up-keep of your caps.

Start to create pleats in a sheet of white tissue paper.,
Tape the pleats.,
Make pleats until halfway along the band length.,
Make pleats on the other end of the tissue paper.,
Fold the tissue paper over in half.,
Pull the unattached edge of tissue paper inside the band.,
Tuck the open end inside the hat.,
Fluff up the top with your hand.",How to Make a Chef's Hat2," After you create the band of your hat, it’s time to start making the puffy top of the hat. To begin, take a rectangular sheet of white tissue paper and make ¼ inch (.63 cm) pleats along one of the shorter edges of the tissue paper. Make around five pleats.


Make the pleats by pinching the tissue paper between your fingers, then creasing the paper into a pleat. Make the pleats about 5 inches (12.7 cm) tall.

, After you’ve created around five pleats, lay the pleated edge of the tissue paper over the paper band you created, overlapping by about ½ inch (1.2 cm). Then tape the tissue paper onto the band by placing a strip of tape so that it covers the pleated section and some of the long paper band., Continue pleating the tissue doing five pleats at a time, taping each section to the band of paper. Continue until the pleats reach the halfway point of the band., You also need to make pleats on the opposite end of the tissue paper. Create ¼ inch (.63 cm) pleats like you did for the other end of the tissue paper, this time taping over the pleats without attaching them to anything. Make sure that the strip of tape is folded lengthwise over the edge of the tissue paper, so that it covers both sides of the pleats., Place the chef’s hat upright so that it stands on its horizontal band. The pleated tissue paper should be standing straight up in the air. Take the tissue paper and fold it downward halfway along its height, making the hat half as tall as before., Take the edge of tissue paper that you just folded over and tuck it inside the band of the hat, overlapping by about ½ inch (1.27 cm). Then tape the tissue paper to the inside of the band.Tape the unattached tissue paper by placing the hat on its side, reaching in through the open band of the hat and taping the pleats to the band on the inside.
It’s ok there are gaps on either side of the tissue paper. You will correct this later.

, You should see that there are still two open sections of tissue paper that haven’t been tucked inside the hat that form an upside down U shape. Pinch the pleats of this tissue paper together, then pull the tissue paper and tuck it inside the brim of the hat.Tape the unattached tissue paper to the inside of the hat to secure it.

, By now, your chef’s hat is complete! You may want to stick your hand up inside the hat and spread out the tissue paper to make it fluff up. You should be left with a tall, fluffed chef’s hat that is ready to wear!"

Measure your head.,
Figure out how high you want the brim of your hat.,
Outline the brim of the hat onto white cloth and cut.,
Cut out a piece of stiffener.,
Draw ¼ of a circle on a piece of folded fabric.,
Cut out the circle.",How to Make a Chef's Hat3," Use a tape measure to measure around your forehead, above your ears where the hat will fit. Then add an inch to this measurement so that the hat won’t be too tight., You may prefer the style of a shorter brimmed chef’s hat, or like how a stiffer, taller chef’s hat looks. Approximate how tall you would like the brim of the hat to be, picking a number between 2 and 8 inches (5 and 20.3 cm). Then multiply this number by two and add on one inch (2.54 cm).You will create the brim out of a piece of cloth that has been folded over, which is why you need to multiply the number by two. You need to add the inch on to the measurement to allow for seams.

, Measure a rectangle onto a white pillowcase or another similar material, with the first measurement you calculated as the length, and the second measurement as the width. Then cut out the rectangle you created.You want to create your hat out of a white cloth that is light and crisp. Cotton is an ideal fabric, and using two white cotton pillowcases works well. Before using the pillowcases, cut them open, rip out any seams, and iron them so that they’re flat sheets of white cloth.

, Outline a rectangle onto a piece of stiffener or interfacing. The length of the rectangle will be the first measurement you calculated (the circumference of your head plus an inch) and the width will be the exact height you want your hat brim to be (do not multiply this number by two or add on an inch as you did for the fabric). Cut out the rectangle using a pair of sharp scissors.Use a piece of stiffener or interfacing that is white or light-colored.

, Take the second pillowcase and cut it into a square that is about 2 ft x 2 ft (.6 m x .6m). Then fold the square into fourths by folding it in half twice. Using a pencil or pen, draw a curve that starts an inch (2.54 cm) from the top right corner and arcs down to a spot that is one inch (2.54 cm) to the right of the bottom left hand corner.This arc is one fourth of the circle with will serve as the top, floppy section of the chef’s hat.
This size piece of cloth produces a floppy chef’s hat. If you want one that is less floppy, make the original square of fabric smaller.

, Make sure that the edges of your folded fabric line up, then carefully cut along the arc with a pair of sharp scissors, through the multiple layers of fabric. Discard the leftover fabric, then unfold the cloth to see the circle you created.It’s ok if the circle isn’t perfectly round, since its edges will be hidden when you eventually sew it into the brim.

Sew the interfacing and brim piece in loops.,
Cuff the brim piece.,
Fold the raw edges of the brim and iron.,
Sew the stiffener into the brim piece.,
Make ruffles around the circle.,
Pin the hat top to the cuff.,
Sew around the top of the brim to connect the two pieces.,
Finished.

",How to Make a Chef's Hat4," Take the stiffener or interfacing and fold it in half lengthwise, to make the strip half as long. Then use a sewing machine or sew by hand to create a seam about ¼ inch (.63 cm) in from the edge that connects the shorter, raw edges of the interfacing.


Do the same for the brim piece, so that you are left with two loops.

, Take the loop you made from your brim piece and cuff it in on itself to make it half its original width. This should leave you with a cuffed piece of cloth that has a folded edge on one side of its length and raw edges on the other side., After cuffing your brim piece, fold the raw edges of the brim piece inward about ¼ inch (.63 cm). Make sure to fold them over to the inside rather to the outside to hide the raw edges.Iron the brim piece, paying special attention to press the area you just folded over.

, Turn the brim piece inside out so that the seams are visible. Then tuck the stiffener or interfacing into the ¼ inch (.63 cm) “cuff” that you made by tucking in the raw edges. Sew by hand using straight stitches or use a sewing machine to sew the two fabrics together., Adjust your sewing machine’s stitch length and the machine’s tension to the highest setting. Then place the edge of the circular cloth under the needle of the machine and sew all the way around the circle, about ½ inch (1.25 cm) from the edge. This will create ruffled pleats in what will become the puffy top of the chef’s hat.Adjust the stitch length and tension of your machine back to the usual settings after you finish.
If you don’t have a sewing machine, hand sew using long, straight stitches and pull tightly after each stitch to create pleats.

, Slide the ruffled top part of the hat into the “cuff” of the brim piece you made, so that ½ inch (1.25 cm) of the ruffled hat top is inside the open part of the brim. Pin all the way around the top of the brim to keep the top part of the hat in place., Hand sew or machine sew all around the brim where it overlaps with the ruffled top piece, about ¼ inch (.63 cm) from the top edge of the hat brim. When you remove the pins, you will be left with a handsome chef’s hat that can be used for a costume or worn while cooking!,"

Make sure you have the basics!,
Now, organize your wardrobe!,
Get some accessories!,
Great!,
Accessorize your outfits!,
HAVE FUN!",How to Create Outfits," For starters, you probably want most of the following:


two or more pairs of dark wash jeans - bootcut, flare, skinny, or whatever cut you like best. Jeans are the staple casual basic, and they are comfortable, easy to wear, and look great.
Neutral pants - black slacks, pinstripe trousers, khakis, or even a pair of white jeans if you're brave! One or two pairs of these would be great. They go with anything and everything.
A few skirts - try different styles, fabrics, and colours. For instance, you could have a jean mini, a tweed pencil skirt, and a flowy A-line cotton skirt. Try for neutrals or easy to wear colours - red, blue, and purple are great.
Short sleeve tees - a few basic tees will take you far. Go for any colours that you like, with embellishments or patterns or anything - in different cuts like V-neck, scoop neck, and boat neck.
Layering camisoles and/or tank tops - a few of one or the other, or a mix of both, can add a pop to any outfit. Pick colours that are softer for the camisoles, like pastels or neutrals. This color scheme could work for the tank tops too - you could also choose bright, funky colours like orange and teal for the tanks. (This is mostly for women, but men go ahead if you like the idea!)
Long sleeves (sweaters, tees, etc) - long sleeve tees and sweaters are a staple for winter and fall. Any colours are great - try to get a few neutrals, but don't be afraid to go for eye-catching patterns or bright colours.
Cardigans, jackets, hoodies - you will want at least one or two cardigans in neutral colours, and maybe a few in non-neutrals if you want. A few jackets, one or two for each season, and some hoodies in bright colours (comfortable and very stylish!);
, Have each category of clothing listed above in its own separate compartment, or at least keep track of where they are. There's nothing worse than knowing what you want to wear, and not being able to find it.

, Scarves, jewelry, belts, sunglasses - these can really make your outfits pop. Try for a mix of different materials - don't buy all gold jewelry for example, but try to get some silver, enamel, wooden, or glass pieces as well.

, Now we can started on making the actual outfits - here are some basic rules to follow:


Mix textures! Outfits should contrast - for example, a cashmere cardigan with a cotton tee and a tweed skirt: this outfit has three very distinct textures. Textures can give just as much visual effect as colours do. If in doubt, go lighter - all-over cotton or silk looks much more pleasing to the eye than a wool shirt, sweater, and skirt.
Play with patterns! Patterns can work wonders for you. Say you have a great upper body, but you're a little self-conscious about your lower half - no problem! Wear something brighter and more patterned on top, with a neutral bottom. This draws the eye upwards. Careful, though - if you have a larger frame, horizontal frames can make you look wider. Also, try to stick to one patterned piece per outfit - more than that, and things get a little too loud.
Go, don't match! Never worry too much about whether your outfit is horrible just because you're wearing two different shades of blue. You don't have to match colours exactly - they just have to be in the same colour palette! A sky blue top would look better with a navy cardigan than with a cardigan of the same colour - this is because CONTRAST is more appealing to the human eye. Don't be afraid to mix different colours, either! Go for bold colours like orange and teal, red and navy, or green and yellow. However, make sure that your colours aren't battling with each other - try to have one of them dominate (for instance, an orange necklace with a blue top - there is definitely more blue in the outfit, so nothing clashes.)
Layer, layer, layer! Layering outfits helps emphasize your figure. It gives your body structure and visual interest, and helps expand the possibilities of your wardrobe.
Take note of your silhouette! Depending on your shape, clothes may or may not flatter you. If you have wider hips, an A-line skirt would work - the skirt flows away from the hips, balancing out the wideness. One-button blazers are great for a heavier torso because they create structure. Always try to accentuate the NARROWEST part of your torso - this creates an hourglass figure that is universally appealing. You could try buying clothing with a seam under the bust, or placing a belt along your waist, depending on where you are the narrowest - this way, your clothes will flatter you.

, Jewelry doesn't have to match 100%. Try to keep things in the same colour family - cool colours (green, blue, purple, grey) and warm colours (brown, red, orange, yellow) should stay together - but remember, neutrals go with everything!

, No one ever said that you couldn't break the rules a little - nothing is law except the law. If you really believe that your striped shirt looks great with a polka-dot skirt, go for it! Try not to overdo it, though - a little rebellion every once in a while makes people notice your unique style, but repetitive breaches just make you seem unfashionable.

Choose your hats.,
Determine your occasion.,
Stock up on pretty decorations.",How to Decorate a Hat1," Hats are a very personal item, and people like different styles.You can use hats that you already have, or buy inexpensive, plain hats to customize.
Pick your hats based on styles you like, or look into finding hats that complement your features.For example, rounder faces look best in hats that have some height and aren’t too close to the face, like a medium-brimmed fedora.Baseball caps, wide-brimmed straw hats, fedoras, cowboy hats, top hats, and beanies can all be customized in different ways.;
, When you plan to wear your hat will have an effect on how you want to decorate.


For example, if you just want to customize the baseball cap you wear all the time when you run errands, you probably won’t add feathers or glitter.
However, if you want to make a derby or costume hat, you might want to add more over-the-top decorations.

, Having lots of materials to work with can help inspire your final design.


Lay out all your materials in front of you, and think about which colors complement each other.Make piles of decorations you think go together.
For subtler designs you might want things like: embroidery thread and a needle, fabric paint or fabric markers in an array of colors, and scraps of patterned fabric. Craft stores will often have short ends of fabric on sale.
For a grander hat consider: ribbon, feathers, fake flowers,sequins, tulle, and glitter.
Regardless of the extent of your decoration, make sure you have scissors and some type of glue on hand. Especially for bulkier decorations like feathers, hot glue works best and glues easily.

"
"
Put a ribbon on it.,
Make a small, embroidered design.,
Add a flower.,
Draw on your hat.",How to Decorate a Hat2," A plain hat like a fedora or straw hat can be instantly dressed up by adding a new ribbon above the brim.Measure the circumference of the base of the crown of the hat with a flexible measuring tape made for sewing, and cut your ribbon about an inch longer than this measurement, so you have a small overlap to glue.
Glue the ribbon around the hat. Use a small line of hot glue in the middle of the ribbon. Tuck the exposed edge under slightly so it doesn’t look frayed or become more frayed over time.
For whimsy, use a bright ribbon with a pattern like polka dots or stripes.
For a more classic style, use a solid color, satin ribbon.

, This works well to adorn fabric hats like the top of a baseball cap or a woven bean.First, use a piece of white chalk or chalk pencil to draw the design you want to create on your hat. It can help to mark off where you want each individual stitch by using dotted lines.
Then, thread an embroidery needle with embroidery floss in your color of choice. You can find both of these at most craft stores. They will be labeled for embroidery.
Follow your design by bringing the need down and through each of your dotted stich marks. When you finish your design, tie off the end of the thread so that your embroidery doesn’t come out.
If you’ve never embroidered before, start with a simple design, like a geometrical shape or group of shapes like squares or stars.
You can go back over your design with a different color of thread if you want a bit more complexity.

, A single homemade rosette can be a nice touch on a hate like a fedora.You can use any fabric you want, like tulle or thick cotton.


Cut out petals from your fabric. These should be ovals in varying sizes. You’ll want a few large petals for the bottom of your flower and smaller ones for the top petals.
To attach them, either sew them together, or glue them on top of one another. Cross two petals on the bottom, and continue them upward until you use your smallest petals.
Glue the finished rosette to your hat with a large dot of fabric glue or hot glue.

, Another two-dimensional way to spice up your hat is to draw on it with fabric markers or paints.This is great for first-time fabric crafters.


Draw your design on your hat first in pencil or with chalk.
Use the fabric markers to go over the outline you made, and then fill in your design with additional colors.
This works well with hats like baseball caps that are made from cotton. It doesn’t work as well on textured materials like straw or felt. If you do want to draw on a more textured hat, opt for the fabric paint over the markers.

"
"
Create some sparkle.,
Increase the height.,
Create a theme for your hat.",How to Decorate a Hat3," For an eye-catching design, you might want to add some decorations to your hat that will catch the light.


Use dots of hot glue to add sequins, rhinestones, or shiny buttons all over your hat.
If you want to use glitter, first spread a thin layer of glue on your hat where you want the glitter to go. Fabric glue works well for this. You could make a design like a star.
Shake the glitter over your glue design, and then, after waiting about a minute, gently shake off any excess. Make sure you have a piece of newspaper under your hat to catch any excess glitter., For an over-the-top hat, you want to add as much tasteful volume as you can.


Feathers can be glued against the crown of a hat. Try using different colors and sizes in an arrangement for more visual interest.
A cluster of homemade rosettes can make a great statement, whether they are an array of colors or monochromatic.
Tulle fabric can be cut and shaped into a huge bow to add to almost any design. If you want a tulle bow, first form the bow and glue it together, and then glue it to your hat., This will help you envision your finished product, and make a statement.


Your theme could be as simple as shades of blue, or more complex.
For example, you could have a garden theme, and glue branches of fake flowers and little fake bird onto your hat.
Or, you might have a more modern them, and only use black and white decorations, like clear rhinestones and a spray of black feathers on top of a black hat.

Put pantyhose on carefully.,
Inspect your pantyhose after each wear for snags and tears.,
Wash pantyhose after each wear.,
Store pantyhose carefully.",How to Care for Pantyhose," Instead of entering feet at the top of the hose and running them through the length of the legs to the bottom, gather the pantyhose in your fingers until you reach the toes; place your toes into the hose, then stretch the length of the stocking up over your calves and thighs. Be careful, when gathering the stocking, not to twist the legs, as this will affect your ability to stretch them over your leg comfortably.;
, Treat all tears immediately. Apply a small amount of clear nail polish to small tears, in order to prevent the tear from becoming longer. Allow the polish to dry before storing pantyhose.

, Instead of storing used pantyhose with other clothes on which they might become caught, wash them with soap in a sink, and hang them on a clothesline to dry. Never wash pantyhose in a washing machine.

, Store them in a plastic bag, in a safe place such as a dresser drawer, where they will be undisturbed by other items that might snag them.

Buy imitation-leather instead of real, genuine leather or suede.,
Do not purchase clothing or fabric made from silk.,
Do not buy clothing made from down or animal feathers.,
Do not buy clothing made from any type of wool.,
Buy faux fur or fake fur instead of genuine fur or pelts.",How to Buy Vegan Clothes,"


Leather is not vegan because it is made from animal skin and hides.
Read clothing labels to find alternative products that imitate leather such as pleather, synthetic leather, man-made leather, waxed-cotton, and imitation-leather.
Clothing made from imitation-leather materials are generally far lower in price than clothing made from genuine leather or suede.;
,


Although silkworms produce silk naturally, sometimes silkworms are boiled alive to extract extra amounts of silk.
Buy materials and fabric that feel like and resemble silk such as polyester, nylon, rayon, tussah, ceiba tree and silk-cotton tree filaments, milkweed seed-pod fibers, and tencel, which is fabric made from wood pulp.

,


Clothing made from down and feathers are not vegan because they are plucked from animals while they are alive or the animals are slaughtered specifically for their down.
Read clothing labels to find substitutes for down, such as polyester fill, synthetic down, down-alternative, and hypo-allergenic synthetic down.

,


Goats, sheep, camels, and rabbits are animals that generate wool and in some cases are raised in harsh conditions for their hair.
Wool products that should be avoided are angora, cashmere, pashmina, mohair, camel hair, and shearling.
Buy alternative wool materials such as polyester fleece, cotton flannel, acrylic, orlon, synthetic wool, synthetic fleece, and any other wool fabric preceded by ""synthetic.""
Some man-made products exist that rival wool in terms of thickness, providing warmth, and can wick away moisture. These products are generally made from recycled plastic soda bottles and can be found in specialty stores that feature outdoors clothing.

,


Fur and pelts are not vegan because they are taken from animals raised or trapped specifically for their fur such as foxes, minks, lynxes, rabbits and more.
Look for clothing labels that indicate faux fur, polyester, acrylic, or mod-acrylic, all of which can accurately replicate fur.

Look through your closet to determine what styles you have that are old, outdated and unflattering and get rid of them.,
Take your measurements to be sure you will be shopping for sizes that fit.,
Decide what styles fit your fashion sense and are practical for your lifestyle.,
Shop for women's 50 plus clothing styles at stores that focus on the mature women to find styles and fits that flatter your figure instead of trendy clothes that might not stay in style for very long.

,
Try on styles you like and check the fit to make sure the colors and patterns flatter your body type.

A good clothing tip for women over 50 is to not wear anything that is over 10 years old. Exceptions to this rule are classics, such as nice-fitting blue jeans, crisp blouses and sleek skirts.;
, Though you may have worn the same size for years, measuring will help you find clothing that fits perfectly and flatters your mature figure.

,


For example, you may need to purchase classic blouses and business jackets, skirts and pants for work, and well-cut blue jeans and casual shirts for the weekend. Shop for styles that fit your taste, budget and body type.

Get two to three pairs of dress pants.,
Buy two to three blazers.,
Buy five dress shirts.,
Get one or two pairs of leather dress shoes.,
Buy three or four ties.,
Buy one full suit.,
Don’t forget socks.,
Mix and match the items you have.",How to Buy Business Attire1," You will want at least one pair of wool dress pants in a darker color, such as charcoal, black, or navy blue. Also, purchase two pairs of cotton pants, like chinos, in khaki or a lighter color. Chinos are less formal than dress pants, but are wonderful for business-casual dress and for warm weather.The “break” in a pant leg is the fold or crease where the front of the pant leg meets the shoe. Choose the amount of break—in other words, the length of the pant—based on the following:Go with no break if you want a contemporary, stylish look. No break means the bottom of the pant leg barely touches the top of your shoe. This style is great for those with slim bodies and for those who are short.
Choose a slight or medium break to be more conservative, while still being stylish. The shorter the break, the more trendy the look.
Go for a full break if your pant legs are a bit wider, or if you are a bit heavier. This is the most traditional look, and it shows a conservative style.;
, You will want to choose two or three blazers, also known as sports coats, in versatile colors, such as black, grey, and navy. These can be worn with your dress pants, or with jeans for more casual events. Try to purchase lighter fabrics, such as cotton, so that you can wear these year round.


If you are taller than 5’9” (180cm), choose a blazer that ends at your lower crotch area. If you are 5’9"" (180cm) or under, buy a blazer that ends at your mid-crotch area. Remember that if it is too long, you can always have it tailored; however, if it is too short, it may be difficult or impossible to adjust.
You want to be sure that the shoulder seams lay right where your shoulder ends. The shoulders of the blazer should lay perfectly flat on your shoulder, with no pulls or wrinkles., You will want to have one dress shirt for every day of the working week. The colors are really up to you, but it’s a good idea to have two or more white ones and a pale blue one. A black dress shirt will also go nicely with a grey suit or grey dress pants., If you have to choose just one pair to start, black leather shoes will be the most versatile. Then, when you’re ready to invest in another pair, try a nice dark brown or tan leather. It will be worth it to invest in a pair of good quality, comfortable leather shoes with a hard sole. If you take good care of them, a nice pair of shoes can last you many years.To take care of your dress shoes, polish them regularly and get the soles replaced by a cobbler when they have worn down.
You can also purchase a nice pair of leather or suede loafers as an alternative to your dress shoes.

, You don’t need to buy these all at once, but having a rotation of ties can add a little bit of pop and variety to your outfits. You will want some silk ties that are a solid color, and if you choose patterns, choose ones that are timeless—this way, you can keep the ties for many years without worrying about them going out of style.

Some timeless necktie patterns that you may want to try are polka dots, foulard (which just means a repeating, symmetrical pattern), or stripes.For some extra business-appropriate fun, you can consider buying a knit tie in a deep blue, burgundy, or grey.

, A suit can be an expensive investment, but if you purchase one that is good quality and a classic style, you will be able to wear it for years. Choose a suit that fits your body wonderfully, is dark in color, and is timeless. A great option for a classic suit is a charcoal grey one that is single breasted, with two to three buttons and three pockets (two on the sides and one on the left breast)., While socks may not be the most exciting investment, black dress socks are a crucial piece of your business wardrobe. Buy at least five pairs of black dress socks, so that you have one pair for every day of the week. If your office is more casual, you can spring for some fun patterned socks that match your style., Now that you have all the components of a classy business wardrobe, you can mix and match them to create many different outfits. Try wearing an outfit with a blazer one day and without the blazer, but with a tie, a few days later. Since you purchased items that are mostly neutral in color, there are many combinations of your pieces that will look great.

Buy two or three pairs of solid-colored dress slacks.,
Choose a blazer that is black, navy blue, or grey.,
Buy a solid-colored pencil skirt.,
Choose five blouses.,
Grab a few pairs of pantyhose.,
Invest in a pair of good quality black dress shoes.,
Get yourself a little black dress.,
Collect jewelry.,
Mix and match your pieces.",How to Buy Business Attire2," Your slacks will likely be worn more than anything else you buy, so you want to be sure to purchase pairs that are versatile. Black, navy blue, and grey are great color options. They can be worn with a blazer, and look wonderful with neutral or brightly colored blouses.

Be sure that you feel comfortable in the pants and that they fit your body well.
To be sure that the pants are appropriate for business, make sure that they are not too tight and will not show underwear lines.
If there is a lot of extra fabric around the crotch area, or the crotch of the pants hands down between your legs, it is likely that the pants are too big. Try on a smaller size or consider a different pair of pants if the issue persists with any size., Your blazer can be dressed up or down by being paired with dress slacks, a skirt, or with a nice pair of jeans. Be sure that it fits well, as alterations can be expensive. Consider the following when trying on a blazer:

Shoulders: This is the most important part of the fit to get correct because shoulder alterations are expensive and complicated. The shoulder seam of the blazer should line up with the end of your shoulder, just before it slopes down into your arm.
Sleeve length: You want the sleeve to hit your hand just a bit above the top joint of your thumb.

, Your pencil skirt will be able to replace slacks on certain days. Choose a skirt in either black, grey, or navy blue—ideally, the skirt will match your blazer, so you can wear the two together if you wish. However, your pencil skirt can also be matched with a blouse and stockings as its own outfit., You will want to have one blouse for every day of the working week, to avoid having to do laundry during the week. Get a few white shirts for wearing with slacks or your skirt and perhaps your blazer. Apart from the standard whites, consider a black blouse and a grey blouse as well. You can also choose brightly colored blouses to add some pop to your business outfit.

Be sure that if a blouse is see-through, you wear a tank top or undershirt with it.
When choosing blouses, pay attention to how tight and low-cut they are. Depending on your office environment, low-cut and tight blouses may be inappropriate.

, Pantyhose are great for the days when you wear a skirt, and they can also be worn under your dress slacks. Buy two pairs of black ones and two pairs of skin-toned ones. Pantyhose can be found very inexpensively at convenience stores, or you can invest in some more durable ones from a clothing store.

Pantyhose often snag, so it's a good idea to have an extra pair on hand when you wear them with a skirt.

, Shoes are one of the most important investments you’ll make for your business wardrobe, since you will be wearing them all day, most days. Comfort is so important here—look for black leather shoes that are closed-toe. If possible, pumps with a small to mid-height heel are best.

As an alternative to wearing heels, you can buy leather flats.
After purchasing a pair of black shoes, consider buying red or brown heels or flats as well.

, If you don’t have one already, a classy little black dress will be a great addition to your business wardrobe. You can wear it with a blazer, pantyhose, and heels for a lovely business look. Depending on the style of the dress, you can also repurpose it for a night out!

Like with all business attire, be sure that the dress matches the guidelines of your company. Generally, you want to avoid a dress that is too short or too low cut.

, Jewelry will give your business attire a personalized touch. Buy a pair of earrings, a simple necklace, or a statement piece. Statement jewelry is often inexpensive and can add flare to your outfit.

Consider simple gold or silver earrings and a necklace or bracelet to add elegance to your business outfit.

, Now that you have all the components that make up your business attire, you can have fun mixing and matching to assemble many different outfits. This allows you to wear some of the same items multiple times in one week without appearing to be wearing the same outfit."

Make a list.,
Shop at discount stores.,
Go for quality over quantity.",How to Buy Business Attire3," Before you go shopping, make a list of the items that are essential for your basic business wardrobe. As you put the item in your cart, cross it off the list. This will prevent you from getting carried away and spending money on things other than the necessities.A guideline to consider when shopping for business attire is the 70/30 rule. This rule suggests that 70% of the items you buy should be classic, versatile pieces, like your grey dress pants, navy blue blazer, and white blouses. The other 30% can be fun, bright, or trendy pieces. Sticking to this will help you ensure that most of your purchases will be multi-purpose and will not go out of style., You can find great, high-quality business attire for low prices at discount stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx, Nordstrom Rack, or thrift stores. Check out these stores before heading to the more expensive department stores to see what items you can cross off your list for cheap., While saving money is always a joy, there are certain items, such as shoes, dress pants, and your suit, that you just shouldn’t skimp on. Invest in a few high quality items, rather than a large amount of cheaper ones.

Good quality leather shoes, dress pants, and a wool suit can last you for many years if you take good care of them, which will save you money in the long run. The alternative is buying cheaply made items, and paying to replace them each time they break or wear out.

Decide to purchase a faux leather item.,
Look for good texture.,
Choose your colors.,
Compare the level of “sheen.” Faux leather items will range from very shiny to very matte, and everywhere in between.To choose a real-looking faux item, select something with a little less sheen.,
Select items with mixed materials.",How to Buy Faux Leather1," Leather is beautiful and fashionable for both furniture and clothing. There are several benefits to choosing faux leather for your body or home.Faux leather is less expensive.
Faux leather is easier to maintain.
Faux leather is vegan-friendly.
Some faux leather items are made to be indistinguishable from the genuine article.
Other faux leather items play up their artificiality for a bold and funky effect.
Some negative aspects include: faux leather is not breathable, it doesn’t look quite as nice, it does not age as well as real leather, it may not be biodegradable.;
, When choosing a quality faux leather item, the first feature you should look for is texture. Genuine leather has a grainy texture, and so do high-quality fakes. Whether you are going for a realistic or more outlandish look, avoid an overly smooth surface. This can be indicative of lower quality., When it comes to faux leather items, the sky is the limit regarding color. Bright colors, funky patterns, imitation animal skin looks, and natural blacks and brown are all available in faux items.Basic black or brown faux leathers will be more likely to pass as the real thing.
Bright bold colors, funky patterns, or metallic finishes will give off a dramatic effect., True leather is not shiny, but matte. Alternatively, go for a trendy look by choosing high-gloss patent leather.

, Whether you are going for realistic or bold appeal, items that mix faux leather with other materials (like wool or cotton) can be great choices. Clothing items (like jackets with faux leather patches) or furniture pieces that integrate multiple materials give off an organic feel. The contrast between materials often gives the faux leather a genuine look."

Decide what type of faux leather you would like.,
Determine the amount of faux leather you need.,
Visit a fabric store.,
Shop online.,
Shop at interior design outlets or conferences.",How to Buy Faux Leather2," If you are choosing your leather based on a certain type of real leather, then try to decide the color scheme and pattern you would like. Research examples of names, colors, and patterns.Faux leather fabric is available in styles that mimic a number of animal hides, such as ostrich, reptile, calf, bison, gator, or pigskin.
Patterns, such as tooling, are common to faux leather fabric. Choose floral designs, paisley designs, cowboy motifs, symbol designs or a woven look as alternative textures.
Faux leather also comes in a few different finishes. You can choose shiny, pearl or metallic finishes. Micro-suede is a type of faux leather that is prized for its finish.

, Before you purchase faux leather, you will need figure out exactly how much you will need. This will enable you to accurately price your project in advance. An average sofa will require around 16 yards (15 m), while a typical loveseat will need approximately 11.


As a precaution, always purchase just a little bit more than the minimum needed. , Depending on the particular store, craft or fabric store may have anywhere from 5 to 20 different faux leather options, available by the yard. A craft or fabric store is the best choice if you want to touch and examine faux leather options before buying. Shop around at a few different stores to find the best product and price.

, Shopping online will give you the widest variety of options in terms of both selection and quantity. The major disadvantage of buying online is that you cannot actually see or touch the product. Additionally, depending on the size of your order, the shipping costs may be high.


An online upholstery fabric outlet will have large quantities of upholstery fabric in different colors, patterns, and finishes.
Search for eco-friendly faux leather options.

, If you are an interior decorator or designer, you may qualify for discounts from certain retailers. Attend an interior designers conference or search for online retailers that offer discounts for designers. Speak to other designers to ascertain tips and industry bargains."

Read the label.,
Inspect the edge.,
Examine pores.,
Trust your touch.,
Smell the item.",How to Buy Faux Leather3," Though it may seem obvious, reading the label on an item is a sure fire way to identify the type of leather. Products made of real leather will proudly say so on the label. If the label says, ""vinyl"" or ""manmade materials,"" the item is faux., Examine the edges of the furniture or garment. Look at any place where the material has been sewn. Fake leather products will have a smooth, pristine edge that can feel almost plastic. Genuine leather will have a rougher, imperfect look around the edges., Take a close look at the pores (or small dots) of the fabric. You may have to look closely to see them. Faux leather will have pores in a perfect, consistent pattern. Real leather will have irregular, sporadically placed pores.

, Genuine leather can feel coarse, smooth, or somewhere in-between. Real leather is also flexible and soft. If the product in question feels very smooth or feels like plastic, it is probably faux leather. Synthetic leather can also be a bit stretchy.Familiarize yourself with leather textures by visiting a reputable leather store and getting a feel for both products.

, Real leather has a very distinct smell. It really cannot by replicated by faux materials.Real leather smells earthy. Faux leather may have no odor, or smell a bit like plastic.


Once again, you can familiarize yourself by visiting a reputable leather store and getting a smell of both kinds of products.

You should not unbutton your suit while standing, especially not during formal occasions.Both a one and two button suit should remained buttoned when you stand.;
, With a one button suit, it's fairly self explanatory. You should button the only button, found in the center of the suit. With a two button suit, fasten the button on top. This will help the suit flatter your figure more., Sometimes, it's okay to go against custom. In the vast majority of situations, the upper button should be fastened. However, in the following circumstances, it's okay to use the bottom button.If you use a long lapel, you should fasten the bottom button. Fold the lapel all the way down past the top button.
If you have a very high stance jacket, it may look odd with the top button fastened. Fastening the lower button can make the suit look more proportional.
If you're very tall, a jacket may spread above your waist. This can expose your trousers and belt buckle. If this happens to you, use the bottom button.

, It is expected that your suit will be unbuttoned when you're sitting down. This will help avoid creases. Make sure to fasten the suit as soon as you stand., The middle button is between the top and bottom button. If your lapel's roll is soft, and extends past the first button, use the middle button.You should always keep this button fastened when standing. It is never customary to undo the middle button when you're standing up.

, With a flat lapel, you should button the top two buttons. The suit will look better this way. You can also use the top button if you personally prefer this look as long as your lapel does not extend past the first button.Again, the middle button should always be fastened when standing.

, This is also customary when wearing a three button suit. This will help prevent creases.Always remember to re-fasten the buttons when you stand.

, Under no circumstances should you fasten the lower button. This is never considered customary. Only use the top and middle button on a three button suit.Some three button suits are called 2 1/2 suits. In these suits, the lower button almost always constricts movement when fastened. It is a particularly big faux pas to fasten all three buttons in a 2 1/2 suit, and it will also be very uncomfortable.

, A double-breasted has more buttons than button holes. For example, a suit may have six buttons and only four button holes.Fasten any button that has a working button hole.
Go slowly as you button a double breasted suit. You want to make sure you're matching each button with the corresponding button hole.

, It is rarely considered custom to button the bottom button on a double-breasted suit. The vast majority of people leave this button undone.However, some men do button the bottom button. Prince Charles, for example, is known to use the bottom button in a double-breasted suit. If you prefer the style, you can try. Just keep in mind many people may find it unconventional.

, Unlike other suits, a double-breasted suit is not unbuttoned. Whether you are sitting or standing, keep all the buttons fastened., With a woman's suit, where the buttons fall is important. If your buttons do not fall in the right place, you may need a different size suit.The middle button of a three button suit, or the top button of a two button suit, should never fall past your navel.
Adjust your suit if the buttons are not falling in the right place. If you can't get your buttons in the proper position, it may be necessary to purchase a new suit.

, With a woman's suit, all your buttons should be fastened in a professional setting. In a business meeting, for example, make sure your suit is fastened.Your suit should stay fastened regardless of whether you're standing or sitting down.

, If having all the buttons fastened is uncomfortable, you can leave the bottom button undone. Keep in mind, however, this is only appropriate with a two or three button suit. A one button suit should always remain buttoned., A blazer may not always button comfortably. If you have difficulty buttoning a blazer, or simply don't like the look, it's appropriate to leave it unbuttoned in a more casual business setting.However, for more formal occasions, always button your blazer. An unbuttoned blazer can look unprofessional in some cases.

Hello: Olá (oh-la)
Hi or Hey: Oi (oy) — informal
Goodbye: Adeus (ah-deuzh)
Bye: Tchau (cha-oh) — informal
Note that some of these words are marked with the label ""informal."" In Portuguese, it can be considered rude to use informal language with people you don't know, people who are older than you, and people in positions of authority. These aren't curse words — just words that aren't very dignified. A good rule of thumb is: don't use informal words with people you aren't close buddies with.;
, Just like English, there are many different ways to greet people in Portuguese. These greetings allow you to remark on the time of day when you say hello:Good morning: Bom dia (Boh-n dih-ahor Boh-n djih-ah in Brazil) — actually means ""good day,"" but it´s used mostly before noon or before the noon meal.
Good afternoon: Boa tarde (Boh-ah tahr-jia) — used after noon or after the midday meal until twilight.
Good evening or good night: Boa noite (Boh-ah no-ee-tay) — used from twilight until the morning.

, Portuguese is no different than most other languages — after you say hello to someone, it's common to ask how they're doing. Use these easy phrases to ask about the people you meet:How are you?: Como está? (Coh-moh esh-tah? or Coh-moh es-tah? in Brazil)
How's it going?: Como vai? (""Coh-moh vye?"" (rhymes with ""eye"")) — informal
What's up? (Only in Brazil): E aí? (E-aye (pronounced as one syllable)) — informal
Is all well?: Tudo bem? (""Too-doo beng?"") — informal

, Once you ask someone how they're doing, odds are that, at the very least, they'll ask the same to you. Use these responses to tell people who you are and how you're doing:Well / very well: Bem / muito bem (Baing / moo-ee-toh baing)
Bad / very bad: Mal / muito mal (Mao / moo-ee-toh mao)
More or less / so-so: Mais ou menos (Ma-eece oh meh-nos)
My name is...: Me chamo (Mee sham-oh)
Nice to meet you: Prazer em conhecê-lo/a (Prazh-air eh con-yo-see-lo/la)
Note that conhecê-lo/a can end with either an o or an a. In these cases, when you're talking to a man, use o, and when you're talking to a woman, use a. We'll see this several more times in this article.

, As a newcomer to the Portuguese language, you'll probably find yourself struggling to communicate from time to time. Don't worry — no one learns a new language overnight. Use these handy phrases to explain your situation:


I don't speak Portuguese - Não falo Português - (Nah-oom fah-looh poor-too-gess)
I speak English: Falo Inglês (Fah-looh inn-glesh)
Do you speak English?: Fala inglês? (Fah-lah inn-gless) — formal
Do you speak English?: Você fala inglês? (Voh-say fah-lah inn-gless) — informal
I don't understand: Não percebo (Nah-oo pehr-say-boo)
Could you repeat that?: Pode repetir? (Poh-day reh-peh-teer)

, Learning how to be polite in Portuguese is very important — you certainly don't want to tarnish your native country's reputation by accidentally being rude. Use these words and sayings to make sure you stay in the good graces of the people you talk to:


Please: Por favor (Pooh-r fah-voh-r)
Thank you: Obrigado/a (Oh-bree-gah-dooh/dah) — use the male form if you are male and the female form if you are female.
You're welcome: De nada (Dee nah-dah) — informal
You're welcome: Não tem de quê (Nah-oomm tah-eehm the queh) — formal
I'm sorry: Desculpe (Desh-cool-pah)

, Knowing how to ask a few basic questions about the Portuguese-speakers you meet will go a long way towards making you new friends. Use these questions and responses to have a very basic conversation:


What is your name?: Como o/a senhor/a se chama? (coh-moh sen-your/-ah se shahm-ah)— formal. Note that, in this case, the male form of senhor has no ""o"" ending.
What's your name?: Qual é o seu nome? (Coh eh-oh seh-oh no-mee) — informal
My name is...: Me chamo (Mee sham-oh)
Where are you from?: De onde o/a senhor/a é? (Djee own-djah oh/ah sen-your/ah eh)
Where are you from?: De onde você é? (Djee own-djah voh-say eh)— informal
I'm from...: Eu sou de (Ee-oh so-oo djee)
What's happening / what's going on?: O que aconteceu? (Oo key ah-cone-teh-see-oo)

, Not every adventure goes as planned. If you ever find yourself in a situation where you need to ask for help from a Portugeuese-speaking person, you'll be glad to know these life-savers:


What time is it?: Que horas são? (Queh o-rah-sh sah-oomm)
I'm lost: Estou perdido (Esh-toe per-dee-doo / Es-toe per-djee-doo(in Brazil))
Can you help me, please?: Pode ajudar-me, por favor? (Po-deh azhu-dar-meh, por-fah-vor?)
Help me!: Socorro! (Soh-coh-hoh!) — used if you are in danger


, Questions are an important part of everyday communication — they allow us to get information about the world around us. Learning the following question words will help you learn the details of every situation you find yourself in:Who?: Quem? (Cang?)
What?: O que? (Ooh kee?)
When?: Quando? (Quan-doo?)
Where?: Onde? (Own-djee?)
Which?: Qual? (Quah-ooh?)
Why?: Porquê? (Poohr-queh)
Because: Porque (Poohr-queh)
How much?: Quanto? (Kwan-toh)
How much does this cost?: Quanto custa? (Kwan-toh coos-tah?)

, Use the words below to describe the various people in your own life and others':


Father: Pai (pa-ee)
Mother: Mãe (ma-ee) — formal
Mom/Mum: Mamãe (muh-ma-ee) — informal
Man: Homem (O-men)
Woman: Mulher (Mooh-lyehr)
Friend: Amigo/a (Ah-mee-goh/gah)
Girlfriend: Namorada (Nah-mooh-rah-dah)
Boyfriend: Namorado (Nah-mooh-rah-dooh)

, In Portuguese, it's custom to call older people or people in positions of authority by their formal titles as a show of respect. While these formalities are usually dropped once two people become close friends, this can take some time, so as a rule of thumb, don't call people by their first names until invited.Mister: Senhor (Sen-your) — this can also be used as a formal ""you""
Misses: Senhora (Sen-your-ah) — this can be used as a formal ""you"" for women
Miss: Senhorita (Sen-your-ee-tah) — used for young women (usually unmarried)
Lady / madam / ma'am: Dona (Do-nah) — a formal title for women
Doctor: Dotour/a (Doo-tohr/-ah) — used for people with degrees beyond a bachelor's; not necessarily medical doctors.
Professor: Professor/a (pro-fess-or/-ah) — used for people with a PhD; not necessarily college educators.

, Knowing animal names in Portuguese can be surprisingly useful, especially if you make a trip to the rainforests of Brazil or Angola. Below, you can find the words for some common animals you may see:


Dog: Cão (Cah-oohm)
Dog (only in Brazil): Cachorro (Cah-sho-hoo)
Cat: Gato (Gah-tooh)
Bird: Pássaro (Pah-sah-row)
Fish: Peixe (Pay-shay)
Monkey: Macaco (Mah-cah-coh)
Lizard: Lagarto (Lah-gar-toh)
Bug: Percevejo (Pair-sair-ve-zhoh)
Spider: Aranha (Ah-rah-nyah)

, Knowing how to describe the different parts of your body is a must if you find yourself in the unfortunate situation of being hurt or injured in a foreign country. Use these words to talk about your body:Head: Cabeça (Cah-beh-sah)
Arm: Braço (Brah-so)
Leg: Perna (Pair-nah)
Hand: Mão (Mah-oohm"")

Foot: Pé (Peh)
Finger - Dedo - Deh-dooh

Toe - Dedo (same as finger) — can also say ""Dedo do pé"" (Deh-dooh dooh peh), literally ""finger of the foot.""
Eyes: Olhos (Ole-yus)
Mouth: Boca (Boh-cah)
Nose: Nariz (Nah-reese)
Ears: Orelhas (Oh-rel-yase)

, As noted above, being sick or injured in a foreign country is not very fun. Make your problems easier by learning these words for talking about how you aren't feeling well:


I am hurt: Estou magoado (Ees-toh mah-goo-ah-doo)
My is broken: Meu está quebrado (May-oh brah-so es-tah kay-brah-doh)
I am bleeding: Eu estou sangrando (Eh-oh ees-toh san-grand-oh)
I feel bad: Me sinto mal (Mee seen-toh ma-oo)
I feel sick: Sinto-me doente (Seen-toh-may doo-en-tee)
I have a fever: Estou com febre (Ees-toh cohn feb-ray)
I have a cough: Estou com tosse (Ees-toh cohn tohs-ay)
I can't breathe: Eu não posso respirar (Eh-oh nah-oo po-so ray-spee-rar)
Doctor!: Médico! (Meh-jee-coh)

, Now that you've learned a good collection of Portuguese words and phrases, broaden your horizons by practicing some practical slang. Portuguese speakers in the real world don't use the sort of plain, dry language you'd find in a textbook. Each Portuguese-speaking country and region has its own slang words, colloquialisms, and sayings that speakers use to spice up their language. Below are just a few of the most common slang words (all of these are very informal.)Cool! (Only in Europe and Africa): Fixe (Feesh)
Cool! (Only in Brazil): Legal (Lay-gah-oo)
Wow!: Nossa (Nos-ah)
Gosh!: Puxa / Puxa vida (Poo-sha / Poo-sha vee-dah)
Shut up!: Cale-se! / Cala a boca! (Cah-lee say / cah la boh-ca)
What's up?: Beleza? (Beh-leh-zah)
Girl/boy buddy or mate: Parceira/o (Par-say-rah)
Hot or attractive girl/boy: Gatinha/o (Gah-cheen-yah/yoh)
Money, cash: Grana (Gran-ah)
Foreigner: Gringo (Green-go)

Decide on your desired dimensions.The sash needs to be long enough to tie around your waist in a knot or bow, depending on your preference.,
Cut out your sash fabric and interfacing.,
Place the interfacing on the fabric.,
Set up a cover cloth.,
Press a warm iron onto the cloth.,
Fuse the rest of the interfacing to the rest of the fabric.,
Slowly remove the cover cloth.,
Fold your fabric in half lengthwise.,
Cut the ends at an angle.,
Sew along the raw edges.,
Cut off the corners.,
Turn the fabric right side out.,
Press the sash again.,
Close the hole.",How to Make a Sash," For most waist sizes, a sash measuring 2 yards (1.8 m) in length will provide plenty of fabric to create a bow. The width is nothing more than a matter of preference, but you need to multiply the desired width by two to create a front and a back, and you must add an extra 1/2 inch (13 mm) for a seam allowance.;
, You need to cut out one large rectangle of fabric for your sash using the measurements you decided on. You also need to cut out an equally large piece of thin fusible interfacing using the same dimensions.

, The shiny side of the interfacing is the side covered with adhesive, and it needs to be the side facing your fabric. The interfacing should be applied to the underside or ""wrong"" side of you sash fabric and pinned in place.








, The cover cloth should be a piece of heat-tolerant material, like an old cotton pillowcase. Lay the cloth over the sash and the interfacing and dampen it using a spray bottle filled with water.








, The iron should already be warmed up to a low setting. Do not slide the iron across the cover cloth. Instead, press it onto the cloth in one spot, starting near the edge of the sash, for about 10 seconds. Pressing the iron creates steam and allows the interfacing to fuse to the fabric.

, After each section is fused together, lift the iron and move it over to the spot directly next to the newly fused portion. Continue until the entire length of the sash has been fused with the interfacing. Move and re-wet the cover cloth as necessary.








, After the fabric has cooled to the touch, remove the cover cloth and test the fusing by tugging gently on the edge of the interfacing and the edge of the fabric. If the two stick together, it was a success. If not, repeat the interfacing steps or try a different type of interfacing.








, The sash should be just as long but half as wide. The underside or wrong sides should face outward while the ""right"" sides or outer sides face together. Pin and iron the fold in place.

, Temporarily fold the sash in half width-wise so that both ends meet together. Pin in place. With the permanent lengthwise fold at the top and the open end at the bottom, cut a short diagonal line starting at the upper corner where the two ends meet. Cut through all layers of fabric and unfold to its original length. By cutting the ends at the same time, you ensure that the edges will be symmetrical.








, Leave a 1/4 inch (6 mm) seam allowance. Start from the upper corner of one angled edge and sew down along the edge, through the bottom, and up along the opposing edge to seal the sash. As you sew, though, you need to leave an opening along the bottom of the sash about 4 inches (10 cm) long so that you will be able to turn the sash right side out.








, Trim the seam allowances off at the four corners of your sash so that it will be easier to turn it back the right way.








, You can do this by using your fingers to gently pushing and pulling the fabric through the opening left at the bottom of your sash, or you can coax the fabric through the hole with a capped pen, blunt pencil, or wooden dowel.







, After the sash has been turned right side out, use an iron to gently press the folds in place. The sash must fold exactly where the seam is. Otherwise, the seam will be exposed as you wear it.








, You can either use a slip stitch or a ladder stitch to seal the hole. Alternatively, you can top-stitch around the entire edge to seal the hole while giving your sash a more uniform look.

A = ah

B = bayh

C = sayh

D = day

E = eh

F = ehfee

G = zhayh

H = ah-gah

I = ee

J = zhota

L = eh-lee

M = eh-mee

N = eh-nee

O = ohr

P = peh

Q = qay

R = eh-rre

S = eh-sse

T= teh

U= oo

V= vay

X= shiss

Z= zay

The letters K, W and Y are used only for scientific symbols and foreign words.

;
, Those are the accent marks, or symbols, placed directly above a letter. There's a few to choose from and they crop up in various circumstances.


The tilde (~) indicates nasalization. Any letter with this symbol will be said through your nose.
Ç/ç is pronounced like ""s."" That's a cedilla underneath that ""c,"" by the way.
Ê/ê is used for stressing and is just pronounced like /e/.
The accent grave (`) is only used in the letter ""A"" and it's just for contractions. For example, the feminine pronoun for ""the"" and ""to"" are both ""a."" If you go ""to the city,"" it's ""à cidade.""
The ""á"" in Portuguese is just used to denote stress and only written when it's abnormal.

, Unlike Spanish, Portuguese has quite a few not-so-tried-and-true pronunciation rules. A lot of how a letter sounds depends on its placement within the word. And sometimes what you're used to and what it actually sounds like are quite different. Here are some examples:


Nasalize (that is, say through your nose) every ""m"" and ""n"" at the end of every syllable (but not between vowels) so they sound like ""ng."" ""Bem"" (well) then is pronounced like ""beng.""The sound ""-ão"" sounds a lot like ""ow,"" but that tilde on top of the ""a"" means it must be said entirely through your nose.
""S"" sounds like ""z"" when it is between two vowels, and like ""s"" otherwise. So ""casa"" is pronounced ""caa-za"", ""absinto"" is pronounced ""abi-ssin-too"", and ""suave"" is ""ssu-aa-ve"".
""D"" and ""t"" become ""j"" and ""ch"" sounds before ""e"" or ""i."" So ""saudades"" is pronounced sa-oo-DA-jeez.
Speaking of ""saudades,"" unstressed ""e"" at the end of words turns to an ""ee"" sound. It's tempting to want to say ""sa-oo-da-jayz,"" but that ""jayz"" becomes ""jeez.""
Unstressed ""o"" does something similar -- it turns to ""oo."" ""Como"" then is pronounced more like ""co-moo.""

Sometimes, it's not pronounced at all. ""Cohm"" would be how it's said, depending on the dialect.


""L"" turns to ""oo,"" too, when not between vowels and at the end of a syllable. ""Brazil"" then is pronounced ""bra-ZEE-oo.""
That trilled ""r"" we all know so well in Spanish turns into an ""h"" sound. So using what we know, how would you pronounce ""morro?"" It's a very strange ""MO-hoo."" Yep. Really.

, If it's not the second syllable, you'll see an accent mark indicating where the stress goes. Don't see it? Stress the second one. ""CO-moo."" ""Sa-oo-DA-jeez."" ""Bra-ZEE-oo."" Picking up the pattern?


""Secretária"" or ""automático"" on the other hand, tells you that the stress is on the antipenultimate syllable.

, In general, European Spanish is much different from Brazilian Portuguese than South American Spanish, which you probably could've guessed. But even though South American Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese are very similar, they have a few stark differences:


Always use the ""ustedes"" conjugation for the second person plural and third person plural; that is, ""they"" and ""you guys"" are the same -- even with regard to formality. Whether you're giving a speech or talking to friends, it's ""ustedes"" all the way.
The vocabulary can be quite different -- even with the most basic of words. Red in Spanish is ""rojo""; in BP, it's ""vermelho."" Never make any assumptions; there are a ton of false cognates out there!
There are only three person-conjugations. Yay! But they do use an entirely new tense, the future subjunctive. So it's a give and take when it comes to difficulty.

, If you're traveling or moving to Rio de Janeiro, it's good to know that they've developed their own sort of accent and way of speech. Most of it lies in the expressions they use and the casual, emotive interjections they favor. But there's some pronunciation differences, too.


Things like ""OK"" to confirm an offer are instead ""Demorou!"" ""Bacana"" means ""cool,"" and ""inteligente"" becomes ""cabeçudo."" And that's just three examples!
Cursing is frowned upon in more formal situations, obviously, but if you're blending in at the local bar watching the football game, it's gonna come up. ""Porra"" is a good word to start with for expressing general frustration.
As for sounds, the starkest contrast is with the ""r"" and it should be a bit more guttural (remember how it's pronounced like an ""h?"") Think something closer to ""loch."" This goes for all ""r"" sounds that are at the beginning or end of a word, those that have been doubled, or those preceded by an ""n"" or ""l.""
""S"" at the end of words or syllables followed by an unvoiced consonant (t, c, f, p) gets turned to ""sh"" here. So ""meus pais"" becomes ""mih-oosh pah-eesh.""

, Specifically, those that end in a consonant other than ""r,"" ""s,"" or ""m."" Those get pronounced as if an ""e"" got smushed invisibly onto the end. ""Internet"" is actually pronounced ""eeng-teH-NE-chee."" Yeah. Say that three times fast. And then there are words like hip-hop -- can you guess? -- It's like ""hippee hoppee!""


Loan words are actually a lot more common in Brazilian Portuguese than European Portuguese and European Spanish. For example, it's ""mouse"" for a computer mouse in all of South America but ""ratón"" across the pond. Kinda makes sense -- the majority of them are from America -- it's harder to make a jump across the Atlantic.

, It's the absolute first thing you have to do when you walk into any room, so it's important you have something to say! Locals will be very appreciative that you're making an effort from point one. Here are some ways to start:


Olá / Oi. = Hi / Hello.

Bom dia = Good morning

Boa tarde = Good afternoon

Boa noite = Good evening or night

While we're at it, it's also useful to know time phrases:

Manhã = Morning

Dia = Day

Noite = Evening or night

Tarde = Evening before 6

Pela manhã = In the morning

De dia = In the day

À tarde = In the afternoon

De noite = At night




, Because when you're lost on the side of the road, you may need them. Or, you know, when you're making small talk at the local bar or cafe.


Eu não falo português. -- I don't speak Portuguese.

(Você) Fala inglês? - Do you speak English?

Eu sou de...(Londres). - I am from... (London).

Eu sou português. - I'm Portuguese.

Desculpe / Com licença. - Excuse me.

Muito obrigado/a. - Thank you very much.

De nada. - You are welcome/No problem.

Desculpe. - Sorry.

Até mais. - See you later.

Tchau! - Bye!


, You'll probably want to start a few conversations to hone your skills, so you'll need some phrases in your tool belt to get the ball rolling.


De onde você é? - Where are you from?

Onde vocês moram? - Where do you live?

Quem é ela? - Who is she?

O que é isso? - What is this?

Onde é o banheiro? - Where is the bathroom, please?

O que você faz? - What do you do?

Quanto custa isso? or Quanto isso custa? - How much is this?


, One of the most common situations you'll find yourself in to practice your skills will be when you're dining out. Here are some phrases you can use to show you know your stuff:


O que você quer comer? - What would you like to eat?

Você está com fome? - Are you hungry?

O que você quer beber? - What would you like to drink?

Eu queria um cafezinho. - I'd like an espresso.

O que você recomenda? - What do you recommend?

Eu quero fazer um pedido - I would like to order now.

Uma cerveja, por favor. - A beer, please.

A conta, por favor. - The bill (check), please.


, If you're in Brazil for a specific occasion, you may need to exchange holiday greetings. Here's some of the bigguns:


Feliz Aniversário = Happy Birthday
Feliz Natal = Merry Christmas
Feliz Ano Novo = Happy New Year
Feliz Dia Dos Namorados = Happy Valentine's Day
Feliz Dia das Mães = Happy Mother's Day
Feliz Dia dos Pais = Happy Father's Day

, Ah, like being a toddler again. In order to have your most basic of understanding -- be it at the supermarket, the bar, or on the road, you gotta know the numbers. There's a masculine and feminine version for one, two, and the hundreds, by the way. Here are the basics:


1 - um/uma (a masculine noun would use um and a feminine noun, uma)
2 - dois/duas

3 - três

4 - quatro

5 - cinco

6 - seis

7 - sete

8 - oito

9 - nove

10 - dez

20 - vinte

21 - vinte e um


30 - trinta

31 - trinta e um
40 - quarenta

41 - quarenta e um

50 - cinquenta

51 - cinquenta e um

See the pattern? It's always the tens place followed by ""e"" and the ones place.



, Because regardless of what language you're speaking, it's helpful to know what's going on when.
In everyday conversation, it is common to omit the suffix ""-feira"". So you will find natives using ""Segunda"", ""Terça"", and so it goes.


Domingo = Sunday

Segunda-feira = Monday

Terça-Feira = Tuesday

Quarta-Feira = Wednesday

Quinta-Feira = Thursday

Sexta-Feira = Friday

Sábado = Saturday

, It'll help for shopping, menus, and just basic communication.


Black - preto

Blue - azul

Brown - marrom

Gray - cinza

Green - verde

Orange - laranja

Pink - rosa

Purple - roxo

Red - vermelho

White - branco

Yellow - amarelo


, Being able to talk about the things around you will certainly come in handy! You'll be able to give basic opinions on things and understand quite a bit more when you know more than just nouns and verbs. But watch out -- there are masculine and feminine versions (they have to match the noun).


Bad - mau/má

Good - bom/boa

Beautiful - bonito/bonita

Big - grande

Delicious - delicioso/deliciosa


Easy - fácil
Sad - triste

Small - pequeno/pequena

Ugly - feio/feia

New - novo/nova

Nouns are inherently feminine or masculine in Portuguese and the adjective must match them. Whatever you're talking about, know that it has a gender -- if you need to describe it, that gender must match. Generally, feminine versions end in ""-a.""

, Portuguese is one of those languages where the verbs have to match the noun -- so knowing the noun is pretty important! Here are your options:


I - Eu

You - Tu or você

He/Her/It - Ele/Ela

We - Nós or a gente
""You guys"" - vós

They - Eles/elas


, Now that you know how to talk about these people, what are they doing? Here are some common verbs in their infinitive (i.e., to eat) forms:


To be - ser

To buy - comprar

To drink - beber

To eat - comer

To give - dar

To speak - falar

To write - escrever

To say - dizer

To walk - andar

to see = ver

, Unfortunately, being able to say ""I to be American"" isn't that impressive -- you have to make is so your verbs match your subjects. Since some verbs are quite different, let's just cover the regular right now. If you know Spanish, this'll be cake. For those that don't, know that the ending indicates whether the verb goes with I, you, he/she/it, we, you, or they as the subject.


""Ar"" verbs, like comprar, conjugate like -o, -as, -a, -amos, -ais, -am. So that's ""compro,"" ""compras,"" ""compra,"" ""compramos,"" ""comprais,"" ""compram.""
""Er"" verbs, like comer, conjugate like -o, -es, -e, -emos, -eis, -em. So that's ""como,"" ""comes,"" ""come,"" ""comemos,"" ""comeis,"" ""comem.""
""Ir"" verbs, like partire, conjugate like -o, -es, -e, -imos, -is, -em. So that's ""parto,"" ""partes,"" ""parte,"" ""partimos,"" ""partis,"" ""partem.""
Of course, these are just three regular examples and that's just in the indicative. There are tons of irregular verbs and loads of tenses, but to cover those would take hours and hours and hours of your time.

, There are a bunch of websites that can help with your speaking skills. BBC and Memrise are just two websites that offer interactive quiz features that can help you grow your database of knowledge and are way, way more than just reading words and hoping you remember them. It's fun to boot!


Listen to tracks and videos online to help you with pronunciation. Since the rules are a bit all over the place, immersing yourself in them as often as possible is the best thing you can do to curve the mistakes that keep springing up.

, Being forced to speak the language for a couple of hours a week sometimes gives us the motivation we wouldn't otherwise have. Seek out a school or community center nearby that offers Portuguese classes -- for conversation, business, or just general learning. Any and all exposure will do you good!


The smaller the class, the better. And if it's large, try to meet someone that you can practice one-on-one with whose skills are a bit better than yours. Study groups can get you practicing every day when class isn't often enough to really build and grow.

, It's nerve-wracking, but it's the quickest and most efficient way to get your skills honed. They know their language is difficult, so don't be worried about making mistakes. They'll just be glad you made the effort! It'll only get less stressful the more and more you do it.


This is part of the reason signing up for a class is such a good idea. Your teacher or your classmates may have access to a circle that you don't and that you can become a part of. You'll be able to meet people in ways you never could've otherwise -- and get something out of it, too.

, You may think speaking is the only way to get better at speaking, but working on your reading, writing, and listening (especially listening) can help, too. Sure, speaking is the best -- but being good at the other ones won't hurt! So pick up a book, start a journal in Portuguese, and listen to documentaries, movies, and music. Do whatever you can get your hands on!


YouTube is a great place to start. There are myriad tutorials online that can get your brain primed for this language, triggering your words faster, quicker, and easier.

É - Like Any
Ê - Like E, but longer, and never like in Equal or Any


I - Like in Equal

Ì - Like in Equal


O - Like in Under or Only (but try not to pronounce it ow or ou, but short and single sounded like the U in Under. Imagine that Only is spelled Ownly, an try only to pronounce the O)

Ó - Like Oyster, or, when the last letter of a word, like Under
Ô - Like O, but longer, and never like in Under


U - Like in Foot

Ú - Like in Foot
Û - Like in Foot

B - Like in Believe
C - When in front of E, and I like in Bicycle. Otherwise like in Cow.

ç - Always like in Bicycle


D - Like in Devil, except when placed in front of an I or an E, that is pronounced like Equal, in that case the D is pronounced like Jam
F - Like in Fine
G - When in front of E and I like in Protégé. Otherwise like in Girl

Gu - Normally like Good or Paraguay, but when in front of I or E simply like in Girl

Q - Only used in the combination qu-, which is pronounced like in Queen when in front of A, O or U, otherwise like Cow

V - Like in Vase
X - Like in Shower, or when at the end of a syllable like in Son or Xerox

Z - Like in Zone, or when between to vowels like Son

, Normally the second to last syllable is always stressed, except:


When one of the letters has a diacritic (ex.: á, â, or ã), in this case the letter with the diacritic is always stressed (this does not count for the rarely used diacritics à and ü)
When the last letter of the word is a consonant, but not m or s. In this case the last syllable is stressed.
When the last letter is U or I. In this case the last syllable is stressed.

, Nasal vowels occur when the diacritic ~ is used (ã, õ) or when the vowel is followed by an N or M, and the M is the last letter of the word. The tilde (~) is normally used in combinations like ação (action) or mãe (mom) with other vowels. In this case both vowels are nasal. You make a nasal vowel by simply letting part of the air blowing out of you nose while pronouncing the vowel.

Find the smallest, thinnest surgical tubing you can find.,
If you use rubber bands you will first have to loop the bands together by putting one through another and back through itself before it's pulled tight.,
Once you have the full length you need (about 20 ft.) divide it into 3rds and cut it into separate pieces.,
String one of the hooks along one of the strands until it's next to the knot.

,
Begin to braid the three strands in a common overlap pattern.,
Once you're satisfied with the braided strands, Put the second hook in one of the strands.,
It's ready to use almost anywhere, anytime, without hangers, clothespins or hanging things over the line.

,
Loop each end around some fixtures so the entire line is slightly stretched.,
When you go to hang anything, pull one of the strands away from the other two and place a small corner of the garment through the gap.",How to Make a Clothesline to Use Without Hangers," If not surgical tubing, you can use some form of long rubber band. If you can't find something like these, buy a box of the heavy gauge rubber bands that the post office uses around bundles of mail. You will want about 20 feet (6.1 m) of the item in it's unstretched condition. You will need two small gate hooks from any hardware store, too. (See tips below.);
, By linking these together you will end up with a long stretchy band of continuous rubber bands.

, Tie one end of all three strands into a knot so it ends up looking like three strands of spaghetti hanging from your hand.

,, This is what you may have learned in elementary school. You know, lay them side by side and take the left one over the middle one to become the middle one and then take the right one over the middle one to make a new middle one. Keep repeating this process until the entire length is braided. Don't do it too loose or real tight. You might want to experiment a little before the next step.

, Tie off the final end by wrapping it in strong string, wire, several twist-ties, or something that will keep if from unraveling, or simply tie them in a knot again.

,, It should be about 6 feet (1.8 m). long when up.

, For example you can take the bottom hem of a shirt and put a small part through the braided strands then take another part of the bottom hem on the other side of the shirt and do the same thing further down the line.

Wear more strapless tops and sheer shoulders.,
Try a dress with open sides.,
Wear a scarf or bandana as a top.,
Try a bandeau top.,
Look at backless gowns.,
Try clothing tailored to look masculine.,
Search out cropped jackets and boleros.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful1," These tops are notoriously difficult to wear bras with, since the strap of a traditional bra will show through. Women with flat chests can don these tops while going braless. They can opt for a strapless bra. Some women with larger busts may not feel very supported in a strapless bra, but the support often proves plenty for women with smaller busts.;
, These dresses do not look good with bras since you can see the wearer’s side. For the same reason, these dresses do not often suit women with larger busts, since so much of the chest is exposed while wearing the dress. Women with flatter chests, however, can get away with exposing a little of what they have without needing to worry about looking inappropriate doing so.

, This works especially well with Hermes scarves and other large square styles. Women with smaller busts can pull this look off easily since tops made out of scarves are often delicately tied together, whereas women with larger busts may worry about ""falling out"" of such tops. Many of these tops often require the wearer to go braless, which is another reason why it is more suitable for women with flat chests.


Wear a scarf as a fitted halter. Fold the scarf in half so that it looks like a triangle. Tie the two tail ends around your waist and tie the two layers of the top point around your neck.
Alternatively, wear it as a sleeveless top. Fold two opposite corners of the scarf to the scarf's center. Tie the scarf around yourself, keeping the folded edges at the top and bottom.

, A bandeau top is a strip of cloth that ties around the breasts, exposing the stomach. The bandeau is not appropriate for all settings, but you can wear it for a stroll on a beach boardwalk or while on an island vacation. You can also wear it beneath an open sweater or jacket for a slightly more appropriate option that works in more settings.

, As another notoriously difficult top to wear a bra with, strapless gowns are perfect for women with flatter chests.

, Instead of fighting against your lack of curves, roll with it. Think “men’s style” jackets, fitted graphic t-shirts with traditionally tough, masculine images, and “boyfriend” jeans. Pull the look together by accessorizing with gunmetal jewelry and thick-banded watches. This is a highly chic type of style that flat-chested women are in the perfect position to take advantage of.

, Many of these garments end just below the bust line, accentuating the bosom. These jackets do not suit women with larger chests well, since the style often makes the chest look fuller.

"
"
Play with color.,
Try wearing horizontal stripes across your chest.,
Look for blouses with horizontal stripes across the chest, but a solid color beneath the bust, covering the rest of the torso.,
Consider polka dots, geometric shapes, and floral prints.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful2," Opt for pastels and other light colors, especially across the bust. Dark colors have a slimming effect, which could make your chest look smaller.

, Horizontal stripes have a widening effect, which often helps small chests look fuller.

, This further intensifies the effect of the stripes. The same principle can be applied to other patterns, as well. Match a pattern over your bust with a solid color covering your stomach.

, Try a few different patterns on and determine what suits your body and your personality best.

"
"
Avoid baggy, loose clothes that look sloppy.,
Look for tops and dresses with an empire waist.,
Try on tops and dresses with nipped waists, since these help create the appearance of an hourglass figure.

,
Also try on snug wrap blouses and dresses to help create the appearance of a curvy hourglass figure.

,
Consider tight tops.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful3," This does nothing but conceal the curves you do have.

, Empire waists help the bust look larger while masking the midsection, making this an especially good option for women with petite busts and wider midsections. Consider an empire waist if you have a petite stomach, as well.

,,, Women with flatter chests can get away with wearing snug tops without looking inappropriate.

"
"
Look at cowl necklines.,
Consider high collars, interesting asymmetrical necks, and crew necks to help your bust look bigger.

,
Go for a halter top.,
Try daring necklines like low v-necks and dramatic scoops.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful4," The extra drapes and folds up top help the chest look fuller.

,, Halter tops expose your shoulders and create an illusion of larger breasts by drawing the eye directly to the bosom.

, Even though these necklines do not necessarily make your bust look bigger, you can wear them and look classy doing so. Women with larger busts risk looking inappropriate in a low neckline, but women with smaller busts can get away with showing more skin and still look appropriate doing so.

"
"
Try a blouse or dress with ruffles or pleats, especially those that trim the neckline.,
Look for tops with details at the bust.,
Consider tops with embellishments around the collar.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful5," This adds volume to your chest without overwhelming your figure.

, Empire waist shirts with a bit of embellishment right along the waistline work especially well.

, A splash of color or a glimmer of gold or silver sequins will elongate your neck, drawing the focus away from the flatness of your chest.

"
"
Match a billowy blouse or tunic with tight jeans to show off great legs.,
Pair a fitted blouse with a knee-length pencil skirt to show off a flat stomach and curvy hips.

,
Wear sleeveless tanks and spaghetti-strap dresses to show off slender, delicate arms.

",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful6," Wear the outfit with your favorite high heels to further elongate your leg.

,,"
"
Consider necklaces with thin chains and small pendants to make your bust look bigger by comparison.

,
Draw the attention away from your chest with chunky bracelets, rings, and bold earrings.

,
Also try out a bold necklace with a shorter chain.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful7,",, A loud, noticeable piece of jewelry at your neck may also steer the eye away from the chest.

"
"
Use blush to enhance the appearance of your breasts.,
Apply glitter body dust to enhance your breasts’ appearance.",How to Make a Flat Chest Beautiful8,"


Choose a blush one shade darker than your natural skin tone.
Apply a light coating of this blush to the skin in between your breasts. This creates false shadows that give off the illusion of a larger chest.
Avoid using a blush that is lighter than your skin tone or too many shades darker.

,


Apply a light, subtle dusting of this glitter to the top of each breast. This highlights the rounded top, ultimately creating a fuller look.
Avoid applying glitter gels or other types of heavy body glimmer.

, One of the most frustrating things is dropping sauce, drink, or other food items on your clothing, only to leave spattering of stains. If you have some stain remover handy, you can take care of it immediately, making full removal of the stain later much easier too.


Stain remover comes in sticks, pens, wipes and small bottles. Choose one that suits the fabrics you prefer preferring and comes in a convenient size.
Even baby wipes or personal wipes will remove many a stain if you can't find suitable portable stain removal items.
Deodorant remover wipes can be handy to have too, especially if you like wearing dark colors and haven't switched to invisible deodorant.

, Fluff, cat and dog hair, dandruff, you name it, it doesn't look great clinging to clothing. Unfortunately, it's often not noticed until you're well on your way out of home and into the bright light of day. A lint roller will fix it in a jiffy.

, If you're wearing pantyhose or stockings, pack a spare pair. Keep the spare pair as neutral as possible so that it can match any outfit. Replace it after each emergency usage.


Pack clear nail polish. It stops pantyhose runs from continuing their merry path down your leg. Plus, it's pretty useful for touching up chipped nails too.

, A small can of hairspray is the ideal way to stop static cling from hassling you out all day long. Simply spray it on bare legs or pantyhose to stop lighter material from doing the cling dance on your legs.


A dryer sheet or two is useful for the same purpose. Rub it up and down the offending area and the static will cease.

, Should your shoe heel break off, the sole start lifting up, the strap of a shoe or bag snap off, or the rivets on your handbag start popping out, add a quick dab of glue to right things until you can get to the shoe repairer.


Fashion tape or double-sided tape could be added as well as, or instead of, glue. Tape can also be used to remove lint as well as hold up hems.

, After a candle has had most of its use in your house, keep the small stub of the base. Cut it neatly if you like, although that's optional. Tuck it into a small resealable bag. Whenever a zipper gets stuck, simply rub the wax over it and the zipper will glide with ease again.


A small piece of soap can do the same, plus is doubles as soap should you need that for stain removal or germ-free hands.

, It can be very useful for adding back color to scuffed shoes or bags.

, All it needs to consist of is: average-size needle, three small loops of thread (black, white and clear) and a spare basic button. A few safety pins can be added to the sewing kit, or added in their own right. Should any rip or tear befall you, or a button pop off, you can mend it quickly and fix it properly later.


Safety pins are an absolute must. They can hold hems up, act as temporary buttons or zippers, keep broken straps in place or even pull clothing over areas that feel too exposed for one reason or other.

, If you wear heels, these inexpensive little extras may just save the day if your heel decides to take a break.

, Should a nail do anything as painful and unsightly as catch on something and rip, you can at least cut it neatly and file it back. It'll do you until you get back to the salon or home-fix.

, Some people like to have both, some are happy to cope with one or the other. Either way, have something to keep your curls, bangs and strays in place and the tangles out.

, Pack a couple of hair ties or elastics, a clip, some bobby pins and anything else you consider standard for your hair.

, It can be used to quell flyaway hairs, moisten your lips and even give your teeth a bit of a shine.


Pack a mini hairspray. Yes, it's useful here too, for the hair this time. Pack it for the reason stated above (anti-static) and for your hair.

, Ideal for quick brushing pick-me-ups, especially to get the parsley off your teeth after a business lunch.


Pack some floss too. It's very small, always handy and it can fit anywhere, even in your purse.

, Gone will be the horror of realizing you ran out the door forgetting to put it on that morning. You have back-up.

, A few of these will keep you feeling secure should the need arise.

,


Pack a few band-aids. For bumps, scratches and itchy spots, put a sticking plaster on it.
Pack some headache tablets. Whatever your preferred variety, have at least two in your fashion emergency kit. Not quite a fashion emergency unless you're prone to overspending on fashion when having a headache but it will help you to keep your head high.

, For those times when washing your hands isn't possible.

, Go through the suggested items in the above sections to help you decide. Purchase or find these items, then set about filling your fashion first aid kit.

, You might even like to make several kits, just to be on the safe side and you can vary the contents and size depending on where you are using it. Some places it might be useful to have a fashion first aid kit include:


Drawer in a desk at your office, workplace or study area
In your handbag, backpack, briefcase, courier bag or schoolbag
In a locker
In the car
In your suitcase when traveling
In your vacation/holiday house or cottage.

, Make it a rule to always replace used items in the kit as quickly as possible; you never know when you might need them again.

Wear a thong.,
Try a G-string.,
Experiment with boyshorts.,
Invest in laser cut underwear.,
Wear a jockstrap under fitted dress pants.",How to Keep Your Underwear from Showing1," A thong is the go-to underwear of choice for fashion stylists for many reasons – they’re completely invisible under even the tightest pants and skirts, plus because they lack seams, they can sometimes be more comfortable to sit on.In addition to reducing panty lines, wearing a thong can also help cure any acne you might have on your backside.
Certain fabrics cause friction when they rub up against the skin, which can lead to acne. Wear a cotton thong to avoid or help clear up any pimples you might have on your butt.
Many people prefer thongs because it’s almost impossible to grow out of them. Since there is less fabric, thongs tend to grow and shrink to accommodate any weight fluctuations you may have.
Wear a thong underneath a pair of tight fitting jeans or skirt.;
, The G-string or V-string as it’s sometimes called, is the skimpiest form of underwear. G-strings are similar to thongs, but with even less coverage on the back and sides.Wear a G-string with a bodycon dress or in any situation where you might otherwise choose to forgo underwear entirely.
G-strings are also a good choice if you're planning to wear a sheer dress or skirt.

, If you can’t bear to part with your fuller cut underwear, boyshorts might be a good alternative for you. Boyshorts are cut similar to briefs, but they fall under the butt cheek, which means they are less likely to be noticed underneath tight pants or skirts.Look for a lace boyshort – the lace will help the panty line look less conspicuous.
Always choose a flat lace. Textured lace will cause your underwear to bunch underneath your clothing.
Wear a boyshort under yoga pants for coverage and comfort as you work out.

, Laser cut underwear is the thinnest form of underwear available on the market and is meant to look and feel like you aren’t wearing underwear at all.Laser cut underwear comes in a variety of different cuts, so you can find a pair that feels comfortable for you.
Because laser cut underwear is seamless, it will never unravel after a wash.

, Men can get panty lines too, so if you're wearing a pair of tailored pants that hugs your rear, you may want to swap out the boxers for a jockstrap.Jockstraps can be purchased online or in sporting goods stores.
If you don't feel comfortable wearing a jockstrap, a pair of briefs is the next best thing for fitted pants.

Cover up with shapewear.,
Pick the right fabric.,
Add another layer.",How to Keep Your Underwear from Showing2," Shapewear is designed to smooth out any unintentional lumps and bumps you might have. Shapewear is available in a variety of cuts for both tops and bottoms and can be purchased at a Target or department store near you.Wear shapewear if you plan on wearing anything formfitting.
To choose the correct size in shapewear, measure your waist and the fullest part of your hips.Treat shapewear like regular lingerie – hand wash it in cold water and allow it to air dry.
You do not need to wear underwear underneath your shapewear.

, There are certain fabrics that naturally disguise panty lines and the thicker the fabric, the less likely you are to see any underwear. If you are going to wear something tight on your lower half, select a thick fabric, like denim or wool; the more textured the fabric, the better.If you still want to wear fabrics like jersey or silk, look for clothing in loose cuts.
Prints can also be useful in disguising panty lines.

, If you’re wearing a tight skirt, try creating a barrier between your underwear and your skirt. You can do this by adding a layer of tights or pantyhose, or by slipping a light slip under your skirt.You can also wear tights under your pants in the winter to add another layer of warmth and to conceal your underwear line.
Get rid of static electricity by running your skirt and slip through a wire hanger a couple of times before trying them on.

Wear nude underwear under white pants.,
Wear simple underwear under your wedding dress.,
Be comfortable while working out.,
Pick the right underwear for a romantic occasion.",How to Keep Your Underwear from Showing3," White pants are a summertime classic, but if you choose the wrong underwear, they can be a disaster. Choose your nude underwear in a color that closely mimics your skin tone.If you don’t have nude underwear, a light gray pair will also work.
Avoid wearing white or black underwear underneath white pants – both colors are equally noticeable.

, Choosing lingerie for a wedding is tricky; you want your underwear to be beautiful for your wedding night, but invisible during the ceremony and reception.Choose your underwear in a color that matches your skin tone.
Avoid pretty details, like bows. Those details might show through your dress, even if the rest of the underwear doesn’t.
Choose your underwear in a size bigger than normal so bulges won’t be visible through the dress.
If you have your heart set on wearing a certain piece of lingerie on your wedding night, change into your fancy underwear after you remove your dress.

, Depending on who you are and your underwear preferences, this advice may sound like heresy. But there are times when going sans underwear can be effective – for instance, when you’re working out.If you are going to go bare during a workout, make sure to wear bottoms with built in underwear or moisture wicking capabilities.
Avoid thongs when working out. The friction caused by your thong sliding around as you work out may cause UTIs or other bacterial infections.
If you are going to wear underwear when working out, look for fabrics that are non-abrasive and that have flat seams.
Men should wear boxer briefs for sports with medium intensity and jockstraps for high intensity sports., Most of the time you want to cover your underwear up, but when it comes to date night, you want to make sure your underwear is ready to be seen. Follow these tips to pick out a lingerie that works for your body type.If you're petite, try ruffles to suggest an hourglass figure and a push up bra to give your curves a boost.

If you layer right and cover them completely, nobody should be able to see them. Unlike the rest of your outfit, it is ok if these items have stains or holes.On the other hand, if you're planning a sheer or risque outfit where you do want to show some of what would normally be your inner layers, make sure that they are pristine and match the rest of your outfit.;
, Your outer layers will be things like jackets, coats, sweaters, scarves, or gloves depending on the weather. The practical side of layering is meant to keep you comfortable in the face of variable temperatures. Ideally, a well-layered outfit is one that you can modify in public without embarrassment. Since your outer layers are the ones you'll be switching most often, wear items that are loose and easy to slide into and take off effortlessly.

, This is especially important in cool weather where you're likely to spend a lot of time bundled up in an extra thick outer layer and without it completely. If your outfit doesn't look quite right with your coat or the coat clashes completely, consider reevaluating your layer choice.

, Coordinating wardrobe colors properly can be a tricky process that takes some practice to get right. However, there are a few quick rules to keep in mind.


Don't mix neutrals that are similar in brightness. The basic neutrals when it comes to fashion are black, browns, grays, and navy blue. While an outfit with navy and light tan or black and light gray can work, navy and black or chocolate brown and gunmetal gray are much more difficult to pull off.Balance the colors in an outfit. When you're first learning to coordinate colors, it's best to stick with only two to three per outfit. However, as you begin to put together more complicated layered looks, feel free to use as many as you can pull off. A good rule of thumb for multicolored outfits is to match a color in one garment with the same shade somewhere else on your outfit. For example, a bright multicolored floral print dress is simple to pull off with a jacket matching one color, shoes that match another, a belt that matches yet another, and/or leggings that match yet another still., You can wear multiple big patterns in one outfit, but it's best to spread them out. For example, if you're wearing a houndstooth jacket, your sweater directly underneath should ideally be a solid color. However, your tie or your shirt underneath the sweater (not both) could be a different pattern.


Very small, subtle patterns without much contrast (such as most herringbone) are largely exempt from this rule., Starting from either your outermost or innermost visible layer, match each garment. Lay them out on a flat surface to figure out what they look like together in your chosen arrangement. Then, check them both against the next possible item. Keep going until you have a complete outfit.

, One of the aspects of layering that most people find daunting is avoiding outfits that look too bulky. The easiest way to do this is to keep bulky garments on the outside and thin, lightweight ones closer to your skin. If you are working with middle layers, try to include them in this thickness gradient., When your clothes are all the same length, they are prone to looking too puffy. A jacket, sweater, and shirt that are all different lengths will help to avoid this and create a much slimmer style.This is less important if you are layering very thin material or would like to add bulk to a thinner frame.
Traditional or conservative style rules assert that you should layer with your shortest hem on the inside to your longest hem on the outside. For example, an outfit layered this way would be mid-length sweater overtop of a shorter shirt with a longer jacket on top.Other fashion experts eschew this advice. Instead, they suggest that you simply aim for contrast between items instead of sticking to a set length gradient. One example of this type of layering would be a long untucked shirt underneath a shorter sweater topped off with an even longer coat.Another would be a short jacket overtop a maxi dress., Using different volumes is another way you can avoid a bulky outfit, even while wearing some thick or loose items. A billowing blouse will look great over skinny jeans, while a tight top will complement a ruffled skirt. Likewise, a tight jacket can look good overtop a flowy dress, while a large bulky coat will pop over a short skinny one., A well-insulated layered outfit will likely make you sweat a little at some point, no matter how cold the weather may be. To stay comfortable and clean, you will need inner layers that are both insulating and will manage the resulting sweat. Silk and wool undergarments will keep you warm while whisking away moisture., In addition to wool, your visible layers may be a combination of a variety of insulating fabrics, such as flannel, corduroy, thick cottons, and cashmere.If you wear leggings, wool or leather will keep you much warmer than nylon.

, Much more so than any other climate, your accessories will be practical. Gloves, scarves, and hats will all help to trap warmth. Follow the same rules with your practical accessories as you would the rest of your layered outfit.


Layered scarves are a chic way to keep warm. One popular look is to tie one scarf more tightly around your neck while letting a second hang loose., Cold weather layering can be much more complicated than layering in other seasons. Until you get the hang of it, try building outfits based on what you've seen look good on others.


A classic feminine winter look is to wear insulating leggings under a short skirt paired with a scoop neck sweater overtop a collared shirt. Top it off with a peacoat either the same length as or an inch or two shorter than your skirt.Matching gloves and a scarf can be added for extra protection.
A more masculine outfit for the cold is a simple blazer over a sweater with a collared shirt as the innermost visible layer.Pair this look with dark slacks, and you have an outfit appropriate for most situations. Wear a matching long overcoat, gloves, and/or a scarf if the weather demands it.

, This can be a cardigan, light sweatshirt, windbreaker, or some other garment that won't look out of place in warm weather. When the temperature climbs outside, people often crank up their air conditioners to compensate. Additionally, in many areas the temperature can drop dramatically overnight. Avoid getting goose bumps because you dressed for only the heat.

, These are textiles that are lightweight and less insulating than cold weather fabrics. Some good examples to keep in mind are linen, poplin, and light cottons. You want to make sure that all layers whisk away sweat and promote its evaporation., Because warm weather clothing tends to be lighter and thinner than winter clothing, it also tends to be much more transparent.


Gray inner layers will be less visible under light clothing than white.Matching your inner layer with your skin tone will also help to cut down on visibility.When done right, sheer outwear can also be on-trend. A good rule of thumb is to match the sheer piece to the main color of the garment visible underneath., In general, there is much less of a reason to layer in the warmer months. While the layered look can be chic, too much may make you stand out in the wrong way.


An unbuttoned shirt over a t-shirt or tank top is a good conventional causal look. Just remember to keep that lightweight outer garment on hand if you need it.
Keep your sleeves as short as possible while still being appropriate for the occasion. Sleeves can dramatically increase an outfit's heat retention. One trendy layering option is to wear a sleeveless vest over a longer-sleeved shirt."

Get a hanger.,
Hang the garment somewhere sturdy.,
Pull gently.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of Leather1," Put your leather item that needs de-wrinkling on a hanger. Make sure to use a hanger appropriate for the garment. If, for example, you need to get wrinkles out of a jacket, make sure you have a hanger with wide shoulders to ensure that the stress caused by pulling the jacket won’t result in additional creases along the shoulder line.For skirts and pants, use a hanger with rubber-padded clips and hang at the waistband to let the garment hang at its full length.
For items too large to hang, the pulling technique may not work.
Try to avoid thin metal hangers as these may bend when put under stress.;
, You will be pulling on the garment, so you need to hang it somewhere that can not only handle the force of the leather, but also withstand you pulling down on it. A beam in your closet, a coat rack, or other object meant for hanging clothes would be an ideal area.


Avoid areas like small nails on the wall or pressure rods for curtains, as these are susceptible to failing when put under stress.

, Using your hands, pull lightly on the garment until the wrinkles relax. Pull in opposite directions at the same time, meaning that if you are working on a vertical wrinkle, you should grab it from both the top and the bottom of the wrinkle and pull gently in both directions.


Relax your wrinkles by alternating pulling from the top and bottom and from both sides.
Do not hold a pull for too long. The exact amount of stress a leather piece can take depends on the garment, but avoid pulling for longer than three to five seconds at a time to be safe. Let the leather rest for another three to five seconds before you begin pulling again.
Understand that this method is intended for small wrinkles, not for larger wrinkles or creases.

Set the iron to a cool setting.,
Turn the silk item inside out.

,
Place the silk on the ironing board.,
Iron out the wrinkles.,
Hang to dry.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of Silk1," Silk burns easily, so don't make the iron too warm.;
,, Put a cloth over the silk. For example, a thin towel.

, Don't leave the iron on any one spot for too long.


If you need a little dampness, spray water gently on the towel or cloth.

, This will remove any final wrinkles.


Turn the silk fabric the right way out to dry.

Get a fabric steamer.,
Start your steamer.,
Hang your garment.,
Steam your garment.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of Leather2," You can use an upright steamer or a hand steamer, but try to find one that is durable and well-regarded. Check online reviews and shop around before purchasing.Steamers are a good all-purpose way to get wrinkles out of leather. They work for garments and shoes as well as larger items such as furniture.

, Set your steamer to a medium-low setting, and allow it heat fully. Test it out away from the leather before you apply any steam to the wrinkled item. Cold or barely-there steam would allow for quick condensation on your leather item, which create some damage.


Read over your steamer’s instructions and the manufacturer recommendations regarding heating times before you use the steamer on your leather.

, If you are steaming a leather garment, hang it vertically. The steam relaxes the leather, allowing the natural weight of the garment to pull the wrinkles down and out. Use a hanger or the rack of your standing steamer.


If your leather objects are too large to hang, do not worry. The steam will still relax the leather enough for the wrinkles to settle.

, Use the steamer to apply an even coat of steam over the wrinkled parts of your leather. If possible, get both the inside and the outside of the wrinkled areas. Be sure to hold the steamer four or so inches from the garment and only apply steam for a second or so at a time, moving over the garment in same fashion that you would with an iron.If the wrinkles aren’t relaxing on their own after steaming, gently pull them to help relax them further.
Do not apply too much steam at a time. This could damage the leather and possibly the seams of your piece.
If you notice any moisture condensing on your leather because of the steam, take a clean, dry cloth and gently blot off the excess moisture.

Run the hot water.,
Allow the steam to build up.,
Let the garment steam.,
Smooth the garment.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of Leather3," Get your shower warm enough so that it is capable of fogging up the glass in your bathroom. Keep it warm enough so that the steam builds, but no so hot that you can’t actually shower in the water.


If you have a means of monitoring temperature in your shower, keep the water at around 105 F (40.5 C), the average temperature for a shower., As it does so, close the door to keep any steam from escaping. Put your leather item on a hanger and leave hanging in the bathroom near to the source of steam, but far away enough from the shower that no water gets on the leather.Try using a towel rack or a door knob as a place to hang your leather item.
Leather is not intended to deal with large quantities of water. Keep your leather far enough from the shower that no water drops get on it. If you notice water condensing on the leather, gently blot it off with a clean, dry towel.

, Allow the garment to sit in the steam for as long as possible. Let it remain in the bathroom during the length of your shower, then allow it to hang in the bathroom a bit longer. Wait until the steam starts to dissipate and the bathroom starts to cool before removing the garment.


Do not let the bathroom cool completely. This will set the leather and stop you from smoothing out any remaining creases.

, When you're done steaming, lay out the garment on a flat surface and smooth it out with your hands. Pull stubborn wrinkles gently to relax them.


Allow the leather to cool on the flat surface before moving or wearing it. This helps set the smoothed leather and prevents re-wrinkling.

Heat your iron on low.,
Find a covering.,
Iron.",How to Get Wrinkles Out of Leather4," Leather isn’t made to be ironed, and ironing it poses inherent threat of damage. Help mitigate this by turning your iron to its lowest setting before bringing it in contact with leather.Empty the steam well from your iron before you begin, as well. This helps avoid spilling and potential water damage.

, Get a heavy, brown paper or a 100 percent cotton cloth, such as a towel, and place it on top of the leather surface. Do not use lighter papers or fabrics, as the cover will burn in direct contact with the heated iron.Make sure the covering is clean and dry. Wipe any paper off with a towel before use.

, Iron your leather quickly and with a light hand. Do not hold the iron or move it slowly across the leather, even in stubborn areas. This may cause the leather to burn and could leave permanent damage.


Never put the iron directly on leather. Move the covering as necessary for larger items or deeper wrinkles.
Store or hang your leather item immediately after ironing if you do not intend on using it right away.

Determine how much of a sweater needs reshaping.,
Wet the sweater and remove excess water.,
Reshape the sweater.,
Dry carefully.,
Wet your sweater.,
Place the sweater in a dryer.",How to Fix a Sweater That Has Stretched1," You only need to soak an entire sweater if you want to shrink it entirely. Sometimes, this is not necessary. Your sweater may only have certain portions, like the neck or sleeves, that have stretched out. In this case, you can reshape the sweater by hand.;
, Fill a tub with slightly warm water. Submerge your sweater in the water until it's soaked. Remove the sweater from the water. Press out any excess water into the sink. Do not wring or squeeze the sweater to remove water as this can cause damage., Place the sweater between a padded towel. Using your hands, gently mold the sweater into your desired shape. Then, set the sweater aside to dry., You should not hang a reshaped sweater to dry. Hanging can cause bumps and lumps on the sweater's shoulders. Instead, pin the sweater to the towel you were using. From there, lay it down in a safe place to dry. Keep out of reach of children or pets as you do not want the sweater handled while drying., If you want to reshape the whole sweater, more extreme action needs to be taken. To start, get your sweater wet using lukewarm tap water. How wet you get the sweater affects how much it shrinks. For more shrinking, completely soak the sweater prior to drying. For less shrinking, just gently mist the sweater using a spray bottle until its damp., If you want to shrink a whole sweater, you can use a machine dryer. After wetting the sweater, place it in a dryer on high heat. You should use the highest heat setting possible, especially if you want to shrink your sweater significantly. Run the dryer until the sweater is completely dry. This should shrink your sweater a couple of sizes."

Look for fabric stuck in the zipper.,
Pull the fabric away from the zipper.,
Work the zipper up and down.,
Prevent further obstructions.",How to Fix a Stuck Zipper1," Sometimes, zippers may stop working because a bit of the surrounding fabric gets caught in the teeth. Inspect the garment or accessory closely for snags, folds, tangles and other signs of a hangup. These tend to be fairly easy to correct.Snags are usually to blame when a zipper completely refuses to budge.
If there are no visible obstructions in the zipper teeth, you may need to try lubricating the teeth instead.;
, Once you’ve located the snag responsible for blocking the zipper, take hold of the fabric around the obstruction and give it a gentle tug. If the snag is especially small, using a pair of tweezers may help you get a better grip. Pull the fabric in the direction opposite the way the zipper runs and hold it.








You can also try dislodging the fabric from inside the teeth with the point of a safety pin.Be careful not to wrench on the fabric too hard, or you may tear it.

, Keeping your hold on the snagged fabric, begin gently pulling the zipper tab. Try sliding it in both directions to see if the fabric releases. In most cases, constant tension, small movements and a little patience will be enough to clear the zipper teeth.









If you don’t have any luck freeing the fabric from the zipper, your only option will be to take it to a tailor.

, After successfully dealing with a troublesome zipper, take a few precautionary steps to make sure the problem doesn’t happen again. Stitch up ragged holes, smooth out wrinkles and use a razor to cut away loose threads. When you’re done, iron the fabric on both sides of the zipper to make sure it lays flat.








The less fabric there is in the way of the teeth, the less likely another snag is to occur.
Keep an eye out for frayed edges around the zipper tape itself.

Prepare a basin of water.,
Dampen the areas you want reshaped.,
Remold the sweater.,
Dry with a hair dryer.",How to Fix a Sweater That Has Stretched2," You can shrink sections of a sweater, like the neck or sleeves, if only these areas are stretched out. To do so, boil a medium-sized pot of water. Then, pour this water into a bowl., You can dip the sleeves, cuffs, or neck of the sweater into the water. Use protective gloves if the water is still steaming. You do not want to get burnt in the process., Using your fingers, gently pinch and squeeze the portion of the sweater you're shrinking. Work the sweater until it's at your desired size and shape.If you're remolding the cuff of a sweater sleeve, it might be a good idea to hold the cuff chest level as you remold. As the cuff is small, pulling it closer will allow you to see what you're doing.When remolding a larger area, like the neck of a sweater, try laying the sweater down on a flat surface as you work.
If your sweater is very wet, you may want to remold it over a towel to catch any drips.

, When you've reshaped the sweater, take a hairdryer and blow the sweater dry. The hot air works in combination with the hot water to solidify the new shape, shrinking that portion of sweater back to its original size.As the method requires hot air to work, you do not want to use the cool setting on your hair dryer. Start with the low heat setting. If the sweater is not drying fast enough, consider switching to high heat.

Fold sweaters rather than hanging them.,
Take precautions if you must hang sweaters.,
Hand wash your sweaters.",How to Fix a Sweater That Has Stretched3," You should fold your sweaters and store them in drawers rather than hanging them. Hanging sweaters can stretch out portions of the sweater. It can also leave small humps at the shoulders. If possible, fold your sweaters rather than hanging them., If you need to hang your sweaters, take certain precautions. Use thick, padded hangers to provide more support. This can help prevent stretching. You may also want to fold your sweater over and hang it from the bottom bar of a hanger. The bottom bar may provide more support, preventing stretching.You can cut open an empty paper towel tube and then fit it over the bottom bar of a hanger. This may help prevent creasing., If possible, you should always hand wash your sweaters. Hand wash them in cold water with a small amount of fabric softener and detergent. Rinse thoroughly, making sure to get all the suds out. When removing excess water before drying, press the sweater. Do not squeeze or wring it. Fold the sweater in half and hang it over the bottom bar of a hanger on a drying rack to dry."

Find a pencil.,
Rub the tip of the pencil along both sides of the zipper teeth.,
Try sliding the zipper.,
Repeat until the zipper budges.",How to Fix a Stuck Zipper2," Check your desk, backpack, briefcase or junk drawer for a graphite pencil. For best results, you’ll want to use a traditional wooden pencil rather than one of the mechanical variety—the broader tip will make it easier to get the graphite onto the zipper.Graphite naturally makes a very effective dry lubricant., Hold the zipper together with one hand while you work. Continue rubbing until you can see the graphite being left behind on the teeth. Focus on the line where the teeth intersect, as this is where most zippers get jammed.








Only apply a light amount of pressure to avoid breaking the tip of the pencil.
The loose graphite particles will coat the edges of the teeth, making it easier for them to lock and unlock.

, Test the zipper a few times by pulling it with slow, smooth motions. It should be able to glide freely once you get it started. When you’re finished, wash your hands and wipe off any remaining graphite with a paper towel to keep it from getting all over the surrounding fabric.








Don’t attempt to force the zipper. This may result in damage to the fabric or the zipper itself.

, If the pencil trick doesn’t work right away, keep trying. There may not be enough graphite on the teeth to get the zipper moving after a single attempt. Alternate between rubbing the pencil and sliding the zipper back and forth until you see progress.









If you’re still encountering resistance after applying a second coating of graphite, move on to a different method.

"
"
Grab a makeshift lubricant.,
Apply the lubricant directly to the zipper teeth.,
Give the zipper a try.,
Clean the garment or accessory.",How to Fix a Stuck Zipper3," Search your home for something you can use to reduce the friction between the slide and teeth of the zipper. This could be a bar of soap, a tube of chapstick or even a bottle of Windex—almost any type of smooth, slick substance will do the trick.Some other options include wax candles, petroleum jelly, crayons and lip balm.
Since so many different improvised lubricants can be effective, you should have a solution close at hand whether you’re at home, work or on the road., Start with the section of teeth that are still connected and use a generous amount of lubricant. Gradually try easing the slide up and down after a few minutes. As the lubricant seeps deeper into the teeth, you should find it easier to get the zipper moving.








Do your best to keep the lubricant away from the fabric itself in order to prevent staining and discoloration.
Use a separate tool, such as a cotton swab, to smear on messier substances like Vaseline or olive oil.If you’re using Windex, spray it over the entire zipper area, then wait a few minutes before testing the zipper., Take hold of the zipper tab and pull on it lightly to see if it moves. Chances are, the lubricant will have worked and your zipper will now be as good as new. Otherwise, you may need to use a second application to get it zipping and unzipping consistently.








Lubricants help clear the teeth of built-up dust and dirt, which is the leading cause of stuck zippers on older items.If the zipper is still uncooperative at this point, take it to an alterations shop to have it repaired or replaced.

, If the item is washing machine-safe, throw it in with your next load of laundry. Otherwise, you can scrub the zipper and the area around it with a cloth dampened with a mild soap solution. This is a good habit to get into when it comes to keeping your zippers functional, as well.








Not only will a good cleaning remove lubricant residue from the item, it will also clean any remaining debris out of the zipper, renewing it and improving its performance for many more wears.

Dress up your uniform or usual look.",How to Find the Perfect Outfit," It's easy to accumulate so much clothing that you become overwhelmed by it. Sort through all of your clothing to decide what to keep and what to donate or sell. If you're having trouble deciding whether or not to keep something, ask yourself:


Does this still fit me?
Would I like to wear this right now?
Do you feel confident in this?
Do I feel good when I wear this?
Are there occasions where I would wear this again?;
, Look at the clothing that you kept, but don't wear very often. You might want to tailor pieces to create new clothing items. A classic example is to cut the legs off of an old pair of denim jeans, creating denim shorts. But, you can create more unique pieces with older clothing. Try:


Getting your clothing tailored. If you have a classic suit, but you never wear it because it's too large, get it taken in.Consider using the fabric from a vintage skirt to create a new shirt or bag.
Dress up a vintage t-shirt by wearing it with a tailored blazer or sports jacket.

, You should have shoes for a variety of situations. To keep things simple, start by making sure you have shoes for work (whether they're dressy or active), running around, casual everyday wear, and dressy or formal situations. For example, you may want:Active: sneakers, boots
Dressy: oxfords, pumps, heels
Casual: sandals, boots, flats, loafers

, Gather all of your jackets, scarves and hats in an easy to find place. This is something you may want to do seasonally, every 4 months or so. The outerwear you need for winter will be remarkably different than what you need in the spring or summer. Here are some examples of what to gather:Winter: heavy coat (like wool), larger warm scarves, beret, parka, beanie
Spring: layering jackets (like cotton), cardigans, pullovers, blazers, fedora
Summer: lighter jackets (like denim or bomber), baseball caps

, Find your sunglasses, jewelry, purses, belts, ties, and watches. These accessories are the finishing touches for your outfit, so try to have a variety of styles. Look at thrift stores, antique malls, garage sales, or shop for locally made items. To get started, try to find:


Sunglasses: a simple black or tortoiseshell pair, a fun bright pair, aviators
Jewelry: earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, cuff links, watches
Belts: simple black or brown belt and wide patterned belt

, Try something different. Look for clothing in different textures, colors, patterns, or style. If you don't feel like buying new clothes, spend some time pairing clothing pieces that you don't normally wear together. You might just find a new combination that reinvigorates your wardrobe.Break some fashion rules. Try pairing bright or patterned clothes with other bright patterned clothes. Or, layer different textures to add interest to a new look.

, The perfect outfit should fit the kind of day you're having or event you're going to. You may need active wear if you're working out at the gym. Or, you should find a nice suit if you'll be in meetings for most of the day. Dressy events call for formal attire, while just hanging out at home means you can wear something comfy and casual.


Don't be surprised if you need to change clothes throughout the day depending on what you have to do. Just be prepared and bring changes of clothes to meet your needs.

, Your wardrobe should already be narrowed down by season, but you'll need to consider the weather for the day. You don't want to be in a hot wool suit if it's 90 degrees outside. Likewise, you'll regret wearing a summer dress if it's snowing outside.


Check the weather forecast for the day or just look outside the window before you get dressed. If you're unsure what the weather may do, try to be prepared. Carry an umbrella, wear a cardigan, or bring a change of shoes if you think the weather may turn.

, Choose one piece of clothing that you know you want to wear and build your outfit around it. For example, you may choose a bright print tie or a striking blazer. To keep things simple, just choose one article of clothing to highlight.Don't worry if you'd also like to highlight an accessory. The goal of focusing on a clothing item is to help you fashion an outfit and avoid competing clothing items (like a striped shirt with striped pants and striped tie).

, Once you have a main clothing piece, choose clothes that accent the item. Avoid completely matching the pieces. This can make them compete for attention. Instead, look for things that really make your focus piece stand out.


For example, if you've chosen a striking navy blazer, you might wear a simple white shirt and tan slacks. Or, if you've picked a bright yellow floral skirt, instead of wearing a yellow shirt or floral blouse, wear a navy or denim shirt.

, The perfect outfit can seem out of place if your shoes are inappropriate. Again, take the weather and occasion into account. Don't forget that you should also be as comfortable as possible. This can be obvious, like wearing sneakers if you're going to be working out. Or, you may really need to consider your day. If you're wearing a simple dress which looks good with heels or flats and you'll be running from meeting to meeting, you may want to choose the more comfortable shoes.


If you think you'll be on your feet for a long time, you may want to bring a few pairs of shoes that you can change into.

, To really make your outfit look put together, add an interesting accessory like cuff links or a scarf. This can add color or interest to a simple outfit. Or, if you have a really bright clothing item, a plain scarf can balance your look. Don't be afraid to try on several things until you find something that works.


When adding jewelry, avoid wearing too many matching pieces. Doing so will make your look seem forced.

, Once you've found a few outfits that you really like, it's easy to keep wearing the same things. This can speed up getting dressed in the morning, but you may want to look more polished or stand out. Make sure your outfit looks mature. Avoid wearing graphic tees, hoodies, or clothing you would have worn 20 years ago.To make your look feel more put together:


Wear a leather bracelet or classic watch.
Make a casual sweater stand out by layering a crisp white or colored shirt underneath.
Wear more dramatic makeup, highlighting your eyes or mouth (not both).
Wear shoes that are a bit dressier than you'd normally choose.
Apply cologne or perfume.

A dress and jacket also looks good providing the dress is smart enough and not too tight or too short. Think elegance here. Sweater dresses cut to knee length with a toning jacket is another great look for more casual workplaces.

, Grooming is important, hair should be well cut, clean and not extreme in colour or cuts. Make up should be discrete, wearing makeup has been shown to increase your chances of promotion just don’t overdo it.

, Traditional work colours are black (chic), navy (trustworthy), red (dynamic, aggressive), grey (conservative). To venture into hot pinks, oranges and wild prints is far riskier and after all it is your career on the line.

, Invest in good quality suits and coats and aim to keep them for several years. Beware of buying cheap clothing, cheaper fabrics and cheap jewellery or wearing old fashioned or worn out clothes. If you aspire to be promoted look as if you mean business and are a competent, confident professional. Clothing sends out very powerful messages about who we are, so dress to make a positive impression, dressing for success is a necessary precursor to obtaining it.

, If you don’t know use a personal stylist and find out the best colours to bring out the best in your skin tone and hair colour. Summer brings more challenges, women should ideally buy a smart summer work wardrobe of tailored dresses that will compete effectively with the men sweltering in suits. Invest in a few key outfits that will last a couple of years, linen shift dresses look great, as do linen mix suits providing they are crumple proof.

Think about the event before the day or evening it happens.,
Consider your trusted confidantes.,
Check the chosen clothes beforehand.,
Choose according to season.,
Choose by style.,

Wear minimal make-up if you're going all out with the clothes and more attention-grabbing makeup if your clothing is more simple (e.g.,
Own it.",How to Figure out What to Wear Wherever You Go," This will help relieve you of those last-minute insane dashes through an entire wardrobe. The things to cover include:


What is the event? Is it formal, semi-formal, or all-out casual but nice? Is it a formal party or are you just casually hanging with your friends?
What season is it?
What will the weather/temperature probably be on the day/night?;
, These might be friends, a spouse, your children, etc. Then make use of them for the following questions:


What are you wearing? (Only needed if you're in so much doubt, you can't figure out what to choose.)
Which of my outfits do you think I look great in?

, Fix up any tears, loose hems, stains, etc. or get them to a dry cleaners.

, If it is cold, wear warmer clothing, if it is hot, wear cooler clothing. If you really must wear something you'll freeze in, add a coat or jacket. Do not wear anything you'll boil in, it is nigh on impossible to feel comfortable and you may faint or get heat stroke.

, It might be fashionable, but does it fit and look great on you? If not, don't force yourself into it. Instead, stick with whatever makes you look wonderful. Gone are the days when only one style ruled the roost. You are liberated enough now to be able to choose what brings forth your best features. It's okay if it's not the textbook outfit to wear, it's more important that you feel confident with what you have on.


You can give a nod to current trends by adding an accessory that sums up the trend, be it by color, shape or logo.

, When everything is popping out or you can't distinguish your frame, the look fails to present you at your best. If something is really great and not in your size, get it tailored. A well-tailored outfit is always worth the effort and expense.

, Fashion doesn't always care about comfort but you should, especially if whatever you're going to requires you to stand a long time, or sit on hard seats, or be blown about by a cold breeze while pretending to like the weather. Think about the venue too––heels on a lawn party will soon grow really exhausting, while running around in just a bikini at the pool party will be less desirable when it comes time to evening drinks indoors at the bar.

, These are especially useful when you are not sure what the day holds; a cute knee length skirt, layered tanks, and a light jacket will go almost anywhere. Peel or add layers to add or subtract formality. At nighttime, add some eye liner, high heels, maybe an over sized accessory and you'll get a whole new nighttime look.

, Tons of accessories aren't necessary. Stick to your main piece and build around it with things that complement it.


Remember texture, prints, and colors. Contrast is nice, but when everything clashes, it's going to spoil your whole presentation.
A scarf is cute, whether it is a silk Hermès scarf or a knitted Burberry scarf.

Use ""dhanyavaad"" (धन्यवाद्) as a basic formal thank-you.,
Put ""bahut"" (बहुत) before dhanyavaad for ""thank you very much."",
Alternatively, try ""ābhārī hōṅ"" (आभारी हुँ).",How to Say Thank You in Hindi1," This is a common but formal way of saying ""thank you."" It's often used in situations where you really want to stress your gratitude (like if you've been given a gift). You may also want to use it with important business contacts, authority figures, and people who are older than you. This word is pronounced in three parts:Lay your tongue against the top of your mouth to pronounce ""dha"" with a soft d sound that's close to the English ""dh"" sound. Use the short u sound (as in ""stuff""). It should sound close to the English word ""the."" This part is not said with an ""ah"" sound.
Next, say ""nyuh."" Again, don't use the ""ah"" sound.
Now, say ""vod."" Here, you will use the ""ah"" sound.
All together, it should sound a little like ""dhun-yuh-vaad."";
, If you're especially grateful for something, you can use the superlative ""bahut."" This means essentially ""very much"" or ""a lot"" and is used a lot the way English speakers might use ""very."" This word is pronounced in two parts:


First, a short ""buh"" sound.
Next, a more forceful ""hut"" sound. Put the stress on this part — the whole thing should sound like ""buh-HUT.""
Say ""dhanyavaad"" after this to complete the phrase. See above for pronunciation help.

, This is another polite, formal way to say ""thank you."" The actual meaning in English is a little closer to ""I am grateful."" This word is pronounced in four parts:Say ""obb."" (rhymes with ""rob""). This part isn't pronounced like the English word ""ab.""
Next, say ""ha.""
Then, say ""ree."" The r sound you want to use here is very similar to the Spanish r — it should sound almost like ""dee"" in English.
Finish with ""hoon"" (rhymes with ""toon"").
All together, it should sound like ""obb-ha-dee hoon.""

"
"
Gain knowledge about the word.,
Know the pronunciation.,
Display respect while using this word.,
Practice to attain perfection.",How to Say Mister in Hindi," The Hindi word for Mister is 'śrī' or 'śrīman';
, The pronunciation is 'Shree' (sh-r-ee) or 'Shree maan' (sh-r-ee-m-aa-n).

, It is common practice to prefix names with 'śrī' and suffix them with a 'ji' as a mark of respect.

, Keep practicing.


Example: The name Albert would be; śrī Albert-ji.

"
Use ""shukriyaa"" (शुक्रिया) as your standard informal thank-you.,
Put ""bahut"" (बहुत) before shukriyaa for ""thank you very much."",
Use ""thaiṅkyū"" (थैंक्यू) if you want to cheat.",How to Say Thank You in Hindi2," This is a very common way of giving thanks in Hindi, but it's not very formal. This means you should use it mainly for your friends and family. If you're talking to someone like a boss or teacher, an authority figure, or an elder, you'll probably want to use one of the phrases above. Pronounce this word in three parts:First, say ""shook."" Make this syllable a little shorter and tighter than you'd normally say the English word.
Next, say ""ree."" Here, again, the Hindi r sound is a delicate flick of the tongue like the Spanish r sound — this should should sound almost like ""dee.""
End with ""ah."" The sound you use here should be somewhere between ""uh"" and ""ah."" It may take a little practice to get this right.
All together, this should sound like ""shook-dee-ah."" Nailing the r/d sound is important here. You may want to try pronouncing it like ""shook-uh-dee-ah"", then gradually working to shrink that ""uh"" sound until it's nothing more than a flick of the tongue.

, You can use ""bahut"" here the same way as you did above to change your basic ""thank you"" to ""thank you very much"" or ""thanks a lot."" Though you're expressing more gratitude here, this is still considered informal.


Bahut is pronounced the same way as in the section above: ""buh-HUT.""

, Hindi, like almost every language, borrows words and phrases from other languages. This Hindi loan word is pronounced exactly like ""thank you"" in English (because it obviously is English in origin). Because this isn't really ""pure"" Hindi, it's considered less formal than the options in the seconi above.


It's also worth noting that English is one of the official languages of India, so much of the population will likely be familiar with this phrase even if they don't speak English fluently.

"
Use ""svaagat haiṅ"" (स्वागत है) for ""you're welcome."",
Optionally, put ""āpa kā"" (आप का) before ""svaagat haiṅ."",
Use ""koii baat nahee"" (कोई बात नही) for ""it's nothing.""",How to Say Thank You in Hindi3," When you use any of the thank you phrases above, you may get this in return. This phrase means almost exactly ""you are welcome."" In fact, you can even say ""svaagat"" on its own if you're greeting someone who's just arrived — just like you'd use ""welcome"" in English.To pronounce this phrase:


First, say ""swah."" This sounds like the English word ""swab"" without the b.
Next, say ""gut.""
Finally, say ""hey."" Don't be confused by the n in the romanization — this sounds almost exactly like the English word ""hey.""
All together, it should sound like ""swah-gut hey.""

, The meaning here is not very different from the phrase above. The difference is a little like saying ""you are welcome"" versus ""you're welcome"" — people will react the same way no matter which one you use. Pronounce this phrase in two parts:


First, say ""op"" (as in ""post-op"").
Then, say ""kuh"" (rhymes with ""the"").
All together, it should sound like ""op-kuh."" Follow this immediately with ""svaagat haiṅ"" for ""you are welcome.""

, This is another way to express that you don't mind doing something for someone else. You would use this phrase similarly to how you'd use ""don't mention it"" or ""no problem"" in English.This phrase is pronounced in four parts:


First, say ""coy.""
Then, say ""bot"" (as in robot).
Next, say a very short ""nuh"" (rhymes with ""the"").
End with a longer ""hee"" (sounds like the English word ""he""). Put a little extra stress on this syllable — the last part should sound like ""nuh-HEE.""
All together, it should sound like ""coy bot nuh-HEE.""

Get rid of anything you don't wear.",How to Choose Good Clothes," You can use outfits to make aspects of your appearance look bigger, smaller, more obvious, or less noticeable.Patterns – Clothes with vertical lines will usually make the part of the body they're worn on look thinner. Meanwhile, horizontal stripes will often make that space look wider. Bright, attention grabbing patterns will draw the eye to where they're worn, so if you'd like to emphasize your bust, a patterned shirt is a good strategy. The converse is also true; dark, solid pieces can de-emphasize certain areas of your body, especially when paired with bright patterns.

Waist styles – Low-waisted paints can make your body look curvier with a more well-defined waist. Empire waists can help to emphasize your bust.

Structured tailoring – Clothing with structured tailoring can be used to emphasize and give shape to any part of your body. Boxy outerwear can make your upper body look bulkier, while shoulder pads can specifically make your shoulders appear wider. Pleated trousers can also make legs look thicker.

Types of hemlines – A-line skirts are great for adding curves and making your bottom half look wider. Straight skirts are also good for doing the latter. Tapered skirts have the opposite effect; wear these when trying to de-emphasize your lower body.

Fit – In general, baggy clothing will hide definition, while tighter fits will accentuate it.;
, Whether you're buying clothing off-the-rack or having it tailored, it's best to keep your exact proportions in mind. Use a tape measure and write down the exact numbers. Here are the measurements you should take:Circumference of your head for hat sizing.
Upper arm for sleeves.
Neck, which is more important in men's clothing.
Widest or fullest part of your chest or bust.
Natural waistline.
Hips for women's clothing.
Inseam, which is the distance from your groin to the bottom of your ankle.

, The right fit is the most important part of choosing good clothes. In general, a garment that fits well but is in an unflattering style will look better than a piece with a poor fit in a style meant to flatter your body shape.Clothing that fits should be comfortable and not hinder your movements while not looking too baggy or sloppy.
If you're planning on losing weight, don't buy clothes that you assume you'll fit into in a few months. Instead, hold off major purchases until after you make any major changes.
Be sure to always hem your pants, especially if you're on the short side. A too-low hem will make you look much shorter.

, If a garment doesn't quite fit now but you think it'll look great once you get in shape for the summer? It's not a good idea to buy it. Shop for your current figure, not the one you think you should have. You don't want to waste money on clothes you might never wear.If a jacket or blazer won't button all the way, it doesn't fit. Try one size up or pick a different one altogether.
If you're swamped in a piece of clothing, it doesn't fit. If it hangs off of you, you should pick a different size.

, This step is crucial in finding flattering clothes that a lot of people skip. A dress or a suit can look like a perfect fit from the front but terrible from behind.If you have a phone with a front-facing camera, take it with you to the dressing room to check how the back of each garment looks on you. See if it looks baggy or too tight. Make sure that it is flattering on you, meaning it's not hugging the wrong curves and that it isn't showing anything it shouldn't.
After you check how your potential new garment looks on you from the front, turn around so that your back faces the fitting room mirror. Switch your phone to its front-facing camera mode and hold it in front of you, higher than your shoulder and tilted down slightly. You should be able to see your back's reflection in your phone's screen.
If your phone doesn't have a front-facing camera, bring a small hand or compact mirror when you go shopping instead.

, You may want to keep up with new styles, but if a certain popular look is unflattering on you, don't wear it. Develop your own style and only incorporate trends that fit it well.For example, if you're a skinny guy and ultra-baggy suits are in, don't waste money on this trend. You aren't likely to pull it off as well as other body types.
On the other hand, if you're pear-shaped and bulky scarves are trendy, take advantage of the chance to look extra chic.

, These can be colors that flatter your skin tone, look great together, or are simply your favorites.Choose clothes that match your skin's undertones. People with warm undertones tend to look better with warm colors, while cool colors pair best with cool-toned skin.
Make outfits that incorporate complementary colors. These are colors that are opposite each other on the color wheel: purple with yellow, blue with orange, and red with green.
Try to build a wardrobe that includes staples of only one or two neutral colors. Neutrals will make up the foundation of most outfits but don't often look good together. For clothes, these neutrals are considered to be light and dark gray, light and dark brown, navy, and black.Remember that you should wear what makes you happiest. If you have a favorite color that doesn't match your skin tone, then it still ""works"" for you.

, If you find an item that looks especially great on you right off-the-rack, check out other clothes by the same brand. You're more likely to find something else that looks great on you. While sizes and cuts are often inconsistent between brands, many brands keep their particular sizing the same over time.At the same time, if you find a brand's quality going downhill or if it changes its sizing, start looking elsewhere.
Keep in mind that American brands are typically more boxy and baggy compared to European ones., It's not uncommon for people to buy a few different versions of a particularly great piece. This will let you spice up your wardrobe while sticking with what you know works.For workhorses like skirts and pants, consider buying even a couple identical pieces.
This is an especially good idea if you have a lot of difficulty finding comfortable clothing that fits.

, If you can afford to purchase well-made, quality items now, you'll save money in the long run. For example, if a good pair of boots costs twice as much but lasts ten times as long, you'll end up spending much more money over time on ten pairs of cheap boots.While expensive doesn't always equal well-made, well-made clothes are usually more expensive than poorly-made ones.
With the exception of breathable summer clothes, a good sign of quality is whether or not a garment is lined.
Check the seams before you buy. Make sure they're even and consistent. Poorly-stitched seams are a sign of poor quality.
Go for quality over quantity. It's usually better to have a smaller wardrobe made up of well-made clothing than a larger one full of cheap pieces.
If you're on a budget, don't forget to check online auctions and second-hand shops. You can often find what you're looking for at a fraction of the retail price.

, When picking out pieces, make sure you have solid pieces that you can wear in a variety of scenarios. You want a wardrobe that will take you from work to out to dinner without having too many pieces that are only for one type of occasion.For instance, a nice pair of pants that fits will can be made professional with a nice jacket and a blouse. For slightly dressier dinner, take off the jacket and add a scarf.
As another example, a knee length skirt in a solid color is appropriate for work with a solid color on top, but it could also work for brunch with friends if you add few accessories.

, When it comes to fashion, the basic neutral colors are black, navy blue, browns, grays, and tans. Because neutrals don't tend to go well together in the same outfit, picking and sticking to one or two will help you create more outfits with less pieces.Buy versatile items like skirts, pants, belts, and coats in your chosen neutral(s).
White is also technically a neutral color, but it can be paired with other neutrals.

, Unless you're buying complete outfits at the same time, never buy a piece unless you know what you'll wear it with. Before buying an item, mentally create one or more outfits using it and pieces you already own.Even though you love an item, it just may never fit into your wardrobe if it's not your usual style, which means you won't wear it.
Skipping this step can lead to a lot of unworn pieces that just sit in your closet.

, The first step of building a wardrobe isn't buying anything; it's streamlining what you already have. Go through your closet and look for pieces you never wear. Eliminating these will make choosing good clothes much easier.You can sell your old clothes online, if you're short on cash.
Another option is to give them to charity. You'll even get a credit on your taxes for the donation, if you get a receipt. Some charities will pick up donations, so you don't have to go anywhere.
Consider posting them on social media. Many times, your friends will want to claim items you don't want.

Make sure you remember the gender or every noun in Hindi as the gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication of the language.You can apply a general rule to determine the gender for a noun. Words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. Keep in mind there are many exceptions to this rule. To be on the safe side, you should still learn the gender of all nouns by memorizing them and lots of practice using them in Hindi sentences and phrases.For example, the noun for boy is: लड़का ladkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की ladkee (F). The general rule of gender applies in the case of these nouns.
But nouns like मेज़ mez - Desk (F) or घर ghar - House (M) are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.;
, To communicate effectively in Hindi, you will need to learn simple pronouns like “he, she, I, we, they”. The pronouns in Hindi are:


First person singular: मैं main - I
First person plural: हम hum - We
Second person singular: तू too - You (Intimate)
Second person plural: तुम tum - You (Informal), आप aap - You (Formal)

Keep in mind each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. You should use the formal आप aap when you are meeting someone for the first time, talking to an elder or if you wish to show respect to the person whom you are speaking to.
The informal तुम thum is used when you are talking with your friends or close relatives. The informal तू too can be used when you are having an informal or intimate conversation, such as a conversation with your partner or with your young children. Do not use the informal तू too when speaking to a stranger or someone you do not know well, as this is considered as very rude remark.


Third person singular: यह yah - He / She/ It / This
Third person plural: वह vah - He / She/ It / That

In spoken Hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently: यह is pronounced yeh and वह is pronounced voh. You should use यह yeh when speaking about someone or something close to you. For example, if someone is standing next to you, you would use यह yeh.
You should use वह voh when speaking about someone or something further away. For example, if someone is standing across the street, you would use वह voh.
When in doubt, use वह voh.


Third person plural: ये ye - These / They
Third person plural: वे ve- Those / They

You will often hear वे ve being pronounced as the singular “voh”. The third person plural pronouns follow the same rules: ये ye for people / things close to you (in the distance sense) and वे vo for people / things further away.
Note that both यह yeh or वह voh could mean either “he” or “she”. In Hindi, the third person pronoun is not based on the gender of the person you are talking about. To determine if the person is talking to a “he” or “she”, you must consider the context of the sentence.



, Start by learning Hindi verbs in the infinitive form (in English, “to ___”), as verbs are conjugated in Hindi by removing the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. Hindi infinitives end in ना naa.Examples of Hindi infinitives include: होना honaa - to be; पढ़ना padnaa - to read or to study; बोलना bolnaa - to speak; सीखना seekhnaa - to learn; जाना jaanaa - to go., You must conjugate verbs in Hindi to reflect grammatical categories such as number, gender, tense, and mood.For example, the infinitive verb होना honaa- to be, conjugated for number becomes::

मैं हूँ main hoon('n' is silent) - I am
हम हैं ham hain('n' is silent) - We are
तू है thoo hai - You are (intimate)
तुम हो thum ho -- You are (informal)
आप हैं aap hain - You are (formal)
यह है yah hai - he/she/this is
वह है voh hai - he/she/that is
ये हैं ye hain - these/they are
वे हैं ve hain - those/they are


There are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense:

For masculine singular subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ता taa.
For masculine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ते te.
For feminine singular or feminine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ती tee.


Hindi verbs have many tenses so you will need to use reference materials such as textbooks and language guides to learn how to conjugate verbs beyond the present tense. You can also use a good reference dictionary to assist you in conjugating new verbs.

, “Hello” and “Goodbye” are the same word in Hindi, “namaste”, pronounced nuh-MUS-stay. Often, you will greet someone with “namaste” at the beginning of a conversation or as a casual greeting when you meet them in passing.“Good morning” in Hindi is “Suprabhaat”, and “Good evening” in Hindi is “Shub sundhyaa”. “Welcome” in Hindi is “Aapka swaagath hai!”
A pronunciation guide for these words can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD9serDDbY8#t=17.

, Practice the days of the week to expand your Hindi vocabulary. It can help you to hear the days of the week pronounced by a fluent speaker, which can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD9serDDbY8#t=17.Sunday: RaveevaaR
Monday: SomvaaR
Tuesday: MangalvaaR
Wednesday: BudvaaR
Thursday: guRoovaaR
Friday: shukRavaaR
Saturday: shaneevaaR
You can also practice saying “yesterday”, which is “kal”; today, which is “aaj”; Day, which is “dhin”; Night, which is “raath”.

, Another easy to learn list is the numbers 1-20 in Hindi. Learning the numbers can be a good way to expand your vocabulary further and get comfortable with the sounds of Hindi words.Zero: shunya/sifer
One: eyk
Two: dho
Three: theen
Four: chaar
Five: paanch
Six: chey
Seven: saath
Eight: aat
Nine: now
Ten:dhas
Eleven: gyaaRah
Twelve: baaRah
Thirteen: teyRah
Fourteen: chowdhah
Fifteen: pandhRaah
Sixteen: solah
Seventeen: sathRah
Eighteen: ataaRaah
Nineteen: unnees
Twenty: bees

,, To keep your Hindi conversations going, you may then ask “how are you?” or “Aap kaisey hain?” pronounced “aap KAY-se hain.”You may then respond to the question with “I’m fine, thanks!” or “Mein theek hoon, shukriya!”
You can also practice saying “thank you” or “Dhanya vaad”, pronounced “DUN-y e vaad.” You can respond when someone thanks you in Hindi by saying “your welcome” or “Shukriyaa.”

, Once you feel comfortable with several words and phrases in Hindi, you may want to string them together in a short back and forth conversation with a fluent friend or a language partner. You can also practice conversational Hindi on your own. An example conversation may be:


“Namaste!” (or “Arrey, Dost!” which is “Hi friend!”, a less formal greeting)
“Namaste!”
“Aap kaisey hain?” (How are you?)
“Mein theek hoon, shukriya! Aur aap?” (I’m good, thanks. And you?)
“Theek-thaak.” (Good)
“Alvida!” (Good bye!)
“Namaste!” (Bye!)

, If you plan to travel in India or an area where Hindi is spoken, you may want to brush up on several traveler phrases to help you speak to locals during your trip. You should practice these phrases with a Hindi fluent friend or a friend who is also learning Hindi so you can master the pronunciation of these phrases and terms.“I’m lost”: “Hum kho gaye hain”
“Can you help me?”: “Kya aap meri madad kar saktey hain?”
“Where is the bathroom?”: “śaucaghara kahaan hai?”
“How much is this?”: “Yeh kaisey diyaa?”
“Excuse me…” (to ask for something): “Kshama keejeeae…”
“Excuse me…” (to pass by someone): “Kshama keejeeae…”

, You can also practice ordering food in Hindi, which is a good way to also practice certain Hindi phrases and terms. Audio recordings of these Hindi phrases and terms can be found on the Audible Hindi website.“Would you like a …?” : “kya aapako … pasand hai?”
“What would you like to drink?”: “Aap kya pina pasand karenge?”
“I would like to …”: “main … lena pasand karunga.”
“I don’t eat meat or fish.”: “Main macchi ya maas nahin khata.”
“I don’t drink.”: “main shrab nahin pita.”
“It’s awful!”: “yah bhayankar hai!”
“It’s delicious!”: “yah swadisht hai!”

, One of the best ways to learn a new language is to sign up for an in person class, where you engage with an instructor and other students at least once a week. You will be able to practice your Hindi in face to face conversations with your instructor and get hands on instruction on pronunciation and intonation.


It can also be useful to be surrounded by other students who are also learning the language, as you can all act as supports for each other and practice the language together. Look for Hindi language classes at your local college or university, or at an Indian community center in your area.

, There are many online learning tools available for beginner Hindi speakers that focus on basic words and phrases, as well as more complex elements of the language, such as conjugation, verbs, adjectives, and Hindi sounds.


There are videos on Hindi pronunciation that can be found here: http://www.linguanaut.com/videos.htm.
You can access a podcast that focuses on learning Hindi here: http://www.hindipod101.com/?src=bc_LearnHindi1_Search_learning%20Hindi_{creative}_{placement}.

, Hindi children’s books can be a great way to learn basic words and phrases in a fun and accessible way. Many children’s books are also good for getting better at conversational Hindi and provide visuals to reinforce the vocabulary.


You can find over 60 Hindi children’s books here: http://www.learning-hindi.com/, some with accompanying audio recordings of the books to get better at pronunciation.

It is written from left to right, lacks distinct letter cases, and is recognizable by a distinctive horizontal line running along the tops of the letters that links them together.A chart with the Devanagari alphabet is available here: http://www.omniglot.com/charts/print/hindi.pdf.;
, Hindi has 11 vowels, some of which are indicated by the use of diacritic marks, or symbols added to the letters of an alphabet in order to show different pronunciations.Vowels in Hindi have two forms: one form for when they are used by themselves, and one form for when the vowel is joined to a consonant in a word.अ a and आ aa

अ does not change the consonant, so if you see a consonant without a modifying symbol, it will have this vowel sound.When आ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ा to the end of the consonant (for example, न na becomes ना naa when आ is added to it).


इ i and ई ee

When इ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ि to the left-hand side of the consonant (before the consonant).
When ई is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ी to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant).


उ u and ऊ oo

When उ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ु beneath the consonant.
When ऊ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ू beneath the consonant.


ए e and ऐ ai

When ए is added to a consonant, you add the symbol े above the consonant.
When ऐ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ै above the consonant.


ओ o and औ au

When ओ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ो to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant).
When औ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ौ to the right-hand side of the consonant (after the consonant).


ऋ ri

When ऋ is added to a consonant, you add the symbol ृ beneath the consonant.
This vowel isn't very common in Hindi and is only found in Hindi words of Sanskrit origin.There is also a detailed pronunciation guide for the vowels here: http://learn-hindi-online.com/hindi-alphabet/vowels.php.

, There are 33 consonants in Hindi.They are organized in the alphabet by how you use your mouth and throat to pronounce them. Because Hindi uses more consonants than English does, some of them have no direct equivalent in English.The (a) next to some consonants indicates that they are pronounced as aspirated (i.e., with a strong breath of air such as p in ""pit"" or ""puff"").


Velar consonants, pronounced by using the back of the tongue at the roof of your mouth (e.g., k or g in English): क k, ख k (a), ग g, घ g (a), ङ n

Palatal consonants, pronounced by raising the front of the tongue just behind the gums(e.g., j in ""job""): च ch, छ ch (a), ज j, झ j (a), ञ n

Retroflex consonants, pronounced by curling the tongue backward and touching the roof of your mouth just behind the gums (none exist in English): ञ t, ट t (a), ड d, ढ d (a), ण n

Flap consonants, pronounced by ""flapping"" the tip of your tongue toward the roof of your mouth behind your upper front teeth (e.g., the t softening in words like ""butter,"" which often sounds like ""budder"") : ड़ d and ढ़ d (a)
Dental consonants, pronounced by touching the tip of your tongue behind the back of your upper front teeth (e.g., th in ""thin""): त t, थ t (a), थ d, ध d (a), न n

Labial consonants, pronounced by using the lips together (e.g., b in ""baby""): प p, फ p (a), ब b, भ b (a), म m

Semivowels are vowel-like consonants, such as the w in ""wet"": य y (as in ""young""), य r, ल l, व w or v

Sibilant consonants, pronounced by using the tip of the tongue to push air out in a hissing noise: श sh, ष sh, स s

Glottal consonants, pronounced by using the glottis at thee back of the throat: स h


, Hindi consonants have two basic different ways of pronouncing them: voiced and unvoiced. Reading explanations for these pronunciations may seem a little complicated, but don't worry; once you start trying to practice the sounds, you'll be able to feel the difference between voicing and not voicing.Voiced consonants are pronounced by vibrating your vocal cords.For example, voiced consonants in English include z in ""zoo"" and g in ""good"".

Unvoiced consonants are pronounced without vibrating your vocal cords. For example, unvoiced consonants in English include s in ""snap"" and k in ""kitten"".

, Hindi consonants also fall into two basic subcategories, unaspirated and aspirated. You can have unvoiced unaspirated consonants, unvoiced aspirated consonants, etc.Aspiration is another term for a burst of air released through your mouth.
The only way to really understand how this works in Hindi is to listen to recordings.

, The Hindi alphabet may look a little alien to you, especially if you are a native English speaker, but with some practice, you'll be able to understand how to make all the Hindi letter sounds yourself.A video recording of the Hindi alphabet is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XyG_594WOjE.


Once you have listened to the recording a few times, pause the recording and try to mimic the pronunciation of the speaker. Take your time and work your way slowly through alphabet.

, You may find it easier to learn the Devanagari script if you can see how it is written. There are several tutorials available online, but the one at hindibhasha.com is widely recommended by university language departments.

, Nouns are words for objects, places, emotions, animals, and people. In Hindi, all nouns have a gender: masculine (M) or feminine (F). The gender of Hindi nouns is essential for proper grammar and communication, so when learning Hindi nouns, you must also learn their genders so you can use the nouns correctly.A very general rule to determine the gender for a noun is words that end with the vowel आ aa are usually masculine and words that end with the vowel ई ee are usually feminine. However, there are many exceptions to this rule, so it's important to still learn the gender of every noun through memorization and practice.For example: The noun for boy is: लड़का larkaa (M) and the noun for girl is: लड़की larkee (F). So in the case of these nouns, the general rule of gender applies.
On the other hand, nouns like केला kelaa - Banana (M) and मेज़ mez - Desk (F) or घर ghar - House (M) are all exceptions to the general rule of gender.

, Simple pronouns like “he, she, I, we, they” are key to communicating in any language, including Hindi. The pronouns in Hindi are:First person singular: मैं main - I
First person plural: हम ham - We
Second person singular: तू too - You (Intimate)
Second person plural: तुम tum - You (Informal), आप aap - You (Formal)

A note on informal and formal pronouns: each pronoun is used based on the level of politeness in a conversation. Use the formal आप aap when meeting someone for the first time, talking to someone older than you or simply to show respect to the person you are addressing.
Use the informal तुम tum when chatting with your friends or close relatives. Use तू too when you are in a very informal or intimate conversation, such as talking to your partner or to young children. It would be considered extremely rude in Hindi to use तू too when talking to a stranger or someone you barely know.


Third person singular: यह yah - He / She/ It / This
Third person plural: वह vah - He / She/ It / That

In spoken Hindi these words are pronounced slightly differently: यह is pronounced yeh and वह is pronounced voh. Use यह yeh when talking about someone or something close to you, so if someone is standing right next to you, use यह yeh.
Use वह voh when talking about someone or something further away, so if someone is standing on the other side of the street, use वह voh.
When in doubt, use वह voh.


Third person plural: ये ye - These / They
Third person plural: वे ve- Those / They

You will often hear वे ve being pronounced as the singular “voh”. The third person plural pronouns follow the same rules: ये ye for people / things close to you (in the distance sense) and वे vo for people / things further away.
Note that both यह yeh or वह voh could mean either “he” or “she”, so there is no difference based on the gender of how you are talking to. You must rely on the context of the sentence to determine if a person is talking to a “he” or “she”.



, Verbs describe an action, occurrence, or state of being. Learn Hindi verbs in the infinitive form (in English, “to ___”), as verbs are conjugated by dropping the infinitive ending and adding other suffixes. Hindi infinitives end in ना naa.Examples of Hindi infinitives include: होना honaa - to be; पढ़ना pahrnaa - to read or to study; बोलना bolnaa - to speak; सीखना seekhnaa - to learn; जाना jaanaa - to go., Like nouns, verbs in Hindi must be conjugated to reflect grammatical categories such as number, gender, tense, and mood.For example, the infinitive verb होना honaa- to be, conjugated for number becomes:

मैं हूँ main hoon - I am
हम हैं ham hain - We are
तू है too hai - You are (intimate)
तुम हो tum ho -- You are (informal)
आप हैं aap hain - You are (formal)
यह है yah hai - he/she/this is
वह है voh hai - he/she/that is
ये हैं ye hain - these/they are
वे हैं ve hain - those/they are


There are three conjugations for gender in the present verb tense:

For masculine singular subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ता taa.
For masculine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ते te.
For feminine singular or feminine plural subjects, drop the infinitive ending ना naa and add ती tee.


Because Hindi verbs have many tenses, you’ll want to use a textbook or other reference materials to learn verb conjugations beyond the basic present tense. A good reference dictionary will also help you conjugate new verbs.

, Once you become more comfortable with Hindi nouns, pronouns, and verbs, you can move on to studying other elements of Hindi., Oxford University Press publishes the gold standard of dictionaries, the Oxford Hindi-English Dictionary.While smaller pocket dictionaries are fine if you just need to look up a word or two, invest in a more substantial academic dictionary if you are serious about more formal study.


There are also Hindi dictionaries online. The University of Chicago’s “Digital Dictionaries of South Asia” project includes a dictionary of Urdu and Classical Hindi., Start with basic words that will help you become familiar with how Hindi vowels and consonants work together to create a word or phrase. Focus on recognizing the Hindi words and the Devanagari script. The days of the week are:Sunday, Hindi word: Raveevaa, Devanagari script: Rरविवार
Monday, Hindi word: somvaa, Devanagari script: Rसोमवार
Tuesday, Hindi word: mangalvaa, Devanagari script: Rमंगलवार
Wednesday, Hindi word: budvaa, Devangari script: Rबुधवार
Thursday, Hindi word: guRoovaa, Devangari script:Rगुरुवार
Friday, Hindi word: shukRavaa, Devangari script: Rशुक्रवार
Saturday, Hindi word: shaneevaa, Devangari script:Rशनिवार

, Once you become familiar with the days of the week, move on to other basic Hindi words, keeping in mind the Devanagari script.Yesterday, Hindi word: kal, script:कल
Today, Hindi word: aaj, script: आज
Tomorrow, Hindi word: kal, script: कल
Day, Hindi word: din, script: दिन
Night, Hindi word: Raat, script: रात
Week, Hindi word: haftaa, script: हफ़्ता
Month, Hindi word: maheenaa, script: महीना
Years, Hindi word: aal, script: साल
Second, Hindi word: doosRaa
Minute, Hindi word: mint, script: मिनट
Hour, Hindi word: gantaa, script: घंटा
Morning, Hindi word: saveRey, script: सवेरे
Evening, Hindi word: shaam, script: शाम
Noon, Hindi word: dopeheR, script: दो पहर
Midnight, Hindi word: aadeeRaat, script: आधी रात
Now, Hindi word: ab, script: अब
Later, Hindi word: baad mey, script: बाद में

, Learning conversational Hindi is a great way to practice your alphabet skills and prepare you for lessons on basic Hindi grammar. Actually having a conversation in Hindi is the most important way to learn the language.


Find a friend in your language class or look online in language forums for individuals looking to practice their conversational Hindi. There are also recordings of basic phrases online that you can refer to.Focus on phrases like:Hi!, Hindi: Namastey!, script: नमस्ते
Good morning!, Hindi: Suprabhaat, script: सुप्रभात
Good evening!, Hindi: Shubh sundhyaa, script: शुभ संध्या
Welcome! (to greet someone), Hindi: Aapka swaagat hai!, script: आपका स्वागत हैं।
How are you?, Hindi: Aap kaisey hain?, script: आप कैसे हैं ?
I'm fine, thanks!, Hindi: Mein theek hoon, shukriya!, script: मैं ठीक हुँ ।
And you?, Hindi: Aur aap?, script: और आप?
Good/ So-So, Hindi: Accha/ Theek-thaak, script: अच्छा/ ठीक-ठाक
Thank you (very much)!, Hindi: Shukriyaa (Bahut dhanyavaad), script: शुक्रीया (बहुत धन्यवाद)

Consider the clasp.",How to Measure a Necklace," Necklace measurements are, essentially, chain measurements. If you want to measure the chain, you will need to open it up and make it as straight as possible.;
, Extend the tape measure from one end of the chain to the other and note the length. This length is the marketable size of the necklace.


Do not forget the clasp in your measurement. The complete chain should be measured because that is what determines how long it hangs.
For similar reasons, do not include the length of any charm or pendant hanging from the chain.

, Standard necklace chains designed for women come in five basic sizes. For most women, these sizes will fall out around the same place on the body.Choker length is 16 inches (40 cm).
Princess length is 18 inches (45 cm), but this size can actually range anywhere between 17 and 19 inches (43 and 48 cm). This length usually falls out at the collarbone.
Matinee length is 20 inches (50 cm), which usually extends just a bit below the collarbone.
If you need a chain that falls at or just above the neckline, opt for a 22-inch (55-cm) chain.
For a necklace that falls just below the neckline, choose a 24-inch (60-cm) chain.

, Necklace chains designed for men come in four basic sizes. Like women's necklaces, men's necklaces usually fall out around the same place on each man.


Men with smaller neck sizes may choose an 18-inch (45-cm) chain. This length should come down to the base of the neck.
The most common length for the average man is 20 inches (50 cm), which comes down to the collarbone.
Choose a 22-inch (55-cm) chain if you want something that lands just below the collarbone.
For a necklace that comes down to a point just above the sternum, go with a 24-inch (60-cm) chain.

, Most necklaces made for children fall within a single range: 14 to 16 inches (35 to 40 cm)., Neck size is probably the most important measurement you will need to know when determining which necklace length will work best for you. A necklace will fall lower on a person with a thin neck and higher on a person with a thicker neck.


Wrap a soft tape measure around your neck, keeping the tape measure parallel to the floor as you measure.
Add 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cm) to your neck measurement to calculate your minimum recommended chain length. Doing so will prevent the chain from sitting too snugly around your neck.
If you want a choker necklace, however, you can stick with your exact neck measurement instead of adding any excess length.
If you cannot customize the necklace length to your neck size, simply choose the second size up from your neck size as your minimum necklace measurement. For instance, if you are a woman with a neck size measuring 17 inches (43 cm), your minimum standard should be 20 inches (50 cm) instead of 18 inches (45 cm).

, In addition to neck size, your height can also change the position of a necklace around your neck. Long necklaces can overwhelm women shorter women and short necklaces can get lost on taller women.If your height is below 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm), stick with necklaces measuring between 16 and 20 inches (40 and 50 cm).
For women with heights between 5 feet (1.5 m) 4 inches (162 cm) and 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm), necklaces of any length should work well.
Women with a height of 5 feet (1.5 m) 7 inches (170 cm) or taller look best in longer necklaces.

, Just as different clothes flatter different parts of the body, different necklace lengths accentuate different parts of the body.


If you want to accent the bust, choose a necklace that draws attention to the area just below the collarbone and above the bust. Usually, 20 to 22 inch (50 to 55 cm) necklaces will do the trick.
If you have a flatter, less prominent bust, thin chains measuring around 22 inches (55 cm) tend to have an elegant look.
Full figured women should avoid necklaces that sit on or below the bust since these chains do not often hang correctly. Stick with necklaces measuring around 18 inches (45 cm), instead.

, Necklaces can subtly make your face appear wider, narrower, longer, or shorter depending on the natural shape of your face. As such, different necklace measurements can flatter certain face shapes better than others.


A choker length necklace measuring between 10 and 16 inches (25 and 40 cm) can help soften the sharp angle of the chin on women with heart-shaped faces. This tactic also works well for those who have rectangular and oblong faces.
Women with round faces should avoid short necklaces since these chains tend to make the face appear even rounder. Longer necklaces measuring between 26 and 36 inches (66 and 91 cm) elongate the jawline better.
If you have an oval shaped face, all necklace lengths should be equally flattering.

, Jewelry should complement your attire, and your attire is usually defined by the occasion. The right necklace measurement for a casual blouse may not work well for a formal dinner dress.


As a general rule, longer necklaces should be work with clothes that have a high neck, like a turtleneck sweater. Shorter chains typically work best with formal attire, especially if the chain is short enough to sit well above the neckline of the outfit.
For men, most necklaces should sit at the collarbone when they are worn with an open collar shirt. Necklaces with a pendant or medallion should be a little longer, however.

, Nowadays, many necklaces often come in measurements that far exceed those of a standard chain. For notably long necklaces, you will need to wrap the necklace around your neck two, three, or even four times.


A necklace measuring 28 to 34 inches (71 to 86 cm) hang at or below the bust and are usually wrapped around the neck twice.
Necklaces measuring 40 inches (101 cm) or longer usually land at or below the navel and may need to be wrapped around the neck two to three times.
If a necklace measures 48 inches (122 cm) or longer, it will usually be wrapped around the neck three to four times.

, Under most circumstances, a strand of pearls should not be snug or long. The ideal measurement would allow the necklace to fall just above the collarbone or just below the neckline.


If you want to wear pearls for a less formal occasion, however, notably long strands can still work well. You can get a strand of pearls measuring up to 100 inches (254 cm) long. For long necklaces like this, wrap the strand around your neck three to four times so that the pearls do not extend past your upper abdomen.

, Pendants can affect both the overall length and weight of a necklace. You should take this into consideration when measuring the right length.


Measure the length of the pendant. When the pendant is placed on a chain of known length, the bottom of the pendant--and the necklace overall--will extend down your front by the length of the pendant. In other words, if you have a 2 inch (5 cm) pendant placed on an 18 inch (45 cm) chain, the necklace will land 2 inches (5 cm) below the collarbone.
Notably heavy pendants may pull the chain down even further since the weight of the charm will cause the chain to hang taut around your neck.

, Clasp length is not taken into account when a manufacturer measures the necklace length. While most clasps do not make a dramatic difference in the position of a necklace around your neck, this detail is still worth noting.


A standard clasp size is only 3/4 inch (2 cm), but shorter and longer clasps do exist.

While Bollywood started in India, Bollywood is now incredibly popular in Britain and growing in popularity in the United States. Large US film companies, like Twentieth Century Fox, have begun setting up offices in India.A lot of films are produced by the Bollywood industry.

This can help prep you for a career in Bollywood.Join your school's drama club, if you have one. You can also take any drama or film classes your school offers.
Try out for roles in the school play, especially if your school is putting on a musical. Acting in a musical can teach you how to sing and act simultaneously, which will be vital for your role as a Bollywood singer.

, Outside of school, look for other acting opportunities. Acting, like all forms of art and crafts, requires years of experience. The more experience you have acting, the better your chance of making it professionally.Join a local theater troupe. Many big stars got their start working in local theater.
If there are any plays or musicals being put on by local theater companies, audition. Getting a role, even in a small production, can help you develop your acting skills.

, Even if you're naturally talented, singing requires a certain level of technical skill. If you want to sing professionally, you have to develop a certain amount of expertise regarding singing. Look for a tutor to give your voice lessons. This can help improve your pitch, tone, and delivery.You can browse the yellow pages or look online for tutors in your area. If you know other people who sing, ask them about where they take voice lessons.
If voice lessons are out of your budget, there are free singing tutorials online. While they may not be as good as one-on-one tutoring, you can still learn a bit about the craft of singing from such tutorials.
You also may be able to find a tutor online, if you can't find a tutor in your area. You can use something like Skype to talk to a tutor through your laptop, and he or she can help evaluate your singing and progress.

, Many big singers got their start performing locally. If you want to eventually sing professionally in Bollywood, work on developing a local following. Not only will support help you cope emotionally as you work towards your dreams, you will gain valuable experience performing for an audience.Sign up for local talent shows, fairs, and other events in which people perform.
You can also try hosting your own shows. Try running an open mic night at a local establishment and play your songs during the course of the evening.

, Higher education may be helpful to your Bollywood career. Certain Bollywood stars have gone to college, and many singers and actors study the craft at a university. While college is not necessary to become a Bollywood star, spend some time considering whether it's right for you.You can try getting a degree in something like music, acting, or something else related to the arts. Getting into arts programs can be competitive, so keep this in mind when applying. There is no guarantee you will get into your chosen school.
A degree may help improve your skills. However, it can also be time consuming and costly. Art degrees, especially for private schools, can be incredibly expensive.

, A good way to build yourself up as a singer is making use of the Internet. Websites like YouTube can allow you to upload content of yourself and your singing. Many popular singers got their start with online content, and having a strong online following can really help set you apart during auditions. You can also potentially attract the attention of talent agents.You can create a YouTube account, and also maintain something like a personal website or blog. Upload videos of yourself singing. You can also upload any videos you have of yourself performing at talent shows, open mic nights, and elsewhere.
Try to incorporate your personality into your brand. Having a big personality in addition to talent can help. Try adding your sense of humor to your posts, tweets, and videos. This may help you gain followers.

, Usually, auditions take place in person. As Bollywood is primarily set in India, most of the time films are shot at locations in India.It may be necessary to make a move to India if you're serious about your career. While Bollywood is gaining some following in the United States, it's still primarily centered in India.It can be complicated to move to another country, so make sure you're serious about your career path before doing so. You will need to learn things like the language in India. While English is prevalent, about 30% of the population speaks Hindi, so some classes may be necessary.
Searching for a job after entering the country can be challenging. Salaries can be lower in India than in the United States, so make sure you're willing to live on less money.
You will also need a visa, and regulations for receiving one vary. If you move to India for something like school, a student visa can help. Consider studying at a college in India as a way into the country to pursue your dreams. You may also need to have a job to maintain a visa, so make sure you have work lined up before making the move, or have a solid plan to find work.

, When you feel ready, look for auditions for Bollywood films. You will have to go through several auditions in order to gain a part in a Bollywood film.You can find auditions online on sites like Dubai Auditions. You can also consider getting involved in the industry itself. Taking a small role as a something like a set assistant may help you hear insider tips about upcoming auditions.

, If you end up landing an audition, take some time to prepare. You want to go into the audition ready to impress the directors.Choose a song you know you can sing well under any circumstances. Pick a song you know by heart, have sung many times before, and that gives a sense of your personality.
Know a bit about what you're auditioning for. If you have a script, or a portion of a script, read it carefully prior to the audition.
Rehearse. In the days leading up to the audition, rehearse every day. Solid practice can increase your chance of getting the role.

, When the audition comes, take steps to wow the directors. Go into the room and give it your all. With luck, you'll impress a director enough to gain a role in a musical.Follow any instructions regarding attire. You usually do not need to dress as a character, but pick an outfit that seems appropriate. You should also be sure to bring in any materials asked for in the call for auditions, such as a headshot.
Be friendly when answering questions, and provide answers that showcase your personality. An actor or singer with a lot of personality can sell more tickets.
Take deep breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. You should also drink water prior to the audition, as this can keep your voice from drying out. While a warm drink can be soothing, avoid coffee or anything else that contains caffeine.

, Remember, failure is part of the process. If you truly want to be a Bollywood singer, stick with it. Eventually, you may be cast in a Bollywood film.Most creative people faced setbacks early on in their life. Actors and singers have histories ripe with rejection. Keep this in mind when you face setbacks along the road.

, Being in a creative field is difficult. Support is vital to your success. Make sure to surround yourself with friends and family members that support your dreams.Seek out friends that build you up and not down. Friends who are jealous, or who put you down, are not worth your time.
Stay in touch with positive people. People who encourage you are important to have around as you continue down a creative path.

, It's okay to be upset if you are rejected. In the aftermath of a rejection, practice some basic self care. This will help you heal.Do something nice for yourself. Go for a walk, watch a movie, or relax and read a book.
Remind yourself it is normal to feel bad. However, you have to pick yourself up and continue on the path towards your dreams tomorrow.

, Sometimes, knowing the likelihood of success can help lessen the blow of rejection. Prior to going in for an audition, try to figure out how many people are trying out. If you know your chances of getting cast are unlikely, it'll be easier to take the audition with a grain of salt.Also, if you're relaxed going into the audition, you may do better. This can increase your chance of getting cast.

, There are many reasons why a director may not cast you. There are probably many talented people auditioning for the same role. You also simply may not fit the needs in terms of your specific vocal range or singing style. Rejection is usually not a reflection of your talent or your value as a person."

Say ""Main tumse pyar kartha hoon."",
Practice your pronunciation.,
Listen for ""Mai bhee aap se pyaar karthee hoon.""",How to Say I Love You in Hindi1," Though there are several ways to say ""I love you"" in Hindi, this phrase is one simplest and easiest to learn. As noted above, in Hindi, men and women say ""I love you"" slightly differently. As a general rule, most masculine verbs in Hindi end with ""a"", while most feminine verbs end with ""ee"". Thus, if you're a male, you'll use the masculine verb ""kartha"", rather than the feminine verb ""karthee"" in the phrase above.


Note that this phrase works not just when speaking romantically to a female, but also when expressing your love to a male, like, for instance, a brother, son, friend, etc.;
, If, as a native English speaker, you try to pronounce the phrase above as written, your significant other will probably understand what you're trying to say, but you'll almost certainly mess up some small part of the pronunciation. For the best result, try to pronounce the phrase with proper Hindi pronunciation using the steps below:Pronounce ""main"" as ""may."" In Hindi, when the ""N"" sound comes at the end of a word, it's usually nasal.This means that it's pronounced very lightly — almost imperceptibly — with the nose, so ""main"" becomes almost like ""may.""
Pronounce ""tumse"" as ""thumse,"" with ""thum"" sounding like ""thoom""
Pronounce ""pyar"" like it's spelled.
Pronounce ""kartha"" with a light ""th"" sound. The ""tha"" syllable shouldn't sound quite like the English word ""the."" It's more of a cross between ""the"" and ""dah"".
Pronounce ""hoon"" as ""hoom/n."" The same ""silent n"" rule applies here as in ""main"", but the sound is slightly more pronounced and sounds almost like an ""M"" sound.

, If you've gotten your point across, you may hear your sweetheart say something like this phrase back to you. Congratulations! This means ""I love you too!""


In terms of pronunciation, the beginning of this phrase sounds almost like the word ""maybe."" The next part sounds like ""op-say."" The rest is basically identical to the way that women say ""I love you"" in Hindi — see below.

Locate a small, thin plastic bag.,
Place the hand you want the bangle to go over inside the bag.,
Smooth the bag as flat as possible around your hand.

,
Gently push the bangle onto your hand.

,
As the bangle reaches the hand's widest part (i.e., the line between the base of the thumb and the base of the pinkie), fold your thumb under your hand until it touches the pinkie.,
Continue to push the bangle gently over your hand.,
Once the bangle passes the widest part of your hand, push it up onto your wrist, remove the plastic bag, and enjoy!

,
Finished.

",How to Get Small Bangles Onto Your Wrist," The bag should not be a zipper-type food bag, but should be soft and pliable end to end.;
, The bag should reach up to your wrist.

,,, This will make your hand as narrow as possible.

, If the bangle gets stuck, try twisting it as you push. Do not force it.

Say ""Main tumse pyar karthee hoon."",
Practice your pronunciation.,
Listen for ""Mai bhee aap se pyaar kartha hoon.""",How to Say I Love You in Hindi2," If you're a woman or girl, the way you say ""I love you"" is very similar to (but not exactly the same as) the way a boy or man says it. Use the feminine verb ""karthee"" rather than the masculine one ""kartha."" Other than this change, the rest of the phrase is the same.

, Because the masculine and feminine phrases for ""I love you"" are so similar, you can use the pronunciation guide above to help you for every word except ""karthee."" Here, you'll want to use the same soft ""th"" sound as above, but, obviously, you'll follow it with an ""ee"" sound, rather than an ""ah"" sound.

, Again, if you've said the phrase above correctly and your significant other feels the same way about you as you do about him, you'll probably hear something like this back. As in the section above, this phrase mean ""I love you too"" — it's just using the masculine verb ""kartha"" rather than ""karthee.""

Try using different Hindi words for ""love."",
Use ""aapse"" for your elders.,
Add ""bahut"" to say ""I love you very much."",
Know how to ask someone out.",How to Say I Love You in Hindi3," Like English speakers sometimes use terms like ""adoration, ""affection,"" and so on, Hindi has multiple words that mean ""love"" (or a similar idea). If you'd like, you can change the meaning of your phrase slightly by using different terms for love. Below are just a few Hindi terms you might want to try — substitute these for ""pyar"" in the phrases above:Ishq
Mohabbat
Dholna
Prem
Pyaar

, Hindi, like many other languages (including Spanish), uses different words for formal and casual situations. The phrase for ""I love you"" above is to be used for people you're close and familiar with — people like your significant other, siblings, children, and so on. However, for people who are older than you, authority figures, and people you don't know very well, you'll want to use the formal term ""aapse"" in place of ""tumse"".With this substitution, the formal version of ""I love you"" becomes ""Main aapse pyaar kartha / karthee hoon.""

, If you really want to express your love for someone else, try adding the word ""bahut"" before ""pyar"" in the standard ""I love you"" phrases above. ""Bahut"" is a Hindi word that means ""very much"" or ""so much.""


""Bahut"" isn't pronounced like it's spelled — its pronunciation is closer to ""bout"" with a very light ""H"" sound in between the o and u than it is to ""ba-hoot"".

, If you've got serious feelings for someone but you're not quite ready to make the jump to a full-blown serious relationship, you'll probably want to spend some time dating this person before you tell them you love them. In this case, knowing how to ask someone out in Hindi can make a great first impression. Try using one of the handy phrases below, substituting masculine ""a"" verbs if you're a male and feminine ""ee"" verbs if you're a female:


""Main aap ko khaane par le jaanaa chaahathaa / chaahathee hoon."" (I'd like to take you out for dinner).
""Kyaa ham ek saaTh ghoomane jaayem?"" (Shall we go for a walk together?)
""Kyaa aap mere saaTh baahar jaayenge?"" (Do you want to go out with me?)
""Main aap ke saaTh aur vakth bithaanaa chaahathaa / chaahathee hoon."" (I'd like to spend more time with you.)
Note that, traditionally, Indian dating/courtship is much more structured and formalized than Western dating and may involve some (or all) interactions (including marriage) being arranged by family members. However, in recent years, young Indians and expats have increasingly begun to adopt Western-style attitudes to dating. To be safe and avoid embarrassment, you may want to try to figure out your potential partner's personal ""rules"" for dating before you ask him or her out."

Familiarize yourself with purity standards.,
Determine the right purity for you.,
Consider plated or vermeil gold.,
Pick your color.,
Find a reputable dealer.,
Ask about a warranty.,
Check the markings.,
Have it independently inspected.,
Beware of scams.,
Clean it periodically.,
Store it properly.,
Take it off when bathing.",How to Buy Gold Jewelry," The value of gold is determined by its purity, also known as ‘fineness.' This is measured in karats. The karat measurement divides purity into 24ths. For example, 24 karat gold is 100 percent pure and 12 karat gold is 50 percent pure., While gold is generally more valuable at higher levels of purity, you or the person you are purchasing the jewelry for may prefer less pure gold for practical reasons. 24 karat gold is very soft and highly prone to scratching and damage.Of course, pure gold is also vastly more expensive than alloyed gold.


If you plan on wearing the jewelry on a daily basis, you will probably want it to be no more than 18 karats, i.e. 75 percent pure, to avoid damage.You should also consider how often your jewelry will come into contact with hard surfaces on a regular basis. For example, highly pure gold rings and bracelets are likely to experience damage if worn daily., Plated and vermeil describe methods of dipping other metals into molten gold to create a coating. This jewelry will be cheaper than the purer varieties but also more prone to cracking and wear.


Plating involves dipping a base metal like steel or brass into an electroplating solution with a lump of pure gold. An electric current is applied and the gold will attach itself in a thin layer around the metal. The plating is usually very thin and prone to wear.Vermeil involves the same plating process but specifically refers to jewelry that has a base material of sterling silver. Sterling silvery is often preferred by people that have allergies to precious medals. The plating is usually very thin and prone to wear., Gold typically comes in yellow, pink, and white. There is also a rarer green variety. The pink, white, and green varieties are created by mixing gold with other metals. The non-yellow varieties are usually no more than 18 karats.Yellow gold represents the color of the natural color of the mineral but that doesn’t mean that all yellow gold jewelry is pure. Don’t assume that yellow gold is pure and always check the markings.White gold is created by mixing in palladium or nickel. It resembles silver but has a slightly brighter hue.
Pink or rose gold is created by mixing in copper.
Green gold is created by mixing in silver. Because of the value of both silver and gold, green gold is usually more expensive than other varieties.

, The large national outlets like Nordstroms, Zales, Jared’s, and Sarraf are the most trustworthy in terms of quality but often include significant markups and similar pieces can be found for less at independent dealers.If you do look for an independent dealer, make sure to do your research and make sure they are reputable.


Don’t be afraid to ask a potential jeweler for their credentials and proof of certification.
Pick a jeweler that offers a variety of services such as resizing and custom design.
If it’s a significant purchase, don’t buy at the first store you visit. Look for similar pieces at other stores so you have a price comparison.

, Reputable jewelers typically offer warranties and some kind of return policy. Warranties will add to the cost but may be a good idea for an expensive piece or one that is made of highly pure gold, because of the risk of damage. Make sure to ask about this before your purchase.

, Gold jewelry will have a hallmark signifying that it is real gold and other aspects of the quality. The marking is usually in an inconspicuous place like the inside of a ring or on the ear-facing side of an earring. Ask your jeweler where the hallmarks are if you’re having trouble finding them.


The markings will demonstrate purity in one of two ways. Some will show the number of karats with the letter ‘K’ after it. For example, ‘24K’ means 24 karat pure gold. Some gold pieces will instead have a three digit number that expresses the percentage of purity to the tenth decimal point. For example, 14 karat gold might say ‘585,’ which means that it’s 58.5 percent pure and 8 karat gold might say ‘333,’ which means it’s one-third pure.Beyond the purity, there should also be a marking to indicate the additive metal for impure alloyed gold. ‘GF’ means gold filled, ‘GP’ means gold plated. To express the base metal, ‘Pd’ means Palladium, ‘PT’ or ‘PLAT’ means platinum and ‘SS’ or ‘STEEL’ means stainless steel.There may also be a single or double-digit marking for the ring size if it’s a ring.

, If it’s an exceptionally expensive purchase or if you have any doubts about the quality, you may want to have the jewelry independently verified. Take the jewelry to a different store and pay a certified jeweler to examine and appraise the piece., US laws requires the karat value trademarks which should help you avoid scams.If you are purchasing gold jewelry online, make sure that at least one of the pictures displays the trademarks and ask for one from the seller if they do not.


Research the typical price of your gold piece accounting for the purity. Watch out for gold that is extremely cheap as it may be counterfeit or have false markings., Gold jewelry wears and collect dirt easily so it should be cleaned regularly. If you wear the jewelry every day, clean it at least once every other month. You’ll need two bowls of warm water, dishwashing soap, a lint-free cloth, and a toothbrush.Add a few drops of dishwashing soap to a large bowl filled with warm water. Gently place the jewelry in the water and let it soak for about 15 minutes.
Pick up the jewelry and scrub it with the toothbrush. Pay special attention to the crevices where dirt can collect.
Rinse the jewelry in the water bowl without the soap. Make sure you remove all soap residue.
Gently blot the jewelry dry with a soft, lint-free cloth. Place the jewelry on the cloth and let it air dry for about 20 minutes.

, Gold jewelry easily collects dust, especially pieces with a lot of crevices.If you aren’t wearing the jewelry on a daily basis, keep it in a small jewelry box.


Try to keep it separate from other jewelry pieces that might cause scratching on contact.

, Gold jewelry will collect soap residue and potentially wear from hot water in a shower so make sure to take it off before bathing. Place is in a soft cloth where it won’t be damaged.

Use a soft, dry jewelry cleaning cloth to polish sapphire.,
Fill a small bowl with warm water and dish detergent.,
Place the sapphire in the warm, soapy water and let soak for a few seconds.,
Scrub the rock gently with a damp cloth.,
Rinse the stone and dry it with a soft cloth.",How to Clean Sapphires1," Giving the gemstones an initial polish before using soap and water will remove some of the less stubborn smudges and tarnishes, making the entire cleaning process more effective and efficient., You'll want to make sure that the water temperature ranges from warm to hot and that there is enough water in the bowl so that the sapphires can be completely submerged. Keep in mind that most types of dish soups or cleaning detergents will suffice. However, make sure the soap you're using possesses a degreasing agent., This initial soak will help remove and/or loosen some of the remaining residue on the gemstone. This will also significantly reduce the risk of scratching the sapphire during the scrubbing process.

, After the sapphire has soaked, gently scrub it with a cloth or a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the more resilient smudges and dirt. Most residue should come off relatively easy after the initial soak. You'll want to soak sapphires with more persistent residue or smudges for a longer period of time., After you've removed the sapphire from the bowl, run it under hot water to wash away any of the dirt or excess soap that may have left. Dry the sapphire completely with a dry jewelry or polishing cloth to prevent water stains, which are more prevalent when cleaning with hard water."

Gently scrub the sapphire to remove remaining smudges and residue.,
Make sure sapphire is dried thoroughly before storage.",How to Clean Sapphires2," Combine hot - not warm - water and soap in a small bowl and place sapphires in the bowl to soak anywhere from 10-20 minutes. Soaking the gemstones will help loosen the more persistent dirt or smudges that have built up.The main difference in the two cleaning styles is the amount of time you let the sapphire soak. The dirtier the sapphire, the longer you'll want to let it soak, which is ultimately aimed at reducing the amount of scrubbing you'll have to do.

, Use a soft-bristled toothbrush, make-up brush or jewelry rag to scrub the sapphire. Rinse the sapphire under warm tap water to clear away dirt and then gently scrub away any remaining residue.

, Use a dry jewelry cloth to thoroughly dry the sapphire before storing as to eliminate the possibility of leaving water marks. Store sapphires in a dry place to ensure cleanliness is retained.

Place the watch face down.,
Find the spring bar.,
Detach the spring bar.,
Remove the spring bars from the band.",How to Change a Watch Band1," The first thing to do is remove your watch and place it face down on a folded cloth or towel. Make sure it is on something that will protect the face of your watch and not scratch the glass. Then place this cloth onto a flat surface, such as a table or countertop.;
, Once you have got the watch face down, look closely at the area where the watch band connects to the watch itself. The vast majority of watch bands are connected by a spring bar, which passes through a loop or hole in the band and fits into indents on the shoulders of the watch.The spring bar is a small metal bar that can be depressed at each end, like a spring.
When pressure is released the bar extends at each end.
When fully extended the bar will snap into place in the shoulders or lugs of the watch and hold your strap in place.

, To remove the band you need to detach the spring bar. You can do this with a specific tool, known as a spring bar tool.If you don’t have this tool, you may be able to remove it using a small flat head screwdriver, or something similar. You may also be to remove it without any tools, just by using your hands, but this will be trickier.


If you have a spring bar tool, insert the pronged fork end between the band and where it connects with the watch shoulders. You can press the bar in from either end.
Then gently apply pressure on the tool, pushing lightly away from the watch. This should push the spring bar down and release the band.You can replicate this with another small tool that fits in the same space, but be careful not to scratch your watch or damage the band.
If you don’t have a tool, you can try using a paperclip to compress one end of the spring bar, and then carefully lever out the band., Once you have detached the band from the watch, slide the spring bar out of the loop in the band and put it to one side. Do this for each half of the band. You may need these bars to attach the new band, so it’s important that you don’t lose them."
"
Thread the spring bar through the new band.,
Insert the bottom end of one spring bar into the indent.,
Repeat on the other side.,
Visit a jeweller or watch store.",How to Change a Watch Band2," When you are ready to attach your new watch band, you will basically be going through the same process, but in reverse. Start by carefully threading the spring bars through the loop at the top of each side of the band.


Your new band may have come with its own spring bars, but you need to make sure these fit the watch.

, Take one half of the band, and carefully place the bottom part of the spring bar into the indent in the shoulder, or case lug, of the watch. You are just putting the spring bar back to where it was before you took off the old band.


Once the bottom end of the spring bar is in the hole, carefully apply pressure downwards on the bar so you can slide the top part into the corresponding indent, or hole.
You may find it easier to use your tool to compress the spring bar when you are manoeuvring it., Now you just have to repeat this with the other half of the band. Begin by slipping the bottom part of the spring into the small hole in the case lug, and then press down and slide the top part into the opposite hole.


Listen for a slight clicking sound that indicate the bar is fixed in the place in the hole.
Once both parts of the band are in, check they are securely positioned and your band is not likely to fall off.

, If you are struggling to change the watch band, and it is proving too awkward, just pay quick visit to a local jeweller or watch store. With the right tools and some practice it is quite simple to change the band, so the jeweller will be able to do it very quickly. If you are buying a new band, the jeweller will often offer to change the band for you for free.

Determine what type of fitting it has.,
Detach a band with screws.,
Take out a band with end caps.,
Remove a spring bar band.",How to Change a Watch Band3," If you have a metal watch band, it may be attached with a spring bar and be replaced in much the same way as a leather or fabric band. The first thing to do is examine the point where the band is attached to the watch to determine which fitting it has. Look closely at the lugs at either side of the point where the band meets the watch.


If there are small hole on the outside of the lugs, this means that your band is attached with small screws that pass through the lugs.
If there are no holes, it will be attached with just a spring bar.
Now check to see if there are end caps on the band attached to the watch.
End caps are the parts at the end of some bands that protrude out like wings. If it looks like your band does not have a flat end, it has end caps., If you have determined that your band is attached with small screws through the lugs, you will need a small screwdriver, or another tool to remove and replace the strap. You can use a flat head watchmaker’s screwdriver to remove the screws. This is tricky work and requires a steady hand. Insert the screwdriver into the lug hole until you feel it catch in the screw and then turn it sharply anti-clockwise until the screw is loose.


Once you have removed the screw, try to carefully remove the spring bar piece that it was holding in place.
You may need to poke through the other side of the band to do this, and you may need to remove the screw on the other side of the band first.
Non-magnetic tweezers can be a useful tool to help you do this.
Make sure you store all the piece carefully when you are done., A band with end caps is generally attached to the watch with a spring bar and no screws. To see if your watch has end caps, look at the space between the lugs. If it appears that the band flows into the watch case, and there are no gaps, you probably have end caps. If you are uncertain, turn it over and look from the back. A watch with end caps will have an extra metal piece at the end of the band. This will have two parts protruding out that may look a little like wings, extending either side of the band.To remove the band you need to work to release the spring bar from the lugs in much the same as with other spring bar bands.
With end caps, however, once you release the spring bar, the caps will fall out loose. The spring bar attaches the caps to the band as well as to the watch.Repeat this for each side of the band, and be sure to keep all the pieces safe.

, Metal bands that are flat at the ends, with no end caps, are more straightforward to change. If there are no screws and the band is just connected with a spring bar, you can change it in basically the same way as you would a leather or fabric strap.


Insert whatever spring bar tool you are using into the point where the band is connected to the lugs, and carefully try to get the spring bar free.
Depress the band to expose the spring bar and then try to slide it out of the indents in the lug.
Repeat on both sides of the band, and be sure to keep all the pieces safe and secure."

Install a band with screws.,
Attach a new band with end caps.,
Fix a new spring bar strap.",How to Change a Watch Band4," Make sure the new band fits and is designed to be attached in the same way as the one you have removed. To install a new band, line it up between the lug holes and carefully thread the screw bar piece through one of the lug holes, and down through the hole in the band. Hold it in place and try to keep the bar and band aligned with the lug holes. Then take one screw and carefully position it in one of the lug holes. Turn it clockwise a couple of times.


Then place the second screw in the other lug hole.
Hold the first screw in place with another screwdriver or a screwdriver block.
Then tighten the second screw until it won’t turn any further. Once you reach this point, tighten up the first screw.
You may consider replacing the screws, which can wear out over time., If you are attaching a new band to a watch that has end caps, you will need to ensure your new straps fits the old end caps. Fix the new band to the end caps by first sliding the spring bar into the end caps. Then move it into position between the lugs, pressing the bottom of the spring bar into the lower lug. Depress the spring bar and after some manoeuvring, you should be able to click it into the hole in the top lug.This is very tricky work, and if you are struggling to get it in, pay a quick visit to the jewellers.
Bands with end caps have less regular sizing than flat-ended bands, so it is advisable to check with a watchmaker or jeweller to ensure your new band will fit.

, A new spring bar strap is reasonably straightforward to install. Ensure you have all the pieces together and the band fits the watch. Insert the spring bar into the hole at the end of the band and move it towards the watch. Depress one end of the spring bar and slide it into place between the lugs.


When one end is in the indent, press down and slide the other end into position.
Listen out for the clicks as the bar slides into the holes in the lugs."

Purchase and track the item.",How to Buy Sterling Silver Jewelry," Sterling silver in the U.S. is almost always marked with a small engraving of 925, .925, or 92.5. This is one of the ways to know if it is real sterling silver. Other countries have different standards, so pay attention to the hallmark on any piece of jewelry you buy., If an item is described as “silver-plated,” then it is not sterling silver. That means it is coated in silver for appearance, but the piece itself is often made of nickel, copper, or another metal. This silver coating will eventually wear away., Test all clasps to be sure that they're secure, but not difficult to open. Lay chains flat to check for any kinks or bends in the metal. And make sure earring posts are straight and not easily bent.New sterling silver jewelry should be shiny and show no signs of tarnish. If you're buying used jewelry, tarnish does not necessarily mean it's poor quality. You will simply need to clean it.

, Decide if you want to visit a department store, a dedicated jewelry store, or a resale store. Department stores may offer frequent sales and promotions, but they also regularly mark up their prices higher than independent jewelers.The staff at a jewelry store is also likely to be more knowledgeable about the products. Antique stores, thrift stores, and flea markets are also an option if you’re open to second-hand jewelry.


Seek recommendations from friends or family about where they have purchased sterling silver jewelry in the past. Localized recommendation websites like Yelp can give you good insight into the quality of products and customer service at nearby stores.

, Choose from earrings, necklaces, bracelets, rings, pendants, and more. Search for the hallmark and test all clasps and backings. Use a magnifying glass or jeweler's loop if you want to inspect pieces more carefully.

, The associate should be able to tell you who the designer is, what metals the piece is composed of, and where the hallmark is located. Walk away if the associate refuses to answer a question or seems reluctant to find someone else there who can answer your questions.Don’t be afraid to ask about the store’s return policy. Any reputable jeweler or department store should have one in writing.

, Once you have determined that you are comfortable with the quality and price of a piece, purchase it. Keep any documentation that the associate gives you – receipts, proof of authenticity, or care instructions.

, Online retailers like Amazon and Overstock.com offer a wide selection of jewelry and make it easy to search for what you want. Many brick-and-mortar jewelry or department stores offer all their products for sale online as well. Etsy is another option if you’re looking for something handmade or vintage.


If you’re shopping for a ring, you’ll want to find out your ring size since you won’t be able to try on different sizes before buying.

, There should be a thorough description with measurements of the item and details about the metal composition. There should also be several photos to show you the piece from multiple angles. If you have any questions, contact the seller for more information., The site will either list their return policy within the product details, or there will be a separate page with a more broad return policy for all items on the site. Be sure the site allows you to return the piece if you don’t like it, not just if it’s damaged during shipping.

, If it is an expensive piece, schedule the shipment so that it will arrive while you’re at home to avoid theft. Or have it shipped to your office if your employer allows it. Many sites offer shipment tracking, so watch for tracking updates to see where your item is.

Research the market, to find out what are the most trusted sources.,
Look into customer care.,
Look at the selection.,
If the quality of the replica products checks out then you can focus on the model you want to buy.,
Beware of how they accept payments.,
Examine the warranty.,
After you get your replica watch, don't be selfish.",How to Buy a Replica Watch Without Getting Scammed," How do you do this? You just read the newest comments posted by customers on forums, blogs and other similar websites. Another thing you should understand about replica companies is that everyday countless websites appear just as at the same time a similar number gets shut down. So today's best replica store may very well be tomorrow's biggest scam. This is why you need to conduct your own researches.;
, After you have selected a couple replica websites that seem to be the most trustworthy ones, you need to start testing their customer service. A liable fake watches company must have a responsive customer care department. This means that on the website you should see their business hours, a working phone number, a business email address and a Live Chat button. Test their communication channels and see if anyone answers them, how friendly and professional there are. Do not submit your order until you confirm that all of these work and are answered in a fashionable manner, during their business hours.

, After you are positive that the company is easy to reach and trustworthy, you can check out its collection. This means studying the prices, the products' descriptions and the pictures. These are the best indicators of the quality of their replica watches.


Nothing is cheap, not even replicas. If a fake watch costs way less than the market's average price then, surely, the quality is terrible.
The product description needs to be accurate, detailed and comprehensive. A sloppy, incoherent or incorrect description shows the lack of professionalism and attention towards the expectations that the customers have from these replica watches.
Check the entire collection and make sure that all the pictures are from the same source. You can tell this by seeing if the images have the same background, lightning and clarity. Also, the photos need to have the company's watermark and not some other name. I, know, it sounds strange, but you won't believe how many replica websites have pictures with different names.

, If you already know the model then you can start your comparison. For this you need many high clarity pictures of the original watch, from various angles and showing the most important details and markings. Turn the replica watch upside down, again and again, until you are certain that it is an exact match. If you find huge differences then consider another model or another store.

, Scam stores usually accept only money wires. These payment methods are not secure when ordering a replica watch online. Do not accept to make a money transfer to a company that sells fake watches, no matter how big the discount for this type of payment may be. Always choose to pay by credit card because if you get scammed your bank can claim your money back, but if you pay by money wire then the money is just gone. You can't get it back.

, This is very important. A replica website needs to have both a money back policy and a repairs warranty. Read very well their conditions and make sure that they do not have some absurd rules regarding the return of a fake watch. Also, a repairs warranty must be provided and the minimum extent for this must be 6 months. This way if the watch has any manufacturing defects you can ask the company to fix it and not pay from your own pocket.

, Post your experience online and let others know how the company has treated you and how good the replica watches were. This way others will also know How to Buy a Replica Watch Without Getting Scammed.

Consider gemstone rings.,
Decide the price.,
Know when to wear what.",How to Build a Fashion Ring Collection for Men," Look at your general, day-to-day outfits and determine your style. Building your fashion ring collection depends on how you dress for the day, what suits your style and how you want to accessorize yourself.;
, The second step is to know what kind of ring you want to buy. Can you carry off something chunky and masculine with your daily wardrobe with ease? Are you comfortable with a little dazzle and drama, or do you prefer plain bands with your attire?



Cultural and religious ring - Plain bands with a particular emblem or crest can be added to the list of additions in your jewelry ring collection.

Affiliation ring – This kind of ring denotes association with a membership of a group, the most common example being fraternal or class rings. Some also denote your branch of service like Navy Academy or Merchant Academy.

Biker Ring - Denoting the passion for motorcycling, these rings are as valued as the leather coat. With extra-large, the design of these rings can be skull or crossbones to denote the aggression.

Spinner ring - Available in various designs and styles, these rings come with four-five bands. While the outer metallic layer moves, the inner band stays fixed.

, There are two things to consider when you are deciding on the size of the ring – the band size and the cross-sectional width of the ring.


One of the best ways to determine your ring size is with the help of a jeweler. Jewelry stores have bands in every size. You can try a few on to find your best fit.  If you can’t make it to a jewelry store or prefer online shopping, you can easily purchase a variety of ring sizes to gauge the width of your finger, usually for less than $10.
When it comes to determining the thickness of the ring, it is mostly a personal choice.  The band can be as broad as you want, just ensure that the band width doesn’t keeps your finger joint from flexing.

, Most of men’s jewelry is metallic, so look for metals that match the majority of your wardrobe.


Yellow Gold: Falling in the yellow family of the color wheel, gold has a warmer color tone. Gold fashion rings match well with earthy color ensembles. Dark tones like navy blue or forest green look best when accented with gold fashion rings.
Sterling Silver or Stainless Steel: Sterling silver or stainless steel resembles the color gray. Since gray is a mixture of the neutral colors white and black, the tone is not too flashy and shouldn’t clash sharply with anything in your wardrobe. Black or dark gray clothing and cool summer colors look best with sterling silver or stainless steel jewelry. The neutral color of this metal means nearly anything will match with sterling silver and stainless steel fashion rings.
Copper or bronze: Since the color tone of copper or bronze jewelry is somewhat flashier than gold, these metals work best with casual outfits. A copper fashion ring can add warmth to plain attire.

, When looking beyond a plain band, keep in mind that there is a wide variety of gemstone fashion rings available. From precious stones like diamond, ruby, emerald and tanzanite to semi-precious stones like peridot,  garnet and citrine, fashion rings are judged on the 4C’s – cut, clarity, carat and color. In general, it is best to keep the dazzle of men’s rings to a simple level by sticking with multiple small stones and a single color scheme. This will prevent your men’s fashion ring from looking gaudy.

, After you figure out what look works for your wardrobe, style and taste--is the next step if deciding on your jewelry budget. If you have a tight budget, you may have to reevaluate what style of ring you’re looking for. For more affordable options, check out discount stores or online jewelry auctions.

, After you have built your fashion ring collection, it is always good to know when to wear each piece. If you work in an office, opt for a tasteful ring studded with just one or two gemstones. A dramatic or broader band ring may need to be reserved for date nights or weekend wear. A gemstone ring with the perfect amount of bling can be worn at parties or events. Reserve these special-occasion men’s fashion rings for times when you need the extra glitz. Wearing them every day can reduce their impact and make them less of status symbol.


If you are wearing a watch, count it as an accessory and try to match the ring with its style and color.
The ring you choose should not just match your attire but it should also match your personality.
Try to pick up styles that are sure to run longer when it comes to fashion.

Consider a wrist corsage.,
Choose a magnetized corsage.,
Look into corsage alternatives.",How to Pin a Corsage," Choose the corsage color and type based upon the clothing of the wearer. Some people prefer to coordinate while others want more of a contrast. You can also choose the color and style of the ribbon as well. Think about size too.A good corsage option might be a single white carnation surrounded by some greenery and a red or white thin ribbon.Before you choose a pinned option, you may want to ask the recipient if they have any metal allergies. If so, they may be more comfortable with a wrist-worn corsage.;
, Some corsages come with standard, plain pins included in the package. However, you can also buy pins with black heads or even pearl ones. Just make sure that you buy a high quality pin so that it will not break under the pressure of holding up the corsage., Carefully open the lid and remove the corsage, gently holding it the entire time. Make sure that all of the greenery looks fresh and that the wrapping around the stem is intact. Wait to do this step until you are ready to proceed with pinning, otherwise you could wilt the flower.

, If the wearer has multiple layers on you will need to decide how many to go through to keep the corsage in place. Ask the wearer if they plan to remove the outer layers at any point. If not, pin through as many as you need for stability.For example, a woman may be wearing a shawl that she plans to remove prior to the main event. If so, pull the top layer of fabric aside to clear a space for pinning.

, A corsage is typically placed about 4 inches down from the shoulder on the wearer’s left. The bloom of the flower should face outward and the stem should be vertical. If you choose, you can slightly angle the stem to follow the lines of the outfit.Make sure to take into account any neckties or jewelry as you determine final placement.

, Go ahead and calm yourself before pulling the pin out and attaching it. You will want to have steady hands for these final steps. It is important that you make as few holes as possible, so as to not damage the garment.

, Pull the pin out from the package or remove it from the side of the stem. Place it between your fingers or set it down on a smooth surface nearby until you are ready. Be very careful or you could lose the pin.

, Go to the lower part of one side of the stem and enter the fabric with the pin. You may need to pinch the fabric upwards to make it possible. Don’t push the pin all the way in or you will lose control of it and may poke the wearer.

, Push the pin out of the fabric and over the stem. The pin should be visible across the stem horizontally. It will hold the stem and flower in place through the tension of the pin.Remember that the pin is not intended to pierce the stem of the flower. Instead, it should go over and around it., Once the pin is over the stem, push it into the fabric it is facing. The two pin entry points on either side of the stem should mirror one another. Then, continue to push until the tip of the pin is almost visible on this new side., Wiggle the corsage a little bit to make sure that it is tight enough to hold over the course of the event. Ask the wearer if they can feel the pin at all. If the pin sticks out too far to one side, simply slowly push it a bit in or out of the fabric to adjust.

, The corsage should be straight or at a desired angle. The hold should be firm with the flowers moving very little even as the person walks. Take a look at the corsage from both a front and side view to make sure you are happy with the final result. If not, you can always take out the pin and try again.

, Some larger corsages actually require two pins. You can follow the same steps as outlined above. However, you should aim to have the pins make an “X” over the stem of the flower. Essentially, position one pin and then thread another directly over it in the stem portion., This is a corsage that does not need to be pinned and that will instead hold to the wearer via an expandable strap or ribbon on the back. You normally wear a wrist corsage on your left arm. Some people prefer these corsages as they are less damaging to clothing. However, they can also be a bit bulky and restrict the motion of your arm.You can also use the ribbon strap on the back of the corsage to attach it to a purse or bag.

, You can ask your florist to make your corsage with magnetic links, as opposed to pins. This means that a two-piece magnet set will hold the corsage up. One piece is attached to the corsage and another goes under the piece of clothing to make the connection.Magnetized corsages don’t work as well with heavy fabric as they do best on an even, thin surface. There is also the possibility that the magnet will disengage with heavy movement.

, You might consider a small bouquet, a flower pendant, or a flower bud in the hair as another option. You can discuss these various creations with your florist or you can experiment and try to make something on your own."

Check its appearance.,
Look for the diameter.,
Check the weave.,
Go for the burn test.,
Check the ply and the dimensions.,
Perform the rubbing test.,
Do the pilling test.,
Check if it has anything glued on it.",How to Identify Pure Cashmere Pashmina Shawls," Though sometimes a slight sheen is possible, yet in most cases authentic piece will bear a matte appearance. In case it has a sheen check how much it is. Slight in amount is fine but if it a whole lot of it, you didn’t pick the right fabric!;
, This is one of the best ones. In some markets, it has been made essential. In fact, an authentic manufacturer will surely mention it and if it isn’t mentioning then it isn't authentic. It is that simple. So, how much should it be? The best grade ones are available for 14-15.5 microns. Don’t buy anything above 19 microns for better quality. The lower is the micron count the lighter and softer will be the product.

, A pure cashmere pashmina shawl will always be woven on a handloom. As a result, it will have an irregular weave. Hold the shawl against light and the irregularities will easily show.

, This is a tough one, as you’d not like to spoil your shawl but you can always pick one thread out of the fringes, it won’t harm the material nor will ruin the design and at the same time you’ll be able to conduct the purity test. Now you’ll simply have to place the fabric piece on some ceramic or steel pot without covering it with lid, you can also use a microwave safe plate for the purpose. Once you have placed the fabric piece on the plate, simply light a match and let it burn. You’ll have to see it burn and smell the odor as well as check the ashes with your finger tips. If you get a burnt-hair kind of odor and the ash turns out to be a powdery material, it is more likely to be pure. But in case it smells the way burnt leaves would do and there are bigger flames consuming it up, oops you’ve been cheated, it is viscose. Again, if it gives a vinegary odor or smell like burning plastic, with the ashes forming small lump, it too is the wrong stuff. It can be acrylic or polyester.

, Dimensions are really important. The higher are the dimensions the heftier will be the price. If anybody tries to sell bigger dimensions at cheaper price, you are surely being cheated. For shawls, standard dimension of thirty-six by eighty inches is followed. Wondering what is ply? Well, it is the strand of the fabric woven together. When multiple strands are used, you need to check the ply. 2-ply uses 2 strands, 3-ply uses 3 strands and so on. It is something that makes the clothing thicker. For shawls, stoles, and scarves they always keep it lower.

, This is the easiest possible test to check the authenticity of the clothing. You’ll simply have to rub the stuff and you’ll know if it is pure or not. But you need to know the logic behind it to know how it works. Acrylic or polyester fabrics accumulate static electricity within them. So, when you rub them, they give out spark. You can even see it in the dark and it is quite audible. And clothing with plastic material used in the making will use up the same static electricity in attracting hair or dust or some kind of tiny particle. When you’ll rub your garment it will show what it is. If it is acrylic or polyester, you’ll hear the spark and if it is plastic, it will attract tiny objects.

, This is again an easiest possible thing to do. All you’ll have to do is see if there is some pilling taking place with the product. If a product is offering 100% fabric you’re going to find a lot of pilling on it after you bring it to use, this is a natural characteristic of the fabric but if there is no pilling at all, you've bought a fake product.

, Only a fake material will come with some kind of label or tag glued on it because it is not possible otherwise. You can never stick a thing on real cashmere. Glue won’t stand on it for long.

But don't forget to look at other kinds of magazines. Lifestyle, celebrity, and even home magazines may show handbags that catch your eye.


You don't have to limit yourself to the most recent magazines. In fact, older magazines may have classic styles that may become popular again.;
, If you want a chance to get some ideas in person, go to antique malls or estate sales. There's no telling what you may find, but you'll be exposed to vintage and classic styles.


You may even purchase a vintage handbag to alter and improve to your own tastes.

, If you've been having trouble locating a bag you like and you happen to see someone with a bag that catches your eye, ask where she got it. There's a small chance that you could also purchase one, but if not, you'll at least have another place to look.

, Ask family members if they have any old handbags that they no longer want. You may find something you like, or could at least alter to fit your style.

, If you tend to carry around a lot, you'll need a larger purse. If you simply want to have a few things on hand, choose a smaller option. You should also make sure that the size of the handbag works with your personal style. For example, if you're a petite person, an enormous handbag will emphasize your small frame., If you know you want a larger bag, think about a duffle, hobo, or bucket shape. If you want a smaller bag, consider a clutch, envelop, or wristlet. If you're unsure what kind of handbag you like, go to a store and carry several different styles till you find one you like., Not all handbags work in all circumstances. If you're going to a swanky formal event, you won't want to carry a messenger bag. And you probably wouldn't carry a rhinestone studded clutch with you to class or the grocery store. The handbag needs to match the situation.

, The fabric you choose will be one of the biggest indicators of your handbag's cost. You could choose from a variety of leathers (the more exotic being more expensive and difficult to find). Leather is long-lasting, can feature patterns, and can be dyed. Canvas is also commonly used in larger bags. Silk and velvet are rarer options.


If you plan on sewing your own bag, test the fabric you chose. Sew a few scraps together to make sure your machine can handle it and to see if the fabric holds together well., Choose blacks and browns if you're looking for a safe, classic color that works with just about anything. Metallic colors can give your bag an edgy modern look. Bright bold colors make eye-catching handbags, especially if your wardrobe is pretty neutral., You'll need to decide what kind of a handle you want. Do you want one long metal chain, two smaller rigid handles made from the same material as the bag, or no handles? You'll also need to decide if and where you want zippers or other closures.


Apply studs, tassels, beading, or sequins to add a little extra emphasis to your handbag.

, If you have experience with sewing, take your sketch and create a detailed pattern. Use your pattern to cut out fabric and assemble your handbag using a sewing machine. Apply any embellishments by hand, if necessary.

, If you're not confident in your sewing skills or just want to make sure you end up with a professional look, find someone to create your handbag. Check for local people skilled in leather work or sewing bags.


If you can't find someone in your area, look online. Many companies will work with you to create a bag based off your own design.

Do not put them in the washing machine! They need to be hand-washed, gently.;
, Wet both sides and the inside of the bag with water. Be careful when handling the bag, make sure it is as flat as possible. Minimize creasing and rubbing it on itself while wet because this will cause bubbling., Keep the material as flat as you can while you soap the inside of the bag, don’t forget the inside pocket. Use the brush to gently remove dirt and grime., Gently brush the material to loosen any dirt, making sure the material is still laying as flat as possible. Gently brush until you’re satisfied that you’ve removed as much dirt as you can. Do this to the other side of the bag and the bottom part, too. Make sure not to crease the material., Generally, the leather is not that dirty and don't need anything more than a quick pass. Try not to get the leather too soaked., Be gentle when handling the bag, avoid crumpling it or causing any creases! Rinse the inside, rinse the pocket, rinse the outside, rinse the leathers — make sure all soap has been rinsed off. Again, please do not crumple the bag or rinse it inside a pail. Just rinse it as best as you can while keeping the material as flat as possible. A hose type shower head is recommended., The back of a plastic chair is best for this. Put the Longchamp Le Pliage upside down over the back of a clean monobloc chair and let the water drip down. The bag’s zipper is open and the back of the chair is “inside” the bag. Let it dry like this for a day or longer., Don’t clip any part of the bag! Just let it hang on a hanger with the zipper open.

Choose a plain hoodie in a dark, neutral color.,
Select a hoodie made of quality fabric.,
Opt for fitted hoodies.",How to Be Stylish in a Hoodie1," Hoodies are typically considered to be casual garments, but an easy way to instantly dress them up and add some style is by choosing a dark color like black or dark gray. Dark, plain colors will automatically upgrade the hoodie’s appearance and create a sleeker look. If you pair it with dark denim and basic trainers, you can look both polished and casual.Try pairing a dark gray hoodie with black skinny jeans.
If you find a plain black hoodie to be a bit boring, opt for a dark rich color like maroon or navy.;
, Hoodies have a reputation for unstylishness for a few reasons, and one of the major ones is because of the sweatshirt material classic hoodies are made of. There’s certainly nothing wrong with this style of hoodie, but if you want it to look fashionable, step things up with a high quality material. Look for hoodies made of high-end materials like pure cotton jersey, brushed cotton and fleece.If you have the extra money to spend, consider a hoodie made of a cashmere-silk blend.

, If you want your hoodie to look polished, avoid oversized and ill-fitting versions that bunch up around the stomach area. These will create the illusion of a paunch and look sloppy in general. Look for hoodies that have a slim fit to create a sleek, fashionable silhouette.If possible, try a hoodie on before you make a purchase to make sure it fits the way you want it to, especially if you are spending extra money on a high-end fabric.

Pair it with a dress or skirt.,
Wear a zip-up hoodie under a black leather biker jacket.,
Wear it with skinny jeans or dress trousers.",How to Be Stylish in a Hoodie2," A popular look is the combination of the casual hoodie with something a little fancier, like a dress or miniskirt. The contrast creates an edgy vibe that trendsetters lean toward. Try wearing a zip-up fleece hoodie with a long flowing dress with a girly print, such as a floral. To up the contrast even more, add a pair of combat boots.You can also try it with a short, flouncy cocktail dress or lace skirt., Hoodies make great outerwear all by themselves, but they can look more stylish (and keep you even warmer) if you wear one under a nice jacket. Try wearing a black hoodie underneath a black leather jacket. Make sure you pull out the hood, so that it’s visible and hangs down in the back, on top of the jacket. If black leather isn’t your style, try wearing a gray hoodie under a denim jacket. It’s important that you still pull out the hood so that it’s visible, though.

, This is another trendy style that uses contrast to make a statement. Opt for a slim-fit hoodie, and pair it with skinny jeans or pants that are structured to have a well-tailored look, such as dress trousers. You can even make a slim-fit black hoodie work at the office if you wear it with a pair of nice dress slacks in a neutral color, like gray.


The hoodie gives your overall look an athletic-wear vibe while still creating a sleek silhouette that looks dressy enough to be considered business casual."

Pair it with sleek shoes.,
Wear it with statement sunglasses.,
Try it with a knit cap or beanie.",How to Be Stylish in a Hoodie3," For many, athletic shoes or trainers are the default choice when wearing a hoodie. This can look great, but if you want to create a particularly stylish vibe, wear it with a nice pair of shoes, like black boots, pointy-toed dress shoes or red leather booties. This particular contrast can look very polished. Be sure you stick with a streamlined hoodie that fits snugly to keep your overall silhouette looking sleek.You can even opt for a pair of statement shoes, like patent leather combat boots in a shiny blue color. Experiment with any classic dressy shoe in an eye-catching hue.

, An awesome pair of sunglasses can instantly make almost anything look cooler, and that includes a hoodie. Try a pair of high-end dark black cat eye sunglasses, or an oversized pair with round mirrored lenses in a fun color, like bright orange.If you have the money to spend, go for a nice pair of designer sunglasses to really amp up the style. However, you can create the same effect with a pair of more affordable sunglasses with a trendy frame.

, This will keep your head warm during the cold winter months while also creating a cool, street-style inspired vibe. Look for a fisherman style beanie hat in a dark neutral color, like dark gray or black. You can match it to your hoodie, or create a trendy contrast by wearing it with a hoodie in a completely different color. Keep the rest of your outfit simple to complete this look.You could also try wearing a plain hoodie with a striped knit cap or beanie to create a different kind of contrast.

If you're unsure what constitutes a fashionable style, spend some time learning about fashion itself. You can do this by seeking out advice from friends and evaluating your own personality.


If you're unfamiliar with fashion, reading up on the latest styles might not be helpful. You may have difficulty understanding language and terminology. Instead of reading, ask a fashionable friend to take you on a shopping trip. Allow him or her to help you pick fashionable outfits that flatter your body type.Good fashion sense starts with your personality. Ideally, your choice in fashion should express something about you as a person. Try jotting down a list of personality traits and passions you would like to see conveyed by your wardrobe.Try to pay attention to the design of clothing you try on and buy in stores. Who is the designer? What is his or her reputation in the fashion world? Why did he or she put a pocket on a particular place in a coat or pair of jeans? Why use two kinds of fabric instead of one? Try to do some research regarding these questions when you get home. Google the designer and read up on his or her artistic and professional goals.;
, If you want to be more fashionable, one great way to stay up-to-date on the latest trends and styles is to follow a variety of fashion blogs. These websites can give you inspiration on how to become more fashionable.


Bookmark at least 3 fashion blogs or websites.

Follow Instagram bloggers whose style you admire. You can also try searching hashtags like #ootd (outfit of the day) for inspiration for new styles.

, Trends come and go, but certain items will always be fashionable. Stock up on the basics and, from there, mix and match with accessories and other clothing items.


If you're a female, a little black dress will always be in style. Look for a basic black dress that is flattering on your body type. A knee-length black skirt is also a consistently fashionable option for women.A black blazer, black trousers or dress pants, dark denim jeans, and a white button-down shirt are items that are always fashionable on both men and women. You can mix and match these with a variety of different clothing items to create many outfits.A beige trench coat is a great look for winter and fall for both men and women. Cardigans are also nice for the colder months. Try to have both a white and black cardigan so you can match it with a variety of outfits.For accessories, a pair of black pumps and a black leather bag are great options for women. They are consistently considered fashionable and will go with a variety of outfits.Pears and diamond studs are good, traditional jewelry options and tend to go with a lot of different outfits., Fashion is highly versatile. At any given moments, a variety of different types of style are in season. Choose styles that you feel comfortable in and that match your personal taste.


It's important to be fashionable in a way that speaks to you. If you prefer a more minimalist style, choose items that go with that theme. If you prefer more vibrant, patterned clothing items, choose fashionable items in that theme.
You'll also notice your clothing items will start to blend together if you let your tastes dictate your style. Your clothing and accessory choices will be linked by your personal taste. If you choose a shirt that doesn't seem to go with anything, chances are you'll eventually buy a set of pants in the same style., Before making any new purchases, review what you have. You may be able to create new outfits using a combination of new and old items. You should also throw away or donate items you're unlikely to wear again as they're needlessly taking up closet space.


What do you have and what do you lack? What fits your vision of your new, fashionable style? If you have a variety of cardigans, but no cute blouses or shirts to go under them, then focus on buying tops when you go shopping. Do you have a lot of casual pants but no dress pants or form-fitting pants? Place focus on buying trendier jeans and dress pants when you go out shopping.Pay attention to the condition of current clothing choices. Clothing with holes or that is stretched out is not fashionable. Considering tossing anything that's damaged beyond repair.Try on clothing you haven't worn for awhile. As bodies change over time, you may find some of your clothes are too big or too small. Donate anything that no longer fits.You should also consider getting rid of clothing items that no longer fit. If you have clothing you used to wear to clubs, for example, and are no longer much of a partier than maybe it's time to get rid of these items., While it makes sense to shop in stores as you can try outfits on, you may be able to get away with buying some items online. If you know your size fairly well, you may find great deals online. However, if you're unsure of your size you may want to go into a store. Returning an item you bought online can get expensive. You can also buy accessories, like purses and sunglasses, online for cheaper prices., Trends do tend to fade out quickly. However, it can be fun to follow some trends that you have genuine interest in. Choose trends that you feel work with your personal style. As trends fade quickly, don't overspend on trendy items as they do not need to withstand longterm use.


It can be fun to follow some trends, but keep in mind they tend to fade out quickly. If you feel personally drawn to a particular trend, follow it if you want. For example, if leggings look great on you feel free to buy a pair. However, don't spend a ton of money on a pair of leggings as they're likely to become less fashionable with time. Instead, go for a cheaper pair. While they'll likely wear down quicker, chances are this particular fashion item won't be a timeless addition to a fashionable wardrobe.Instead, spend more money on items, like the ones listed above, that have been consistently fashionable for years. You can incorporate these items into your existing wardrobe as trends change for years to come.Follow trends you can easily incorporate into your current wardrobe. If pale pink is one of the colors of the season and you have mostly red accessories, you might want to sit this one out. If another, more neutral shade, is also in style invest in a pair of pants or a vest in that color over pink., Classic accessories can help your wardrobe stand out. Invest in nice accessories to compliment our clothing choices.


Nice scarves, jewelry, watches, sunglasses, and other accessories can help your wardrobe shine. Look for clearance sales on accessories in your favorite stores., Having a nice scent associated with your presence can make you appear more fashionable. Try to develop a classy scent using perfume or scented lotion.


For men, choose a cologne that you use consistently. Look for a fragrance that blends with your natural odor. You can also combine or layer products to create a unique scent.Make sure you don't use too much cologne, however, as this can be off-putting.
For women, scented lotion, perfume, shampoo, and conditioner all carry distinct scents. Choose a brand that is pleasant but not overpowering. Too much perfume or scent can be irritating to others.

, Your grooming habits can also help you become more fashionable. Focus on your hair, shaving habits, and make-up.


If you're a man, shave on a regular basis. Keep your hair trimmed and brushed.
If you're female, neutral make-up is sometimes more flattering that dramatic colors. Stick to tones that match your skin. If you paint your nails, do so carefully. Make sure you avoid smearing the polish and redo the nails as needed when you notice the color fading or chipping., Being fashionable goes beyond clothing and make-up. You should also strive to create a fun and fashionable home environment.


Line drawers in your home with scented, patterned paper. This can be a fun way to make your home cute and fashionable.If you work in an office, consider bringing in personal business cards and pens. This can be a fun way to add flare to your personal style., A fun way to live a fashionable lifestyle is attending fashion exhibits. Watch for fashion related exhibits at local art galleries. Make a day trip to a big city if a big fashion exhibit is coming into town. This can help you stay up-to-date on trends while having a sense of the history behind fashion., Instead of using store bought cards or e-cards, invest in a personal stationary. Send people handwritten notes for birthdays and holidays. This can be a fun way to be fashionable and help the people around you feel valued., See a barber or hairdresser on a regular basis to work on your personal style. A nice hair style can help you stay fashion forward.


For men, a reliable barber can help you work on your personal style. He or she can choose a haircut that's flattering for your facial features. A barber can also give you advice on hair products to use.For women, going to a hair salon once every couple of months can help you maintain a flattering hairstyle. Talk to your stylist and what cuts and styles would look best on you. Ask him or her about what products to use as well.

, Having a tailor you trust can help you stay fashionable. You can have clothing items altered or repaired to fit your style and taste. It may be somewhat pricey, but if you're paying for tailor service on high-quality items they'll end up lasting you a long time., High quality clothing should be washed with some care. Proper laundering can help your clothes last longer.


Separate clothing items before washing based on color, especially dark colored cloth. For example, reds should be washed separately from blues.Wear clothes a few times before washing them. This helps maintain color and shape. Allow expensive items to air dry after washing. It's a good idea to invest in a drying rack.If you notice stains in clothing, work on blotting them out rather than rubbing. This will stop the stains from spreading."

Lay out the clothing you intend to pack in the garment bag.,
Set a budget.,
Decide whether the garment bag will be your only piece of carry-on luggage, or whether you'll use it as supplementary luggage.,
Check the bag's hanger capacity.,
Consider the bag's size.,
Evaluate the bag's carry mechanism.,
Consider what the bag is made of.",How to Buy a Garment Bag," This narrows down your shopping considerably because if your clothes just won't fit in a given bag, there's no point in even considering the purchase.


Pare your packing list down to the bare essentials by eliminating any major wardrobe piece that doesn't go with at least three other pieces you've packed.;
, As mentioned above, there's no point in even considering a garment bag if it's simply out of your reach.


Any decent bag should last for years of regular use. If you're going to be stuck with anything for that long, you might as well pay enough to get something that works well--so invest as much as you reasonably can in a good garment bag. To a certain point, you get what you pay for.

,


If you're only using the garment bag to transport a few delicate options, consider a literal garment bag that folds into your primary suitcase. The bag protects the few garments you place in it, but you don't have to deal with the inconvenience of hauling a separate piece of luggage just for those garments.
If the garment bag will be your only piece of luggage, look for one that has small interior or exterior pockets for storing toiletries and other sundries.

, If you can't efficiently store your clothes on the allowed number of hangers, you need a larger bag.


Also take note of how the garment bag secures hangers. Ideally, the hangers should clamp or strap in place; there's nothing worse than losing a hanger and the garment on it down the middle of your carefully packed bag.

,


Every airline has specific regulations about how large and heavy a bag can be carried on the plane. Regulations may vary between domestic and international flights on the same airline. As a general rule, your garment bag must be able to stow securely under the seat in front of you or in an overhead bin if you carry it on.

,


Possible options include: a stand-alone wheeled garment bag, a shoulder strap or hand-carry garment bag, or a garment bag that ""piggy backs"" atop another piece of wheeled luggage.
Try the bag out before you buy it. Slip it over your shoulder and stroll around the store, or take a wheeled bag for a roll. The shoulder strap should ride comfortably without slipping off, and wheeled bags should roll smoothly over both carpet and hard surfaces.
Some garment bags fold two or three times; take time to fiddle with the folding mechanism and make sure it won't become a frustrating hindrance on the road. The bag should have sturdy zippers and clasps, too.

, This is, to a large degree, based purely on personal preference. Leather is extremely durable but also tends to be expensive, and may be objectionable to vegans or vegetarians. Nylon and vinyl are also common manufacturing materials.

If you don't have too many accessories, pick out a store where you think you can get good prices.,
Figure out the number of accessories you might want to buy.,
Get some new shoes if you can afford them.,
Buy a nice belt to spice up plain jeans or slacks.,
A nice bag can be another great asset to your ensemble.,
Try on some jewelry.,
A cap or hat can provide you with a signature look or just a way to draw attention to your outfit.",How to Buy Accessories for an Outfit," Department store outlets, for example, are always good for a bargain, and you can usually find a pretty good deal in a vintage or secondhand shop.;
, You should also factor in your budget (see step 1) and plan accordingly. Accessories can add up quickly, even if you only intend on getting a few of them. You might not be able to purchase everything you want in a single excursion, so decide what you really need and what you can do without until you've saved up some more money. Here are a few ideas as to what you should buy if you're trying to focus on accessories:

, Shoes are the ultimate accessory--a single pair can be worn with a huge variety of outfits, and they can add excellent flair to an outfit that would otherwise be pretty blah.


If you like flat, comfy shoes, either buy some simple flats or a cute pair of boots.
If you prefer heels, think about what kind of heels you will be able to walk in and select a pair. Black and nude are the most adaptable colors for heels, especially if you often wear tights or pantyhose with them. However, in that case you should also remember to only get close-toed heels, since open-toed will reveal your nylon-covered feet.

, Try on a couple to find a good one for you. Black, brown, and gray belts are easy to match, but if you're feeling extravagant you might want a more brightly colored or boldly patterned one.

, If you can afford it, get more than one! A plain leather bag is perfect for everyday use, while a more shiny or sparkly clutch might be more suitable for a night out.


If you have an outfit in mind, try to choose a bag that will compliment your outfit.
If you're a fashion-forward person, never buy a knockoff purse.

, Glittery earrings, a beaded necklace, or a chunky ring--whatever you think reflects your personality. For example, if you are confident and have daring taste in clothing, big jewelry will work well on you. If you're girly and a bit shy, try pearls, lockets, and smaller earrings.

, There are lots of different styles and looks to go for; again, make sure to pick one that suits you.


Don't be afraid to try your hat on before buying it! Look in a mirror or ask a friend for advice about what looks good on you.
In addition to being a solid accessory a hat can also be used to cover up bad hair days.

Work on your teeth.,
Take care of your hair.,
Watch your weight.,
Take good care of your skin.,
Don't overdo the make-up.,
Wear what clothes fit you.",How to Be Attractive in the Fashion World," If you're lucky enough to be blessed with perfect teeth, skip this part. if not, use it. First, sort out any issues you may have with them. Visit your orthodontist, and see if you can get braces. If you can afford the invisible ones, get them. if not, you'll have to stick it out. Wear the braces. After your teeth are perfectly straight, get them whitened. This also can get expensive, but is worth it. Be vigorous with brushing and flossing.;
, No matter how good you think your hair is, it could always be better. Visit a good hairdresser (not one that is unprofessional or cheap). If it's short, let it grow but get it trimmed every six weeks. Wash it every day if it's oily, or every two days if it's not. Don't use products yet. if it's long and thin, or too frizzy, have it all cut off. This will be painful. Let it grow and again, look after it. When it's the right length, have your colours and highlights done and it cut to suit your face. Look after it even MORE thoroughly now. Just don't overload it with product. Use a light hairspray after styling it.

, Don't starve yourself, but aim to be slim and healthy. Eat LOTS of fruit and vegetables, drink loads of water, and cut down on carbs and fat. Visit the gym at least 3 times a week. Do cardio work, and lift some weights to get toned. Females shouldn't worry about bulking up - they don't have enough testosterone to obtain extremely big muscles.

, Take off all your make-up EVERY night without fail. Cleanse, tone and moisturise every morning and night. Once a week, you should steam your face, exfoliate, and do a face mask. Skin and hair are the most important features of your look.

, Have a happy medium. Don't pile it on, but try not to go bare-faced in public. Wear a well-applied foundation that reflects light and is the right shade, concealer over dark circles and blemishes, if you're the retro type, maybe an elegant flick of black liquid eyeliner on your top lid, otherwise just a light taupe shimmer eyeshadow and some grey eyeliner on your bottom lid. Well-applied non-clumpy black mascara, a blusher that defines your cheekbones and a light neutral lipstick(or retro girls, red lipstick is the best). Re-apply this throughout the day and watch YouTube tutorials to apply it WELL.

, There is no set uniform, though generally glossy fashion types (which is what this article is about) don't go too out of the ordinary. Always the highest stilettos Manolo has to offer, tight leggings or skinny jeans, or maybe a pencil skirt, or one of those Peter Pilotto print dresses or skirts. The choices are endless. Just keep in mind that this is a mature look, and fashion glossies don't do emo, scene, Barbie, or any of those other cliques. Another thing- have an amazing handbag. Expensive. You can get away with cheaper items of clothing as long as you spent a fortune on your shoes AND bag. Accessorize tastefully, and maybe add a Starbucks to-go cup. You're done!

Look for the perfect cut.,
Remember, for a Classic look, colour will be your main medium.,
Experiment with prints; they can be beautiful paired with minimalist pieces.,
Always remember the first rule of Classic Style: the quality of your material is paramount.,
Use drama as your weapon.,
Use accessories to enhance beauty.,
Use your shoes and handbag to pull your outfit together.,
Do not sacrifice comfort.",How to Be the Most Captivating Classic Dresser," The Perfect cut equals the Perfect Outfit. Above all, cut is the most vital element of your look. If possible, imitate the French women and have all your staple items tailored. If you cannot afford tailoring, be ruthless when shopping. Only purchase pieces that fit you perfectly--belts that hug your hips, fitted waistlines and shoulders. Keep in mind that the most beautiful silhouette is clean, simple with graceful lines.;
, Seek out pure shades rather than ""in-between"" tones. Black is always lovely and white, navy, charcoal and true red are other desirable shades. If these colours do not attract you, do not be afraid to experiment with less conventional tones. However, be sure that your choice does not detract or distract from the innate beauty of the garment; the grace of its lines, the perfection of its design.

, However, exercise caution as prints can also be distracting. Choose a print that is neither too ""loud"" or too ""busy"". Tasteful, original floral designs are lovely as are bold, geometric patterns. Let your instincts guide you but remember: the simpler, the better.

, Do not settle for any inferior fabrics as the simplicity of classic clothes will certainly make this obvious. The beauty of a garment lies very much in the beauty of the materials used. Consider the different ""characters"" of various materials, how they look in different lights. A little black dress in wool has an immensely different feel to a little black dress in lace. The following are examples of ""Classic"" fabrics; silk, cashmere, good quality wool, lace, cotton, chiffon, corduroy. Fur is the best choice if you are looking to add a touch of luxury. If you are conscientious about wearing real fur, be sure to purchase a high quality faux substitute.

, While it is true that cut and material create a beautiful outfit, it is drama that captures and intrigues. Wear your classic items with irony: defy some traditional proportion (wear a trench coat over a short dress), wear an unexpected colour, add a taste of tackiness with patent leather or fake jewelry. Above all, allow a fascinating glimmer of your soul to shine through. Always be sure, however, to consider all your choices in the light of good taste and make beauty a priority.

, Choose tasteful jewelry and keep your accessories to bare necessity. Avoid gaudy, bright designs unless you are making a statement. The most beautiful jewelry is simple, often traditional and architectural. Fresh flowers are also very attractive especially when pinned in the hair on on the lapel.

, Shoes must be elegant in shape, simple and tasteful. Steer away from shoes that are gaudy, highly decorated or overtly unconventional. Look instead for small details of heel shape, stitching, colour and material. Likewise, bags should be simple in design, monochromatic and embellished with little hardware.

, Be sure that you are comfortable in the unique fit of your clothes and the reaction of the fabrics with your body. Study how your outfits moves with your moving body--is the effect graceful?

Get the hair.,
Care for your skin.,

Take care of your body.,
Dress well.,
Make changes to your life.,
Remember it's okay to be true to you.",How to Be Inspired by Kendall Jenner," Kendall has long, shiny dark brown hair. To achieve this look, either grow your hair out or get extensions. To make your hair shiny, wash it every other day, eat right, drink lots of water, use a shine-enhancing shampoo and conditioner, and use a shine spray after styling your hair. Part your hair in the middle and make loose waves by either braiding your hair loosely overnight and brushing it out, or by using a curling wand.


If you choose to use heat to style your hair, use a heat protectant on your hair so that your hair doesn't become damaged by your styling tools.
Non-brunettes may want to dye their hair; however, this isn't necessary.;
, Wash your face, and if you have acne, try a cleanser meant to remove or treat acne. Use skin moisturizer day and night.

, Start with a foundation; try a BB, CC or DD cream that matches your skin tone. Use a concealer for any imperfections, and then apply powder. Kendall's look is usually thin eyeliner, eyelashes, brows, and a nude lip, so consider doing the following:


Apply a bronzer to the hollows of your cheeks, nose, and corners of the forehead.
Apply highlighter to the high points of your face.
If applying eyeshadow, first, use gold eyeshadow as a wash to your lids. Next, use a taupe eyeshadow in your crease and outer corners. To finish, use a vanilla eyeshadow and apply it to your brow bone and inner corners.
If applying eyeliner, use a gold eye pencil and line your waterline with that. Then, thinly line your upper lash line with a black liquid liner. After that, tightline with a dark brown pencil.
Curl your lashes and apply three coats of black mascara to your top and bottom lashes.
Fill in your eyebrows with a brown pencil or shadow and shape them with a brow brush.
Apply a nude lipstick with a peachy undertone, and, if you want, apply a lip gloss over it.

, No one can look exactly like Kendall, but there are a bunch of foods and daily things you can do to make your body look similar to her build. Try eating lots of fruits and vegetables daily, either with a meal or for a snack. Sit-ups are good for toning up your stomach.

, Kendall is very edgy and grungy in the fashion department! Hats, skinny jeans, jackets, dresses, skirts, blazers, shorts, sunglasses and other fashion pieces are a big statement with Kendall. She's always wearing something classy, but edgy and different. You can find inspiration from little pieces in your closet, or just Google some pictures of her and save them on your computer for inspiration. She is mostly seen in black or dark colors at night and blushes, whites, and pinks during the day. She's not big on accessories, so don't wear too much jewelry.


Kendall often wears heels, which are also a good way to make you look taller.

, Okay, so not everyone can have the life of a Jenner or a Kardashian - but you can always try to. Kendall spends a lot of time with her family and friends, and is spontaneous, doing many adventurous things. Spend some time with your friends and try your best to to go on little adventures, whether it's going by the lake and jumping in, or having a water balloon fight.


Honor your family. If you have siblings, hang out with them and try to appreciate them.

, Take inspiration from Kendall's everyday style and life, and apply it to yours, but don't try to be her. Be the best you that you can be, and love yourself the way you are. Everybody has flaws, even Kendall, and no one's perfect. Always remember that no matter who you are, you're beautiful.

Start looking at the world as your canvas and create, whether it be by styling different clothing garments together, or sketching ideas of clothing garments you'd like to recreate or find in a store.


Keep your eyes open for fashion. Fashionistas may be equally influenced by Gucci as by music, fine art, or poetry. Think about fashion as an art form, if you want to be real fashionista.;
, Watch what celebs and designers are wearing, and try to recreate those looks into your daily outfits as a fashionista. Try not to copy the looks exactly, but try to put your spin on things.


Knowing what’s coming will really help you out in getting the goods before stores realize they can charge you twice as much as it is worth.
Look for things you've never seen before, and wouldn't necessarily buy at first. When you see what's coming into new stores that you find strange, it might mean that this is the next big thing.

, On your personal Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram pages, follow as many style and fashion icons as possible. This way, you can get instant fashion updates at your fingertips. Search popular fashion hashtags and regularly go digging for new and surprising style inspirations online.


Pinterest and Wanelo are great fashion-forward social networking pages that can help connect you with the fashion world. Start a profile and start saving things you like until you begin to develop a style you like that is all your own. Check out the ""recommended"" clothes that are near the things you save.
In Wanelo, you can go to the ""Magic"" section which provides things they think you'll like based on your recent saves.

, Fashion magazines are one of the classic touchstones of being a fashionable person. Particularly look out for magazines like Vogue or Marie Claire where the photography of the adverts can be as informative as the articles themselves. Magazines can give you some basic information about the fashion world.


Carefully examine the details on photos. What is in now and what is not? Discover new fashion trends. Pay attention to the way of clothing and allow it to inspire you as to how you can wear your own clothes.
Can't afford to subscribe to that many fashion magazines? Read them at the bookstore, or head to the library and check out their subscription.

, If you want to be a fashionista, you don't have to like what everyone is wearing. By the time you figure out what's trendy and start dressing like other people, it'll be old hat. You don't have to look like the trend-setters out there, and you shouldn't want to. Aim to have your own style.

, Don’t just go out and buy a bunch of really cool pieces that match with one thing in your closet. You will soon feel that you are running out of clothes when truthfully you just bought a ton of statement pieces like a cool floral skirt with no plain tops to match it with.


Get things like camisoles, plain sweaters and cardigans, a plain skirt, and a few neutral-colored dresses, so you'll have as many options as possible to match. If you aren't quite ready for wild colors, just go with black to make sure you'll have choices.

, The right pair of shoes can make or break a fashionable outfit. Even a simple pair of form-fitting jeans with a cute top can look suddenly spiced up with a surprising pair of pumps. Shoes should be cute and comfortable, and you should have a variety of them to spice up your different looks.


Boots are super important. They always elongate the leg and make you look super toned. They also can go almost all year long. They are classic and won’t go out of style.
A cute but casual pair of flats is important for any wardrobe. That does not mean running sneakers.
Invest in a great pair of heels that will last a long time. Then you can get other ones you just like for some special occasions.

, Fashion's a great hobby, as long as you can afford it. If you're on a budget, it's important to set a particular amount out of your funds that you're allowed to spend on money per month and stay strictly in that limit. You don't have to sacrifice style for cash, though, and you can learn to find quality items for cheap.


Price items at different stores and always go back and compare. Don't go just to one fashion store and settle for what you find. Make sure you do the rounds and keep track of different items you hope to purchase.
Find the right stores. You can always splurge once and a while on a real statement piece that you know is something you'll never find anywhere else but try to stay within that budget. There’s a difference between Fashionista and shopaholic.

, Jewelry, cute hats, earrings, necklaces, and bracelets are helpful in allowing you to create different looks from the same items in your wardrobe. Find what looks right for you and look at the outfit as a whole in the mirror with it so you don't over accessorize by mistake.


Invest in affordable scarves, jewelry, and shoes to accessorize your outfits. They make a big difference in any simple outfit, and you can get away with having a wide variety of cheap items that accent your other pieces.

, When you truly develop your own style, sometimes you'll picture such an ideal outfit and you go on a mad hunt for it. And you won't find it. Instead of being disappointed, learn how to make it yourself! You can learn to mend your favorite items and keep them looking fresh and new, as well as how to make up new items as you go along, just for the cost of materials. This can be a real cost-saver, and a great way to make statements.

, Every couple of months, it's important to get rid of clothes you won't wear anymore. Give old clothes to charity, or have ""Naked Lady"" parties, in which you get together with a bunch of your fashionable friends and trade items you don't want anymore.


You can save interesting T-shirts, or old jeans which are not popular now if you think you can combine it with some other things to get unique look, but it's usually easier to purge focus on working with what you like in the here and now.

, A lot of people assume you need the latest trends to be fashionable, but this doesn't necessarily have to be true. If you mix a plain white t-shirt with denim jeans one day and a black pencil skirt another, you've got two outfits right there made with a minimum of items.


Practice organizing your clothes into different looks when you've got free-time. Spend some quality mirror time trying on different things together and experimenting to see what you looks right.

, Something might be fashionable in general, but it's not right for you and your body type. That's ok. It's important to figure out not only what's stylish and what's ""in,"" but what's going to look good on you.


It's good to spend time in front of mirror discovering the perfect combination of items for you. Find out the clothes which defines your body shape best and will help accent your best features.

, To be a fashionista you need to be confident. The number one rule in fashion is to wear what you want to wear, so always wear what you want and choose items that will help you feel comfortable and radiant.


Hold your head up high and improve that posture. People started to notice that you're dressed nice if you're walking with your head up. Be proud and get noticed.
Don't wear something just because it's ""fashionable,"" or because someone recommended it. Fashion changes. If you used to love wearing blazers a year ago, but now you want to try leather jackets, go for it. Life is short and a fashionista should always wears what she wants.

, Although runway fashion can be very over-the-top and glamorous, sometimes less is more. You don't need to wear a fancy dress to school to be a fashionista. Just be yourself and find clothing that you feel represent you, and make you feel beautiful and confident.


Try and separate runway fashion from everyday fashion. The designers of those elaborate garments are mostly wearing normal everyday clothes, just like you. Keep that in mind.

, Fashionistas need to mimic the beauty your fashions exudes on the outside by being beautiful on the inside. Being a fashionista means nothing if your attitude is not positive. Be happy, and enjoy life. Fashion is wonderful, but brand names and style aren't everything. Learn to be you and love you, and soon your inner fashionista will shine.

Look for labels.,
Look for brand names.,
Look for price.,
Feel the fur.,
Try the burn test.,
Stick a pin into the item (through the fur and its lining).,
Check the backing.,
Be aware that guessing is not necessarily easy unless you have all the facts to hand.",How to Tell the Difference Between Real Fur and Faux Fur," If the item is a garment, it will often carry a label. The label will tell you the constitution of the item (providing that the label is genuine). However, when a garment is a mix of materials and fur is not the majority of the material used, fur isn't always mentioned on the label. Also, real fur is sometimes sold as fake fur.;
, If you know that some brands are associated with fur or faux fur, this might be helpful in deciding which sort of fur you are dealing with. However, be aware that some brands carry both fur and faux fur lines. For example, Abercrombie & Fitch, Aéropostale, American Apparel, Billabong, The Gap, H&M, etc. all claim to use only synthetic furs, and a number of companies are currently shifting from fur to faux fur lines. See the Sources below for a complete list.

, Real fur usually costs a great deal more than faux fur. Hence the association of fur with very rich, older people! However, smaller bits of fur and fur trims can be quite cheap, so don't let the relatively low price of a garment fool you.

, Not all pieces of fur are conveniently labeled or priced. Another method for testing the item is that of feeling, however good faux fur can feel like it is real. Some indicators are:


Fur: feels very soft to the touch, falls in a smooth and sleek line, passes through your fingers as if you're petting a cat.
Faux fur: feels coarse and rough to touch, feels synthetic; can be sticky to touch in humid weather, and it might have the same feel as a stuffed toy animal. It might stick to your hands if it's made out of a plastic-y material (this only works if your hands are sweaty).

, This requires the loss of few pieces of fur or faux fur. Pull out 2 – 3 strands. On a flame-proof item (such as a ceramic plate), hold a match to the strands. If it is real fur, it will singe and there will be an odor similar to that of burnt hair. If it is faux fur, it will smell like melted plastic, melt like plastic, and curl into hard plastic-like balls.

, If it goes through easily, this suggests it is faux fur because the pin is sliding through a synthetic base. If it is hard to push through, or resists completely, it is likely to be real fur, as you're trying to push through the leather lining to which the fur remains attached.

, If you're able to see the backing of the item, or can make a small incision to check by feel or sight, look for leather to indicate real fur or stretch weave/fabric backing for faux fur. You may also be able to see the backing if you part the fur and separate the hairs.

, As the anti-fur advocate Kate Winslet found out to her great chagrin, simply being told that something is not fur is not necessarily a complete answer."

Resist blindly following trends.,
Set a trend spending limit.,
Let trends be an inspiration, not a fashion dictation.,
Follow trends that are comfortable for you.,
Invest in timeless classics.",How to Avoid Becoming a Fashion Victim1," While the celebrities might look great in their latest get-up, it’s not necessarily a look that will work for you.Remember the low-rise jean fad? If you had a body reminiscent of Christina Aguilera in the early 2000s, the trend may have worked for you. For most everyone though, it was rather unflattering.


Give the fashion mags and blogs a break, and resist the urge to buy the latest trendy item if you don’t see yourself actually wearing it more than a couple times.;
, Setting a limit to prohibit the purchase of too many non-basic items can help you avoid becoming a fashion victim. This will help you avoid being a fashion victim with the added benefit of saving you money. For example, you could set a maximum of $40 per month for the purchase of trendy items.

, You never want to copy someone’s look from head to toe without adding any of your own personal touches. Instead, let the trend inspire you to think of ways to incorporate it into your existing look.


If camo print is trending, you wouldn’t want to dress head to toe in it. Instead, try incorporating a camo jacket with your favorite pair of black skinny jeans and neutral tank top. This is an easy way to take a piece of the latest trend and apply it to your individual style.

, Stick with trends that you feel good wearing and can be comfortable in.


We look best in clothing we feel confident in, so it is always important to make sure you feel comfortable in your clothing. Remember to dress how you want to feel.
Some trends can actually cause damage to your body. Skinny jeans that are too tight can cut off circulation, and high heels worn too long, too often, or in inappropriate settings can cause damage to your feet. Only wear what is right for you, as any of these mistakes can quickly turn you into a fashion victim.

, Come spring, choker necklaces could be a trend long forgotten. If you want to be nice to your wallet and never fall victim to outdated fashion, focus on trends that you know never really go out of style.


For example, almost everyone looks good pairing blue jeans with a white top, and every woman can benefit from a properly fitting black dress for special occasions. These are two outfits you can count on to always be in style.
You should also invest in a good neutral blazer in black, beige, gray, or brown. This piece pairs well with jeans or khakis, and adds a touch of professionalism and class to any outfit.
A pair of comfortable black or nude pumps can be worn with just about anything and look amazing paired with jeans or flouncy skirts. Stylish bags, jewelry, and scarves are always an easy way to complete a timeless yet still trendy look (as well as to stick to your trend budget!).

Know when to let go of a trend.,
Condense and update your wardrobe.,
Get rid of any ruined clothing.,
Reject the wrong hand-me-downs.",How to Avoid Becoming a Fashion Victim2," The fashion industry is designed to routinely make you feel out of style. They’re in the business of selling clothing and the best way to do that is to constantly change what is trendy.An easy way to fall victim to fashion is to hold onto a look that fell out of style long ago. If your favorite trend is a decade old, and has yet to come back into style (like high waisted pants) it’s time to update your look to something more current.

, A good rule of thumb is to retire an old trend whenever you pick up a new one. This prevents unnecessary crowding of your closet and lets you focus on the current trends. It’s also a good idea to rid your closet of items you haven’t worn in the last 6 months.


A fast way to gauge unworn clothing is to hang everything “backwards” on the hanger at the start of a season. When you wear and wash something, put it back in your closet facing the opposite direction. At the end of the season, everything that is still hanging backwards needs to go., Throw out anything stained, stretched out, damaged or ill-fitting. Wearing anything along these lines will make you an instant fashion victim. Sometimes we hold onto clothes for sentimental value, even though they’re 2 sizes too small and we should never be seen in them again!, Hand-me-downs are a great way to change your wardrobe on a budget, but if a hand-me-down is too worn, the wrong size, ugly, or out of style, do not add it to your wardrobe. Accepting them is an easy way to clutter your closet again.

Buy clothes that fit you well.,
Accent your body type.,
Consider your lifestyle.",How to Avoid Becoming a Fashion Victim3," Buying a trendy piece that doesn’t fit right is a quick way to become a fashion victim. If you are in any way uncomfortable in your outfit, chances are it doesn’t fit properly. When in doubt, take your clothes to a tailor - they'll be able to fix your beloved items so they fit you well.


You should be able to fit two fingers in the collar of a dress shirt. If your shirt is supposed to be tucked in, it should be long enough that normal bending movements don’t cause it to come untucked. Shoulder seams should rest on the edge of your shoulder, and long sleeves should cover your wrist bones.Button down shirts should be large enough that there is no buckling between the buttons revealing your undershirt.
Pants should fit snug, but with enough room at the waist to comfortably fit two fingers. Skinny jeans should be a tighter fit, but not a constricting one.

, An easy trick to remember is to balance out the thicker parts of your body by accentuating and drawing attention to the thinner parts.


If you’re wider in the middle, avoid clothes that draw attention to your waist. Trade high-waisted pants for clothes that are blousy in the middle, such as empire waist shirts and shift dresses. Avoid loud prints and stick with monochromatic palettes.If you’re bigger on the bottom than on the top—swap your skinny jeans for some wide-legged pants, and accent your trim top half with fitted shirts and jackets.
If you have the curvy hourglass figure, wear things that accentuate your thin waist. Wrap dresses, high-waisted pants, and outfits that color block at the waist are your best bets.
To dress a “boyish” figure—do what you can to make your bust and hips look bigger. Accentuate your waist with belts, try some flared skirts and boot-cut jeans., You wouldn't want to fall victim to fashion by buying trends that contradict your lifestyle. If you're a person who spends most of their time outdoors, you might want to reconsider the trendy stiletto boots before you go sinking into the turf. Conversely, if you're a professional and devote most of your time to business meetings, the latest yoga pant fad may not be in your best interest.

Know your style personality.,
Avoid mismatching colors and styles.,
Remember, less is more.,
Try it before you buy it.",How to Avoid Becoming a Fashion Victim4," What type of outfit do you feel most comfortable and stylish in? Those are the trends you should follow. If you don’t feel comfortable tottering around on super high heels or wearing drop-crotch pants, stay away from those trends., Make sure your stock wardrobe includes plenty of neutral-colored pieces as well as a few nice printed pieces for proper balance.


For example, try white pants and jacket with a red shirt, or a cream colored dress with an olive cardigan or scarf.Just be sure to keep your outfit to a maximum of three colors.
If you struggle with matching clothes, consult a color wheel and stick with complementary or analogous colors for the most appealing match. Complementary colors are opposite each other on the color wheel. Analogous colors are three colors next to each other on the color wheel.
You wouldn’t want to mix a button-down dress shirt with running pants, or a sweatshirt with slacks, just as you’d never want to wear more than three prints at once.Keep athletic wear for the gym and pajamas at home. Nothing screams fashion victim like wearing your fuzzy pajama bottoms to the grocery store, or pairing athletic leggings with a nice blouse.

, Too much of anything - trendy items, make-up, jewelry, revealed skin—will put your outfit on the fast track from tasteful to tacky. Stick to dressing in a classic manner and throwing in one or two trends tops to avoid overkill.

, The easiest way to make sure you’re able to put trendy outfits together is to try them on before you buy them.


Try on items in the combinations you plan to wear them. Study yourself in the full-length mirror with an objective eye until you have a clear opinion of how it looks. This way you can see if the printed shirt you planned to wear under the blue blazer you want to purchase will actually go together.
Take along a fashion-conscious friend whose style you trust when you go shopping. When left to ourselves, it can be easy to talk ourselves into—or out of—just about anything. Your friend can provide you with a second opinion on the clothes you try on.

Measure the circumference of your head.,
Fold the wire in half and twist.,
Create a hook at the end.,
Wrap the wire with floral tape.",How to Make a Baby's Breath Crown1," Using a thin floral wire, measure the circumference of your head. Wrap the wire around the top of your head where you would like to crown to sit. Then double the amount of wire and cut it using pliers. You want to double the wire in order to ensure that you have a sturdy base for the crown. This will also allow you to make an adjustable crown.Floral wire can be purchased at your local florist or craft supply store.;
, Once you have cut the wire, find the middle of the wire and fold it in half. Place your index finger at the fold and then begin to tightly twist the wire so that it twists all the way to the ends. You can trim the end of the wire to create a clean end with two equal lengths.

, After you have twisted the wire, you will have a loop at one end where your index finger was located. Fold the other end to create a hook. You can adjust the circumference by creating a larger or smaller hook. This works nicely if you are making a crown that will be worn by someone else.Place the hook through the loop to hold the wire in the shape of a crown.

, Using floral tape, wrap the wire tightly with tape. This will help to hide wire and will give your homemade baby’s breath crown a more professional and finished look. Add extra tape to the end of the wire. This will help to prevent the wire from poking your while wearing it.You can use a green floral tape to blend in with the stems of the baby’s breath.
If the crown is being used in a wedding, you may want to match the tape with the wedding colours. For example, try gold or silver floral tape.

Cut the baby’s breath stems.,
Tape the flowers to the wire crown.,
Continue evenly around the crown.",How to Make a Baby's Breath Crown2," Before attaching the flowers to the crown, you will need to cut small sprigs of baby’s breath. Try cutting the stems so that they are similar in length. You want to leave a few inches of stem. This will make it easier to attach the stems to the crown.If you want, you can tape together a few sprigs of baby’s breath to create a small bunch and then attach the bunch to the base of the crown. This will make a fuller looking crown.

, Take one sprig or bunch and tape it to the crown using floral tape. Lay the flowers horizontally along the crown base. Make sure to tape the entire stem so that you do not have any stems sticking out from the crown.Before attaching the flowers, attach the two ends of wire so that it is in the shape of a crown. Once the flowers are on, it is harder to bend the wire into a circular shape.

, Continue to tape sprigs or bunches of baby’s breath all the way around the crown until you reach the starting point. Make sure the flowers are all facing in the same direction and are placed horizontally along the crown.You can place them close together for a fuller look. Alternatively, you may want to space them farther apart for a more natural and bohemian look.

Choose a long bunch of baby’s breath.,
Trim the stem.,
Tape a small bunch to the stem.,
Create a circle.",How to Make a Baby's Breath Crown3," In order to make a baby’s breath crown using the stem of the flowers as the base, you need to choose a bunch of baby’s breath that has a long stem. The stem should be long enough to wrap around your head and fit like a crown., Cut off all of the smaller bunches of baby’s breath that shoot off of the main stem. You can either cut them with scissors or just twist them off using your hands. Set these small bunches aside because they will eventually be attached to the crown., Directly under the small bunch of baby’s breath at the end of the stalk, tape another small bunch of baby’s breath to the stalk. Continue to tape small bunches of baby’s breath to the stalk until it is long enough to fit as a crown.Be sure to tuck in the stems with tape, so that you do not have any stems sticking out of the crown.

, Once you have reached the end of the stalk, carefully bend it into a circle to create the shape of the crown. Use floral tape to attach the two ends together.You can then fill in any gaps with more baby’s breath. Simply attach small bunches using the floral tape.
You can also wrap a ribbon around the crown in order to make the base more stable.

"
"
Add ribbons.,
Include other flowers.,
Spray with water.",How to Make a Baby's Breath Crown4," Once your crown is finished, you can add ribbon or twine to give it a fuller look. Simply wrap the ribbon or twine around the crown and between the bunches of baby’s breath. You can leave tails of ribbon at the back to tie a bow.Choose a ribbon that matches with the overall look of your outfit or the event.

, You can also add other flowers to the crown to give it a pop of colour. Baby’s breath can still be the dominant look, but you may want to add a few small daisies or some greenery. You can simply tape these additional flowers onto the crown the same way that you attached the baby’s breath.


Disperse other flowers or greenery throughout the crown.

, Once you are finished constructing the baby’s breath crown, you should spray it with water in order to keep it fresh. For instance, you may be making these crowns the day before a wedding. A light spray of water can help them stay fresh. You should also keep the flowers in the refrigerator."

, You will be buying clothes about 6 months before people actually wear them. For example, in the Spring, you will be buying clothes for the fall and winter seasons.

Be proud of your age.",How to Look Ten Years Younger," Make sure you choose a cleanser that is gentle, and that it doesn't have any excess oil. If your cleanser is too harsh, then it may dry out your skin and cause you to age more quickly. Make sure the cleanser is meant for your age group, not for teenagers, and that it is said to be moisturizing and gentle for your skin. You should use the cleanser before you wear any makeup.If you don't use facial cleanser, then you should get in the habit of using one, especially if you are older. Cleanser removes the traces of chemicals from your environment, as well as any makeup that can cause aging if you leave it on your skin for too long.;
, It's just as important to moisturize your skin to keep it looking fresh and clean, as it is to cleanse it of harmful materials. Find a moisturizer that is made for ""anti-aging"" and which has deep moisturizing effects. Men can benefit from this product just as much as women can, even if they're not used to using moisturizer or anything on their faces.

, Sunblock isn't just for the beach. If you really want to look ten years younger, then you have to make sure to wear sun protection any time you step out into the sun. You can find a moisturizer that already contains SPF, which can keep your face from drying up while protecting it from the sun as well. Damage from the sun is one of the things that can make you age prematurely, so make sure you wear at least a SPF of 15 every day. Otherwise, you may end up with wrinkles, brown spots, and a complexion that is duller than you want it to be.Don't just put the sunscreen on your face. Put it on the tops of your hands, your arms, your chest, or any other part of your body that will be exposed to the sun, too. That will keep you from having those age spots on your hands and your chest.

, Exfoliating is another practice you should get used to if you want your skin to start looking younger. It'll make your skin feel softer and will make it look brighter, while leaving you feeling refreshed. Again, make sure you pick the right cream that is meant for people in your age bracket, so that it is as gentle as it needs to be. Make a habit of making exfoliation part of your daily routine.

, Here's what both men and women should do with their facial hair to look ten years younger:


Women should aim to keep their eyebrows pretty and thick. You may think that super thin eyebrows make you look sexy, but they'll actually make you look older. As you age and your eyebrows thin out a bit, choose a pencil the same size as your brows to fill out your brows to keep your face looking youthful. Having thicker brows will keep your face looking young and full.
Men should keep their face shaved or trimmed; having more scruffy facial hair makes them look older than they really are. You'll be surprised by how much younger you'll instantly look if you just trim or shave that facial hair.

, There are countless tricks that can help you make yourself look younger just by applying makeup the right way. The best use of makeup not only hides your blemishes, but it also emphasizes your best features, bringing your face to life. Here are a few tricks that you should try:


Use creamy concealer. Waxy concealer can cake around your wrinkles and will make you look older than you really are. When it comes to concealer, wearing less of it can actually make you look younger; if you wear too much, it'll emphasize your wrinkles instead of covering up your imperfections.Use blush correctly. Just a dab at the height of your cheekbones will do the trick. Putting it in the hollows of your cheeks will actually make you look even older. This is because your face tends to thin out as you get older, and using blush this way will make your face look even thinner.Substitute your black eyeliner for brown. Black will start to look too harsh on your face as you get older, so choose the more subtle brown colors to frame your eyes. Smudging your eyeliner can also give you a more natural, and younger look.
Emphasize your lashes. Try thickening mascara, curling your lashes, or even trying thickening agents on your lashes to make yourself look younger. As you age, your lashes will thin out, and you can work on counteracting this.
Wear simple lipstick. Just a nice light shade of pink can do the trick; if you line and color your lips too much, it'll look like you're trying too hard. Your lips will naturally thin out as you age, so you can thicken them out a bit, but if you overdo it, you won't be getting the look you really want. Any woman can also look for the perfect shade of red to emphasize her lips; brick or tomato colors can be the way to go for a more dramatic, but not too dramatic look around your lips., Though many people think gray hair is sexy and stylish on both men and women, if you're on this page, then you're probably okay with covering up some of that natural beauty, right? If you're up for it, then see a stylist about dying your hair to achieve a natural, younger look. You can also dye your hair yourself or with a trusted friend if you're up for the risk of an at-home kit. You'll be surprised by how big a difference returning your hair to its natural color will make.


However, you should remember that dying your hair is actually damaging for it, and that, while eliminating your grays may help you look younger, your damaged hair may counteract some of that. It's up to you to make the call.
Women who dye their hair should also consider getting highlights so they can add a softer look to their hair.

, You may be feeling the effects of aging because you've had the same hairstyle since the 80s. It's time to get a younger, sleeker, and trendier hairstyle to show off your beautiful face. Look online or at magazines to see what styles people are rocking to get inspired, or ask your stylist for advice. You don't have to get the chicest, most not-you hairstyle out there, but making a change in this department can instantly make you look ten years younger. Here are some things that both men and women can try:


Women can think about getting bangs if they would be flattering for their faces; people with larger foreheads tend to do better with bangs. Bangs are hip and trendy and can make women look younger. Layers can also make women look younger, giving their hair more volume and bounce. If you're one of those women with super long hair, you can consider chopping it off so it frames your face and falls just above your shoulders.
Men should grow their hair out so their features don't look so stark. Just a few inches is fine -- if it's too shaggy, then it'll make them look older and more tired. Find the right balance. Men who are balding should think about shaving their heads. This makes a statement, and will make them look younger and will be more flattering them having thinning hair or a bald spot.

, Bright, straight, clean-looking teeth can go a long way in making you look younger. On the same token, yellowed, crooked, or rotting teeth can make you look older than you really are. If you have dental problems you've been putting off, now is the time to address them; see a dentist if necessary. If you don't have serious problems in that department but don't pay enough attention to your teeth, then it may be time to make sure you brush your teeth at least twice a day and that you floss regularly. You can look into whitening toothpaste or whitening strips, as long as you make sure you use them safely and effectively.

, It's important to wear flattering clothes that make you look thinner and more up-to-date. As long as you don't try to wear something the people half your age typically wear, you'll be able to use your dress to your advantage. Dressing for your age and body type can make a huge difference in how old you look. Here are some things to try:


Women should wear flattering shirts without trying to show too much cleavage. Doing so can actually make them look older.
Both men and women can benefit from a wardrobe update. If you haven't gone shopping in the last few years or the last decade, it may be time to go on a shopping spree with a trendy friend to see what all the latest shoppers are up to. Though you can maintain your style, you should try to update your look at the same time.
Don't wear clothes that are super tight to try to look younger; instead, pick flattering clothes that make the most of your best features.
Wear bright colors. Dark browns, grays, and blacks will actually make you look older and more drab. Brighter colors, such as blues, reds, greens, or pinks, can make you give off a more fun and vibrant vibe. Though darker colors may be more slimming, they may also make you look older. To avoid ditching the darker look entirely, mix up your darker clothes with lighter-colored clothes or jewelry; black pants can go great with a bright top, for example.
Women should also make sure to wear the right accessories. Matching necklace and earring sets tend to make them look older; instead, wear bright rings, cute studded earrings, and trendier, less bulky jewelry.

, You should always drink at least ten 8 oz. glasses of water a day to keep your skin looking fresh, and to make sure that your body feels healthy. Drink a glass or two of water with every meal as well as throughout the day. You don't have to be thirsty to reach for a glass, either. If you've exercised, drink even more water than you normally would afterwards to make sure to replenish. This will keep you looking -- and feeling -- young and can take years off the way you look and feel., Make sure to get at least thirty minutes of exercise a day, whether it means taking a vigorous walk, a short yoga class, or going for a jog in the morning. You may feel that you're too busy to exercise, or that you're too unhealthy, but there is a form of exercise that can help almost anybody. It'll also give you energy and will make you feel even younger and more energetic. If you commit to a regular workout routine, it'll help you look younger in no time.


Of course, you should avoid that sinewy no-fat look by eating healthy meals each day, or you can end up looking older if you don't give your body the nutrients it needs while exercising.Older people should try yoga. It's a low-impact form of exercise that can help you get toned and feel more energetic. Biking, walking, and Pilates are also great for this.
If exercise is making you sore, that's just part of the process! But getting massages can also help you relax and look and feel younger, especially after a busy week filled with great workouts.

, Eating three healthy meals a day, along with healthy snacks and plenty of water, can help you look and feel younger. If you're only eating processed foods or are constantly overeating, then you're bound to look older than you really are. Foods that are rich in Vitamin C, like broccoli and oranges, can help you look and feel younger, and antioxidants such as berries can help keep your skin fresh. Carrots and sweet potatoes are also great for your skin, and low-fat yogurt can help keep your teeth strong.


Pretty much any fruit or vegetable or natural food can have benefits in terms of making you look younger. Cut out the processed, fatty foods, and you are bound to look younger than you ever have before.

, Sure, ""don't worry, be happy"" sounds clichéd, but it basically means try to live life stress free. The less stress in your life, the less wear and tear you will have mentally, which will in translate into less wear and tear on you physically. Have you ever seen a friend go through a rough time and they look weathered and aged beyond their years? We all go through tough times but how we handle them makes all the difference. Try to always get enough sleep and relaxation. If life seems overwhelming try meditating and clear your mind, most troubles are only temporary.


Doing yoga is a fantastic way to reduce stress, live in the moment, and take care of your body.
Unfortunately, some things will always be bound to stress you out. You can't avoid stress completely. But working on having a positive attitude and a foolproof game plan for tackling stress can go a long way in helping you deal with it.
Laugh as much as you can. Adding laughter to your life can help you reduce stress and to look and feel younger.

, Keep your back straight and your head up, and not only will you feel better and more ready to tackle your day, but you'll also look younger in the process. The next time you feel like slouching over or hunching over, think about how much older that will make you look and feel. It's all in the attitude -- if you're maintaining great posture, you will look more energetic and ready to tackle your day, and you will start to look and feel younger in no time!


This goes for sitting down, too. You should keep your spine straight whether you're sitting or standing.

, Though every person needs a different amount of sleep, sleeping for at least 7-8 hours a night should begin to give you the rest you need to feel alert and to look rested. You don't want your face to look puffy or your skin to look saggy because you've barely slept. Not getting enough rest will make you want to hunch over, and to be less likely to maintain other healthy habits. As you get older, your body will show signs of tiredness more easily, so you should make sure to find the amount of sleep you really need and to stick to it.


It's true that, as you get older, you may need more or less sleep. Listen to what your body is telling you and follow through with it.

, Not only is smoking terrible for your health, but it also makes you look much older than you really are -- and fast. If you're a smoker, you should drop this habit so that you can keep your lips from getting thinner, your skin from being super dry and filled with wrinkles, and so you can restore some shine to your hair. Smoking also makes your hands and nails discolored, which is another way to make you look older than you really are. You'd be surprised by how quickly dropping this habit will make you look younger.

, It's okay to drink and have fun with your friends once in a while, and you shouldn't quit drinking completely if you like to have a good time with your friends on occasion; after all, you want to feel fun and vigorous too, don't you? But drinking alcohol regularly has been proven to make your skin look puffier and more dry, and this is something you should avoid if you want to look ten years younger.


Of course, part of looking young is feeling young and having fun. And for some people, alcohol is a fun social lubricant. So, if you like to get crazy and have a few martinis now and again, don't cut the drinking out of your life completely.

, While you can take many steps to reduce how old you look, you should be proud of the years you have earned instead of trying to cover up who you really are. You must have achieved great things in your life, and you shouldn't really want to look like you're in your twenties or thirties again. If you keep up a young attitude and are proud of who you are and how you look, then you'll actually look much younger than someone who is desperately trying to cover up every little sign of aging.


Feeling positive about who you are and how you look can go a long way in making you look and feel younger! You should try it, some time.

Organic fabrics and dyes are becoming more common. Check out companies that have organic clothing lines.
Manufacturing practices are also important to people in LA. Look for casual clothes that were locally made, rather than factory-produced in another country.

Brass, rose gold and silver are popular metals to play with, but you could also wear accessories crafted from wood or clay.


If you love accessories, go for a bohemian look. For example, you could wear a bold beaded statement necklace, hoop earrings and a stack of silver bangles.

Men can swap out their sneakers for a pair of dress shoes and show up to a club wearing fitted jeans, a t-shirt and a nice blazer.

, Since LA is right on the beach, people often wear swimwear all day long. Choose swimwear you're comfortable being seen in, since you'll probably be living in it for hours.

Start with the right little black dress.,
Wear the dress rather than letting the dress wear you.",How to Dress Up That Little Black Dress1," Not all little black dresses are equal; some have more style and suitability than others. When choosing a little black dress, keep the following things in mind:

Daywear for parties, lunches, and events: Wear a fitted black shift dress, with a slashed neckline. Avoid anything that clings to the body and lean towards dresses that skim your body contours. The length should drop just below the knee. This is suitable for the office as well.For office wear, softer fabrics look great in black.And lightweight wool crepe is a good summer fabric if wearing a black dress.Evening wear, incredible dates, and amazing events: This dress can be slinkier and yet should remain well-shaped. Look for a ruched black dress with straps, close-fitting but in fabric that conceals all, and with a heart-shaped bodice. The length should end on the knee. Casual: A black wrap-around silk jersey, a black linen shirt, and the forgiving stretchy black dress are all suitable for less formal events and home wear.Trendy for Teenagers: For the younger ones who want to wear a LBD (little black dress) with a twist, try making it funky by pairing it up with kitsch jewelry with matching bright nail polish (like bubblegum pink or turquoise) and maybe even bright tights to go with it!






Spend a reasonable amount on your little black dress. It's one wardrobe item that you're unlikely to give away.;
, Black is the ultimate classic color and the easiest to work with, and if you can wear it well, you can't go wrong. However, black doesn't suit everyone. For example, it can drain pale skin tones or it can simply make some people feel too somber and dour.However, this doesn't mean you should avoid little black dresses.


If black doesn't suit you, be sure to keep the dress as far from your face as possible (such as using a plunging or deeply rounded neckline and straps instead of sleeves).That way, it won't drain the color from your face but you can still benefit from the elegance, simplicity, and backdrop of wearing black.

"
"
Add pantyhose.,
Choose the right shoes.,
Use jewelry to brighten up the little black dress.,
Add a belt to the black dress.,
Add a scarf.,
If you don't mind wearing gloves, they can really dress up the little black dress.,
Select a suitable bag.,
Add headwear and hair accessories to the list of possible dress-ups for the little black dress.",How to Dress Up That Little Black Dress2," Pantyhose evens out your skin tone on your legs and provide the finishing touch to the look. For evening wear, sheer black or gray tinted pantyhose are an excellent choice. Colored tights could also work with a black dress provided the color matches with other accessories and is right for your age and skin tone.


For winter wear, remember that legs tend to look longer when the shoes and tights color match., Dressing up the little black dress with shoes is a significant part of the look because the shoes can provide contrasting color or style to the dress. Shoes worn with the little black dress should be of very good to excellent quality because they are a feature piece and people's eyes will be drawn to them with your black dress backdrop.

Try plain black and unadorned flats for a casual look suitable for the office or an informal event. Chanel-style slingbacks are also good additions for daywear.






Classic evening shoes that go well with a little black dress include ballet slipper flats, single-strap slingback sandals, or pumps.






Wear a bright color, such as red high-heeled pumps, to add a bit of excitement.







, The little black dress provides a magnificent backdrop for showing off your favorite jewelry pieces.

Additions that work well include a necklace that fits the neckline style of the dress, a brooch pinned in a cute spot, or an updo with daring earrings. The list is really endless as far as combos go!






A little bit of sparkle with costume jewelry can go a long way and is perfect for evening wear.






If you're in the possession of diamond necklaces, brooches, and other jewelry pieces, use the dark backdrop to let the diamonds shine their best.






Wear pearls. If it's a shift-style dress, pearls with white satin gloves and round-toed pumps make for an adorable look, à la romantic Audrey Hepburn. Don't wear pointed pumps though, as these are too fierce for such a soft and retro look.







, Provided the style of the dress can handle the addition of a belt, it can provide a very emphatic contrasting feature on your little black dress.


Select a belt for color, texture, glamor, or pattern. The only concern is to ensure that it fits well with the dress as a whole – check the complete look in the mirror.

, If you like wearing scarves, this can make a lovely addition to a black dress. Select a print or pattern that matches with the other additions to the dress and ensure that the scarf is of high quality, such as a silk scarf.


A silk wrap can make an elegant addition to a plain black dress. Try a very simple pair of black pumps, preferably rounded and a pair of chandelier earring with a Dupioni silk wrap. The chandelier earrings and Dupioni silk wraps look great when matching and a warm color.

, White gloves for the daytime and black gloves for the evening can work wonders.

, Again, the bag is going to get noticed because the black serves as a backdrop to anything you're holding, so make sure the bag is treated as part of the overall fashion look. The bag doesn't have to match the shoes or other accessories but it should blend well with the color scheme.

A small clutch bag is a lovely, discreet look. Try a dazzling or sparkling color to dress it up for the evening.






A handbag should be good quality and clean.






A larger bag can work for casual wear, provided it's in excellent, clean condition.







, A well placed hat can be suitable for special events such as race meetings, royal events, and very warm days.


An astutely placed hair bow, floral item, bejeweled hair piece, or simple ribbons can go a long way to making a lovely statement with the little black dress.


"
"
Match your makeup.",How to Dress Up That Little Black Dress3," With a black dress, all your accessories should have a color theme. The same goes for your makeup. Make sure your nail polish, eye shadow, and lipstick match your wardrobe.


As an alternative, just ensure that your makeup highlights the best features of your face and gives life to your entire look.

Respect yourself.,
Dress like you mean business.,
Act confident.,
Be social.,
Be friendly.,
Be current.,
Take initiative.,
Take smart risks.,
Roll with the punches.,
Be a good leader and teammate.,
Go above and beyond.,
Constantly improve yourself.,
Be really good at what you do.,
Get involved.,
Get media success.,
Get social success.,
Get the person of your dreams.,
Succeed in the workplace.",How to Get Noticed," When other people see that you don't respect yourself, they begin to worry (sometimes just subconsciously) that maybe you aren't worthy of respect. Show them how deserving you are by taking good care of yourself and showing them how much you think you're worth. Eat healthy, exercise, and practice good bodily hygiene (like taking a shower, brushing your teeth, and wearing deodorant).;
, You should always been dressed like you expect to get noticed. Don't wear clothes that don't fit, look bad on your body, or have stains, tears, or wrinkles. These are indicators that you don't want to be seen. Instead, dress nicer than everyone else and put work into what you wear.

, Confidence is a very attractive quality. If you're confident, more people will notice you and will look to you for guidance and help (whether they know it or not). From people you're dating to people you work for, everyone will notice when you start acting confident. Speak up for yourself, make decisions, speak like you're sure, and stop talking like you're less. Definitely stop apologizing when you do every little thing.


If you're complaining or whining all the time, people are gonna get tired or it and move on.
Make sure you keep a positive attitude and even if you have a different opinion on something; sometimes it's best to keep you're thoughts to yourself.

, If you want to get noticed, you're going to have to start by getting out there. Talk to people, go to events, and make friends. You want to build a network (of friends, customers, future employers or coworkers, or even just people that can help you find a date).

, Be nice to people. Be positive. Be friendly. If you're a jerk who talks about others behind their back or gets randomly angry or vengeful over slights, then people will worry that they'll be next to get your mean-treatment. People might say that they like that whole cut-throat, ""I'll do anything to get what I want"" attitude, but really it makes people suspicious. If you're a pleasant person to be around, then you're much more likely to get help from them, promotions, or positive social (and romantic!) attention when you need it.

, You know how you kind of worry about your parents when they keep dressing like it's 1986? Other people will worry about you if you're basically just rehashing old stuff, whether it's ideas, styles, or practices. Clinging to old ways is a sign that you don't know how to change and that you can't be creative. Instead, try to get out on the edge, constantly pressing for new and better ways of doing things.

, Grab life by the horns. Be involved with everything that's going on around you. Don't wait for things to happen to you or for you, just get out there and make them happen. Whether you're asking your friend out on a date after 5 years of do-they-don't-they drama, asking for a promotion at work, or sending your demo to every record label on the planet: do what you have to do to start getting yourself where you want to be. The best thing to do if you want people to notice you is to make them notice you.

, To get noticed, you want to set yourself apart. You want to have something to offer that no one else can offer. The best way to do that is to take smart risks. Do something big but do it right. Weigh the risk vs the gain and only take the leap if it's worth it to you. Generally it's scary to take risks, and you might be reluctant, but you'll never get anywhere exciting in life by staying safe and in the same place your whole life.

, Be flexible. Don't panic when things don't go according to plan. When something negative happens, turn it into a positive. When something positive happens, find a way to help carry that over for a rainy day. Your boss will be impressed, but that guy you like will also know that no matter what craziness happens in life, you can help him get through it without breaking a sweat.

, Leadership and a good ability to work with others is attractive to everyone from your manager at work to your teacher at school to that girl you really want to date. Take control of situations when you can, keep people motivated and working hard, and sacrifice your own glory for the good of the team when the time comes. People will notice because this behavior shows that you're a winner...and they'll all want you on their team.

, People will tell you that in order to get noticed you have to work hard, but you're probably already working hard (and if you're not, start, because nothing's going to just fall into your lap). What you have to do is not just work hard but go above and beyond the call of duty. No matter what you're doing, whether it's work or trying to win your crush, you have to do more than what's expected in order to show people just how great you are.

, You should work to constantly get better and keep your work and skills fresh and ever changing. Stagnant work or personality gets boring and people will get tired of you. Keep them interested and keep yourself happy by keeping your life and work exciting and new. This also means getting really good at what you do, and this is another great way to get noticed.

, When someone is clearly very dedicated and good at what they do, that catches people's attention. You become known as That Woman or That Guy. You're the one. The one they remember because they know if they ever want to do something like what you do, they're going to call you for help. Get good, really good, at the thing you do. It takes practice, time, and dedication but you can do it.

, Even if you're not necessarily good at what you do, another way to catch some positive attention is to always be involved. Get in on projects, volunteer your extra set of hands for whatever you can, and start doing things. Simply being the person that shows up when everyone else is off doing something else can get you attention from the people that matter.

Choose a pair of pumps to glitter.,
Clean the shoes.,
Stuff the shoes with newspaper.,
Mask off the areas you don't want glittered with painter's tape.,
Cover a small portion of the shoe with a thick layer of Mod Podge.,
Shake on some glitter.,
Tap off the excess glitter.,
Continue painting the shoe and shaking on glitter.,
Allow the glitter to dry.,
Apply a second coat of glitter, if necessary.,
Seal the glitter with an acrylic sealer.,
Remove the tape and newspaper.,
Extend the sealer, if necessary.,
Allow the shoes to dry completely before wearing them.",How to Make Glitter Pumps," You can apply glitter to the entire shoe, or to just one part, such as the heel or the sole. Make sure that the pumps are smooth. Any textures or embellishments, such as bows or rhinestones, will make it difficult for the glitter to stick.


If the pumps come with laces, bows, or any other decorations, remove these temporarily. You will put them back on in the end.;
, Wipe the shoes down to remove any surface dirt. This is very important. Any surface dirt or oils will prevent the litter from sticking.If you will be applying glitter to the underside of the sole, wipe it down with rubbing alcohol.

, If you don't have any newspaper, you can also use crumpled up paper, tissue paper, or even a plastic bag. This will help keep the insides of the shoes clean and glitter free.

, For example, if you are glittering the entire shoe, cover the sole with masking tape. If you are glittering the sole, wrap tape around the bottom edge of the shoe, right where the material meets the sole. This will help keep your lines neat and crisp., It is best to work a small area at a time. If you cover the entire shoe with Mod Podge, parts of it may dry before you add the glitter. You can apply the Mod Podge using a paintbrush or a foam brush.Be generous when applying the Mod Podge; don't skimp on it. You want it to appear white., You can use chunky glitter or ultra-fine glitter. The choice is up to you. If you need to, use your fingers to gently pat the glitter into place so that it lays flat.Work over a sheet of paper. When you are done, you can fold the paper in half, and funnel the glitter back into its jar.

, Chances are, the excess glitter already slid off of the shoe, but gently tap the shoe against your work surface just to be sure.This will give you a smoother finish. Don't worry if the shoe appears patchy—you can always apply more layers later on!

, Once you have the entire portion covered with glitter, move onto the next patch. Apply more Mod Podge, then shake on more glitter. Keep doing this until the entire shoe is covered in glitter. When you are done, move onto the next shoe.


If the shoe gets awkward to hold because of all the glitter, let the glitter dry for 1 hour, then continue working., Set the shoes down some place where they will not be bumped or disturbed. Make sure that no dust, lint, or pet hair gets on the shoes.

, As the Mod Podge dries, you may notice the glitter layer becoming more translucent. Part of the shoe may even show through, especially if it is a different color. If this happens, you will need to apply another layer. Simply repeat the process: apply some Mod Podge, then shake on some glitter., You can use the spray-on kind or the brush-on kind. You will need two coats. Let the first coat dry completely before applying the next one.


If you can't find an acrylic sealer, you can use more Mod Podge instead.Make sure that you use a sealer with a glossy finish. A matte finish will dull the glitter and give you a sandy finish instead.

, If there is any glitter stuck where you don't want it, wipe it away with a damp sponge or towel. Use a piece of tape to pick off any stubborn bits of glitter or Mod Podge., If you applied the glitter to only a small portion of your shoe, such as a heart shape, it might be a good idea to extend the sealer just a smidge beyond the glitter. Use a thin paintbrush and some more brush-on acrylic sealer (or Mod Podge), and paint just outside the design. This will help lock the design in and keep it from peeling away.

Choose your fabrics wisely.,
Purchase wrinkle-resistant fabrics.,
Spray your clothes lightly with starch or fabric finish spray.,
Invest in a bottle of wrinkle-releasing spray.",How to Avoid Clothes Creasing During Wear1," Fabrics most easily crease when they are still damp or warm. Be sure that your clothes are room temperature and completely dry before putting them on.Just as you don't want to put on clothes that are still warm from the dryer, try to avoid getting wet or sweaty during the day. This will cause your clothes to crease.;
, Before you wear your clothes, be sure to iron them inside-out, and along the seam lines. This will help minimize the amount of creases that form throughout the day. Be sure to read the clothing labels to determine the proper heat setting for your iron., Trousers that are too baggy have a tendency to bag and bunch, causing rumples and wrinkles to appear. Trousers that are too tight, on the other hand, have a tendency to pull and buckle which creates a different sort of wrinkle that will reappear every time you wear them. If you are not sure how your trousers should fit, get professional advice from a tailor., If you know that you have a long meeting that requires you to sit for several hours, do not choose fabrics like silk that crease quickly. Try to choose stiffer fabrics for days that you can't have any creases in your clothing, or will be doing activities that cause creasing., Cotton clothing will wrinkle more than clothes that have a mix of synthetic fabric in them. A shirt that has 50% polyester and 50% cotton may wrinkle less than a full cotton shirt. When buying clothes, look for tags that say they are wrinkle-resistant, or purchase higher quality clothing. Clothes made of wrinkle resistant fabric are available in a wide variety of colors, styles and cuts, and can be found in both formal and informal styles., The product label will give further instructions on how to spray your clothes. These sprays work to increase fabric crispness and support the fabric's ability to hold shape all day.

, These products are not as effective as ironing, but they do work to reshape fabrics back to their natural shape. These sprays can also prevent creases from forming throughout the day.

Pull your clothes flat when you sit.,
Avoid crossing your legs.,
Don't put pressure on your clothes.,
Stand as much as possible.",How to Avoid Clothes Creasing During Wear2," One of the most common places for clothes to fold and crease is near your bottom and thighs when you sit. The fabric may get folded and permanently crease after you stand up.For dresses or dress shirts, pull down slightly on the tail when you sit so you are sitting on it flat, as opposed to pressing wrinkles into it with your body.
In the car, unbutton the bottom button of your shirt and lay it over the lap belt. This will help prevent creasing along the area where your seat belt rests.

, If you are in the habit of crossing your legs when you sit, be careful, as it will crease your pants. Just like when you sit, crossing your legs creates small folds in the fabric of your clothes that press down to create creases and wrinkles. Try sitting with your legs uncrossed on days you are avoiding creases.


When you are sitting at a desk or table, if space permits, stretch your legs out and keep them outstretched., The more contact and pressure your clothing receives, the more it will crease. Try to let your clothing hang loose and not be pressed up against your body by your hands, folded arms, bags, or jacket for long periods of time.

, If you are at a party or other event where sitting is not required, stay standing. Sitting is mostly responsible for pant creases in the legs and the seat. If you are able to stand, you will minimize the opportunities for your trousers or dress to wrinkle."

Invest in a bottle of wrinkle-releasing spray.,
Get the crease wet and pull.,
Use a blow dryer.",How to Avoid Clothes Creasing During Wear3," These products are not as effective as ironing, but hanging your garment, spraying it with the product and then using your hands to remove wrinkles can be very effective. A spray bottle filled with fabric softener has pretty much the same effect and would be far less expensive., If you do find yourself with a crease, get it wet with warm water and gently pull at the fabric. This should reshape and release the creased fabric back to the original shape.

, Heat helps to release creases. If you find yourself with light creases in your clothing, try to hold a blow dryer to the crease to soften the wrinkle and smooth out the fabric.


Hold the blow dryer about ten inches away from the fabric and keep it set on low.
Don't hold the blow dryer in the same spot because it may burn the fabric. Instead, wave the blow dryer around from side to side."

If you're wearing a miniskirt, pull the cloth down to cover as much of your thighs as possible.
If you're wearing a longer skirt, dress, or train, pull it down to cover your knees and push any excess fabric toward the center of the car so that it doesn't get caught around your feet when you exit.;
, Don't lean out of the vehicle to open the door, but make sure it's open far enough that you can exit gracefully. If your date or chauffeur opens the door for you, all the better.

, Try to keep your knees together throughout the movement.

,, Place your hands on the seat on either side of you, and push yourself up out of the car. Keep your hands low to give yourself better leverage and to appear more graceful. Try to rise smoothly. Alternatively, you can use one hand to boost you up, and the other hand to hold down your skirt flat against your body as you stand.

, Showing your underwear is embarrassing, but hitting your head on the way out of the car is even worse. Gracefully dip under the top of the doorframe.

, If the pavement is uneven, or if there's a curb right next to you, the first step can be disastrous, especially if you're in high heels. Be aware of where you put your feet, and watch your step.

Buy quality clothing. You often get what you pay for. The bargain T-shirt you bought at your local discount Mega-Mart is not usually designed to last very long. However, purchase price is no guarantee of quality--even an expensive boutique may be basing its price on its trendiness rather than for an eye on sturdiness. Unfortunately, price often has little or nothing to do with how well-constructed a garment is.
Certain brands have a reputation for quality, (such as in the USA), Land's End, L.L. Bean and Duluth Trading Company.
Wash the clothing according to the instructions on the label. It is also important to read these labels prior to purchasing a garment, so you are sure that you are happy to do the type of washing or dry cleaning it requires. If not, do not buy it.
Online reviews are often a good guide to how others have found the quality of the clothes. If a lot of people comment on flimsiness, pilling, and so on, that's a warning.
Close zippers and clasps when machine washing clothing.
Keep a set or two of older clothing around for messy or strenuous activities, such as gardening.
Wear an apron or smock if you are doing something messy, such as cooking or a hobby such as painting.;
, The specifics depend on what stain you are trying to remove and what fabric you're removing it from, but it's generally best to treat the stain as soon as you can.

Find your stain removal answer quickly in wikiHow's Stain Removal category.

, You will need the button or a passable replacement and a needle and thread. The process only takes a few minutes, and it is one of the simplest and most common things to fix. You can even do it in front of the TV if you have to!

When you are given button and thread on the purchase of a new garment, get into the habit of keeping these in one single place for easy retrieval when needed. A small jar in the laundry room is a common tactic.

,

Repair seams that have torn or come undone. If a hole develops along a seam, you can usually just sew it closed again. The repair will be invisible and straightforward., If a garment has a large hole, you may have to apply a patch.

A great patch is decorative, so it becomes a feature rather than a flaw! Generally any place that has craft or sewing supplies will offer a selection of decorative patches.
You can use patches made of similar or the same material. (Such as using denim fabric to replaced worn-out knees on a pair of jeans.)
Iron-on patches exist, but have a tendency to come off. Sew-on patches (or iron-on patches that are sewn down) tend to last longer..

, It is relatively simple to hem pants and skirts, and it will allow you to adjust the length of a garment.

One of the most common ways to fix a damaged pair of jeans are to create shorts, or ""cut-offs"".
Another common use is to make pants a little shorter to give them a new appearance if the bottom edge is worn.

, Darning is the process of rebuilding a worn fabric using a needle and thread or yarn in a process similar to weaving. It may take a bit more skill than the other techniques listed here, but it is still a good option for mending small holes and reinforcing worn spots.

Socks and thick denier tights made from wool, cotton, or cashmere can be made to last a lot longer with darning.

, The classic example is making jeans into cut-off shorts when the knees are worn through, but if you are resourceful, you could restyle all sorts of worn clothing, or make bags, quilts, leg-warmers or mittens. There are many, many options.

For a few ideas on restyling clothes, see wikiHow's suggestions on fabric and clothing reuse and sewing clothes.

, Sometimes bad things happen to good clothing, and it is not a simple fix. This is when a good professional can be really useful. He or she may be able come up with creative solutions, too. For instance, the ugly rip accidentally put in your prom dress could end up saved by creating a new hem line., There are a few circumstances in which a garment really cannot be fixed. These are:

The garment is threadbare and/or very fragile. Threadbare is when the fabric is worn very thin through use. Generally, it is only a matter of time before holes appear. At this point, the fabric may be completely unable to be sewn.
The garment has hazardous materials on it. If your favorite shirt is covered in anti-freeze, it may not be able to be safely laundered.
Permanent stains. You may be able to put a butterfly-shaped patch on that permanent marker stain. Perhaps you can attempt to make your bleach-stained jeans into a retro 80's piece. But sometimes, a stain cannot be removed or worked around and there is just no way around it.

Wear clothes that fit.,
Wear tunic style shirts.,
Wear flared bottom shirts.,
Wear dark shirts and pair with bright colored bottoms for extra effect.,
Emphasize your hips to draw attention away from your chest.,
Skip on turtlenecks.,
Avoid natural and empire waist items.,
Don't wear shirts that emphasize cleavage.,
Avoid clothes that add bulk around the chest.,
Skip on horizontal stripes.,
Stand up straight.,
Use special bras.,
Use shapers.,
Use chest binders.,
Use chest binding.",How to Visually Reduce Large Breasts," You should start by always wearing clothes that fit. Don't wear clothes that are too tight, since these will just make your breasts look bigger and draw attention to them. You also don't want to wear clothes that are too big or loose, because these will make your breasts look bigger but will also make you look bigger over all. Instead, just wear clothes that fit you, neither too loose nor too tight. Not only will this be more comfortable, but it will reduce the visual appearance of your chest.;
, Wear shirts that are long, with a hem line down around the widest part of your hips. This will draw the eye downward and away from the chest, while also emphasizing your hips. Together, this will do a lot to reduce the appearance of your hips.

, Wear shirts that flare out below the natural waist. This will help draw the eye downward and away from the chest. This style of shirt is very trendy and in fashion right now as well.

, Wearing a dark shirt in general, using colors like black, navy, and forest green, will reduce the appearance of your chest. This works by reducing the appearance of highlights and shadows, which makes it harder for the eye to perceive depth and shape.


If you want to make the effect even stronger, pair the dark top with a skirt or pants that are brightly colored. Wearing turquoise, pink, yellow, red, or other bright colors will draw the eye down from your chest to your hips and legs.

, In general, wearing clothes that emphasize your hips will draw attention away from your chest and make it look smaller by comparison. Wear horizontally striped pants or skirts and when you wear skirts, try to wear full, circle skirts. These will add volume to your lower half and make your body look more even.

, Turtlenecks and especially bulky turtle neck sweaters will only make your chest look bigger. Tight turtlenecks will only make your breasts look bigger and thicker turtlenecks will just add bulk, achieving the same effect.

, Natural waist tops, which draw the waistline upwards, and empire waist tops which create the cinch of the waist just below the breast line both serve to make the bust look bigger. Avoid both of these styles as they will only emphasize your chest by making it look bigger in comparison to your waist.

, Of course, you'll want to skip tops that emphasize your cleavage. Anything that is very low cut is only going to make your breasts look bigger. So much bigger, in fact, that they'll probably accurately look like they're on the verge of falling out! Instead, wear items that are slightly higher cut.


For some people, V-neck and sweetheart necklines will make the cleavage and bust look bigger and more noticeable. Some people, however, find that they prefer the appearance they get with this neck style. Experiment to see what works for you.

, You'll want to pass on clothes that add bulk around your breasts, making them look even bigger. Cowl-neck sweaters and tops, ruffle-front blouses, longer scarves, shirts with puckers or gathers around the breasts, and many other items will add a lot of fabric at the bust line, making your breasts appear even bigger.

, Horizontal stripes will make your chest appear wider and according make your breasts look bigger. Instead, wear narrow vertical stripes, as these will draw the eye upward and make your chest look smaller. This is because it tricks the eye into thinking the two sides of your body are closer together.

, When you have bad posture, you breasts will sag and hang, which just makes them look bigger. Standing up straight with your shoulders pulled back will lift the breast and cause the tissue to be more taught and stretched, physically reducing it's outward shape.


If you have trouble standing straight, there are many back braces and posture correctors available online or from your doctor.

, There are a number of bras which can help. Minimizers are designed for this purpose and simply work by adding no extra bulk.You can achieve the same effect by using an unlined bra, which is often cheaper. However, most women with large breasts find that they prefer the support of a more structured bra. Because of this, you may find that a maximum support, high quality sports bra works better for you. A sports bra will squish your breasts down and make them appear physically smaller.


It's also really important to wear a bra that fits. , Shapers are vests or shirts which are made out of tight elastic. A normal shirt is then worn over the top. You can find shapers for the chest from many department stores as well as from online stores.

, Chest binders are shapers on steroids: they'll significantly reduce your bust by maximizing how much they compact your breasts. Their effect may be to strong and constricting for some people, however, so only use this option if you're looking for serious reduction.

, A temporary solution for desperate situations is to do traditional chest binding. This is where you use a tighter material to bind down your breasts - preferably a chest binder, but a tighter sports bra will also suffice. This is useful if you just need to temporarily reduce your bust in order to fit into particular clothes for a special event.

Do not use ace bandages or duct tape for chest binding - these materials aren't made for binding, and using these can result in shortness of breath, damaged or collapsed lungs, bruised or cracked ribs, torn skin, back pain, spinal damage, dizziness, and permanent damage to the breast tissue.
Do not be tempted to use an elastic bandage, as this becomes very uncomfortable and dangerously constrictive if it is pulled tight enough to have an effect.

Locate and release the crown.,
Pull the crown all the way out.,
Rotate the crown to change the time.,
Secure the crown.,
Wind it regularly.,
Wear it more often.,
Get it serviced as needed.,
Avoid exposing it to harsh conditions.",How to Adjust the Time on a Rolex Replica," On the right side of a Rolex there is a small, circular dial called the “crown” that allows you to control the mechanism of the watch. Unscrew the crown and pull it out from the watch base. Once the crown is extended, it puts the watch in position to be wound to change the time.The crown dial is found in the same position on all Rolex models.;
, After unscrewing and releasing the crown, make sure it is pulled out all the way. Pulling the crown out to its first position allows you to wind the watch to make sure it’s keeping accurate time, while the second position determines the day and display date and extending it fully to the third position lets you manipulate the hour and minute hands. If your Rolex replica has the wrong day displayed, make this change first, then proceed to adjust the time.Both hands of the watch will stop completely when the crown is pulled all the way out.
On certain models, the display date can be changed from the third position. Otherwise, this position will only be used for adjusting the watch's exact time.

, Now that the crown is in the proper position, rotate it clockwise to wind the gears inside the watch and change the position of the hour and minute hands. Twist the crown slowly so that you don’t overshoot the correct time. If you do wind it too far, you can rotate it counterclockwise until both hands are where they need to be.Rotating the crown counterclockwise also allows you to change the display date on some Rolex models. You may have to do a little testing to find out which position the crown on your particular model needs to be in to manipulate the date.

, If you’re satisfied that you have the correct time, return the crown to it’s original position by pushing it back into the base of the watch. Screw the crown into place to secure it. That’s it! Rolex watches are prized for their simple, intuitive design and ease of use, which is another reason they are so often imitated.Screw the crown back into its resting position to make sure it is completely secured. If not, the crown may accidentally enter another position and throw off the time or date of your display.
Securing the crown on an authentic Rolex also forms a seal that keeps the watch waterproof. This may or may not be the case for a replica Rolex.

, Mechanical watches need to be wound by hand periodically to ensure that the mechanical parts are being given enough kinetic energy to stay in motion and keep time accurately. Rolex technicians recommend winding their watches about 20 rotations once a month or so; if you’re using a knock-off, the watch will probably lose time faster and you might need to wind it more frequently.To wind a Rolex-style watch, unscrew and release the crown until it is in the first position. Don’t pull it out any further. The crown will then be ready to rotated, winding the watch’s mechanical innards. Wind the crown stem until you start to feel resistance, then push the crown back into place and screw to secure it.Wind your watch every few days to keep it from losing time.

, As a rule, the more you wear your watch, the better time it keeps. The kinetic energy generated by wearing the watch on your wrist as it moves is transferred to the watch to keep the gears running. Make sure your watch is getting plenty of wear, or you may find that it is becoming less accurate.If you’re not in the habit of wearing a watch, or are for some reason unable to, consider purchasing a watch-winder. Watch-winders are small devices that rotate your unworn watch continuously, mimicking natural motion. Leaving your watch on a watch-winder when you’re not wearing it can prevent it from losing time as quickly., Watches, like cars and other mechanical appliances, require regular service. Take your Rolex replica to a watch specialist once or twice a year to have it inspected for mechanical flaws. A watch specialist can alter and replace springs, repair broken gears and keep the watch running like new.Watchmakers and specialists can usually identify tough to explain mechanical problems that might cause your watch to run poorly or stop altogether.
Certain mechanical parts may wear out faster on replica models. It might be a good idea to get these parts replaced every so often.

, Replica Rolexes, while fine watches in their own right, are not made to quite the same specifications as the real thing, and as a result are more easily upset or damaged. Try not to expose your watch to excess moisture, and be careful about dropping it or allowing it to absorb impact. Even if these things don’t break your watch outright, they may hinder the internal mechanics enough to render it unusable.Mechanical watches are also susceptible to changes in gravity, polar positioning and magnetism. They require greater care and upkeep than digital and satellite watches.If you’re planning any sort of dirty or physical activity, it may be best to leave your Rolex replica behind. These watches were designed more for casual wear, and while they may be more capable of withstanding a moderate amount of punishment, it’s better not to take chances.

Make sure they fit.,
Consider thongs.,
Try boy shorts.,
Look for seamless panties.,
Take care with color.,
Go commando.",How to Avoid Panty Lines1," The most important thing is to purchase panties that fit! Make sure they are not too tight, or else they will dig in to your skin and cause unsightly panty lines. At the same time, if you choose underwear that is too loose, it can easily wrinkle up inside your clothes, showing wrinkles and bumps.If the elastic is cutting into your skin and feels restrictive, your underwear is too tight.
If there is any excess fabric hanging down or you feel like your underwear isn't supporting your butt at all, it's probably too big.;
, Thongs simply don’t have the lines to show, making them the ideal panty line-free choice. While they may not be the most comfortable underwear, they are a good option when you are wearing especially tight clothing.Be sure to check out the rear view when you sit or squat, as these positions tend to expose part of the thong if you’re wearing low-cut pants.
If you're concerned about your thong showing when you squat, be sure to wear high-waisted pants and skirts or shirts that extend lower than the waistline of your bottoms.
G-strings have even less fabric than thongs, so they're the best choice for minimizing panty lines.
Keep in mind that thongs are much less comfortable if they are too tight, so get one that fits properly.

, For those who hate thongs, there is another alternative! Boy shorts provide full coverage, and because they do not cut across your butt, they offer a much more seamless look than most bikini-style underwear.You need to be more cautious with boy shorts than you do with thongs because they do not completely eliminate the possibility of a visible panty line. It's a good idea to test them out with your favorite pair of form-fitting pants.
You can find boy shorts in many different materials. Choose one that you find comfortable and that has invisible or very minimal seams.
Make sure your boy shorts fit snugly, but don't cut into your skin.

, Most major lingerie brands have a line of seamless panties, so there are plenty of different styles to choose from. Many of these styles have laser cut edges, which are very thin edges that do not leave a visible panty line. Elastic and spandex panties are very good for a seamless look.
Unfortunately, cotton panties, which are the best for feminine health because of their breathability, are typically not seamless because the fabric is too thick.

, Match your underwear to your skin tone when wearing light-colored clothing. Flesh-colored underwear blends in with your skin, leaving invisible panty lines, even if your pants are a bit see-through., If you're brave enough to do this, simply don't wear underwear. This is the only way to know that there are no panty lines whatsoever.


Going commando is best when wearing pants. Always wear underwear with skirts and dresses.
Be sure to wash your pants after each use when going commando to prevent infections like bacterial vaginosis and yeast infections.Some workout pants are actually made with special linings so that they can be worn without underwear. If you feel uncomfortable doing this, you can also go ""faux commando"" by ordering disposable cotton patches that adhere to the inside of your pants, allowing you the freedom of no underwear without any discomfort."
"
Try shapewear.,
Wear tights.,
Consider a slip.",How to Avoid Panty Lines2," If you want a totally smooth look without wearing a thong or skipping the panties altogether, consider wearing shapewear under your clothes. These undergarments typically extend to your mid thigh, so there will not be a panty line. They also suck in unwanted bulges, and they're available in a variety of styles for different body types and different outfits.You can wear panties under your shapewear or not, depending on your personal preferences.
If you just want to smooth out your butt, upper thighs, and/or lower stomach, you can buy panty-style shapewear. For more coverage, you can opt for a pant-style that extends further down your legs or a bodysuit-style that covers your upper body (except your chest) as well.Shapewear should not be used to attempt to fit into a smaller size of clothing. If it feels overly restrictive or you begin to experience numbness or tingling, your shapewear is too tight., If shapewear isn't for you, you may be able to get the same benefits from a pair of tights or pantyhose. Wear a pair under your pants or with a skirt for a smooth look.As with shapewear, you do not need to wear underwear under your tights or pantyhose if you don't want to. The choice is up to you.
You can buy high-waisted styles if you want some coverage over your stomach, although tights will never give you as much control as shapewear.

, If you're wearing a skirt or dress, consider wearing a slip or half slip underneath. This old-school accessory can help you achieve the seamless look you want.A full slip covers your entire torso and the upper parts of your legs, and is meant to be worn with a dress. A half slip covers only your butt and upper legs, and is meant to be worn with a skirt.
Many slips contain some lycra, which helps shape your body and prevents the garment from bunching. If you are looking for a little extra control, you can also find shapewear in slip styles.Try to match the color of your slip to your dress or skirt as much as possible. This will make the slip less visible if it ever peeks out from under your clothes.
Make sure your slip is always shorter than any slits in your dress or skirt.Avoid slips with lace details, as this may show through your clothing.To avoid static cling between your slip and your garment, try gently pulling each item through a wire hanger before you put it on.

Avoid skin-clinging clothing.,
Choose thicker fabrics.,
Opt for prints.,
Steer clear of see-through pants.",How to Avoid Panty Lines3," Extremely tight clothing will always bring out a panty line if there is one to bring out. If you don't feel comfortable going commando or wearing a thong, but you don't want panty lines, avoid wearing super clingy pants and skirts.


Leggings are especially likely to show panty lines. If you want to wear them with regular panties, consider wearing a tunic-length shirt with them. The shirt will cover your butt, so you won't have to worry about whether or not your panty lines are visible through your leggings.
If you love to wear skirts, consider wearing a loose-fitting style that will not show panty lines as much. For example, instead of wearing a tight pencil skirt, wear an A-line skirt.

, Pants and skirts made from thick, textured fabrics are much less likely to show panty lines than silky, clingy fabrics. If you don't want to have to worry about panty lines, choose fabrics like denim and tweed over fabrics like jersey and silk.Rear pockets add extra fabric to the seat of your pants, so they may also help hide panty lines.
Keep in mind that not all denim is created equal. Some is much thicker, while some is thinner and stretchier. Opt for thicker, less clingy styles if you are trying to avoid panty lines.

, Prints are better at disguising panty lines than solid colors, so if you want to wear some tight leggings or yoga pants with your regular undies, you may want to choose a patterned pair.Remember that prints will not eliminate panty lines; they will only help disguise them. It's a good idea to check for panty lines in the mirror before you go out.

, You definitely have to put a lot of thought into choosing the right underwear when you are wearing pants that are even remotely see-through. If you don't want to have to worry about it, avoid wearing any bottoms that may show more than you want.White pants are common culprits, so always make sure you can't see your underwear through them before you buy them.
Leggings and yoga pants can also be see-through, so make sure you buy a pair that is thick and opaque.

If the watch is just slightly loose and you aren't in danger of it falling off, you might consider leaving it as is unless it is bothersome.
If your watch is too small, you will have to buy extra links from the manufacturer to make the band larger.;
, Pinch the band evenly from the clasp until it is the proper size.Make sure you have an equal number of links on either side of the clasp that need to be removed.
This will make sure the watch itself stays centered on the wrist band.
Write down the number of links that need to be removed from either side of the clasp.

, There are several things you will need to adjust your watch band.You will need one or two push pins. You will use these to push the pins that hold the links together out of their holes.
Get a pair of needle nosed pliers to help you remove the pins.
You will need a small jewelry hammer.
Make sure you are working on a flat surface with good lighting. You will need to collect any pins you remove from the band.

, Be sure to leave about 1⁄2 centimeter (0.2 in) of space between the bottom of each removable link and the flat surface.Count up the number of links you will need to remove.

Choose earrings that frame your face.,
Wear rings that flatter your hands.,
Consider your skin tone.,
Compliment your frame.",How to Accessorize With Jewelry," Your jewelry should be appropriate for where you are going. Are you wearing jewelry to work? This is time to be more conservative with your accessorizing. Are you at a formal event? If so, consider wearing more fine jewelry and gemstones. Are you hanging out with friends or going to a party? Then be playful, fun and more daring with your look.


Small, dainty jewelry is best for work. Stud earrings instead of dangling earrings are acceptable. Your jewelry at work should never be distracting.If you are unsure what is appropriate, see what the other women at the office wear and follow suit.;
, You have so many options when it comes to jewelry. Bracelets, necklaces, earrings, watches, and rings are all available. All jewelry comes in different shapes, lengths, materials and widths. Whatever you choose should compliment your outfit and personal style. If you are new to accessorizing, start with a pair of stud earrings. Studs are appropriate for every occasion and can be worn with other jewelry as well., If you are wearing a busy outfit with a loud print, your jewelry should be more subdued. If you are wearing a plain, simple outfit, you can wear more creative jewelry to transform your outfit.Remember your jewelry is an addition to your outfit and should never compete with what you are wearing.


If your outfit is already embellished with jewels, skip the necklace and wear some simple earrings.Your jewelry can also be used to bring your outfit together.For example, if you are wearing a black dress with red shoes, you could wear some red jewelry to pull the outfit together.
For example, you would not wear a huge, statement necklace with a leopard print top. However, you could be much more adventurous with a plain white tee or blouse.

, It used to be taboo to wear gold, silver, copper, rose gold, etc. However, this is no longer the case.Feel free to mix up different metals. Another way to mix and match is by playing with size, width, and texture. Wear bracelets of different widths or necklaces of different lengths.


You can also stack rings on your fingers as well. Try doubling up or wearing a regular ring and a midi ring on the same finger.
Necklaces and wrist wear (e.g. bracelets, bangles, cuffs, and watches) can be stacked as well.

, A necklace should compliment the neckline of your clothing. You want the necklace to be visible, yet not compete with your outfit. The right necklace can emphasize and enhance your outfit.On the other hand, the wrong can be a distraction and take away from what you are wearing.


Try a long pendant necklace if you are wearing a deep V neckline. The necklace should hit right above your cleavage.
A short, statement necklace looks great with a sweetheart neckline.
Layered necklaces and statements necklaces look nice with crew neck cut clothing.

, An easy way to begin accessorizing is to build around one piece of jewelry such as a statement necklace, ring, or bracelet.This piece would be the focus of your outfit, and then all the other pieces would be minimal. For example, if your earrings are the focal point, you may wear a simple band on your finger and a dainty necklace.


If your necklace is the centerpiece, wear stud earrings and minimal rings or bracelets.
Your watch and bracelet could also be the focus of your accessorizing. If this is the case, do not wear earrings or necklaces that would compete with your wrist jewelry.

, The color of your jewelry does not have to be the exact same color as your outfit or the other jewelry that you are wearing.You can wear multiple complimentary colors or wear a pop of color if your outfit is all neutral colors.If you are unsure what colors will look best with your clothing, take a look at a color wheel. Find whatever color you are wearing on the wheel and then look across the wheel to determine which colors are complimentary.Wearing metal jewelry is always a safe bet if you are not sure about what colors to wear.
Diamonds and diamond-looking jewelry are also safe no matter what colors you are wearing.If your outfit is a neutral color (e.g. black, white, gray, etc.), you can wear some bright colored jewelry to add some color and personality to your look.

, Different styles of earrings are more flattering depending on the shape of your face. If you have a long or oval shaped face, try studs or shorter drop earrings. If you have a square or round face, pendant earrings will look nice. Hoop earrings compliment every face shape.These are just suggestions for choosing earrings. At the end of the day, wear earrings that you like and that you feel confident wearing.

, Rings are a beautiful addition to any outfit. To make your fingers look longer, wear narrow bands. If your fingers are already thin, you can get away with wearing wider bands.As a rule, your left hand is for serious jewelry like wedding and engagement rings or family heirlooms. Your right hand is for more playful and over-sized rings., Jewelry is worn close to your skin so look for jewelry that compliments your tone. Cool skin tones have bluish colored veins and have more pink and red undertones. Warm skin tones have greenish colored veins and more yellow undertones. If you have a cool skin tone, platinum and white gold will look best. If you have a warm skin tone, yellow gold and rose gold will look best.Rose gold actually looks good with a variety of skin tones.Go ahead and give it a try.
Gemstones such as yellow diamonds, Citrine, Garnet, Morganite, Ruby, and Peridot are recommended for warm skin tones.
Emerald, Opal, Amethyst, Aquamarine, Zircon, and Tanzanite are recommended for cool skin tones.
No matter your skin tone, diamonds or diamond-like jewelry will always look nice.

, Jewelry will look different depending on your height, body type, and bust size. If you have a smaller frame, thin and dainty jewelry is very complimentary. However, dainty jewelry may not stand out as much on a larger frame. If you have a larger frame, try some chunkier jewelry.


If you are 5'4"" or smaller, go for necklaces that sit on or just below your collarbone.If you are tall and/or have a long torso, any necklace length is usually fine. Keep in mind that shorter necklace lengths may get lost.
The shorter your neck, the thinner the necklace should be. For example, you would not wear a choker if you have a very short neck.

Pick your path to becoming a jewelry designer.,
Learn the basics.,
Give yourself a competitive edge with a degree.,
Plan a timeline.,
Learn the process of creation.",How to Become a Jewelry Designer1," There are many different routes you can take to becoming a professional and skilled jewelry designer. One way you can help pick your own path is by deciding what you may want to specialize in.Decide if you want to only design, or design and create your jewelry.


If you want to stick with just the design aspect, you may consider focusing on your illustration skills, as well as getting an education in fashion and jewelry design.If you want to create your designs, you will then have to gain practice, knowledge, and expertise in working with medals, jewels, and various raw materials used to create jewelry. Try attending a reputable trade school for jewelers.Many jewelry designers skip school and learn through apprenticeships and on-the-job training they find by applying for work at reputable jewelers.;
, New jewelry designers usually just start out by learning how to adjust, re-shape, and resize jewelry. From there, you can learn more difficult elements such as cutting and setting stones, mold-making, metalworking and engraving. Once you have these basic skills learned, you can focus on your personal style in areas of shape and texture that you can practice mastering.


Jewelers suggest learning about gemology, sales and jewelry fabrication in order to understand the process of jewelry production from beginning to end.While you do not need a formal education, there are certain skills you may want to consider taking classes on. You will need manual dexterity, artistic skills, steady hands, experience with CAD software to design, the ability to visual design ideas to actual jewelry, and a knowledge of popular fashion., Depending on the specific route you take, you may benefit from going to school. Jewelry makers who become specialized or independent tend to be more successful with a formal education. Also, employers find jewelers with a degree more appealing because they do not require as much on-the-job training as a person without a formal education. This will help you stand out against competition. You can take your education as far as a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Fine Arts or Masters of Fine Arts in Metalwork and Jewelry Design.There are many accredited universities and art institutes that can give you the opportunity to cut and shape gems and pieces of metal first-hand.
A few of the best jewelry design schools are Rochester Institute of Technology in New York, Istituto Lorenzo De Medici – The LdM School of Design in Italy, and Birmingham City University in England.Advanced credentials and experience can help you one day if you decide to start your own business., Once you decide that you want to become a jewelry designer, you can begin practicing right away by signing and creating you ideas. However, if you are looking at finding a job, it may be helpful to know how many years you will have to put in before that may happen.If you decide to receive a formal education, you can be in school anywhere from two to six years.
You will need about one to two years of experience and on-the-job training to become a skilled designer. Keep in mind, you can receive this experience while you are still in school., When a jewelry designer has an idea for a piece of jewelry, or is presented with an idea from someone else, there are several steps that need to happen before that jewelry comes to life. Depending on the situation, the design phase usually takes about seven days, and the production can take about two weeks. Here is the typical process of design to final product:The designer will start by drawing their ideas on paper with pencils. It has become common to design jewelry with special computer software that can give a better idea of what the piece will look like in 3D.The next step is to make a 2D design into a 3D prototype. This can be done in various ways such as 3D printing, CAD, or clay or wax molds that can be filled with melted metal.Once the prototype is worked out, the jeweler can start casting the metal.A jeweler can then cut, polish, and set precious or semi-precious gemstones into the jewelry."
"
Gain experience by crafting at home.,
Expand your tool collection.,
Invest in a variety of pliers.",How to Become a Jewelry Designer2," You do not have to limit yourself to designing at a job or school. With the proper tools and materials, you can practice making your designs come to life. Materials and tools can become expensive, so you may want to start out with just the basic materials. Here are some general tools to get you started:


Scissors that are professional-quality are great for cutting into extra small places with ultra-sharp precision.Thread Clippers are useful for quick snipping work.
A standard graphing ruler is a basic piece of jewelry equipment that will help you visualize and create your designs.
Use less expensive materials than what you imagine your design ultimately having. If you are envisioning a piece with silver or gold fill, practice with copper wire or other base metal wire just to get the hang of things.
Hammers and mallets can be vital for forming jewelry., There are so many different types of tools required to make the wide range of jewelry available. The type of equipment you buy will become more specific once you decide what type of jewelry it is you want to create. Here is a list of common equipment used to make jewelry that you may or may not need:


Bead boards
Disks and templates
Anvils and blocks
Wire jigs
Stamps and punches

, Pliers may be one of the most helpful tools you use to help you create your designs. They are many different pliers out there, and they all offer a unique way to help you create jewelry. Here are essential pliers to have in your tool kit:Wire cutters are great for cutting headpins, eyepins and wire to string jewelry.Round nose pliers are good when you want a smooth curve and will help you in you make loops, bends, clasps and jump rings for wire work.Chain nose pliers have a flat surface and taper towards the tips which makes them great for getting into small spaces and gripping wire. They are also useful for opening and closing jump rings.Crimping pliers are a perfect tool for stringing beads because they have two notches on the jaws that easily secure tubes and beads."
"
Begin work in the industry.,
Network with as many people as you can.,
Learn good communication skills.,
Submerge yourself in the fashion culture.",How to Become a Jewelry Designer3," It is important to get your hands working as soon as possible to gain knowledge, practice, and skills. Apply at local jewelers to see if you can get your foot in the door in anyway possible. Even working in the front of the store as a cashier can teach you a lot. You can learn how jewelry is displayed and presented to the customer, and listen to the feedback they have about the pieces.


Be sure that any jewelers you work with know the direction you are headed so that as positions open, or help is needed designing or creating jewelry, you can be considered for the job.

, Spending time in an art, craft, or jewelry setting, and put the word out there that you have a passion for design. This is a great way to start a meaningful relationship with designers and other people who can help you launch your career in jewelry design.


Bring value to those relationship by letting people know what skills you can provide such as reliability, quality, sincerity, creativity, business and marketing knowledge, or dedication. Sell yourself and your skills so other people in the industry want to have a connection with you., Jewelers work closely with employees and customers to figure out designs and talk jewelry. You will have to communicate with your customer about what they are looking for in their piece. This will require you to have great interpersonal skills so you can build strong relationships to help you to successfully sell jewelry.Consider taking a communications class at a local college.
Remember to always be polite and friendly when talking to fellow employees and customers.

, Jewelry designers need to know what the latest fashions in jewelry are, as well as the history of jewelry, so they can stay current, and sell jewelry. This will require research, attention to detail, and input from other people. Regardless of the education you receive, or the skills you learn, you will not be a competitive designer unless you have creative ideas that appeal to other people.


Try to get internships with designers, or volunteer at fashion events to learn about great styles.
Read as many books as you can about the history of jewelry. Great books to start with are, History Of Jewelry by Black and Georgian Jewellery 1714-1830 by Ginny Redington.

Set up an Etsy account.,
Be prepared for economic booms and busts.,
Learn important skills to become an entrepreneur.,
Have a strong will.,
Take care of your health.",How to Become a Jewelry Designer4," These events pop-up throughout the country in large and small cities allowing vendors to rent a space to sell their product. If you want to sell your own product directly to the people, consider finding local fairs and shows near you, or go on the road with your jewelry. You will be charged an initial fee to have a spot at the show, but after that, the money you earn from your jewelry sales are yours.


This is also a great way to advertise your jewelry. Make business cards that let people know how they can contact you about your jewelry. Leave them out for people to take as they admire your pieces.

, Etsy is a great website for creative entrepreneurs who want to sell their homemade products online. You can post pictures of your jewelry for people to view and buy. It is a convenient way to sell your goods when you do not have your own website or store and you are trying to get started as an entrepreneur., As the economy fluctuates, so will jewelry sales. Although jewelry sells at even the worst of economic times, jewelry is seen as a luxury item and sales will definitely take a hit if the economy is struggling.Try to make the best use of your time regardless of the number of sales you do. You can use slower months when sales are down as an opportunity to design and make jewelry repairs.

, If you want to have your own store, be sure to learn all areas of the business, not just design and creation. You may want to just focus on jewelry design, but if you open your own store, you will have to know much more to become successful.Consider taking courses in business administration, merchandising, and entrepreneurship to help you start your business and become successful.

, There are many aspiring jewelry designers out there with no formal education for graphic or jewelry design. Regardless of where you stand with your knowledge on jewelry design, if you have the passion, you can become a designer. Whether that means working for yourself, or for another person, you can make it happen with passion, hard work, practice, and networking.It may take several years to find yourself in your dream position. Do not give up if things take a little longer to start happening for you than you expected.
Remember that learning a new skill takes a lot of practice. You may not have a natural knack for jewelry design at first, but with practice, you will improve your skills.

, Designing and creating jewelry can be hard on the body. You will spend many hours leaned over, shaping gems, and focusing your eyes on innate details. After a while, your body may start to ache, your hands may tense up, and your eyes can feel strained.


As you create, take time each hour to walk around, stretch out, and relax your eyes to prevent injury.
Always wear protective eye goggles when working with tools to cut and make jewelry.

, Jewelry industry positions and salaries vary widely. You may decide to pursue a career in retail sales or management, or if you prefer to work in a more creative capacity, you might opt for a job in design or manufacturing.

, More than half of all jewelry professionals and precious stone and metal workers were self-employed in 2008, and projections indicate that number will likely grow.

,How to Find Your Ring Size1,
"
Wrap flexible measuring tape around your finger.,
Record the measurement where the tape overlaps.,
Compare the measurement to a sizing chart.",How to Find Your Ring Size2," Wrap the tape close to the knuckle; this is the thickest part of your finger and you want to ensure the ring slides on comfortably. Make sure you use a cloth or plastic measuring tape; these will wrap around your finger more effectively. Using a metal tape measure is possible, but will be significantly more difficult and could even cause an injury.


Alternatively, many jewellers offer printable ring sizers on their websites. You can use these much like a tape measure, only the ring sizes are visible on the ruler itself, saving the work of converting measurements.
Don’t wrap the paper too tightly. Aim for a snug but comfortable fit.
Make sure to use the exact finger you want to size for. For an engagement ring, you should be sizing your left ring finger. This is because the size of your two ring fingers might be slightly different.The size of your fingers tends to change throughout the day. For best results, measure at the end of the day., Do this on a separate piece of paper with a pen or pencil. You can record the measurement in inches or millimeters, depending on the retailer. Many will have both measurements available but a European retailer might only have measurements in millimeters.


If using a printed ring sizer, mark the point where it overlaps directly on the ruler itself.

, You can find these charts at many online jewelry retailers. You can print this chart for easy reference, but usually you’ll just need to compare to the online chart. These charts convert measurements into ring sizes; for instance, 2.34” (59.5mm) would be a size 9.

If your measurement falls between two sizes, go for the largest size.
If using a printed ring sizer, note where you marked the overlap to determine your ring size.

"
"
Find and print a ring sizing chart.,
Find a ring you own that fits the finger you’re trying to size.,
Place your ring over the circles on the chart.",How to Find Your Ring Size3," Many online jewelry retailers offer printable charts that show a number of circles of different sizes.If you print the chart from the jeweller you plan to order from, you’ll know the sizing on the chart will match the sizing of their products.


In order to ensure that the size chart is not distorted in printing, make sure any scaling options on your printer are turned off.

, Choose a ring that fits snugly, but isn’t too tight. Make sure the ring fits the correct finger; even your two ring fingers can be different sizes.

, The circle should match the inside of the ring for the perfect fit.If you are having trouble choosing between two close sizes, you should opt for the larger size.

Opt for a thick headband over a thin headband.,
Avoid novelty headbands.,
Consider a leather headband for professional occasions.,
Play with a crochet headband for a feminine, delicate touch.,
Look at fabric headbands for a comfortable, versatile option.,
Try a few plastic headbands for a wide selection.,
Keep your hair in place with a toothed headband.",How to Choose a Sophisticated Headband1," Thin headbands tend to serve a more practical use, while thick headbands generally look more decorative. Some thin headbands may create a sophisticated look, but you will have a far easier time creating that look with a thicker band.;
, Novelty bands are typically seen around holidays or special events. They often feature attachments like reindeer antlers or rabbit ears. Other novelty bands may simply have a holiday themed print, such as shamrocks or pumpkins. Neither type is sophisticated, however, and all novelty headbands should be avoided when trying to create a mature style.

, In a broad sense, ""leather"" headbands refer to any headband covered in suede, vinyl, or genuine leather. These bands typically have a very structured, unadorned look to them that works well with many office dress codes.

, Crochet headbands may be made of stiff yarn or a variety of other materials. In most cases, the band is not stiff, like a standard headband is, but floppy. It stays fixed on the head through elastic. They usually have a colorful, flowery appearance that looks very feminine.

, Fabric headbands can be made from a number of materials in a wide range of colors and patterns. Many fabric bands are stretchy and elastic, while others are consist of soft fabric glued onto a stiff headband base. For more sophisticated styles, look for fabric bands made from glossy materials.

, Plastic headbands are likely the most common and most varied. Many plastic bands are considered casual, but many others are molded into a range of classy shapes and designs that make them suitable for sophisticated looks.

, These bands have small plastic teeth along the band to help keep it in place. Individuals with thin hair may benefit the most from these bands, since they slide around less than headbands without teeth typically do. Many stylish headbands also come with teeth, especially bands made from plastic.

"
Opt for solid colors over patterns.,
Keep things conservative with neutral colors.,
Add a little personality into your ensemble with a pale colored headband.,
Choose elegant patterns for a change of pace.,
Avoid bright colors and loud patterns.,
Compensate for bolder colors by choosing a more elegant material.",How to Choose a Sophisticated Headband2," If you feel a little uncertain about where to begin, start by selecting a nice, simple headband in a solid color. Many patterns still look sophisticated, but solid colors are generally more versatile and work for more occasions than many patterns.

, Think black, brown, gray, beige, white, muted gold, or muted silver. A neutral colored headband is subdued enough for more conservative settings, like businesses and conferences, but sophisticated enough to make you look clean and well put together.

, Baby blues, rose petal pinks, lavenders, and buttercup yellows have a delicate, feminine aura that aids in creating a sophisticated look.

, Look for plastic headbands with mock-lace designs, or fabric headbands with a soft floral or muted argyle print. Stick with patterns meant to evoke a sense of grace or class, and look for subdued hues.

, For example, a lime green headband or a one with hot pink flames will probably not evoke the sense of sophistication you were hoping for. Use your discretion to determine what colors and patterns might be too bold.

, If you prefer stronger colors, look for a cloth headband made of silk, satin, or a similarly glossy material. This adds a level of elegance to the headband that offsets the boldness of the color or pattern. For instance, a plastic leopard print headband will probably not look very sophisticated, but a silk leopard print headband might.

"
"
Keep your embellishments subdued.,
Try a scarf headband.,
Wear bows with caution.,
Look for feathers that follow the curve of the headband.,
Consider a headband with a costume jewelry gemstone.,
Look at headbands with flower embellishments.",How to Choose a Sophisticated Headband3," A little detailing on the band can be stylish in a mature way, but too much can have the reverse effect. For instance, a carefully placed fake flower can make a headband look decorative, but a band completely covered in fake flowers will look youthful rather than mature.

, A scarf headband is a thick headband with two extra pieces of fabric hanging off the ends. Tie this fabric beneath your hair and let it hang down in a knot or bow. This combines the look of a thick headband with the look of a scarf. Both items are chic accessories, and the combination works well to create a sense of fashion forwardness.

, A small, carefully placed bow may look mature, but bows can easily look girlish, instead. Look for a thick headband with a small cloth bow placed on the side, and gravitate toward bows made from glossy materials. Avoid headbands with large bows, brightly colored bows, bows with loud patterns, or bows placed at the top center of the band.

, Feathers can also look immature if worn the wrong way. Look for dark feathers that curve alongside a stiff plastic or cloth-covered band. Avoid crazy colors like hot pink or neon orange, unless these colors are carefully matched with black or another neutral. Also avoid feathered headbands that have feathers sticking straight up.

, A small crystalline brooch placed at the side of the headband adds just enough glitz to the accessory to make it sophisticated.

, Small cloth flowers or woven plastic flowers are both good options. Avoid headbands that are covered in multiple, brightly colored flowers. Instead, opt for a band with one flower or one subdued cluster of flowers.

Try the straw hat in bold colors, like yellow or pink, or go for something softer, like coral or turquoise. You can also wear them in darker staples, like navy or red.Bucket hats and newsboy caps are fitting looks for warm weather as long as the material and color are light. A khaki colored hat coordinates especially well with a white outfit to create a natural look.;
, The combination of white and tan creates a leisurely appearance. A tan belt on a white outfit gives a pop of color while remaining neutral.A tan belt strapped across a loose-fit blouse adds structure to your outfit.
Try a tan belt with white pants and a white t-shirt.
For a sleeker evening look, wear a skinny belt with a fitted white dress and tan shoes.

, White can be monotonous, but a bright red or blue belt can throw enough color into your ensemble to draw the eye. If tan is too neutral for you, add a belt that has a bit more color.Choose a patent leather belt for chic flair.
Pair a colorful belt with a long, flowing white maxi dress.
Try a silk sash for a touch of daytime elegance.

, A silver or gold chain belt looks elegant enough for evening and creates a nice amount of visual interest against a plain white background. If you don't like chain belts, try a black belt with a large metallic buckle.


Mix and match your metals for a chic look. You don't have to match gold with gold and silver with silver - have fun mixing it up as you accessorize., A leather jacket creates a tough, boyish look, while a sweater or wrap gives you a softer appearance. Black provides a crisp, stylish contrast to a white dress.Pairing black with your white dress can give you a sleek look for evening.

, If you want something a little more fun, wear a colorful blazer, jacket, sweater, or shrug with your white outfit. Go for something bold in fuchsia for an attention getting look, a soft pastel for a romantic summer day, or an earth-tone for a boho chic look., For a casual day look, or a casual summer night, pair your white dress with a denim vest or your white t-shirt and white jeans with a denim jacket.This look is classic, gives your outfit texture, and can be paired with bold, colorful accessories.

, One great way to accessorize and break up the monotone of a white outfit is to pair it with a summer scarf.Try it in a bold color, a soft flower pattern, or even an animal print., Instead of wrapping the scarf around your neck, try wrapping it around your head as a stylish headband. If you don't want to use a scarf as a headband, buy a colorful headband to accent your outfit. Go for flowers, rhinestones, or feathers.


Leave the scarf open for a casual look. Wrap it around your neck and let the tails hang down as you go out for the evening.Wrapping it as a cowl neck works for just about any look.

, Summer is the perfect time to accessorize with sunglasses, and sunglasses are the perfect accent to a summer white outfit. Choose large black shades, vintage cat-eye sunglasses in red, or rad Rayban-style in neon colors.

, Beige and tan flats work great for a casual, neutral look. Colored and textured footwear also gives a casual style while providing a pop of color. Typically, simpler is better when going for a casual style.


Consider a denim or light pink canvas flat for a change of pace.

, Metallic shoes can be a great compliment to a white outfit. Go for closed-toe flats in silver, slingbacks in gold, or embellished bronze gladiator sandals. Metallic flats are extremely versatile and can be worn with dressy or casual outfits.

, When putting together a classy day look, choose dressier flats to accompany your white outfit. Look for bright colors to add variety to an otherwise plain look.


Try wedge sandals for a dressy day look. This shoe looks good with most outfits., Stilettos and other slim designs work especially well for nighttime, and a black shoe adds just the right amount of distinction to your feet.


Try a metallic heel. Look for a tall, strappy stiletto heel to quickly turn your outfit from simple to glamorous.
Go for a pair of bold stilettos. Bright red pumps and colorful pink or yellow stilettos can really help accessorize your outfit, and take it to the next level for evening wear while keeping it summery., Tote-style shoulder bags work great for casual outfits. A white outfit makes a perfect blank canvas, so don't be afraid to look for a bag with a bold color or bright pattern.


Look for a canvas tote-style handbag. These are great for boho chic styles. Opt for a bag in a color found in everyday nature. Think brown, sky blue, and grass green.

, If you are putting together a casual day outfit, choose a bold colored bag or one in a neutral tone. Both large or moderately sized bags will look great. For a dressier look, gravitate toward bags made from more sophisticated materials, like leather, instead of casual materials like canvas.

, For an evening look, choose a small clutch. A sparkly silver or gold handbag can look lively enough for a party and elegant enough for a formal reception. A bold blue, red, or yellow clutch can bring a bit of fun while still keeping you sophisticated.

, For summer white outfits, wear stackable silver rings and chunky bangle bracelets. Chunky pieces look a little more playful than delicate pieces, making them more suited for casual dress. The simplicity of a white outfit also allows bold jewelry to take center stage without competition.

, Since white is such a simple color, a long pendant that extends well below your neckline is an appropriate way to add visual interest to your outfit. A nature-themed design, such as a flower or leaf, plays into the boho style.

, For a dressier look, stack thin bangles on your wrist to create a whimsical look while adding detail to a simple white background.

, Dangling earrings with baby blue aquamarine stones or delicate pendants set in silver are perfect for summer. Light tones work well for daytime and coordinate with white to create a delicate, classy appeal.

, If you would rather try for city chic than quiet elegance, bold colors are the way to go. Look for costume jewelry necklaces strewn with bright red, green, or orange gemstones. Long necklaces that drape over your front are especially effective at adding vigor to your ensemble.

, If you want an elegant touch to your evening white outfit, wear simple pearl pieces, like bracelets or post earrings. If you wear a pearl necklace, choose one that hugs your neck instead of one that hangs over your blouse or dress. Pearls look elegant, even with a white outfit, but pearls that overlap with your outfit will only get lost.


Try black or pink pearls. Black pearls and other shades, like pink, can add a nice twist to your look.

, If you want a simple, sleek look, go for an all white outfit adorned by black jewelry. The black-and-white look can be very timeless. Wear long necklaces, dangling earrings, and chunky rings. If your outfit itself is relatively unadorned, you can get away with wearing multiple strong pieces.


Add a simple black belt, black heels, or even a black jacket to complete your black-and-white outfit.

, These bold earrings do not look good with other pieces of jewelry, especially at the neck, but they make a stunning focal point when hanging above a white dress or blouse with a low neckline.

Wear leg warmers with flats and tights.,
Wear 'em with pumps.,
Wear leg warmers with a skirt.,
Wear 'em over jeans.,
Wear them peeking above your calf-high boots.,
Wear them on top of your ankle boots.,
Go totally urban.,
Rumple them up a little bit.,
Stick to neutral colors.",How to Wear Leg Warmers1," If it's 40 degrees outside and you're just dying to wear that dress, leg warmers and leggings or footless tights are a great option. Black tights and black leg warmers are an understated, classic combination. It's like wearing boots, but much more comfortable!


Make sure they're a little bit bunched, especially around the ankle. They shouldn't be so low they're dragging on the ground, but there should be overlap between your shoe and the leg warmer.;
, This one takes a bit more confidence, though it's a totally acceptable look. As long as your heels are on the understated side, leg warmers will look good. Stick to heels that are nude, brown, black, or gray.

Leg warmers are a cozy look. If you're wearing stripper heels that glow-in-the-dark, leg warmers will look a bit out of place. Unless your leg warmers are glow-in-the-dark too, of course.

, This is the same concept as with a dress. Tights are only necessary if the weather requires it, though they can streamline the leg. If you have a skirt that's a little on the short side, leg warmers can make it more modest.


Your shoe options are endless here. Flats, pumps, boots -- it's all good. Just keep the colors neutral yet varied!

, You know those skinny jeans you have, but your pear shape makes you feel a little funny wearing them too often? Wear leg warmers over them! Problem immediately solved. Again, your footwear here can be anything. Anything but flip flops!, For an extra textual touch (or a bit more warmth), wear them just peeking above your boots. Anywhere from 2-6 inches is good.Don't worry about matching colors. Unless you're wearing black, this will be hard to do. Different shades of brown and beige are totally fine. It'll just draw attention to your attention for detail!

, If the pants, skirt, or dress you're wearing don't go well with your calf-high boots, you can get a similar look with ankle boots and leg warmers. Just pull them a bit over the tops of your booties and scrunch 'em up!

, Wear them with Converse or Converse high tops for an urban look. No one said leg warmers had to be for dressed up occasions! You can wear them whenever you want!


Fashion is, as of late, about intentional chaos.If it doesn't go together, in a way it...goes together. A quick Google search will verify this if you're skeptical. So if you're think you're not in line with current trends, just in being so, you are. Blowing your mind, huh?

, Leg warmers are not meant to be stretched flat. You want them below your knee and appearing a bit loose. If you don't have them hidden by a boot, they should be about 4-6 inches (10-15 cm) from your knee, extending down to just above your heel.

, What makes leg warmers wearable after the millennium is their inconspicuousness. When they used to be neon yellow and pink, now they're mostly donned in browns, beiges, blacks, navies, and creams. While they don't have to be a color in your outfit necessarily, stick to neutrals that match everything.


Leg warmers are a definite accessory and shouldn't really be a focal point. If your eye goes straight to your leg warmers, you're probably doing it wrong.

Get leg warmers in neon colors and patterns.,
Wear those ell-dubs with matching fingerless gloves.,
Make sure your clothes are in the same color family.,
Pair 'em with your old school Nikes or Converse.",How to Wear Leg Warmers2," 1983 was awesome. If you weren't there, know that it was awesome. You could practically go hunting in your day clothes you were so brightly-colored. Sunglasses were worn just so you could look at your friends' bright orange shoulder pads. Sadly the 80s are over, but you can bring them back with some bright plaid leg warmers!


They can either be a solid, bright color or several colors in a pattern. As long as they can't be missed, you're good. Magenta, lemon yellow, magenta and lemon yellow in a paisley pattern -- don those bad boys like you're being paid by Cosmo.

, Someone less in tune with fashion history would call this ""overkill."" But the 80s didn't have such a word in their vocabulary and fingerless gloves the same color and pattern as your legwarmers were a go-to look. It's called ""matching"" and it never occurred to anyone 30 years ago that it could be a bad thing.


Does your local leg warmer supply warehouse not have matching fingerless gloves? Well for one, shame on them. For two, looks like you're going to have to take matters into your own hands. Take out that sweater your grandma knitted you in 2007 and put it to good use. Turn the arms into leg warmers and whip up some palm warmers out of the shoulders. She'll be glad you did something with it.
'83 was thirty years ago. If that fact makes you a little nauseated, you're not alone.

, Are you rocking fuchsia leg warmers? Hope you can find some fuchsia tights, a fuchsia skirt, and a fuchsia top. You'll look like you're straight outta Olivia Newton John's ""Physical"" video.You may not want to take this look to the gym, however.


Modern day shopping outlets not keen on your 80s throwback? That's what wikiHow's ""Dyeing Fabric"" article is for! Clothes aren't magically grown out of thin air by elves, you know. Make something yourself!

, The 80s were a little less...put together than fashion is now. How do you think they birthed the grunge era? Because of this, wear your leg warmers with anything. Tennis shoes? Sure. Chucks? Sure. The question is: Are your legs cold? If the answer is yes, wear leg warmers.


Most people are a little bit hipster, whatever that means. If you have any of that I-just-grabbed-this-out-of-my-closet-and-I-look-super attitude in you, leg warmers are a safe bet. If none of your outfit goes together, your leg warmers make sense. In other words, it's a crazy, mixed-up world, and you can't do it wrong. Leg warmers in the morning', leg warmers, in the evening', leg warmers at dinner time.

Wear fascinators to formal events.",How to Wear a Fascinator," If you want to wear a fascinator with your hair slicked back, then go with a smaller one. If you’re going to wear your hair loosely pulled up, then a medium size is probably best. Wear a large fascinator if you’re wearing your hair down and in a voluminous style., If it’s warmer outside, you’ll want to go with a fascinator that’s made of a lighter, more breathable material, such as straw. In the winter time, wear a fascinator made of a heavier, thicker material, such as wool or felt., Your fascinator will give off a more subtle, classy boldness if it looks like it belongs with the outfit you're wearing. To ensure this, wear a fascinator that’s the same color as the clothes you’re wearing., Redheads look best with a fascinator that’s an earth tone, such as beige, brown, or deep green. If you have blond hair, try wearing a light warm color like coral or a neutral like taupe. Finally, opt for bright, deep shades such as hot pink or emerald if you have brown hair., It looks best to create a contrast between your fascinator shape and your face shape. If you have a more round face, opt for a slightly taller fascinator. If you have a longer or thinner face, a spherical or disc-shaped fascinator looks best., Since headbands are secured behind the ears and so are glasses, those with glasses will feel more secure and comfortable wearing elastic securing fascinators. Additionally, try to keep the style of the fascinator simple to avoid looking too “busy” in combination with your glasses., Don’t wash your hair the day of the event. With many hairstyles, dirty hair holds pins and grips better than freshly washed hair., For added security, take a section of your hair where you’re going to put the fascinator and comb the hair back toward the center of your head.This backcombing, or teasing, will create knotting and volume, which will make the fascinator hold better.

, Spray the hair that you just backcombed with a hairspray to ensure that the section will stay teased., Push the comb piece attached to your fascinator firmly against your scalp towards the back of your head to make sure it’ll stay in position throughout the day., If you’re wearing a big, showy fascinator, you’ll most likely need to secure it with a headband. Headband fascinators are the best for creating stability. You can even add a headband to a comb fascinator to take security a step further.In addition to comb pieces and headbands, fascinators can be secured with elastic bands or hairclips.

, The best place to wear a fascinator is either on the right or left side of your head. Wearing it towards the front of your head correctly is sometimes acceptable, but try wearing it on the side a few times and getting comfortable with that before going for a bolder look.The fascinator should be placed just above either your right or left eyebrow., Many fascinators attach to your head with a subtle elastic band. This goes behind your ears and around the nape of your neck, not under your chin. This mistake looks silly and will not appear fashionable., Especially if you’re a first time wearer, it’s a good idea to wear a classic shape, such as a brimmed hat or a mini pillbox shape. With a fascinator, less is often more. To stay stylish, avoid oversized, elaborate styles that are distracting and overwhelming., Traditionally, fascinators include several different materials, including feathers, flowers, and lace. Stick with these and stay away from rhinestones when you’re choosing a fascinator. This adds a glitzy flair to the look that ends up looking a little too over-the-top and out of place, especially in excess. As a good rule of thumb, less detail is more., Fascinators can be a great accessory to add to an outfit, but make sure that you’re wearing it to events where it’s fitting. Garden parties, tea parties, and weddings are all great places to wear a fascinator.

Leave the fascinator at home if you’re attending the cinema, the symphony, or any other event that has stadium-style seating. It’s rude to block the people behind you."

Know what you’re dressing for.,
Iron your pocket square.",How to Fold a Pocket Square1," For a great complement to your outfit however, it should be a complementary color or pattern.


Some ties come with a pocket square, which you can wear together, or you can mix it up depending on your style preference.
If you don’t have a pocket square, both a handkerchief or bandana can also be used.;
, Not every occasion calls for a pocket square, so the material pattern should complement your outfit, tying it together.


For formal events, you may want to opt for a white, or subtle patterned pocket square that’s crisp and neatly ironed. The fold you use should serve to accent your outfit, not distract.
For casual events, feel free to be more ambitious. Go with brighter colors and louder patterns.

, Even if you are going more casual, it’s good to start with a clean, ironed pocket square or handkerchief.


Ironing your pocket square before folding will also make folding much easier.

, A bright red can look overwhelming if you use it in every part of your outfit. Instead, use different shades of red to create contrast while staying within an all-red color scheme.

, This shade is deep enough to mimic the classic look of black, but offers a subtle hint of color to your feet.

, If you have a bold personality, opt for a bold shoe. Shiny patent leather adds a trace of shimmer to your foot, which may prevent your red shoe from being obscured by your red dress.

, Think rubies or garnets. Gunmetal settings create a tough look, while silver and gold settings have classic appeal.

, Post earrings, bracelets, and rings do not overlap with your dress and can be admired on their own. Necklaces and long dangle earrings may brush your dress, and the red stones may blend in with the red fabric.

, Even though you can have an ensemble with multiple red pieces, you should still keep things toned down. A large red bag may wash you out with too much red. Instead, go for a small red clutch, especially one in a shade that varies from your dress.

, Too many red accessories can confuse the eye. Restrict your jewelry to one or two small pieces, and avoid any accessory that looks unnecessarily large.

Wear a few well-chosen accessories at a time.,
Pair bold accessories with understated clothes.,
Avoid being too matchy.,
Wear items that play up a color in your outfit.,
Balance the size of your pieces.,
Choose items that enhance your features.,
Use bold makeup as an accessory.",How to Accessorize1," A lot of people make the mistake of piling on all the accessories they own at once. When it comes to accessories, less is usually more. If you're wearing jewelry, a watch, a scarf, a hat and sunglasses, no one piece will stand out, and your outfit will end up looking cluttered. Choose a few accessories that accent your outfit or highlight the feature you want to play up.


Wearing a full jewelry getup, complete with earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and rings, can overwhelm your look. Try wearing either earrings or a necklace instead of both, and limiting how many rings you wear at once.
If you do wear a lot of different accessories, make sure they aren't competing for attention. Match your metals and colors so that your accessories look like they were chosen with intention. For example, you could wear big gold hoops, a colorful warm-toned scarf, and a gold watch for a streamlined look.;
, Neutral clothing can be completely transformed when you add a few bold accessories. If your wardrobe has a lot of neutrals like black, white, beige, olive or navy, accessorizing gives you a chance to play with fun colors and give your outfits a boost. The best thing about neutrals is that they look great with most other colors, so you don't have to worry too much about making sure your accessories match your clothes. Here are a few ways to use bold accessories to add some life to your neutral outfits:


Pair a thin red or hot pink belt with a black or navy dress.
Wear a splashy orange or yellow scarf or shoes with khaki or olive-colored clothing.
Freshen up your white blouse with a multicolored statement necklace or big drop earrings.

, It might be tempting to play off the blue polka dots in your dress with matching blue earrings, a blue necklace and blue shoes. However, matching to this extent can sometimes look a little old-fashioned or childish. Throwing some unexpected, yet surprisingly perfect accessories into the mix shows off your creativity and adds interest to the outfit.


Use the color wheel to help you come up with interesting color combinations that accent each other beautifully. For example, if you're wearing a purple shirt, try adding something mustard or lemon-colored to your outfit instead of hunting down the same shade of purple. Since yellow is opposite purple on the color wheel, your outfit will be appealing to the eye.
Wear colors with black and white. If you're wearing a black and white flowered top, then you could pop in an electric blue medium sized beaded necklace and some cute blue earrings.
While going overboard with matching is usually ill-advised, it can also be a lot of fun when you do it deliberately. Wearing red pants and a top with red sunglasses and a red scarf could look vintage and chic. Your monochrome look will be sure to turn heads.

, If you're wearing a multicolored outfit, accessories can add interest by allowing you to bring out one of the understated colors. For example, if your dress is black with a small flower pattern, you might wear ceramic bangles that match the green of the flower's leaves. Playing up one color makes the outfit look pulled together and elegant.


You can also use accessories to tie together two seemingly mismatched clothing items. Pick an accessory that shares colors with both of the clothing items, like a scarf that picks up the pink in your blouse and the beige in your pants. Now your outfit looks like it each piece was chosen with intention, rather than just thrown together.

, If you're wearing a pair of large, dangling earrings, don't pair them with an oversized statement accessory. Your look will be more balanced if you wear a smaller necklace (or no necklace at all) so that your face isn't overwhelmed by too much large jewelry. Keep the size of your various accessories in mind when you decide what to wear together.


Accessories can also be used to balance details on your clothes. If you're wearing blouse with interesting embroidery near the collar, you wouldn't want to wear a big scarf to cover it up. Instead, choose a thin chain that will accent but not hide the details you want to show off.
Let one item be the star of your look. If you're excited to wear an adorable new hat you just bought, don't wear your bold new belt at the same time.

, Accessories give you the opportunity to bring out the best in your face and body. Well-chosen accessories can make your eyes look bigger, your neck look slender, or your calves look more defined. For example,


Wear large hoop earrings to accent the slant of your cheekbones.
Wear shoes with a bit of height to elongate your legs.
Wear a scarf that matches your eyes to make them look brighter.
Wear a slender chain necklace to draw attention to your collarbones.

, If you're wearing a shade of knockout red lipstick, or you've lined your eyes for a vintage cat eye look, you probably don't need too many accessories to complete your look. Let your makeup itself be the accessory. Just make sure the colors you choose complement the colors in your outfit and help tie your look together. Here are a few other unexpected items that can count as accessories:


Nail polish and nail art
False eyelashes
Tattoos
Glasses and colored contacts
Hair extensions or weaves

Look for patterns that include red in them.,
Go for an Americana theme.,
Save the green for Christmas time.,
Opt for deep shades over bright shades.,
Mix in shades of brown.",How to Accessorize a Red Dress2," In essence, pink is a light red. Not every shade of pink will match with every shade of red, so you should carefully examine compare a pink accessory before wearing it with your red dress.


If you don't know where to start, try silver-pink jewelry or a silver-pink metallic shoe. These pieces are mostly silver but have a slight hint of pink.

, Carry a handbag with red, yellow, and blue running through it, and match it with blue shoes or simple yellow earrings. Keep your accessories small and low-key to achieve a funky style without looking too busy.


This works well for casual and party dresses, but may be too much for a formal or semi-formal occasion.

, This works especially well if the shade of red matches the shade of your dress. Wear a scarf with red and violet stripes, or a sash with an abstract print in red and orange.

, For a Memorial Day picnic or 4th of July barbecue, tie a navy blue belt around a red sundress. Match it with white sandals and white earrings or novelty flag earrings.

, A red sweater dress can matched with deep green pumps can create a fun, seasonal look for the holiday season, but may not work well otherwise since many automatically associate a red-and-green color scheme with Christmas.

, Deep shades add color without looking too flashy. Bright colors may compete with a bright red dress, resulting in a tacky look.

, Try a simple, chocolate brown pump matched with a solid brown belt. For jewelry, look for pendants and earrings that contain brown gemstones like tiger's eye, amber, jasper, or topaz. The gemstones can be large, but only opt for one or two statement pieces.

Tie a black belt around your waist to break up the monotony of a solid red smock dress and finish the look with black fashion boots.

, Black can look strong and classy, but the right black accessories can really turn up the heat. Wrap a black lace shawl around your shoulders for evening or carry a clutch with a layer of black lace. Complete the look with your highest pair of black stilettos.

, If you want to make your red summer sundress look classy, adorn yourself in white accessories like while bangle bracelets and white sandals. Avoid black, which may look too heavy for warm summer months.

, A black cardigan in a luxurious material coordinates nicely with an evening dress, but a white cardigan works best for day dresses.

, Patterns create added visual interest, but a simple black and white pattern keeps it subtle. Try a black and white polka dot handbag for timeless appeal, or get a little edgy with a large zebra print shoulder bag.

, A simple pearl necklace, matched with small pearl post earrings, can create a classy, elegant look, especially when paired with a white or cream shoe.

Add a simple hint of glamour to your dress with solid silver or gold.,
Go for a two-toned look.,
Maximize your glitz and glamour with diamonds.",How to Accessorize a Red Dress4," Metallics often have enough shine to look elegant on their own. Add shimmer to your neck or wrist with a simple chain, and look for a metallic shoe and handbag to tie your look together.

Adapt your accessories to your signature style.,

Check out thrift stores and clearance bins for trendy accessories.,
Spend big on classic items.,
Pick accessories that go with your complexion.,
Consider accessories outside the obvious.",How to Accessorize2," There's no end to the accessory choices out there, and it can be tricky to narrow down your options. If you're just now starting your accessory collection, begin by choosing a few pieces that match your current style. Once you get used to accessorizing, you can start branching out and experimenting with bolder pieces you might not normally think of as ""you."" Here are a few basics you might want to add to your shopping list:


Earrings: silver or gold hoops, jeweled studs, and a few pairs of fun dangly numbers.
Necklaces: a tasteful silver or gold chain, a string of pearls and a bold statement necklace.
Scarves: a neutral scarf that matches everything and a few bold scarves to show off your personality.
Belts: a classic leather belt, a wide statement belt and an elegant skinny belt.
Hair accessories: an array of barrettes, a headband or two, and if hats are your thing, a sunhat and a beret.

, When you're deciding which accessories to purchase, check out fashion magazines and blogs for great ideas. Look for inspiration from people who have similar taste to you or clothes that aren't far from your wardrobe.


Pay attention to how the accessories are styled. What colors and textures are paired together?
Most magazines and blogs provide information about where the items are from, so you can purchase them for yourself.

, Accessories are so much fun because they give you the opportunity to wear all the latest trends without having to break the bank. If you see an accessory you like, chances are there's a knockoff within your price range. Instead of saving up your money for an item that's likely to go out of style next season, look for less expensive versions of the accessories you want.

, There are some classic accessories that are worth spending more money to purchase. If you're absolutely certain that you'll wear an accessory a lot, buying something higher quality could be a good investment. For example, a pair of diamond studs will probably get a lot of use, and it might be worth it to you to have the real thing. When you're deciding whether an item is worth splurging on, ask yourself these questions:


Will it stay in style forever, or is it about to be last season's fad?
Does it match the majority of my wardrobe, or will I struggle to find an outfit to wear it with?
Is it made with high-quality materials (like sterling silver or 14 karat gold) or is it priced high simply because it's a name brand?

, Your accessories will look best if they enhance your natural coloring, whether you have warm or cool-toned skin, hair and eyes. If you have warm-toned skin, earth colors and golden tones will look best. For a cooler complexion, go for jewel tones and opt for silver over gold.


To figure out whether you have warm or cool-toned skin, put a silver bracelet on one wrist and a gold one on the other, or hold silver and gold jewelry up to your eyes. Which metal looks more flattering against your skin and makes your eyes appear to sparkle? If you're warm-toned, it'll be the gold. If you're cool-toned, it'll be the silver.
No matter what your skin tone is, accessories can be a fun way to play with colors you wouldn't normally wear. If you never wear peach near your face because it makes you look washed out, try wearing peach-colored flats or a peach belt. That way you can enjoy the color even if it doesn't match your tone.

, Anything you wear on your body can be used as an accessory. An umbrella or a parasol can be used to accessorize an outfit. So could a tattoo sleeve, a feather boa, pins, veils, keychains hanging from your belt loops, and candy necklaces. Be creative!

Stud earrings. As long as they don't hang too low, most earrings are office appropriate. If you have a big meeting, you might want to go with classic silver, gold or diamond studs, but for everyday wear, mix things up with a little pop of color.
Chic glasses. Black or tortoise shell wayfarer-style glasses will make you look smart and stylish at the office.
Colorful flats or kitten heels.

, With the right accessories, you can turn a standard sweater set and slacks ensemble into something with rockstar edge. In fact, the juxtaposition of the two looks is all the more interesting and fun. To amp up your basic sweaters, shifts or blouses, wear these:

Studded jewelry. Wearing jewelry with thick metal studs or little spikes shows the world you mean business.
Bold eye makeup. Break out the black eyeliner and create a smoky eye to go with your goth jewelry.
Motorcycle boots. They look good paired with a dress or jeans.

, The place where you live might be completely land-locked, but that doesn't mean you can't look like you just spent your afternoon at the beach. Try these accessories to build a look that's free and breezy:


Colorful beaded necklaces or earrings.

Keep away from direct sunlight and heat.,
Make sure the leather can ""breathe."",
Keep leather away from pesticides.,
Dry clean the jacket before moving it to storage.",How to Care For a Leather Jacket," There are many ""leather protector"" or ""leather waterproofing"" products, but read the label carefully before buying. A silicone polymer spray, or an acrylic copolymer spray, should preserve your leather's appearance and shine. Grease-based or wax-based products are more protective, but not recommended for jackets due to their potential effect on color, longevity, shine, and smell.Check the label on your product to find out how long the water resistance lasts. Typically, the product needs to be re-applied once every several weeks or months.


While this treatment will make the leather jacket resistant to water damage, it will not be fully waterproof, even if the treatment claims otherwise. Never immerse a leather jacket in water or place it in a washing machine.;
, Rubbing in leather conditioner restores oil to the leather, preventing excessive dryness and cracking, but too much oil can clog the pores and affect the jacket's color or longevity. Only apply leather conditioner when the jacket starts to feel dry or stiff. Here are some tips for choosing a product:


Check the label to make sure it is suitable for your type of leather. (This is mostly important for suede or nubuck jackets.)
Ideally, use pure mink oil, neatsfoot oil, or other natural animal oils, but be aware that this may darken the leather.Products that contain wax or silicone can dry out the leather, but may be a cheaper option that causes less of a color change.Use sparingly.
Never use products that contain mineral oil or petroleum, which can cause significant damage.Also avoid ""saddle soap,"" at least on unfinished leather without a protective water-resistant coating., Leather polish will bring a shine to your jacket, but has the potential to discolor, dry out, or clog the leather surface. Use this for special occasions, and test on a hidden area first before using a new product. Buff with a cloth until a glossy surface is created.Do not polish suede or other leather with a soft, fuzzy texture. It is not possible to make suede glossy without permanently removing this texture.Don't use shoe polish, even if it is intended for leather shoes.

, In damp, winter conditions, white salt deposits can form on leather. Wipe the salt off with a damp cloth promptly, to avoid dry spots and cracks. Let the leather air dry, then apply conditioner to the affected area., If your jacket gets wet, hang it evenly on a hanger to dry at room temperature. Remove objects from the pockets to avoid stretching the wet leather, and keep it away from direct heat sources, such as radiators or airing cupboards. Apply conditioner after drying, if the leather had become thoroughly soaked.

, Storing the jacket on a clothes hanger should prevent and remove minor wrinkles. If you are bothered by major wrinkles, taking the jacket to a professional leather cleaner is recommended. Alternatively, set a clothes iron to the lowest setting (often labeled ""rayon""), place the leather under a cloth, and iron the cloth quickly and briefly.See the section on storage for more detailed information.

, Almost all leather jackets sold in stores include a tag describing how to clean the jacket. Because there are many varieties of leather, not all of them distinguishable to the naked eye, follow the specific instructions on the label whenever possible.The steps below are generally safe if followed thoroughly, but no method is guaranteed to work safely on all leather.

, If your leather jacket has been left in the closet for a while, it may need dusting. To avoid scuffing or damaging the leather, use a dry cotton cloth, nubuck cloth, or camel hair brush., Test your jacket first by dropping a single drop of water onto it. If the water stays on the surface, it is safe to wipe dirt from the leather using a slightly damp cloth.If the water is absorbed and darkens the leather, do not apply water.

, ""Suede brushes"" can remove light grime from suede, but may scratch other leather materials. You can try using a dry sponge as a cheaper option. Do not use this method on non-suede leather, or on unidentified leather.


This may work best if you first hang the suede in a steamy bathroom. Do not apply steam directly to the suede with an iron or kettle, as heat can cause damage., This method works well on suede, but test other leathers in a hidden area before use. Rub the art gum eraser over the grimy or dirty area to detach the dirt or fresh ink stains from a suede jacket.If the eraser residue clings to the jacket, remove it with a gentle vacuum cleaner or compressed air.This type of eraser is sometimes sold as ""artist's eraser,"" and is available at crafts stores. It is a putty-like substance which crumbles apart when used. Don't confuse it with ""kneaded erasers,"" which look similar but does not crumble.

, Only use a leather cleaning product that matches your type of leather, ideally one manufactured by the same company that made your jacket. Always test any cleaning product on a hidden area of the leather to test for discoloration or damage, leaving the product on for at least five minutes, then wiping it off with a clean cloth. If no harm has occurred, treat the affected part of the jacket according to the product's instructions.


Suede or nubuck should be treated only by products specifically made for those types. Leather labeled as aniline, semi-aniline, or pigmented leather might be cleaned by a general purpose leather cleaner, but always test on a hidden area first.
You can purchase ink stain remover for leather, but this is not usually 100% effective if the ink has dried., If a leather jacket is covered in mold, which usually appears as a white or grey fuzz, mix equal parts water and rubbing alcohol. Gently wipe off the mold using a cotton cloth dampened with this solution. If that is unsuccessful, try a mild, germicidal soap mixed with water instead.Wipe off excess liquid with a dry cotton cloth once you're done.

, If the above methods do not remove a stain from your jacket, take it to a dry cleaner that specifically advertises leather-cleaning services. Always ask whether the dry cleaner knows how to treat the type of leather and stain before handing your jacket over.


Never wash a leather garment in a washing machine or washtub.

, A wide, padded clothes hanger is the best option for minimizing wrinkles and stretch. Avoid using clothes pegs, which cause a great deal of stress to a small area.

, Direct sunlight can fade the leather's color or cause spotty discoloration.Heat can cause dryness and cracking, so store the jacket in a cool location away from heating vents and other heat sources.

, Leather will last longer if exposed to dry air, especially a light draft. Never store leather inside a plastic bag or underneath plastic sheeting. When storing leather in a bag temporarily, open the bag whenever convenient to expose it to the air.Storing your jacket inside a closet is fine, unless the closet is unusually hot or damp.

, Leather can absorb insecticides. If this occurs, it may not be possible to remove the smell, or even the toxin, from the jacket. In addition, mothballs and similar home pesticides are most effective in small containers, which are not ideal homes for leather.

, If storing leather long-term, dry clean it first to remove any pests and odors.This reduces the chance of pests attacking your jacket, but check your storage regularly for pests if possible.

Wear straight-legged pants or pants with a flare.,
Gravitate toward A-line skirts and dresses.,
Know your body type.,
Choose soft, draping fabrics.",How to Look Cute When You're Heavy Set1," Many heavy set women settle for shapeless plus sized clothing because they feel a need to hide their heaviness. Oversized, baggy pieces only make you look larger, however.;
, Like any other woman, you should dress in a way that works with the natural contours of your shape and accentuates your curves. Fitted tops and dresses that nip in at the waist are especially flattering since they define your waist, making your top and bottom look more proportioned.

, Clothes that are too tight will show any rolls of fat or excess weight you likely want to hide. Clothes that are too big will make you look boxy and larger than necessary. Purchase clothing that brushes against your body without squeezing it, and remember that bunching or pulling will only draw unflattering attention to those areas of your body.

, Long, fitted pieces that extend past your hip create a smooth, streamlined silhouette that may make your hips and stomach look thinner. Avoid pieces that end at the widest part of your thighs, though, since the horizontal hemline across that area of your body may make your thighs look larger.

, Long tops may only make you look shorter and stouter. Tops and jackets that stop just above your hipbone elongate your leg, reducing the appearance of stoutness.

, Tapered legs only make your hips and thighs look larger. A straight-legged pant streamlines your appearance, reducing the appearance of thickness around your thighs. Pants with a slight flare, like boot-cuts, also help by balancing out the width of your upper leg with extra material at the bottom.

, A-line skirts flare out toward the bottom, creating a flattering silhouette for your hips. Wrap dresses and empire waist dresses area also very flattering, since they define your waist and drape naturally off your curves.

, Not all heavy set bodies are the same. You may have be an apple shape who carries her weight around her stomach, a pear shape who carries her weight around her thighs, an inverted triangle who carries her weight in her chest, or a rectangle whose weight is evenly distributed throughout her body. Determine your body type and learn about what styles of dress flatter your shape best.

, Stiff fabrics often create a boxy look that adds pounds rather than taking them away. Clingy fabrics tightly form to your body, often accentuating excess weight. Draping fabrics fall off your body naturally, lightly hugging your contours without drawing extra attention to them.

When shopping for evening wear, remember that you aren't limited to just dresses!",How to Look Beautiful if You Have a Fuller Figure," Shopping for larger clothes can be challenging. It is easy to give up and settle for wearing something that sort of fits. Very skinny women are all more or less the same proportions, and these are often the fashion models that designers base clothing sizes on. Larger women tend to be more diverse in body proportions. The scaling-up clothing designers attempt often fails completely unless the designers are competent and knowledgeable about plus-sizes.


You may need to find stores that specialize in larger sizes. In America, for example, Lane Bryant has been providing clothing for larger sizes for decades.
Better department stores may have areas dedicated to full-figured clothing. However, usually this is for mature women, not so much adolescents or children.
Online shopping may be your best bet if you have no specialty clothing stores nearby. Just be sure that you consult sizing charts--what is 4X in one brand may be a 2X in another.
Make use of a seamstress. Since full-figured women vary so much, proper tailoring is important. Being able to take in a seam can turn an almost-right piece of clothing into just-right.;
, It is one thing to find well-fitting plus-sized clothing, but sometimes the styling is sorely lacking. This is often especially true if you are a young adult, and want to wear junior's fashions and not items designed for a middle-aged woman. Follow the advice give for fitting above, plus:


Do not settle. It is very tempting to ""give in"" and wear clothes you really do not like. But fashionable larger clothing exists...you just may have to look longer and harder than other women. The extra work is worth it.

You deserve pretty clothes! The fact that it is so difficult to find fashion-forward larger clothing sends a very strong, subtle message: That you do not deserve to look or feel pretty, just be grateful it just fits. But that is no more correct than it is for any other woman. You have every right to look and feel great, no matter what your weight is!
The clothes are meant to flatter you, not the other way around. All too often, women are made to feel if they do not look good in a clothing item, that it is somehow due to a personal failure. If you do not like how the pants look, that is because there is something not right about the pants...not that there is something wrong with you. Even models do not necessarily look right in every piece of clothing.

, Full-figured women sometimes spend so much effort concealing, they forget to accent the positive as well. Every woman has features that is worth showing off. Do you have great hair, shapely legs, flawless skin, a curvy figure? Choose styles that show off these features.

, Women have been taught to feel good wearing small size, but bad if the size is larger. This is ridiculous. You will look and feel better if what you wear fits appropriately, no matter what the tag says.


Sizing for clothing pieces vary by designer, manufacturer, whether the clothing is for juniors, or misses, or women, and even what country the company is in. A size ""16"" or ""XXL"" or ""2x"" means essentially nothing.
Try on the same piece in two or three sizes, and choose the one that flatters your body the most.
Sometimes things are mis-labelled. In all clothing, occasionally one factory makes an error cutting something, or the labels may get mixed up. This happens once in a while especially at discount clothing stores. Once in a while, two items labelled the same size do not fit the same.

, Larger women sometimes completely give up on finding the right undergarments, and just settle for ""something""--but in fact, well-fitting undergarments make a huge difference for full-figured women. Supportive bras, panties, and other shaping items like Spanx not only feel great when well-fitted but also make you look more ""put together"".


Get fitted for a bra. Many women think they know what bra fits properly, but in truth, are often way off. Many department stores and better lingerie stores are exceptionally helpful in determining if a bra fits or not.
Invest in bras that fit. A-cup women can go around with flimsy (or no) bras, but not so women with bountiful bosoms! Good bras are inevitably more expensive than cheap ones, however. But good bras will typically be longer-lasting, support better, and feel better.

, Even if you do not wear shapewear every day, it is a confidence booster. This not only helps clothes fit better but boosts confidence! No more underwear lines, hooray!

, Be happy with who you are; this is more important and speaks louder than your clothes or size ever will. A skinny girl with a sour attitude and poor self-esteem is just not as beautiful as a young lady that is well dressed and wearing a smile.

, Larger women can carry off accessories that may ""overwhelm"" a smaller frame. For example, a big, chunky necklace might look over-sized on a thin woman, but be able to be pulled easily by a large one.


Difficult-to-shop-for sized women often must be very selective and deliberate in shopping, so the number of items in the wardrobe may be smaller. Accessories can give more variety in the wardrobe without having to worry about size as much as one would in buying something like a shirt.
Remember that not all accessories are clothing. Things like handbags, shoes, belts, are all things to consider in an outfit.

, Some people seem to have the notion that if you are heavier, you somehow cannot or should not wear what you want to wear. It is true that some trends (like spaghetti-strap tank tops) may not be a first choice for larger women. But most trends are fine for women of all sizes. For instance, if you really like those leopard print tights, wear them, no matter if you are size 12 or 22!


Darker colors are generally more slimming. But a wardrobe of dark, drab colors is not flattering.
Do not be afraid of color. A great color looks great on anyone, regardless of size. Using color can bring the eye to features you want to highlight.

,


Wear a straight-up-and-down or boot-cut jeans or pant. These will take the emphasis off your hips and butt and compliments curves.
Pointy-toed shoes and boots tend to make legs seem longer and you look thinner overall.
Opt for longer shirts. When the hem of the shirt falls a few inches below a woman's natural waistline, the overall effect smooths the stomach.
Try dresses that gather under the bust. For many larger women, dresses with an empire-style bust de-emphasizes the stomach and shows off a lovely bust.

, Try a black dress pant paired with a bright top and great shoes. If you do decide to go with a dress, make sure it fits! Strapless can be tricky for a bigger bust, so be careful.A tulip skirt can also do wonders on a plus-size lower half.

Break away from black.,
Gravitate toward bold colors.,
Avoid large patterns.,
Avoid embellishments on the widest parts of your body.,
Try on dark wash jeans.,
Consider a medium to dark wash denim jacket.,
Choose colors that flatter your skin tone.",How to Look Cute When You're Heavy Set2," Black does have a slimming effect, and having a little black in your wardrobe is certainly advisable. Too much makes you look bland and bleak, however. Adding color into your wardrobe gives your clothing personality and makes you look cuter.


Wear dresses that have a dark side panel; this will give the body an elongated look.

, Light pastel shades may make your body look larger, so be careful about choosing them. Bold, bright hues, on the other hand, do not have this widening effect and often look flattering.


Solid blocks of color tend to work best.

, Huge patterns that cover your entire outfit often appear overwhelming. As a result, your curves get masked, and you may end up looking heavier. Stick with smaller patterns or patterns that are limited to one area of your body.

, Stay away from tops that have ruffles down the front or pants that have decorative zippers on the thigh. These details automatically draw the eye, making the parts of your body they cover noticeable in a very unflattering way. Look for unadorned pieces or those that have embellishments on other parts of your body, such as blouses with beading at the neckline or skirts with lace at the bottom hem.

, Dark wash jeans look slimming and clean-cut without looking bland and boring. Light wash jeans may make your legs look wider, but many medium washes also work well.

, A fitted denim jacket with a short waist can add spirit and liveliness to your wardrobe. Stick with medium to dark wash denims, however, since anything lighter will probably make you look heavier than you are.

, You can get help from someone who is familiar with matching color to skin tones, or use online resources to help you. If the tones match, you will look healthy and beautiful.

Be aware that what may have suited you 10 years may cause you to look washed out now, as your skin ages. Always update.

Invest in a body shaper.,
Buy a proper fitting bra.,
Look for long, flowing silk nightgowns with plenty of feminine detail.",How to Look Cute When You're Heavy Set3," Body shapers are worn under your clothes and help you keep your proportions in check. A good shaper should not be so tight that it leaves marks, but it will keep a little excess fat in check and give you an overall smoother, streamlined look.

, Many heavy set women are gifted with enviable busts, but this makes it even more important for you to have a supportive bra that fits you correctly. A bra that does not fit correctly may make you look saggy, but a proper fit will help you achieve a very womanly, mature look.

, Nightgowns that drape over your curves will usually look very flattering. Long gowns work well for most woman, but shorter women should also consider shorter versions of this style. Look for a gown with a deep v-neck to flatter your bust as much as possible.

Elongate your leg with heels.,
Buy bold, chunky jewelry.,
Look for pieces that draw attention to your face.,
Stick with one or two key accessories for each outfit.,
Look for longer hair styles, depending on the shape of your face.,
Use make-up to accentuate your eyes.,
Keep the rest of your make-up looking natural.,
Sling a fun, colorful bag over your shoulder.",How to Look Cute When You're Heavy Set4," This tip is especially helpful for shorter women. Heels extend your leg, making it look longer and more slender. A longer looking leg reduces the appearance of stoutness, which may help your overall appearance look more slender.

, Think large bangle bracelets, chunky beaded chokers, heavy pendants with large charms, and bold rings. Look for cute designs that appeal to your personal taste. Due to your larger appearance, you can wear bolder pieces with style, and without having your figure overwhelmed by them.

, Necklaces and earrings work especially well in terms of jewelry, but you can also consider scarves, hats, headbands, and other accessories that draw the eye away from your body and toward your face. Get as creative, wild, or elegant as you please.

, Accessories can definitely make an outfit look cuter, but too much will create a busy look that will end up having the opposite effect.

, For many heavier set women, shorter hair can make the hips look wider and unbalanced. Balance out bottom heaviness by creating volume on top with long hair. Try incorporating layers and waves into your hair for even more volume.

, Outline your eyes with eyeliner and mascara, and play with eye shadow color until you find something that looks bold without looking clownish. Noticeable eyes downplay a plumper chin.

, Stick with skin tone foundations and bronzers. Do not apply too much blush to your cheeks, and do not apply dark colors to your lips. Keep the focus on your eyes by keeping the rest of your make-up subdued.

, Choose a cute design in a bright color or pattern to give your look a playful edge. Look for girlish embellishments like bows or frills.

Things that may fit from one manufacturer may not fit from another, and even things from the same manufacturer may fit differently. Order a few things at a time until you get an idea how the sizes run. If you find something basic you like, like jeans, get more than one pair.;
, When you go to local shops, if you're not comfortable with your own decisions, take someone with you whom you trust. Women are great for this. Women love to shop, and usually won't let you go too far wrong.

, They're there to help you get a good fit.

, Use that information as a basis for purchases you make on your own.

, This doesn't mean what fit when you were in school, just worn lower under your tummy. Tight clothes ARE NOT attractive. And remember, unless you're talking about 501s, your size probably isn't on your label.

, Again, not what you wore in school, what you wear now. A big pile of fabric around your ankles is not what you want. With things that shrink, like jeans and chinos, do allow some length for shrinkage. Nothing is more frustrating than pants that were the perfect length that now show the world your ankles because they shrank.

, Discount mass retailers like K-Mart, Target, etc. can be a God send. These store carry larger sizes, at reduced prices, and you can try things on to your heart's content. You can also buy things, take them home to try, and return what you don't like at your leisure.

, This is something dry cleaners often specialize in, and it usually isn't very expensive. Getting less expensive clothing altered can make the difference in looking shabby and looking sharp.

, Mid-range retailers like JC Penney, Macy's, etc. are really good for big and tall sizes. Stores like this combine a level of customer service you don't get in less expensive stores, and a price range you can often afford even when you don't think you can. Shop the sales. You'll surprise yourself at what you can get, at really good prices.

, Finally, if you're getting a bit older, say over thirty, give up on the bright Hawaiian-type shirts. Yes, your friends may find them amusing, but you don't want to date your friends. If you have to have one, wear it out when you go to the bars, not on a date.

Place the clothes that you wish to alter into a washing machine.,
Add 2 or 3 pumice stones into the washing machine with the clothes.,
Remove the clothing and pumice stones from the washing machine once the wash cycle is complete.

Repeat this method if you have not obtained the desired results.,
Consider using bleach as an alternative to pumice stones.,
Use granulated pumice soaked in bleach as an alternative to bleach alone.

,
Put the bleached clothing in the washer and clean using soap powder.,
Consider a second wash if there is any lingering bleach residue on the clothing.

",How to Stone Wash,";
, Pumice stones were used in the original technique to create the stone washed look because they are abrasive and move thorough the clothes like sandpaper and remove the dye particles from the surface of the yarn.

,, Remember not to overdo the pumice stone method as you may destroy the fabric of the material causing it to rip easily.

, This is known as acid washing where dry clothes are bleached then placed in a washing machine.

Engage in body positive self-talk.,
Limit your use of negative media.,
Surround yourself with body positive people.,
Spend more time in front of the mirror.",How to Embrace Your Curves1," Instead of focusing on what you don’t like about your body, focus on what you do like and what your body enables you to do. Focus on the idea that your body has enabled you to accomplish your goals, or even perform mundane activities like walking and singing.When you find yourself criticizing your body, stop yourself and reverse the dialogue, for example, “I am proud of my body. Because of my legs and hips I am able to dance and I love dancing!” Or, “I love my arms and hands because they are strong and enable me to hug and comfort my friends when they are feeling down.”;
, Limit your use of magazines, TV, and social media that glamorize the thin body ideal. Also, try to cut out media that constantly criticizes women and their appearance. Surrounding yourself with this kind of negativity can result in negative thoughts about your own body, as well as the bodies of others., Surround yourself with people who love their bodies no matter what shape or size it is. Find friends who support you and encourage you to find beauty in your own body. Eventually, their confidence and good habits will pass on to you the more you hang out with them, and vice versa.If you have a good friend who constantly criticizes and compares their body type to others, try to flip the conversation. Let them know that you think their body is beautiful. Also, try to steer the conversation toward things you both love about your bodies, instead of what you hate about them.

, Do this instead of avoiding the mirror because you do not like your curves, especially when you are naked. Do your makeup or hair in front of the mirror while you are nude at least once a week. By doing other activities while you are naked in front of the mirror, you may be able to become more comfortable with your curves and appreciate your body for what it is, not what it is not.This may be uncomfortable in the beginning, but the more you do it, the more comfortable you will become with your naked body and curves.

Determine your body type.,
Get fitted.,
Emphasize the parts of your body you love.,
Accessorize.,
Accentuate your waist with belts.",How to Embrace Your Curves2," Examine your body in the mirror. Look at your proportions and the way your hips connect to your waist and bust. To be sure, measure the size of your bust, waist, and hips. Knowing your body type will enable you to choose clothing that fits properly and complements your body type.Some common body types are the pear, rectangle, diamond, hourglass, and the inverted triangle shape.

, Having bras and underwear that fit properly is as important as having clothes that complement your body type. Good-fitting bras and underwear will provide you with support in the places you need. Therefore, your clothes will hang on your body properly and your posture may improve, boosting your self-confidence further.Visit a lingerie store to get fitted. Invite your friends to come with you and make a day out of it.

, Determine which parts of your body you love and want to flaunt. Then choose clothes that accentuate these body parts. You can also do this by using color. Use bright colors to draw attention to your favorite body parts.For example, if you love your hips and thighs, then stock up on pants that accentuate these features.

, Accessories are a fun way to add some excitement to your outfit. Choose from belts, earrings, necklaces, bracelets and rings. You can also use accessories to accentuate the body parts you love.For example, if you want to accentuate your collar bone, then wear a bold collar necklace or a bib necklace.
Draw attention to your eyes by wearing earrings that bring out the color in your eyes; for example, if you have green eyes, try red hoop earrings.
Accessories are also a great way to stay up-to-date with fashion trends, if that is your style.

, Belts are also a great way to create a waistline when you are wearing oversized dresses and tops. You can also create a waistline by wearing tops and dresses that ruche at the waist, or that have details, like beading, that draw attention to the waist.Wearing a top and bottom that are two different, but complementary colors can also create a waistline.

Pick an exercise routine you love.,

Reward your body.",How to Embrace Your Curves3," Studies reveal that women who exercise feel better about their bodies no matter what kind of body type they have. If you haven’t already, find an exercise you like and stick with it. It could be biking, dancing, walking, roller-skating, or running. Choosing something you enjoy will help you stick with the exercise longer.Ask your friends to join you if you do not want to go at it alone.
Try not to exercise with a weight goal in mind. Instead, set different goals for yourself each week like, “I will bike two to three times this week.”

, Supplying your body with the nutrients it needs to function can also boost your confidence both mentally and physically. Make sure you are getting the recommended amount of protein, vegetables, fruits, carbohydrates, and dairy each day. Try to limit your intake of sugar as well.It is recommended that you eat at least five portions of fruits and vegetables, three portions of protein and three portions of carbohydrates daily., Treat yourself to a massage or a manicure.

Women's Fashion accessories Can Make Or Break An Excellent, Classy Outfit.",How to Select a Plus Size Wardrobe," Do not be satisfied with shapeless oversize outfits ever again. Ungraceful clothing hides your complete appearance positive and unfavorable. Find clothing styles that highlight the best fuller shape attributes and disguise those you do not prefer. Garments missing the proper tailoring are almost always going to make your shape seem larger than it actually is.;
, Black colored pants, clothes, skirts and other plus size clothing is not necessarily the most slimming or figure flattering on a woman's body. A desirable outfit is as much about appropriate styling, tailoring and general fashion as it is about hue. Monotone shaded apparel can be nearly as flattering, or even more, than plain old dull black. Using additional colors around your face will bring focus to your skin shade, face shape and eye coloring. Black is liable to wash out most skin color. Stores where you'll find the right little black gown in plus sizes are Kiyonna Klothing, Avenue and Zaftique.

, Don't worry too much if the local shop doesn't carry a large enough variety of plus size clothing within their fashion selection, designs and sizes that you like. Try internet shopping at among the list of various girls clothing website pages exclusively personalized to the needs to plus size figured ladies. There are lots of clothing designers that provide their designs only on the Internet. Listed here are a couple of my favorites: Catherines, Arden B., Jessica London. If you like a little more current or sexy style, try Torrid or Size Appeal.

, Just because pant in addition to jean creative designers continue to carry tapered leg pant fashions for gals does not mean you have to wear them. A plus size shape, or any body for that matter, is not complimented by the ice cream cone shape of a tapered leg pant. Choose from streamline pant shape that's a straight leg from you hip right down to the floor. This goes for women's denim too. If your hips or butt happen to be an issue area for you, try selecting a plus size jean that slightly flares out at the bottom to balance the volume along the hip. A straighter or mildly flared leg pant will elongate your legs having them look longer than they really are. Add an incredible pointy-toe high heeled (search by wide width size here) shoe for even more long legged illusion. To seek out a great pair of designer denims, try Lane Bryant.

, I have noticed a frightful trend in some variety store plus size apparel sections- gowns and other apparel with HUGE all over shapes and designs. First things first, I wouldn't recommend a whole outfit of all one pattern with no solid coloration to break it up(unless it's a dress, of course). Secondly, make certain the pattern you do go with is going to incorporate within your wardrobe and doesn't overwhelm your height. The size of the pattern should match the proportions of the gal. For anybody who is tall, you call pull off a larger pattern. Should you be petite, choose less massive prints to avoid overwhelming your outfit with pattern. If you would like to include more decorative fabrics into your wardrobe, my best advice would be to pick one clothing article per outfit to have a pattern (like a skirt, top or jacket, not all three). For elegantly decorative plus size clothes my personal favorite plus size store is Coldwater Creek.

, A shorter body frame can look even shorter with overly long plus size tops, jackets and sweaters. Tops that go below the hip level on a petite shape will start to shorten the look of your legs all the more. A top or coat that shops just at the hip bone will elongate your smaller legs to their longest character. Sorry ladies, but the longer sweaters and jackets really only enhance a taller plus size frame. Shops that stock tall and petite plus sizes are Lane Bryant, Chadwicks of Boston, and Newport News.

, I know we already listened to it on Oprah, but I must tell you once more that 75% of all women are wearing the incorrect size bra. YIKES! Having a fuller figured bosom brings along it's own set of specific issues such as bra straps digging into your shoulders and back, saggy appearance to breasts, and cup spillage (i. e. the dreaded two bubble outcome). Many of these issues can be solved by purchasing the right size plus size bra and the good thing is that there are numerous stores online that supply especially to plus size girls. Try going to a department store or specialty bra shop to be perfectly sized for a bra. If you are shopping for a new bra size in bulk, consider online bra websites that are fitted with your size more available and at better prices. A few of my personal favorite merchants for plus size bras and intimates are Just My Size, Bare Necessities, Fig Leaves and Hips and Curves.

, The fact remains whether you like or dislike your plus sized, plump, voluptuous, full figured body type it's a must to clothe it for it's current shape and size. Whether you plan on losing weight sometime soon or want to stay how you are, have the confidence to feel sexy and gorgeous in your CURRENT skin and garments. Find fashion items that make you feel pleasant and gorgeous inside and out.

, All women normally have an idea of what clothing size they are (or what size they'd like to be), but the truth is that every designer and producer of clothing has its own sizing chart. What may be a size 14 in one designer could be a size 16 or 18 in another. Concern yourself about how the clothing fit and flatter your body and less about the silly number on the label. Attire that bunch and pull in locations that are too little will draw unbecoming awareness to that place. The best clothing suppliers have sizing charts with inch measurements to help you choose your personal size at their market and these stores generally have fantastic return policies in case the garments aren't quite right. Here are some stores that carry clothing size 24 and above: Alight, Avenue, Kiyonna Klothing, and Ulla Popken.

, Ordinary looking outfits can even be jazzed up with a bold women's accessory, but take care about not overdoing it. Each outfit needs one unique accessory focus, not a bold bracelet, diamond necklace and earrings that could overwhelm you. The great thing about accents is that there is no need to visit the niche plus sized clothing store for great accents. You could shop at just about any clothing retail store for great bracelets, designer purses, wide width shoes, and scarves to spice up any closet. For impressive designer deals look into eBay, BlueFly. For other classic accessories look at Macy's and Nordstrom.

Keep it simple.,
Maintain normal body proportions.",How to Dress when You Are Fat," Avoid horizontal stripes and excessive patterns. These will draw unwanted attention to your body that you may be trying to avoid. Solid colors are a safer choice if you want to appear slimmer.


The tried and true rule is that black is generally very slimming and flattering. Sticking with darker colors are a safe bet because brighter/lighter colors draw attention to your body and are less effective at camouflaging certain trouble areas.
If you do choose a pattern, think vertical. Any vertical stripes or patterns that flow vertically will follow the length of your body and elongate it rather than cutting it off like horizontal patterns would.;
, Statistics show that many women wear the incorrect bra size on a daily basis. Go to a store and get professionally fitted for a bra. The store clerk will make sure you figure out the exact right size for you. If your bra is too small, it can make you look top-heavy; if your bra is too big, it will make you look frumpy. A well-fitting bra can also have a minimizing effect for women who feel they are too top-heavy.

, Wearing shapewear garments under your clothing will help slim your figure, smooth out lines, and give you better posture. All of these are good things that will help your clothes look more flattering., A wide belt (not a skinny belt) will help hide your tummy if that is a problem area for you.Sparkly earrings or exciting headbands can draw attention away from your body and direct people to look elsewhere., In general, shoes that stop at your ankle or have ankle straps will make your legs look shorter and cut off the smooth lines of your body.Instead, go with some tall boots or ballet flats. And of course, heels make everyone’s legs look great.

, It is a common practice to think that wearing oversized clothing hides your figure. In reality, though, it only accentuates the features you are trying to hide. Wearing clothes that are too big just draws attention to the fact that you are trying to hide behind your clothes and makes your silhouette less distinct. This will make you look bigger in the long run., It is easy to think that wearing pants that are too big are more flattering than pants that are too small (we all want to avoid the dreaded muffin top!). But the fact of the matter is that both options are equally unflattering. Pants that are too big hide your shape and make you seem bulky. Get a pair of nice fitting jeans – or if you can’t find one, have a tailor create a pair just for you from some you already own. A perfectly fitting pair of pants will go a long way.


Additionally, aim for boot-cut pants. This style is slightly wider at the bottom and will make your hips and thighs look more proportionate., Pencil skirts are great for curvier girls because they go with the natural curvature of your body. They hug you in all the right places and help your hips/thighs look more balanced, much like boot-cut jeans., These styles will accentuate your curves, while still camouflaging your tummy, thighs, or butt. The flowy lower half of the dress is much more flattering than a fitted type that will show every bulge or imperfection.


A universally flattering style for most body types is the wrap dress. , No matter what size you are, it is better to show your figure than to not. Choose clothes that emphasize your waist. Even larger ladies have hourglass figures and it is important to show them off. This means wearing clothes that fit properly and accentuate your features, rather than trying to simply hide them or cover them up. Use colors and patterns to your advantage to draw attention to your waistline with vertical stripes or an interesting belt., Larger men tend to think that hiding underneath baggy clothing will camouflage their size; however, this is not true. Fitted clothes are simply more flattering (and more comfortable!) than clothes that are too big. Baggy clothing looks sloppy and unappealing.Similarly, clothes that are too small will only highlight your extra weight. Wearing clothes that fit right is important.

, The heavier the material, the more it adds to the bulk of your body. Thick sweaters and shirts can make you look bigger than you actually are. Plus they can contribute to more sweating, which is a common problem for larger men., Most casual clothing is less attractive on larger men. Baggy clothes and thin t-shirts won’t do any favors for a heavy man. The fact is that fitted trousers with a blazer will look better on a larger man than jeans and a t-shirt will. Try dressing up your everyday wardrobe a bit to find things that are more flattering and make you feel more comfortable., Clothing that has too much going on pattern-wise will only accentuate your body and draw more attention to your frame. Try sticking with solid prints or minimally patterned items. This will help flatter the shape of your body, rather than bringing the eye directly to it.

, Make clothing decisions that keep your body proportions intact. For example, if you have a larger belly, don’t wear your pants underneath your gut. This will make your paunch more noticeable and pronounced. Instead, wear your pants at the normal level around the naval. This will mask your extra belly fat somewhat and maintain the normal proportions for your body.If you have trouble keeping your pants up wearing them at this level, try suspenders instead of a belt. They are stylish and will fix this problem for you!"

Empty your wardrobe onto the largest unoccupied space you can access easily.,
Separate your clothes into the following categories: Tops (dresses), Bottoms, Jumpers and Jackets, Underwear, Shoes, Other.,
Tackle the tops - you should have the following:


Tank tops in white, black and colour.,
Brace yourself for Bottoms:


A black or dark coloured suit - Should match each other, but not necessarily worn together at all times.,
Rejoice for Jumpers and Jackets


Neutral-colored sweater - aka jumper
A cardigan in black and one in coloured - a very effective way to look feminine and jazz up an ordinary outfit.,
Underwear warnings!,
Start on the Shoes (You're not, by any means limited to just these so don't worry!,
Obsess over the others:


A selection of scarves, wooly and silk, in a variety of colours for all sorts of occasions
Hair pieces - headbands, berets, flowers etc as well as your other hair pieces.,
Done!",How to Perfect a Woman's Wardrobe," Filter through it and assess each item: Is it damaged? - holes under the arms, elastic fraying etc. Does it fit? - too small, too big or just not tailored right etc. Do I ever see myself wearing this? - obscene pattern, sixties style etc. Put these to one side to donate to charity (If they are still usable) or to throw (If they are beyond saving);
, These categories should cover everything. Now most women find they have a lot of the items needed for a capsule wardrobe, but you may have to add a few things to your wish-list.


Note - in the lists, 'colour' refers to anything that isn't white (Or beige or cream etc) OR Black (Or navy or dark brown etc). The Colour is usually a bright colour and can be patterned if you like - and they don't all have to be the same colour! (But please use your common sense, don't make half of them lime green and half neon orange, try to match them)

,
T-shirts in white, black and colour
Long sleeved T-shirts in white black and colour
Button down shirts in white and colour - think office work space.
A dressier shirt in a colour - think ruffles, texture or patterns.
An 'any occasion' top - you know the one. Shouldn't be a T-shirt or shirt but is you well loved best friend.
A daytime dress - summer time, on the beach, in the park dress
A cocktail dress - normally knee length, coloured
A Little Black Dress
A 'ball gown' dress - Think 'I've been invited to the opera by the queen in twenty minutes, I need something to wear' should almost certainly be ankle length.

,
A pair of standard jeans - Normally straight leg or bootcut
A pair of dressier jeans - Maybe in a colour, skinny, flared etc.
Two pairs of smart black trousers - Your new best friends. Love them.
Alternative trousers, not jeans - Khaki's, linen trousers.
A smart black skirt - whatever suits your shape, pencil? A line?
Alternative skirt - Handkerchief, patterned, coloured?

,
A tailored blazer - basically a suit jacket but often textured.
A graphic sweater - Think big, fluffy, having a bad day and need comfort.
A Trench or other long coat - should be knee length of longer to keep your bum warm!
A waterproof coat - For nasty days

, More importantly than anything, they should fit properly and be in a good condition. No hanging elastic or ladders please!


Several pairs of knickers in a variety of colours - suitable styles.
Several bra's including a T-shirt bra in both white, neutral and black - again, suitable styles for your tops.
Several pairs of socks - including supportive sport socks.
Many tights in neutral and black. Possibly in colour if desired. - Now please throw them out as soon as they get holes or ladders, unless the holes or ladders are in a place covered by your other clothes and are small enough to tackle with a spot of nail varnish.
Socks for pumps (in suitable colours)- wearing pumps without Popsocks or tights is unhygienic.

,):


Good quality black pumps - And polish them regularly to make them last!
Comfy, smart shoes - Think office work, closed toe, will go with a suit shoes.
Black, heeled shoes - for classier evenings out.
Supportive trainers - jogging, sporty, shopping days.
'Hard work' shoes - should be very supportive and sturdy. Think hiking shoes, gardening shoes etc.

,
Consider multiple pairs of glasses, if you wear them and can afford it.
Amongst other jewelry, a pair of plain gold/silver studs and a gold/silver chain watch. These are essentials for the workplace and make any woman look refined in the ability to be glamorous but not showy.
A selection of nail polishes and Nail polish remover. There is nothing worse than a wonderfully dressed woman. . . with chipped and unkempt nails.
A handbag. You know you need one, and you know what you need to keep in it. Adjust accordingly.

, Now, these are just guidelines. Please remember though that a lot of these items brought cheaply are often as good a quality as designer versions. And for a lot of the plain items - no one will be able to tell the difference.

"
Set aside a distinct space for each functional category of clothes.,
Use hangers for items that need to hang to avoid wrinkles, such as cotton shirts.

,
Use any space for items that do not need to hang.,
Make a habit of removing clothes to wear from the same end of any given queue (such as the right side) and adding freshly cleaned ones to the other end (such as the left side).

,
If an item in position to be used is somehow unsuited to that particular day's wearing, take the next one from that end that is suitable.

,
If a closet rod has obstructions that prevent clothes smoothly, simply return hangers to the side they were taken from and move the clothes in the closet over only when clean clothes are added.

,
Make short stacks.,
Find places for small things.,
Hang belts.,
Hang ties.,
Maintain space between unwashed clothes wearing.,
Find your own washing and storing method.,
Repair or remove from duty any item of clothing that appears worn out or badly damaged.

",How to Make the Most of Your Wardrobe and Time with Organization," The clothes in each category should be essentially interchangeable. For a man in a white-collar job, the largest categories might be dress shirts, dress pants, suits, ties, briefs, socks, t-shirts, casual pants, and casual long-sleeve shirts.;
,, Hangers are effective but consume much space and, depending on one's proficiency in folding versus hanging, time. A deep shelf or drawer with a tilt-up front is better than a regular drawer because items can be slid out of the bottom rather than requiring an entire stack to be lifted to access its last item.

,,,, Clothes on shelves do not stack well on end. Instead, make a series of short stacks and move the stacks from one side to the other as earlier stacks are depleted.

, Small items such as socks and underwear can go in a single-purpose bin. A bottom-emptying hopper would be better, but the bin can simply be mixed or its contents turned over from time to time. (If the general public is commenting that you wear the same underwear too often, the belt or suspenders queue has gone wrong -- check on it.)

, Belts can be taken off one long peg or loop to be worn, and returned to another. When that peg runs out, take them off the other one and return them to the first as they are gone through., Ties can similarly be moved from one side to the other of a multi-tie rack.

, Clothes that can be worn more than once should be worn a day or two apart, with new clothes in between, not twice in succession. Once-worn clothes should be kept in a different area to air out without transferring volatile dirt to clean clothes.

, The precise order of washing, sorting, folding and returning clothes to queues does not matter so long as all of the clothes are washed and folded at once, or the dirty-laundry and unfolded-clothes piles are periodically inverted to retrieve items lingering at the bottom of stacks.


A suspended clothes net, bin, or other bottom-opening hopper could solve this problem more elegantly.

Pick out a dress pattern and duct tape color.,
Lay out strips of duct tape.,
Cut out your shapes.,
Fit the pieces together.,
Consider gathering and hemming.",How to Make a Duct Tape Dress1," You're no longer a slave to the standard gray! Head to your local fabric and hardware stores (or even Target or Walmart) and go crazy.

Dress patterns can be found for under $10 at most fabric supply stores.










 


A size 10 body needs about 2 rolls of 60-yd (55 m) duct tape, depending on the pattern.












;
, This is easiest to do on a hardwood or clean tile floor. Getting duct tape stuck to your carpet is like getting gum out of your hair.

Lay them sticky side up, slightly overlapping each other. Lay out enough to cover the dress pattern and then some.













Cover them with a thin cotton cloth. Wrinkles aren't a serious issue; if you see some, don't fret.













Plastic wrap is usable here, but it won't do you any favors in soaking up sweat (or being comfortable) when worn.



, Some dress patterns come with multiple options; just because you're working with duct tape does not mean you have to choose the easiest one.

Trace them on the cotton side of your duct tape material and cut the pieces out.













Make sure to think ahead when it comes to duct tape lines--do you want your pieces vertically or horizontally lined?














, You may feel like Sisyphus here, but fear not! Any piece sticking out or bulging can be forced into its proper place. You're the boss, after all.

Peel back about 5/8 of an inch (1.6 cm) of your backing (plastic wrap or thin cloth) and join the pieces together with this slight overlap.













Layer the seam with a piece of duct tape on the front, if desired.













Cover any raw edges with folding. Peel back the cloth or plastic layer to adhere as necessary.














, Even though you're working with duct tape, this is doable! If your pattern calls for it, go on ahead.

To gather your duct tape fabric, simply scrunch it with your fingers, then wrap a 1/2"" strip of tape around the edges to hold it in place. Position it on another pattern piece as directed by the instructions, then secure with more tape.













To hem your duct tape fabric, remove a couple inches of backing from the edge and carefully fold the edges in.













Make a cut down the back, if necessary. You have the option to add velcro or a zipper, if desired.

Choose the right type of fabric.,
Measure the width.,
Measure the length.,
Cut out your basic measurements.,
Mark the center of your rectangle.,
Fold the rectangle of fabric widthwise.,
Temporarily fold the cape in half again.,
Round out the bottom.,
Unfold your temporary fold.,
Measure your neck.,
Cut out a triangle for the neck.,
Measure out the hood.Find a free hood pattern or fold a hood from a hoodie in half so that the back seam is to the right and the opening is to the left.,
Sew the hood together.,
Attach the hood to the cape.,
Apply bias tape to the edges.Even if your fabric is ravel-resistant, bias tape is a good idea because it hides any uneven cuts and ensures that no unraveling will take place.,
Pin the bias tape to the edges.,
Stitch along the lower edge of the bias tape.,
Sew snaps along the center front of your cape.,
Measure out arm holes.,
Stitch the armhole.,
Pin a decorative brooch at the top front of the cape to finish it.",How to Make a Fashion Cape," For this project, a nice fleece blanket will suffice. If you want a more elegant look, you could also choose any ravel-resistant fabric that is thick and double-sided. A ravel-resistant fabric works best to prevent the edges from fraying, and a double-sided fabric works best so that you do not need to sew an underside into the cape.
, Use a soft cloth tape measure to measure your arm span from one set of fingertips to the other set. The fabric will need to be twice as long as this span., The length of the cape can vary depending on your own personal preference, but a good length to start with would be to your upper or mid thigh. Use a soft cloth tape measure to measure the distance between your shoulder and your thigh, or from your shoulder to whichever stopping point you choose. Add about 1 inch (2.5 cm) onto this measurement for a seam allowance., Use the measurements you took to cut out a large rectangle. The width should look notably larger than the length., Use your tape measure to locate the center top of your cape, along the width or arm span of your fabric. Make a small mark with a fabric pencil at the exact center., Lay the rectangle out flat. Bring each top corner of the width or arm span in toward the center, matching both top corners with the center mark. Your fabric should be half as wide now, and there should be a line down the exact center if the garment. Pin and iron the fold in place., Fold along the width or arm span of the garment. The fold should be where the two halves of your fabric come together, and the arm span should be halved once more. Pin in place but do not iron., Position the fabric so that the newly folded edge is on your left and the intended top of the cape is at the top. Use a fabric pencil to draw a curve or semicircle from the top right corner to the bottom left corner. Cut along this line to round out the bottom of the cape., The last fold you made, which reduced the arm span of your fabric to a quarter of its original size, should now be unfolded, revealing the center line once more. The bottom of the cape should look rounded while the top should remain a straight line., Use a tape measure to measure the diameter of your neck. Add 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) to this measurement to allow for a little extra comfort room., From the top center of the fabric, measure out the distance needed for your neck. The center of the neck measurement should be the center of your cape. Cut out two short triangles from the top, with the height of each triangle being about 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm). Only cut the triangles out from the top layer of the fabric., Trace the pattern or hood onto two layers of your fabric, pin the layers together, and cut along the outline., Sew from the top left corner of the hood, or the top corner above the opening, all the way down along the curved back and the bottom corner, where the neck should be. Allow for a 1/4 inch (0.5 cm) seam allowance., Fold the cape in quarters again, placing the fold toward the right and the opening toward the left. Match the back of your folded hood to the back top of your cape and the opening of the hood toward the left, or the front of your cape. Sew the bottom of the hood to the top of your cape., You can use bias tape that matches the color of your fabric or tape that contrasts with it for a nice eye-catching pop. The tape should be applied to the bottom edge, up along the center, and around the hood., The tape should naturally be folded in the center when you buy it. Make sure that this fold fits over the edge of the cape., You can either use a sewing machine or a straight hand stitch. Either way, the tape should be securely fixed onto the edges., Sew-on snaps are easy to apply and can be sewed by hand. Apply one snap at the top of the cape and as many as you need to close the cape up in front, spacing the snaps about 4 inches (10 cm) apart.

You can also use a zipper or buttons, but buttons will require extra work since you will need to sew in button holes, as well.

, Arm holes are only optional, but they will help the cape stay centered and may make it easier to move around. Lay the cape out flat with the front facing out. Draw a small mark with a fabric pencil about 1/3 of the way down from the top of the cape along the curved bottom., Make a straight stitch from your two arm marks about 2 inches (5 cm) in length, running parallel to the top of your cape., You can either center the brooch or leave it a little off-centered. Either way, a brooch makes the perfect finishing touch to an otherwise plain cape."

Assemble your materials.,
Put on an oversized T-shirt.,
Start wrapping the tape horizontally.,
Use shorter pieces arranged in a pattern around the bust.,
Cut the T-shirt to match your dress pattern.,
Wrap twice more.,
Mark the wearer's natural waistline.,
Cut down the center of the back for removal.",How to Make a Duct Tape Dress2," The last thing you want is to be standing in half a duct tape dress and discover you're missing something. Then again, the looks at your local Walmart would be priceless...









Scissors
Duct tape (1 to 1 1/2 rolls of 60-yd (55 m) tape for a size 10 figure)
T-shirt

Marker

, Any color will do. The T-shirt will adhere to the duct tape and not be seen. And, as a result, wearing the duct tape dress is a lot more comfortable.

The T-shirt should extend to the desired length of the dress. Don't concern yourself with whether or not it's too baggy; length is all that matters.













If the T-shirt is not long enough, attach extra material (as haphazardly as you choose) to extend. This is the underside and does not have to be pretty.














, Begin at the bottom edge of the T-shirt, starting at the back and wrapping around.

Use strips--it's easiest to have a tape-cutting helper. If you wrap it like a mummy, you're likely to curve absent-mindedly. Using strips creates linear angles.













Don't be worried about overlapping too much. Duct tape is one of the most versatile, miraculous things on the planet. If you mess up or create a hole, it can be easily fixed.













Wrap a little more loosely around the waist than you do the hips and thighs. At least initially--you'll be wrapping tighter later on.














, Feel free to change directions; let your creativity flow.









Short pieces of tape capture the contours of the bust better. Arrange them so they radiate out from the center of the bust area.

, When using a T-shirt as your pattern, it's easiest to make a sleeveless, high-necked duct tape dress, but feel free to deviate from this norm.

If you want a higher neck, use plastic wrap to protect the neck area and extend accordingly.














, You'll be wanting to go a bit snugger this time.

Don't skip this part! Three layers ensure the durability of your dress.













It's a good idea to wrap horizontally, vertically, and then horizontally again.













If you're super-creative, take this to the next step and try weaving.



, Have your guinea pig bend a little to make this easier to gauge.

Using a marker, make a line all around the natural waistline.













Use this line later when wearing and add a strip of duct tape for a cinched waist.

, Or, heck, keep it on!









You can close the dress with additional tape, attach velcro or a zipper, or place it on a stand.
Keep your hand between the T-shirt and the wrapped body to avoid cutting undergarments or flesh.

We all notice our closets get disorganized.,
Look at your clothes!,
Pair up the outfits you normally wear.,
Try pairing your articles of clothing up with different ones from usual.,
If you're in a creative mood, maybe do one of the following: You can get fabric paint and splatter different colors on a top you may wear out to the mall.,
Look at patterns online, if you have some sewing skill you can easily alter most clothes.,
Putting your clothes back.,
Now, you PUT your clothes back.,
Follow by putting everything else back in an organized manner.

,
Step back and enjoy your wondrous closet!",How to Make Your Wardrobe New Without Buying Anything," The first step is for you to neatly take all of your clothes and etc. out of your closet. Then, put the ones you do not want in a pile to donate or sell somewhere.;
, This is the most important step in the process. Look at them and think 'Do I wear the same pattern of outfits over and over again?' and, 'Do all of these look the same, just in different colors?' Put clothes that you either have a duplicate of or you are just tired of it in a pile SEPARATE of your throw-out pile.


The separate pile will be spiffed up by doing something as simple as using scissors to cut off extra beading,so it won't look the same as the other shirt similar to it.







, Ex. I normally wear a green t-shirt with a logo on it and jeans. That would be a pair. Try to find out where your weaknesses are. Maybe you always wear a red blouse with your black cardigan. When you have them all paired in the basic piles, go onto step 4.

, Bring out your shoes and jewelry. Make a belch outfit pop with an awesome necklace. Or, on the make-up side, wear a different color of lip gloss, eye-shadow, lipstick, or blush with an outfit that doesn't have a lot of spark.

, Or, get some iron-ons, and iron them on for a different feel. Maybe, you could make some old and ugly jewelry look new again by cleaning it off- a simple thing like that could make it wear-able!

, If not, you could always take them to a seamstress or a tailor.

, When you put your clothes back, make sure to clean the rest of your closet (Yes, like getting extra junk out, dusting, e.t.c.). It will make you want to look at your closet more, and not avoid it.

, But do not put a pair of jeans by a t-shirt. Designate an area for t-shirts, and area for blouses, and area for skirts and jeans, and an area for jackets. While putting them away in their designated areas, try to put them in color order, so when you want a red top, you can find one lickety-split.

,, Enjoy!

Layer appropriately.,
Incorporate tights.,
Add a hoodie to your wardrobe.,
Transition your summer shoes smoothly.,
Start incorporating warmer colors.,
Add fall fabrics gradually.,
Use leather to stay warm.,
Add bolder jewelry.,
Start wearing hats.,
Use accessories to keep warm.,
Incorporate fall color with a tie.,
Change your makeup style for fall.",How to Transition Your Wardrobe to Fall," Layering is one of the best means to transition a wardrobe item from summer to fall. If you don't want to put away your favorite band t-shirt or summer dress, some layering allows you to wear the item into the fall months.Throw on a nice button down jacket or cardigan over a shorter sleeved t-shirt. This will make the item warm enough for fall. You can also add a jacket or blazer to a shorter sleeved dress in order to wear it through the fall.In addition to saving a dress with a jacket, a long-sleeved or 3/4 sleeved t-shirt can be worn under a short sleeve or sleeveless dress.;
, If you want to save a summer skirt, dress, or a pair of shorts, you can wear tights with them. A cute pair of tights under a skirt, dress, or shorts can be a great addition to a fall wardrobe. You'll be able to keep your shorter items of clothing out of storage into the fall.In addition to keeping you warm, you can use tights to add in fall colors. If you have, say, a white skirt, you can wear with a pair of shorts in a warmer color, like orange or amber. This will give your outfit a look more appropriate with fall.

, Hoodies can be fashionable in more casual settings. If you're, say, going out with friends, throw a zip up hoodie on over a t-shirt. This will allow you to wear something with shorter sleeves well into the fall months.In addition to zip-up hoodies, you can wear a hoodie with no zip over a shorter dress for a cute, casual look.
As with tights, hoodies can be used to add fall colors. If you have a hoodie in a warmer shade, throw it on over a short sleeve item that's brighter.

, There's no need to throw out the sandals right away. As long as it's warm enough, it's appropriate to keep wearing sandals with heavier fall items. You can also wear an in-between shoe item, like work boots, desert boots, or dress shoes.You can also start wearing socks with a more summery shoe to transition into the fall.
Flats can be an excellent choice as they're appropriate for both the summer and winter months., You don't need to make the transition all at once. It will look smoother and more natural if you gradually incorporate warmer colors into your wardrobe. As the season goes on, you can gradually transition brighter colors out completely.Fall colors are colors that have an earthy tone, like oranges, browns, golds, darker blues, and burgundies. You can add a dash of warmer colors here and there, like a burgundy blazer over a lighter shirt, and gradually add more and more warm colors as the season goes on.
A good way to make the transition easier is to look for lighter, more summery clothing in fall shades. This will help bridge the gap between the warmer and colder months.

, As with color, you don't want to suddenly switch to fall fabrics. You can start adding more fall appropriate fabric choices here and there. Mix and match fall and summer fabrics for a smooth transition into the fall.Cashmere, wool, tweed, and flannel are typically associated with the fall months. It can be awkward, however, to jump into a wardrobe defined by these fabrics. There will probably be days in the fall that are slightly warmer, and you may be uncomfortable in something that's, say, completely flannel.
You can add fall fabrics by incorporating items that won't keep you too warm on the early days of fall. Add wool socks, for example, or a tweed tie.
You can also have something you can easily remove in a fall fabric. For example, wear a flannel button-down underneath a lighter t-shirt.

, Leather is always stylish and it can keep you warm in the fall months. You can add bits of leather to your wardrobe to stay warm as you're transitioning your summer pieces into fall.You can wear a leather skirt or pair of leather leggings with a more summery top.
A leather jacket can be worn over a lighter t-shirt.

, As fall comes around, bolder and clunkier jewelry is appropriate. More delicate jewelry may be difficult to see under heavier items. As you start to add things like turtlenecks and scarves, opt for larger pieces of jewelry to compensate,Go for things like statement necklaces and necklaces with large pendants or beads.
Bigger earrings may also make your jewelry more noticeable in fall. You can try dangly earrings, hoop earrings, or other bigger items.

, Hats are always in style, and can keep you warm as fall approaches. As it warms up, you can add a hat to most outfits for a nice accessory.A knitted hat can be particularly nice for fall, as it's a typical fall fashion that will keep you warm.
You can also try incorporating fall colors with your hats. You can, for example, add a brown knit cap to an outfit that has more summer colors.

, You can use accessories to help on days that get cooler. You can wear a scarf out, a leather belt, or a cardigan to both keep warm and accessorize.Have a variety of scarves of different shapes, sizes, and textures. This way, if the weather varies in your area, you will always have a scarf that's appropriate. You can wear a lighter scarf on warmer days, and a longer, thicker one as it cools down.

, If you wear ties, a tie is a good way to smoothly add some fall color. If you're still wearing button-down shirts with a summery color, add a tie in a warmer shade. This will help you make the transition from summer to fall colors more gradual., As fall rolls around, you'll want warmer colors for your makeup. You can start with small tweaks, like a warmer lipstick, and eventually start using warmer shades of eye shadow and slightly heavier eyeliner. A cat eye can be a good look for fall.You can switch from bright pastel eye shadows to darker, warmer colors.
You may also want to change to more weather resistant types of makeup, such as waterproof makeup, as fall may come with harsh winds, rain, and snow.

Combine your casual clothing with sexier pieces.,
Show off your shape.,
Find the right size.,
Leave something to the imagination.,
Wear more red.,
Get rid of your old, boring clothing.,
Study fashion blogs and magazines for inspiration.,
Be confident in yourself.,
Take care of your personal hygiene.,
Enhance your look with the right makeup and fragrance.,
Don't try too hard.",How to Dress Sexy but Casual," Creating a balance between sexy and casual is all about mixing up lengths, styles, and fits. You can wear things that drape for a casual look combined with something tight to add a bit of sex appeal, or you can show off your legs with a sexy skirt while wearing a more modest top.


Combine a short bottom, such as a mini shirt, with a turtleneck or long sleeved top.
Pair a low cut or open back shirt with a fashionable pair of wide-leg pants.
Throw on those jeans that accentuate your curves with a flowy top. You can also belt the top to show off your waist.
Add textures like lace and leather to your look. Black pants are sexier when they're black leather pants. A lace top will allow you to subtly show some skin while still looking relaxed and casual.;
, Wearing figure flattering clothing is the key to enhancing your sex appeal. Don't hide your shape with baggy clothing, but don't squeeze your body into extremely tight clothing either. Everyone has their own unique assets, so choose the clothes that best accentuate yours.


If you think your arms are sexy, fill your closet with sleeveless tops. If you love the way your back looks, buy some tops and dresses that have open backs. If your legs are your favorite body part, short skirts and dresses should fill your closet.
Replace bulky sweaters with slimming dark colored turtlenecks, replace looser skirts with tight pencil skirts, replace baggy t-shirts with tight v-necks. Though these changes are subtle, they'll give you the casual, sexy look you're going for.

, Wearing clothing that is too big or too small is rarely figure flattering, and can draw attention to all the wrong areas. If you're unsure of your proper size, ask a salesperson for help when you're out purchasing your new, sexy wardrobe., There's a common misconception that showing more skin is equal to being sexy. There's absolutely nothing wrong with loving your body, but showing a lot of skin can come off as trying too hard, especially in a casual environment. Instead, wear clothing that shows off your figure but still leaves some of your body to the imagination.Wear a long sleeved knee length body glove dress. You'll be all covered up, but you'll still be showing off your shape.
Wear high waisted pants with a cropped, flowy top. You'll get to show off your legs and hips without showing tons of skin.

, The red effect is very real, and has been proven time and again in studies. Researchers have learned that there are several biological factors that actually make women appear more attractive to men when wearing red and that women perceive men as being more dominant when wearing red. So yes, wearing red will scientifically make you sexier, even if it's something as casual as an oversized sweater., If you've been wearing the same old clothing for years, giving your closet a makeover is the perfect way to add some sex appeal to your wardrobe. Get rid of the clothes that don't make you feel great and replace them with new pieces that you find sexy. If you've been wanting your very own little black dress, now's the time to get one! If you're sick of wearing the same boring suit to work, change it up with a bold color or different design.Wearing old clothing doesn't feel fresh or exciting. Being excited about what you're wearing will give you a boost of confidence, and confidence is always sexy. A new pair of jeans that fit you like a glove will make you feel sexier than the old pair that don't seem to be as flattering as they once were.

, When changing your wardrobe, you may need a bit of guidance to point you in the right direction. Looking through fashion blogs and magazines can help you find the sexy, casual look you're going for and teach you how to put your ideal outfits together.


Create a Pinterest board of casual outfits you find sexy. Look for the trends you see on your Pinterest board and add those items to your closet. If your Pinterest board is showing a lot of pumps, it's time to add some pumps to your shoe collection. If your Pinterest board is filled with distressed jeans, then get yourself a few pairs of new denim.
Study how your favorite sexy, yet causal outfits are put together and copy them. Mastering the art of a sexy, yet casual look is all about balance. Pair a sexy top with casual pants, or give a t-shirt and jeans some sex appeal with 5 inch high heels., If you feel sexy, then you'll look sexy. If you don't feel sexy, that will show as well. Confidence is one of the sexiest ways to spice up your outfit, so own it! Pair your sexy new clothing with a confident attitude, and your sex appeal will be undeniable., Your sexy, casual look will be incomplete without the proper hygiene, so create a beauty routine to go with your new wardrobe.


The right haircut and hairstyle can make or break your casual, sexy look. Whether you prefer the messy, natural look or a simple, refined bun, choose a hairstyle that makes you feel sexy. If you're running around town in black pants and a sweater, add a bit of sexy to your look with big, bouncy curls. If you're wearing a short dress, sweeten the look with a half-ponytail or a bun.

, The right makeup and fragrance will transform a nice outfit into a sexy outfit. Appealing to multiple senses – sight and smell – will take your look to the next level.


Makeup is a great way to complete your look. However, if you're going for the casual, sexy look, keep your makeup on the lighter side. For example, if you're wearing eyeliner, go with a nude lip or lip gloss. If you're not big on eye makeup, give your lip a splash of color with red lipstick. These techniques will make you look effortlessly sexy.
Pick a personal fragrance that you love. The perfect finish to an outfit is your favorite perfume or cologne. Lightly spritz yourself before you head out to add a bit of extra sex appeal to your look., Trying to be somebody you're not is never a good idea, and it's obvious to others. Instead of trying to change yourself, embrace what's naturally sexy about you. The more comfortable you appear, the sexier you'll look – no matter how casual your outfit is.


If you're not a dress girl, you don't have to wear dresses to be sexy. Instead, throw on some figure flattering pants with a low-cut top, or a crop top, and step out with confidence.
For men who don't like to dress up, pair a blazer with sweatpants for a casual, sexy, and trendy look. You'll be comfortable and look great."

Be Patient.,
Buy a fashion and make-up book.,
Clear out all drawers and you wardrobe.,
Ask a friend to go shopping in a huge place with you.,
Buy the make-up first.,
Buy essentials!,
Buy extras.,
Buy accessories.,
Buy a fancy dress for occasions.,
With a friend go to a spa.,
To finish off a tiring day of shopping have a girls night in with a box of sweets and a movie.",How to Improve Your Style and Wardrobe," Before you begin let me tell you this will take some time to do, if you transform yourself it will change how you feel and maybe it will change what other people think. You will hopefully have more confidence in your self since you will be wearing new clothes and have a new well-suited haircut. You will have to work to obtain this by buying latest fashions, styling your hair and applying your make-up to look natural.;
, You will need this to help you with your choices throughout the re-vamp!

, To clear out clothes you should start with throwing out what is ripped and what is too small. Once you have done that you should now be able to clear out what you don't like. Then with shoes try all on and clear out what you need too following the rules above. With accessories throw out the broken and dispose of them, with make-up throw out the empty, the messy and the ones that don't compliment your skin tone. Once you have everything you are going to clear out decide what you can sell, fix or give away to a friend or charity.

, Think about what friend would be best to go with, one that isn't too nice to say no to a bad outfit, one that won't get bored, one that will stay with you and do her own shopping as well, one that will make the shopping trip fun and one who can crack a laugh and isn't picky where she eats and shops. Ask the friend who you decide along to a huge shopping trip to make the re-vamp more fun.

, Do a checklist and tick off what you have at home already before you go shopping. You will need a foundation (the shade should match your skin tone as much as possible), blusher, a pink for pale skin or a plum for darker, lipstick (a red for pale porcelain type complexions if you want to look doll-like which is a good look with floral or for tanned for an easy going look, a plum for darker skin or a pale pink for girly girl looks such as vintage or glamour) eyeliner (go for black or you could be adventurous and go for blue, brown, purple or pink), mascara(go for black, brown or clear for work/school/parties or for a very party look go for blue, purple or pink), concealer(again one shade lighter than skin tone), eyebrow pencil(in same colour as brow), lip liner(same colour as lipstick), lipgloss(shiny clear is always good) and any sparkly stuff (use sparingly!) for nights out.

, If you wear the same outfit over and over it will look different with a new necklace, bangle, shoes, belts, bags, purses and hairbands.

, Choose a little black dress or a lovely dress that will be timeless so you don't always need to re-vamp your wardrobe to update the fashion.

, Get manicures, makeovers, facials, pedicures, massages and a haircut.

, At the end of the day you will want nothing more than a box of chocolates and a long movie wrapped in a blanket in your pajamas.

Use a safety pin or hair tie to fasten the two back straps of your bra together towards the top of your back. This will create a sort of halter in front, lifting your breasts and bringing them closer together.Wear two bras for extra volume and lift in your chest. The first bra you put on should push your breasts together (try the twisting technique if you don’t have a bra that naturally does this).

, Camel toe can be a problem with stretchier fabrics, such as yoga pants that some people wear to work out.


Buy clothing, especially when choosing workout clothing, that has built in lining at the crotch. The extra layer is designed to reduce embarrassing problems like camel toe. Stay away from 100-percent Spandex clothing.Avoid linen and polyester fabrics, especially if it's warm out. These types of fabrics are more likely to cause camel toe.

, Black or darker fabrics are more likely to hide what some people call “crotch cleavage.”


The worst possible fabric for camel toe would be a thinner, unsupported polyester or yoga pant in a light color.
The problem with white or light beige fabrics, especially if they are non tailored yoga or otherwise stretchy pants, is that they leave almost nothing to the imagination.

, Choose thicker leggings that are matte enough so that you can’t see your underwear through them.


Whatever you do, don’t wear tights as leggings. They will be so see-through that you will have more problems than camel toe.Wear a long shirt or sweater over the leggings. No one really wants to look at your crotch area in leggings anyway. Try a tunic."

Wear underwear.,
Buy clothing or panties with multiple seams.,
Choose pants with a lower waist.",How to Prevent Camel Toe2," If you want to avoid camel toe, don’t go “commando” (without underwear). Going without underwear will increase the chances you’ll have this problem.


This is especially true with fabric that is especially thin or made out of material that stretches or is lighter in color. If you don’t wear underwear with such already unsupported fabric, you’ve got a double problem.
Wear thicker panties. The panties are less likely to cause camel toe because they won’t get pulled into your private parts as easily. Thicker panties will also provide some support, smoothing out lines.

, Try to buy jeans, slacks or workout gear that contains multiple seams.


For example, you could look for clothing with seams that have a V formation in the crotch area.
Clothing that has a single seam running through the crotch area is more prone to camel toe. That’s because the looser fabric will more easily creep into your private area.

, This holds true for workout pants as well as for blue jeans. The higher the waist, and the more likely you are to get camel toe.Try on clothing, squat and sit in it inside the fitting room before you purchase it to test it out for camel toe. Avoid the ""mom jeans"" look. Jeans that ride up the hips could cause you a camel toe problem (not to mention being uncomfortable and unflattering).
Choose pants and workout clothes that fit comfortably on your hips. You want to avoid clothing that will ride up and bunch in your privates area.

Wear a panty liner.,
Pull the fabric out of your privates.,
Buy special camel toe inserts or panties.,
Try card stock.",How to Prevent Camel Toe3," If you’re already out on the town, and you realize you have camel toe, a quick fix is to wear a panty liner. Many beauty pageant contestants use this trick.Instead of wearing the panty liner vertically like you normally would, fasten it to your underwear horizontally, and place it around the seat of your underwear.
You can think of this maneuver as applying the panty liner as if it is a Band-aid.

, This seems like the simplest solution, but it’s only a quick fix because the camel toe could come back.

However, in the restroom or a private area, simply tug at the material so that it loosens around your private area.
You could also pull your pants down a notch at the waist to reduce the tightness around your crotch area. If all else fails, tie a sweater around your waist.

, Whenever a problem arises in society, people invent a solution to it. Camel toe is no different.


You can also buy commercial inserts that resemble panty liners but are specifically designed to prevent cameltoe. Camel Ammo and Camelflage are two such brands.You can purchase special panties designed to prevent camel toe, especially online. Some of the panties are designed out of special materials that won’t bunch. Some of them have a triangular patch sewn into the area of your privates.You can also find commercial camel toe guards that resemble men’s athletic cups. Some of these products are flesh colored. Look for them online.

, If you don't have a panty liner handy, you could cut out a small piece of card stock and create your own panty liner out of it.


You will use it vertically. Cut it to the approximate size of the crotch section of your panties.
Then, layer the piece of cardstock underneath the panty liner. Wrap the wings around the bottom of the crotch of your underwear and smooth them down. The extra cardstock should work as a cup to keep everything hidden.

Ill-fitting undergarments will not enhance your curves, but they may also be uncomfortable.Stores that specialize in quality lingerie can offer you qualified salespeople who will find for you the proper size bra. Note that sizing varies from one company to the next, so you may have a different bra size for each brand you wear.;
, Once you’ve been fitted for the proper sized bra, buy a bra that enhances and shapes your chest while supporting it.Get bras with an underwire, a good lining, and maybe even some padding.Each of these features can take a curvy or boyish shape from drab to fab.
Buy a few styles so you have options for different looks. For example, you’ll want a nude bra for lighter colored clothing and a black one for darker garments. Having a seamless bra will create a smooth silhouette., Undergarments such as Spandex help control specific parts of your body by highlighting or creating curves while while smoothing out your shape.Shape wear comes in all different shapes and sizes depending on where you would like to either accentuate or create curves. For example, you can get something that looks like a traditional “girdle” that will smooth out and enhance the curve of your bum, belly, and thighs, whether you are naturally curvy or have a more boyish shape.
You can buy shape wear at many stores and websites offering quality brands.

, Clothing is usually mass-produced to accommodate standard body types. Clothes that are tailored to fit your body will accentuate or highlight curves while hiding any spots you may not like. Tailored pieces can also create curves if you aren’t naturally curvy.In order to best accentuate your curves, your clothes should be formfitting but not tight, nip in at your waist, hug your hips, and fall loosely over your thighs and calves.If you want to create curves on a slimmer figure, you can make your clothing tailored so it’s slightly more formfitting, but not skintight.For example, you can have a boxy top tailored to be more form fitting and flattering to your figure by adding darts, or have wrap dresses and skirts adjusted so that they just skim your curves., Solid colors will create a slim line and color blocking, which is a way of wearing two or more solid colors, will help further accentuate your curves.You can also use color blocking to create curves. For example, a dress that has side panels in a different color that taper in will define your waist and give you a curvier look.Horizontal color blocking, such as wearing one color on top and another on the bottom, is a bit more subtle but will also highlight your curves., Because fabrics fall in different ways on a person’s body, choosing the right fabrics for your clothing will help accentuate or create curves.The best options are medium-weight knits and soft fabrics that will drape well over your curves.Consider cotton with a small percentage of spandex to help the garment lightly skim your body while retaining it’s shape.
If you aren’t naturally curvy, consider fabrics that have a bit more spandex to hug your body while creating curves.

, Small clothing embellishments and details, such as a peplum or an A-line, will accentuate or create curves by drawing the eye towards specific areas of your body.Peplums are a good way to make your hips look curvier.The peplum should be structured and not hang loosely from the article of clothing.If you’re wearing a peplum, stick to slim pants or pencil skirts that go below your knees to create a tapered look. This will make your hips look curvier and your waist smaller.High necklines can make a woman look boxy, so opt for lower necklines that break up your chest area and draw attention towards your face.Off the shoulder tops or strapless dresses draw horizontal lines across you and emphasize the widest part of your body. This makes your waist look smaller, helping to create an hourglass shape.An A-line skirt that nips in at the waist will also help create curves, especially if you pair it with a more form fitting, tucked-in top.Draping, which is often seen on soft, stretchy fabrics, is another way to create structure and highlight or create curves., The most effective way to highlight your shape and create curves is to accentuate your waist.There are a number of ways you can do accentuate your waist, including wearing a belt or an A-line skirt, or getting tops tailored to your waist., Wearing clothing that is either too large for you or loose and flowing will hide your curves and create a boxy shape.Any woman can wear prints, just keep in mind the silhouette. If you’re naturally curvy, use prints to play up one part of your body while keeping the rest of your outfit simple. If you’re naturally slim, you can wear prints with just about anything. For example, you might consider a printed blouse with a nipped in waist to create curves., Accentuating your waist is one of the best ways to show off your curves and wearing a belt will help to create a waistline on any look.Make sure the belt fits with your look. There are innumerable choices in belts, and finding the right style is key to creating a waist. For example, if you are wearing a tighter top, wear a thinner belt. For dresses, you can choose thicker belts, including Japanese-style obis.

, A pair of simple, classic heels will not only lengthen your legs, but also help create an hourglass shape.Make sure to choose simple heels and avoid details like ankle-straps, which will cut the line of your look., You’ll want to pull your curve-highlighting look together with the right jewelry. From earrings to necklaces and bracelets, these simple details will complete your outfit, giving you confidence.


Longer earrings and necklaces will highlight your shoulders.
A stack of glittery bracelets can draw attention to your hips.

, One accessory every woman should have that will help draw attention to curves is confidence. Putting together your curve-accentuating look and knowing that you look good will give you this confidence.

;
, It can be a little tricky to take an accurate chest measurement on your own, so if possible, see if you can find a friend to help you. If not, you'll just need to be extra careful to make sure the tape measure doesn't slip in the back.








, Any extra fabric will add a few centimeters to your measurement. Since you'll be wearing a bra under the clothing you're getting measured for, the extra fabric of the bra should be included in your measurement.








, Position it so that the tape is horizontal to the ground, and falls just under your armpits. Bring it around your back so that the ends come together in front, across the widest part of your breasts.









Don't stick your chest out or exhale; just stand normally.
Make sure the tape measure is not twisted.

, The place where the end of the tape measure meets with the other side is where you'll find the number that indicates your chest size.








, This type of tape measure is made of soft material that makes it easy to wrap around your body. If you don't have one, you can instead use a piece of string to wrap around your chest, and measure the string with a ruler to get your size.








, You will get the most accurate measurement if someone else is holding the tape, since they'll be able to make sure it's lined up correctly across your back. However, you can still get a very accurate measurement if you just want to do it yourself.









If you must take the measurement yourself, do it in front of a mirror, so that you can see if the tape is parallel to the ground all the way around.

, Clothing adds extra width to the measurement, so it's better not to be wearing anything on your torso.








, Slide it tape so that it surrounds your chest and falls just under your armpits. Rest it securely around the widest part of your chest, which is often above or at the nipple line. If you are performing the measuring yourself, make sure the numbers are turned out so that you can read it in the mirror.









Hold the ends of the tape with both hands in the front of your body, so you'll be able to see the measurement.
Look in the mirror and make sure the measuring tape isn't twisted.
Ensure the tape is at the same height all the way around. It should be parallel with the ground.

, Don't puff out your chest or flex your muscles. This will add a few centimeters to the measurement and make it less accurate.








, Look in the mirror at the place where the beginning end of the tape measure and the remaining portion meet in the front of your chest. This number is your chest measurement.









Don't look down at the tape to take your measurement, since this can cause it to slip out of place. Look in the mirror instead.
Add 2 inches (5cm) to the measurement for any garment that you want to be slightly loose, such as a dress shirt. Always round up the measurement when buying clothing.

Buy age-appropriate clothing (more relevant for women).,
Look at your potential purchases from different angles.",How to Dress Well when You're Overweight," The colors, cut and patterns you wear can draw people's eyes toward or away from your figure. Here are some basics:


Dark colors hide, while light colors highlight. So if you like your waist, wear a light belt over a dark shirt. If you want to hide your bottom half, wear dark pants and a lighter top.
Big patterns will make you look bigger, while small patterns can make you look smaller.






Avoid horizontal stripes. Stripes are okay on plus size clothing if they are diagonal or vertical. If you want to look larger in the bust area, horizontal stripes will enhance the bustline.






Don't put ruffles on anything you want to look smaller; do put them on areas you want to emphasize. This means that anyone looking at you will be attracted to the area of emphasis
Wear ruched or gathered fabric on areas you want to make look smaller. For instance, you might see a one-piece swimsuit with ruched panels over the belly.






Know what colors look good on you. A flattering color can make your skin tone glow, while the wrong one can make you look sallow and washed-out.
Wear something that is baggy like a blouse and this ensures that it's both stylish and dressed well.;
, It's true that your underclothes are the foundation of your look - it's hard to look good when you're wearing flimsy underwear that doesn't support you sufficiently.

Buy a bra that fits (women). Not only will a good bra help lift your figure and make you look younger, it'll help you avoid backaches. If you're not sure what your size is, visit a department store such as Nordstrom or Dillard's (US) for a fitting. Do not go to Victoria's Secret - chances are you'll need an uncommon size, and they carry a narrow range of sizes.
To lose a bit of girth around your hips and thighs, wear low-legged, high-waisted underwear in a firm, supportive cotton.






Make sure you have sufficient coverage. Underwear that's too small is not underwear you should buy. If you can't find the right size at your mall or local stores, look online.

, If you tend to carry your weight in your hips and legs (that is, you're ""pear-shaped""), pay extra attention to these tips:


Seek out tailored skirts and trousers. Avoid flared pants and wide-leg trousers.






Avoid shapeless garments, like broomstick skirts and ""one-size"" dresses. Instead, find something with a nipped waist.
If you're looking for a skirt, you can't go wrong with an A-line cut. Avoid pencil skirts as this shapes and outlines your hips and waist. However, skirts such as skater skirts would really bring out the beauty in every individual .
Buy at least one pair of well-fitting jeans. Skinny or straight-leg jeans in a dark wash look great.






Be very careful with leggings. For some women, a long shirt or dress with leggings is a slimming and fashionable look. However, if you have larger hips, thighs, or bottom, it can look awful.

, Depending on your body type, this could be the difficult or easy part. If you tend to carry your weight around your stomach and shoulders (or you're ""apple-shaped""), these tips can help:


Choose shaped T-shirts and dresses over ""straight T"" shirts and un-tailored dresses. They should be fitted closely to your natural waist and shoulders.
For men, wear tailored shirts. Pay extra attention to making sure the neck and wrists are fitted.






For women, skip spaghetti-strap or halter tops. You'll want your shirt to cover your bra straps, and they might be wide.
Wear full-length cardigans and jackets - don't opt for cropped lengths.






If you like your forearms, wear a three-quarters sleeve. If you dislike your arms, wear full sleeves or short sleeves - breaking up your arms in the middle with a sleeve will look even more unflattering.
If you're wearing skinny jeans or leggings, try a tunic-style top that's a bit flowing. Wearing a top that's not fitting is fine as long as your bottom half looks tailored and well-fitted.






Button-down shirts must fit properly across the bust and stomach. That means there's no pulling of the fabric at the button. If it does, the shirt does not fit.

, Beautiful and unusual accessories not only make your wardrobe more versatile, but are blind to weight gains or losses.

Larger women can pull off large, bold jewelry that would overwhelm smaller-framed women. Teeny earrings and pendants may get lost on you, however.






A big handbag bag can help make you look smaller, as it does not look tiny next to you.






Two or three chunky bangles will make a plump wrist appear slender. Wearing long dangly earrings elongates the neck.
Good boots, such as ""equestrian-style"" boots can cause the illusion of a slender calf. A good pair of boots makes wearing a skirts or pants a positive joy.






If you have heavy legs and ankles, avoid delicate or flimsy footwear; it will make it look as if you are about to fall over, or sink into the floor. A wedge heel, on the other hand, looks marvellous, however stout your legs are.
Last but not the least, be confident in how you look- you are you for a reason and no one can take that away from you.

,, The longer the shorts the less leg you see., A few small mental shifts can make all the difference in how you look, and (best of all) they're absolutely free. Cultivate your confidence in these areas:

Stop paying attention to sizing tags. Especially in the US, clothing sizes can be extremely arbitrary and not standard from designer to designer. Don't focus on maintaining a certain size, and then find yourself heartbroken when the garment that fits you is bigger than that. Instead, focus on finding clothes that fit. If it helps, cut the sizing tags off all your clothing.






Spend time taking care of yourself. You are worthy of attention, and you deserve to feel your best. Schedule time each day for grooming, and don't break the appointment. Telling yourself it's OK to look sloppy because you're already overweight is the worst thing you can do. Pay attention to your skin, hair, fingernails and toenails, body hair (optional) and makeup (optional).
Accept your body as it is for today. You might have long-term goals for changing your body, but chances are they won't happen overnight. Instead of obsessing over what your physique is not, appreciate what it is for just this day. Remember, you only get one body - be nice to it!







, Whatever you put on, make sure you're wearing the garments, and not vice versa. If you struggle with confidence, try these things:

Don't buy ""tent"" clothing. Clothes that are too big might seem like they're doing you a favor by hiding your body, but they're actually communicating a lack of confidence. Instead, buy what fits and rely on colors, patterns and embellishments to draw the eye away from your flaws (see more on that below).






Practice good posture. The way you carry your body can make all the difference in how your clothes look. Keep your chin up high, your shoulders back, your spine straight, and your hips centered over your feet. When you walk, don't shuffle and barely lift your feet off the ground - instead, practice the sort of ""gliding"" walk that beauty queens learn, that doesn't cause your body to bounce up and down very much. You can practice this with the old balance-a-book-on-your-head trick.






Fashion is supposed to make you feel good. Clothes are not supposed to make you feel bad about yourself. They are supposed to provide comfort, protection, modesty, and aesthetic pleasure. If it isn't happening, that's not fashionable for you.

, Putting a measuring tape around yourself might seem like your worst nightmare, but you have to know your size if you're going to dress well. Try to remove yourself from the situation as much as possible, and recognize that these are just arbitrary numbers - they're not measurements of who you are as a person.


Buy a soft measuring tape, which can be folded into a coil. Seamstresses and tailors use these. Or, if you're short on cash, ask if you can have your measurements taken at your dry cleaner's.
Take the measurements for your neck, bust and underbust (for women), waist, hips, and thighs.
Write down your measurements. Keep this information handy whenever you're shopping, so that you'll know exactly what you need.

, Sometimes your size just isn't fitted well ""off the rack"". You may have an ample bosom but a skinny waist, for instance, and so most clothing that fits your bosom swallows your waist. Instead of walking around in clothes that don't flatter, bring them to a professional to alter to your size. Ask your dry cleaner for a recommendation.

, If you dread going shopping because it forces you to focus on your size, try to turn it around and make it a fun event. Take an upbeat friend with you, or go in with the attitude that nothing can get you down today. See the employees as people who care about clothing and would be excited to help you look your best. If someone proves you wrong, move on to the next salesperson.

, Instead of buying numerous sloppy, frumpy pieces of clothing that don't flatter you, invest in a few well-made items that you love and will last awhile.


Don't just cruise the clearance racks. Sales are fine if you see something you'd buy anyway for a great price, but don't make them the exclusive focus of your shopping. Think about it this way: A few high-quality items that make you feel amazing and last for 3 or 4 years are ultimately a better value than 10 or 15 items from the clearance rack that wear out quickly and make you feel less than your best.

, Here's a good rule of thumb: If someone 20 years younger or 20 years older than you would also be shopping in this department, then readjust. You don't want to look too young and seem like you're trying too hard, but you also don't want to buy clothes that age you. If you're unsure, look around at the other customers - are they about the same age as you?

, Sit down in front of the dressing-room mirror. Many overweight women do not realize that what looks good standing up is disastrous sitting down. Does your skirt ride up and show a lumpy thigh? Can you wave to a friend across the room without straining at your sleeve? If there is the least chance that you will feel uncomfortable, find an alternative: there's nothing worse than the suspicion that any sudden movements will split your seams.

Get a suitcase or messenger bag.",How to Dress Well As an Overweight Man," You may have been lighter several months or years ago, or maybe you are about to start a new diet. However, if it doesn't fit you now, don't wear it. This might mean that you have to invest in some new clothes that fit you. Too-tight clothing just draws attention to the fact that you're overweight, emphasizing curves you may not want emphasized. Similarly, over-sized clothes don't make big people look smaller, they just make you look bigger. While Kate Moss might look even more rail thin wearing something that is over-sized, this is not the case with larger people.;
, Chances are they will only make you look sloppy. A T-shirt that is two sizes too big will be too wide in the shoulders and neck and hang down below your crotch, making you look even bigger as a result.


If you have problems keeping shirts tucked in, you can change that. Buy shirts labeled ""tall"", which are usually available only in large or XL. If you are in that size group, then they will fit you well without being too big. Put your shirt on first, and then your pants. Do not do too much ""blousing out"" of the shirt, particularly at the front, but also don't tuck too tight--somewhere in between the two extremes will look best.

, If the pants fit in the waist, but are busting at the seams at your thighs, buy a larger size that fits your thighs and have them taken in at the waist. It is better to pay a little extra for pants that fit you perfectly than $50 for pants that don't.

, Some overweight men may not want to wear shorts or t-shirts in the summer because of insecurities. However, dressing in out of season clothing to try and cover it up will only draw more attention to you. Wear clothing that suits the environment to fit in instead of sticking out., Even a faint pinstripe (which is very in right now) does wonders for creating a nice vertical line. Make sure that the stripes are on clothes that fit you because even a simple pattern like a stripe can accentuate clothes that don't fit and make you look enormous instead of giving you the slim look you're trying to achieve.


Wear vertical stripes instead of horizontal stripes. Vertical stripes can help to slim your appearance, and horizontal stripes can actually make you appear wider.
Avoid bold patterns and contrasting colors., The shape of the collar on a v-neck sweater or t-shirt can help to make the neckline appear longer.This can help make double chins a little less noticeable.


When purchasing dress shirts, select shirts with a spread collar to balance out the proportion with your face.Avoid turtlenecks as they can make your neckline disappear., Straight leg pants (meaning as wide at the bottom as at the thigh) keep you from being V-shaped with tiny ankles and a wider midsection. If your pants fit, you don't need pleats.

, Avoid thicker fabrics. Cargo pants, hoodies with front pouches, and bulky sweaters can make you look bigger. Shoulder pads are also a generally a no-no. While natural materials are generally preferable, synthetics can help you cut down on how bulky your clothes appear during colder seasons.


Select cashmere over heavier wool sweaters. The lighter fabric will still keep you warm without adding bulk to your body.
If you sweat a lot, you will want to avoid synthetic fibers like rayon and natural fibers like silk. While they may drape well, they are not breathable and can lead to excess sweating and discomfort.When choosing a jacket, select one that suits your body shape. Avoid a double-vented jacket if you have a large backside. The slits will likely leave you exposed. Try getting a single vent jacket instead., Longer hemlines can help to elongate your body.When possible, wear shirts, jacket or coat that goes down further down your body. Finding shirts that look good without being tucked in can help to lengthen your body. You can also wear a trench style coat over a short coat to help lengthen your appearance.

, Lighter shades attract attention, darker shades detract. Use these principles in conjunction to suit your body best. If your torso is larger than your bottom half, dark clothing on top and light on bottom can help you look more proportional. Additionally, undershirts can keep you cooler in the summer, warmer in the winter, and keep you from appearing too sweaty.

, One that is wide, thick, and sturdy will work best, and you should wear it tighter with a tucked shirt than with an un-tucked shirt (a wide belt will feel more comfortable if tight than a narrow belt will.)


As an alternative, try switching from a belt to suspenders.Suspenders with business attire will look much more stylish than a belt. Select a bright color like red to brighten up your look.

, If you wear a tie when you go to work, be sure to purchase ties that are wider. Buying a thinner tie will make it seem as though your body is even larger and the tie is smaller.Be sure when you tie it that your tie comes all the way down to your belt.

, Pick out a fedora or similar hat that suits your personality and make it your trademark. Wearing a stylish hat shows that you noticed all the details when assembling your wardrobe. It can help dispell any notions that you are heavyset because you are lazy.

, If you normally carry around a large wallet or giant cell phone you might want to consider using something other than your pocket to transport your gadgets or accessories around. While nobody wants a man-purse, lots of things in your pocket just add weight to your waistline. For a very professional look, invest in a high-quality briefcase.


If you wear an accessory like a watch, select items that are on the larger side. You want to avoid small accessories that can make it seem out of proportion compared to your size.

Choose a quality bra.,
Choose tops that skim the body.,
Look for structured busts.,
Go sleeveless or try sheer sleeves.",How to Dress Sexy (for Larger Women)1," Remember the importance of good quality undergarments for the foundation of any sexy outfit. Find a bra that features comfort in the cups, band, and straps.


Look for wide straps to support a larger chest. The center front of the bra should lie flat across your breastbone, the band should lie parallel all the way around your chest without riding up, and there should be no spillover from the cups or gap between breast and cup.Consider your outfit for an evening or other occasion when you want to dress to impress. A strapless top or dress will need a strapless bra, a plunging neckline will need a plunge cut bra, a low back or cutout style will need a low-back or backless bra, etc.
Consider a bra that’s built into a longer control-top undergarment if you want to offer more support for your entire midsection when wearing a form-fitting sexy outfit.;
, Look for tops that fit closely but skim the body without actually hugging the skin for the best long, sexy lines for your torso.


Try a plunging neckline to accentuate your chest, or a low back to show off some more subtle skin. Well-fitting, body-skimming fit will keep bared skin from looking overexposed or uncomfortably revealing.
Try an off-the-shoulder top or dress for an easy way to bare some skin and show off your shoulders and neck., Try tops and dresses that have structure or built-in padding and support for the chest to lend support as well as flatter a fuller chest.


Look for structure in the bust particularly when the garment is difficult to wear with a bra and can replace one.
Pay attention to the neckline shape as well. Choose a V shape or sweetheart neckline to elongate the body and show off cleavage, or opt for less cleavage but a beautiful frame for your neck and collarbones with a square neckline., Wear tops and dresses without sleeves, or opt for sleeves that are sheer as a way to both add some sex appeal and still be a little more covered up if you’d like to be.


Look for sleeves with lace detail, cutouts, or sheer sections for extra sexiness on the arms.
Opt for sleeves in a kimono or dolman style, or another similar style that floats away from the arm for an elegant and flattering look.Avoid regular t-shirt length short sleeves, which visually cut the arms off at their widest point. Opt for three-quarter length, sleeveless, or a shorter sleeve that lands at a diagonal angle on your arm.

Create some extra visual weight on the top half of your body to balance out the over all look.,
Take care not to undo the look.,
Wear shirts or dresses with capped shoulders.,
Prefer flared dresses.,
Let jackets fall below your hips.",How to Pick an Outfit for a Pear Shape1," Some great examples of this would be big hair, big hats, big necklaces, big bust or a stylish jacket.


Horizontal stripes or ruffles on top can work well. However, if you have a large bust, avoid the ruffles.






Avoid wearing shapeless tops.





;
, While you want to add volume up top, be careful not to draw attention to the thighs or waist this is easily done by wearing hip hugging jeans, pants or fitted skirts.

, Frills or sequins on the shoulders will also give the appearance of broader shoulders to balance out your curvy bottom.

, These will flow beautifully around your lower body and give you plenty of shape around the middle and top of your body.


Sleeveless dresses will draw the eye to your upper body.







, If they are shorter than this, they tend to accentuate the pear shape effect.


Avoid wearing a jacket that has a pattern that cuts off at the base. This draws the eye right to the place where the jacket ends.

Go for cinched waistlines.,
Look for curvy fit or stretch denim to flatter the waist.,
Try solid colors or smaller patterns.,
Favor thick fabric and use embellishment strategically.",How to Dress Sexy (for Larger Women)2," Look for tops, skirts, and dresses that nip in at the waist to accentuate your naturally sexy hourglass shape.


The cinched or narrower section of a garment should hit at your natural waist, which is the smallest part of your midsection, between your ribcage and belly button.Try peplum or wrap style shirts and dresses, which show off the narrowest part of your midsection while flaring away from the stomach below. A wrap dress makes for an attractive everyday look, while peplums easily create a sexy evening look; both can be dressed up or down.
Try skirts, shorts, and pants that are intended to be high-waisted, hitting anywhere from the bellybutton up to the natural waist, which accentuates the waist but also creates some support for the lower abdomen if you want it.

, Buy pants and jeans that accommodate a larger waist and hip section by looking out for curvy fits, or material with enough stretch to create both comfort and a sexy body-hugging look for the waist, hips, and backside.


Make sure that the waist on any pair of pants fits comfortably when standing and sitting. Remember that the waist can stretch with wear, but should fit when just washed as well.
Try jeggings or other popular pant styles that feature an elastic waistband for optimal comfort and extra curve-hugging. A wide stretch waistband fits more comfortably than a smaller one that may dig into the waist or lower stomach.
Opt for a mid-rise or high-rise fit to slim the lower abdomen for a sleek look., Opt for solid colors in dark or jewel tones for a sleek evening look that flatters your waist and hips. Keep patterns subtle and smaller in scale for a chic and sexy style.


In general, lighter colors will visually highlight and darker colors will reduce, so choose color for your top to draw attention to your midsection, or dark neutrals to downplay it.
Try patterns with geometric shapes that point downward, like vertical stripes or chevrons, for an elongating effect for the middle of the body. You can still use more horizontal or larger patterns for any areas you want to accentuate.

, Wear tops made with fabric thick enough that it won’t cling to your body where you don’t want it to. Make sure ruffles, beading, or other embellishments that can be sexy are placed on areas you want to highlight rather than downplay.


Embellishments that add volume to a garment should hit only at areas of your body you want to accentuate or widen. However, features like a belt or ruching can help narrow an area like the waist if you want to define that sexy hourglass shape.If you choose thinner fabric for garments around your midsection, look for items that drape, fold, or gather to avoid uncomfortable or unflattering clinging.
Wear a tank top or control undergarment underneath a top that is too thin to provide a smooth base."
"
Choose bootcut or slim cut pants.,
Choose skirt hemlines at or above the knee.,
Wear tights to lengthen the legs.,
Try a slit in a skirt or dress.,
Try heels to amp up the sexiness.",How to Dress Sexy (for Larger Women)3," Go for jeans or pants in a straight cut for universally flattering length, whether you opt for a sexy form-fitting skinny style or a bootcut that floats straight away from the legs to the floor.


Choose a dark wash on jeans when you want to slim any area of your legs or hips. Alternatively, you may want to add lighter wash or bright color to accentuate the legs and lend balance to a larger torso.
Avoid fading and whiskering on denim, or too many embellishments on pockets and seams, in areas you do not want to widen., Find skirts and dresses that fall just above the knee for the most universally flattering look for the legs.Also try out a high-low hemline, which is shorter in the front and longer in the back, to get some more coverage while still showing off your legs for an alluring look.
Look out for skirts and dresses that feature pleating or lines that fall vertically from the waist to make the lower body look longer.

, Try tights as a way to show off your legs while not actually showing bare skin if it makes you uncomfortable to do so, as well as provide sexy length to the leg.


Choose tights in a similar hue as your skirt, dress, or shoes to help create the illusion of extra length in the legs.
Try out tights with classic sex appeal like fishnets, lace, or thigh-highs.
Choose control-top hosiery for additional support for your midsection if you wish.

, Go for a slit detail up one side or leg of a long skirt or dress, which helps elongate the leg while providing a sultry detail to an otherwise more covered look.


If you’re not ready to bare skin with a slit, try looking for vertical seams on the front of pants or skirts, which has a similar flattering effect.Wear heels to further lengthen the leg you show off with a slit.

, Accentuate the length and beautiful muscles of your legs by choosing a sexy heel that matches your outfit or accessories.


Opt for a pump with a pointed toe for an elongating shape; even a flat with this toe will achieve this effect.
Nude color (approximately matching your skin tone) on heels will visually create even more leg length when worn with bare legs or nude hosiery."
"
Choose trousers which are cut with plenty of room around the thighs.,
Choose skirts and pants that elongate your body.,
Sidestep capri pants.,
Choose wide-legged jeans.",How to Pick an Outfit for a Pear Shape2," Choose well tailored trousers for the best effect.


Darker tones work well with such dresses.






Avoid stiff fabric around the bottom zone.







, Choose straight lines for the best effect; A-line skirts are ideal.


Again, darker tones are best.






Avoid anything that clings to the hips, such as pencil skirts.







, Capri pants will accentuate the pear shape and can even increase the sense of size around your bottom zone.

, Always wear good quality jeans.

"
"
Wear heels.,
Choose boots that cut off just under the knee.,
If wearing flats, choose rounded ones.",How to Pick an Outfit for a Pear Shape3," Almost any height of heels will help to give a sense of more elongation. However, do not wear really high heels.


Peep-toe shoes are a good choice.







, Avoid wearing any low-cut boots as these give the impression of chunkiness.

, Pointed flats will accentuate the pear shape; on the other hand, pointed high heels are fine.

"
"
Choose maternity clothing that fits comfortably.,
Use the same principles outlined above.",How to Pick an Outfit for a Pear Shape4," That is the number one driver, as you don't want to feel constricted or overheated. Most maternity clothing will fit the pear shape just beautifully, so enjoy the shopping.

, Just ensure that the fabric has plenty of stretch without being saggy. Darker colors may be overwhelming during pregnancy, so feel free to lighten up the colors to befit your mood.

Define business casual.,

Purchase a pair of cotton pants.,
Go for a pant suit in a neutral shade.,
Use stripes wisely.,
Keep a classic sheath dress in your closet.,
Support your look with high-quality undergarments.,

Shop at stores which have several options for plus size women.,
Try the items on in the store.,
Choose clothes which are a good fit for you.,
Take your measurements.,
Hire a tailor to adjust the fit.,
Dress for your shape.",How to Dress Business Casual for the Plus Size Woman," The very first question for many people is, “What is business casual?” It seems like a contradiction and definitions can vary greatly from one person to another. One thing is sure, business casual is not suits and jackets. On the other hand, it’s not jeans and flip flops, but somewhere in between.The best way to define your specific company’s interpretation of business casual is to look around at your co-workers. If you’re new to the job, visit similar offices or ask around for advice from people in a similar field.
Part of the concept of business casual gets rid of the stuffy dress code and allows for more self-expression in your outfit. This will allow you more room to have fun and dress comfortably.
Business casual is more popular in part to busy lifestyles, which don’t allow time for people to go home before their evening plans. The business casual attire should be able to transform easily from the office to your after work hours.;
, Button-down shirts can be tricky for busty women who have trouble with gaps or “peep-holes” being created between the buttons. Choose a material which stretches to allow for movement without gaps. Some flattering styles will be cut to create more shape with features like darts or ruching.Layer a cardigan over a fitted button up to create a slimming effect by elongating the line of your midsection.

, For most offices, business casual still does not include jeans, except maybe on Fridays. On the other hand, you don’t need to wear slacks and pencil skirts every day. Stock up on some cotton pants. Khakis always work, but if you want to let your style shine, you can try some patterns. Make sure the pattern is proportional. Small patterns can be lost on large women.Choose material which is thicker and has more substance. The thicker material will show less bumps than a flimsy slack.These should be comfortable and wrinkle free.
Avoid pants which are too tight and are more suitable as leggings. You want your clothes to lie gently on your curves., Pant suits are flexible and allow you to slip a jacket on to transition from casual to an important meeting. Choose a neutral shade like black, beige, navy, or gray, and pair them with colorful blouses or sweaters., You probably have heard that large horizontal stripes should be avoided, but there are ways to use stripes to your advantage. Stripes which angle inward can create the illusion of shape and a smaller waistline. Thinner stripes are better stripes, and light colored stripes on a dark background are ideal., It is easiest to go for the little black dress which can be dressed up or down according to your need. One solid color, like black, can have a slimming effect by creating a straight line from head to toe. You can still add your own flavor with some colorful jewelry, a scarf or a cardigan., Your bra and underwear can have an effect on your look and comfort while at work. Consider going to a store which specializes in undergarments. Bring your measurements or have them measure you there to get the perfect fit.Spend the extra money here on quality. The support will be worth it.
Choose undergarments with smooth finishes to allow your clothing to lie smoothly on top.

, Open toe shoes are acceptable for the business casual style, but avoid sandals. Make sure your shoes are comfortable and leave enough room for your feet to breath.Choose flats or short heels.
Black shoes will match most of your outfits. Considered a nude shade too, these will go with anything.

, A nice long necklace can elongate your features from your neck to your chest. Choose a necklace which drapes in straight lines before curving., Avoid any cuffs which are too tight and pinch the skin around your wrist. If you have a chain necklace which is a little too short, you may be able to wrap it around your wrist a couple of times to make a rope bracelet., Avoid a ring for every finger and choose just one which has a little class and style. Go for a ring which has a more neutral color and can be work with several outfits.You can find rings which come in adjustable sizes at plus-size stores.

, Avoid a belt which is too thin. Try a nice wide belt, or a wrap-around belt for a little flare. Wear the belt over dresses, shirts, or even jackets., It can be frustrating to find only a small section of a store with a couple of items to choose from in your size. For more options and access to trends, check out some of the stores, in person or online, which cater to plus-size women.Fashion to Figure is an online store offering some of the trendiest items available to woman sizes 1X-3X.
Torrid not only provides clothing options, but you can find some heels and ankle boots in wide widths.
If you want to walk into a store and browse the racks, Lane Bryant caters to plus-sized professional women.
Have a dress made specifically to fit your body online at eShakti. Choose any dress style on the site, then add your measurements. They will tailor the dress accordingly before they ship it to you.

, It can seem like a pain to try everything on before you purchase it, but don’t write something off before you try it on. It may turn out to fit much better than you anticipated.On the other hand, it could fit much worse and the time you spent trying it on would have been much less time than it takes to return the item to the store.
Ask the store clerk for assistance with sizes. They can also make a good outside eye for a second opinion on the fit.

, If an item is too tight in one spot, opt for a slightly larger size. You can always have the item tailored for a better fit. Clothes which fit well are more flattering and professional than ill-fitting clothing.If you are wearing an item of clothing which is slightly large, match it with a more form-fitting item. You don’t want the whole outfit to look baggy., Use a flexible measuring tape like one found in a sewing kit. Measure your thighs, hips, waist and chest. These measurements will be extremely helpful when shopping online or from catalogues. Compare your measurements to the size charts listed by the seller.Take all of your measurements at the widest part of that section of the body.
Don’t pull the measuring tape too tightly around your body. The measuring tape should not cause your skin to cinch, but should be gently touching your body all the way around.
Don’t have any items of clothing in the way when you are taking your measurements.
Write your measurements on a piece of paper and keep it handy.

, It is difficult for anyone to find the perfect fit. All bodies are different. A tailor can adjust the size and shape of an item of clothing for the best fit to your particular body.If you are between sizes, choose the item which is slightly too big to give your tailor room to work.

, Plus size women still come in a variety of shapes. People carry their weight in different parts of their bodies. It is helpful to know your shape and how to accentuate your best features.Apple shaped women are wider in the middle with thinner legs. They look great in shorter sheath dresses which create a straight line from the top to the thighs, and allow the attention to go to their great legs. Just keep the length past your fingertips for work.
Pear-shaped women carry their weight in their hips. Jeans can be a tough fit here. Try a boxy top to even out your look, or embrace the shape with an a-line dress.
Hourglass refers to large hips and bust with a smaller waist. Try a retro-style fit and flare look to fit your curves.

Be healthy.",How to Be a Fat Girl," Do not hang out with people who make you feel bad about yourself. They are not good friends. Instead, form alliances with healthy, happy people who make you feel healthy and happy as well. Find a good partner who loves you the way you are; don't lower yourself or settle because you think your options are limited.They're not.


If your family frequently rips on you because of your weight, tell them in no uncertain terms that your body is none of their business and that you will not discuss your weight with them.;
, In the past, women weren't supposed to be a size 0. Hips were for baby-makin', and that was a very good thing! It was trendy to be a bit bigger. So when you're bombarded by models and whatnot, realize that it's a trend. It's just what society wants right now. Not what is good or what is bad. Society has no idea what's good, bad, right, or wrong!


If weight-loss commercials or magazines leave you feeling deflated, don't watch them or buy them. Until you're strong enough to be able to take the daily messages that tell you fat is bad without believing them or even without paying attention to them, try to eliminate them from your life. Grab that renaissance magazine and go to town!

, Don't be that girl. Don't be the girl that quite clearly hates her body and makes fun of others because of it. Don't be the girl that's been ridiculed for being overweight and as a result is mean herself (even if it is defensive). The world's gonna be rough, yeah, but that's not an excuse. You're still beautiful and the world is still awesome -- what do you have to be hating' on?


Kill 'em with kindness, you know? Practically smack them upside the head with it. When someone is hating on you, giving you a hard time, not only should you not give them a hard time back, you should not give them the time at all. They aren't worth it. Don't let them rain on your parade.

, Since you won't be tolerating others talking smack about your body, you definitely can't talk smack about it. That just breeds negative feelings and propagates the problem. You don't need that. Even if it feels right, even if it feels socially acceptable (self-deprecating humor is oddly trendy), don't do it. There's no point.


While we're on the topic, don't talk smack about others' bodies either. Whether they're too fat or too thin. Saying, ""Girl, you need to eat a cheeseburger!"" is basically the same as that girl saying to you that you need to skip a cheeseburger. It may not seem like it, and, true, society is on her side, but she probably still has issues. Most women (read: people) do!

, Don't not go out and play basketball. Don't not hit on that sexy guy in your history class. Don't limit yourself in the world because you feel you take up too much of it. Don't be afraid to take risks, thinking your fat is holding you back. It's your body and only you know exactly how to work it. What's there to be afraid of, anyway?


If you feel awkward in your clothes, people will pick up on that. If you don't feel awkward in your clothes, people will pick up on that! If you're afraid of what other people will think, know that you're a great determiner in that!

, ""Fat"" is a word that has a negative connotation, and it shouldn't! It should be a descriptive term, like ""blonde,"" ""cute,"" ""short,"" et cetera. By claiming it and wielding it as such, you'll disarm people who use the word as an insult. Try not to use euphemisms like 'overweight', which imply that there's something wrong with being fat.


That being said, not everyone feels this way. Even if you have good intentions, even if you think of fat as a good thing, people don't necessarily know that. Calling someone else fat may to you be a term of solidarity or even endearment, but to them you're pointing out a very sensitive flaw of theirs. Be careful.

, Even though this one is pretty obvious, it has to be said and it has to come first. Without loving your body, you're gonna be a pretty second-rate fat girl. Once you realize it's the only one you'll ever, ever, have, the positive thoughts start falling into place. This thing that responds to your thoughts is all yours -- no one else's -- and it is good.


The goal is to be able to look in the mirror and think that you're beautiful without wanting to change. Do whatever you have to achieve that goal; everyone has their own method of learning to love themselves.

, If you want to identify as a fat girl, cool. If you don't, cool. You're a ton of other things you don't identify as, right? Do you constantly think about how you're a female? Probably not. Do you think about your nationality? Your religion? Whether you're tall or short? Blonde, brunette, or redhead? Nope. This ""fat"" thing, this fat label, only has to be yours if you want it. Even if you fit it, doesn't mean you have to see yourself as it.


The nuance in meaning here is that while, yes, you are a fat girl, you're also a thousand other things. It's a non-issue if you want it to be. Heck, you're also a one-nosed girl, right? A ten-fingered one too? Do those things matter? Exactly. Neither does your weight.

, Once you're the girl who's okay with being overweight (instead of the one that's all sad about being fat, like people expect), people are gonna feel like they have to say something. Don't ask why; they just do. So they will. What are you going to say?


Think of a few possible situations. ""You know it's not healthy, right?"" or ""But you'd look so much prettier if you were thinner,"" or ""Boys like skinny girls,"" might be three of the many things you'll hear. If you're like the rest of us, you'll want to shut the book on the issue as soon as you can -- this crap gets old fast. Something like, ""I'm in a good place right now. My weight isn't something you need concern yourself with,"" will tersely show them that the case is closed.

, You know that one friend of yours who can only talk about women's rights? The other friend who can only carry conversations about football? The one who has something negative to say about anything that isn't hipster enough? All these people have one thing that's dominated their personalities which, more often than not, isn't a good thing. So in addition to being a fat girl, be something else. Be so much more. Be a good person, too!


There are no two ways around it: society sees being fat as a bad thing. Therefore, fat people (women even more so) are often viewed negatively. For starters, this is crap, so show them that. Be the most awesome person ever. Be kind. Be funny. Prove to the world that being a fat girl is just one of your many fantastic characteristics.

, You're gonna have days where you look in the mirror and you think, ""Weh-he-hell, look who's still got it!"" And then there will be days where you look in the mirror and realize you would sacrifice your cat to just take back the last six times you know you ate too much cheesecake. Newsflash: this happens to everyone. Whether you're 100 pounds sopping wet or 300 pounds dry as a bone, this happens. We all have to deal with it.


So when you have one of those cat-sacrificing days, the important thing to realize is that it'll pass. It may take 30 minutes, it may take 3 days, it may take a week or two, but it'll pass. That's what emotions do. Nothing you've felt has ever lasted your entire life, you know?

, Seriously. Everything. Why is cellulite bad? Think about it. It could be cute if society said it were. Why is the double-wave arm-flab look embarrassing? It's not. What is the best moral system? What are numbers, anyway? Okay, those last two are a bit off-topic, but you get it.


Everything we think has been taught to us. Someone a long, long time ago said it or published it or sang it in song and all of a sudden now it's a thing. However, that person's view on society is just that: that person's view. So when someone tells you fat is bad (or even fat is good), question it. Make your own opinions.

, There was civil rights for blacks, women, gays, and shortly there will be civil rights for fat people. Sort of seriously, we're talking now. Have you heard of the Fat Acceptance movement?Or Health at Every Size?The latter is its own community! So get to studying. There's an entire world out there that wants to identify with you.


Along with movements and organizations, read blogs. Connect with others that are going through the same thing. Read books on being fat and fit. Educate yourself so the next time you run into that young girl who's struggling with her body image, you can help her. If this wasn't worth it before, it will be worth it for that.
Scratch the surface of any article promoting weight loss and you'll almost always find that it was backed in some way by a corporation that makes money by claiming to help people lose weight. It's important to see past the bias in news articles in order to get to the truth of fat and weight loss. Websites like The F Word, junk food Science and Shapely Prose are good places to go to find articles and medical studies that focus on fat.

, Seriously. Touch it. If it's in the way, move it. Stare at it in the mirror. Look at it. Look at it until it becomes completely unremarkable. Know how it wiggles. Know it rests. Know when it becomes cumbersome and when it doesn't. Know which parts you like more than others. Accept it.


In addition to all this, wash it well. And more importantly? Dry it. Fat people get called smelly because of the ones that shower and don't dry off, leaving odoriferous marshes behind in their rolls. Not pleasant. Don't fuel the stigma!

, Doctors who are unable to see past your weight are to be discarded immediately. If your doctor prescribes weight loss without really investigating your complaint, if they brings your weight up without being invited to do so, or if they deny you help/treatment until you lose ""X"" amount of weight, find someone else who will treat you with respect. You may also decline to have yourself weighed; that is totally your choice, because it's your body. There's more than one doctor out there, so find one that fits for you!


Be straight with your doctor. It's a very, very touchy topic and doctors are aware of it. You know you're fat. You can say it. Talk to him/her about how you want to handle it. If he/she is any good, they'll respect you.

, As you probably know, certain positions are going to be easier than others. This is also true for tall people, short people, people who aren't super flexible, etc. So don't limit yourself! Don't not get on top because you're self-conscious. Don't think you'll break him. You won't. Just trust.


That being said, do get a good mattress. You want one that's firm and springy; not one you sink into. And when it comes to lube, it can be your best friend.

, There's not really a point. If you try to position yourself in such a way that you look skinnier or cover yourself up in baggy clothes or refuse to have sex in the light, it's time to give it up. You know. Your boyfriend knows. Everyone knows. You know what everyone else looks like, so there's no use trying to cling to the facade that it can be hidden. It can't. And guess what? That's fine.


This is you. You're gonna have to get used to it sooner or later, so it might as well be sooner. Of course certain clothes will be more flattering (more on that in a bit), but when you're out of those clothes, there's no use shying away from the spotlight. Soak it up!

, Unfortunately, lots of us fat girls have insecurity issues. It makes sense since society is pretty condescending 24/7. If the world (read: men) hasn't been that great, it's gonna be practically impossible not to succumb to attention when you get it. But not all attention is good attention -- just because someone is paying you some doesn't mean you need to entertain them.


In other words, when that guy comes up to you at the bar and asks you to go home with him, you don't have to. Some guys look at a fat girl and think she's easy because she's desperate for sexual validation. Ha. Send those guys home with themselves.

, Alright, so as much as you can't hide the fat, you can still be pretty and beautiful and have a great sense of style. Find local options for buying clothes in your size or look on the Internet for more choices. Load yourself down with accessories that make you feel good. Whatever your style, do everything in your power to rock it.


Even if you're not concerned with your appearance, keep clean and well-groomed - keep your finger and toenails neatly maintained and buffed to a shine, even if you don't polish them.
Get regular haircuts and keep a style that flatters you, and do any hair removal or odor control that you deem necessary. You'll feel better about yourself, which is really the very most important thing.

, Virtually all of the health risks associated with being fat are actually tied to poor diet and exercise (and as we know, it's possible to be a skinny couch potato as well as a fat Olympic athlete). Adipose tissue (fat) on the body is not a health risk on its own. Fatty arteries and other internal organs are, but that's why you're going to exercise and eat right: to prevent fatty buildup in those important organs and arteries, to promote a strong immune system and to help your body heal itself if it does get injured or sick.


Weight loss is not necessary to be healthy (except in the most extreme cases), and attention to exercise and food intake should be entirely for your health and never for the purpose of shrinking.

, The right watch or earrings can really make an outfit stand out and a properly placed accessory can take attention away from problem areas.

Don't wear pants with no pockets at all unless you got super low belt loops and a belt on. Wearing skirts that have flare or a lot of ruffles around hips works great but just make sure their ruffles are not too low or it will give you big thighs and no hips.

Highlight your waist.,
Try out High Heels.,
Highlight your best assets.,
Flaunt them.",How to Be a Beautiful Curvy Woman,"


If you've got a waist, make the most of it: it gives hourglass figures balance and makes you the envy of all those women with no shape!
If you have no waist, go for a large jacket with a belt to give the illusion of one - it's very flattering.;
,


""For every centimeter of heel you lose a kilo in weight,"" according to Marina Rinaldi. Heels make you taller, longer and leaner, but they can tire you out quickly, so go for boots during the day and save your stilettos for the evening if you struggle with foot ache. A good advice: High heels and a suit with a belted jacket can make anyone look instantly slimmer.

,


Follow your curves. Jennifer Lopez has a classic curvaceous figure and knows how to work it, but remember: no two curvy girls are the same.
If you have a toned, peachy derriere like Jen, go for a dress that will cling in all the right places to show them off.
If you have real authentic 1950s curves, nip your waist in to show them off.
If you're tall, put your legs on display in shorts. The golden rule is never to hide your curves but to dress them up subtly.

,


All the stick insects within a 3-mile radius are jealous of your jugs and men just can't help but stare. So make the most of your assets without going weird - you wouldn't want to make anyone else feel inadequate, naturally... Go for dresses with plunging necklines, open blouses, trench-style coats and jackets to show off your decollete.

Often, dying it a shade or two darker or lighter can make a much more striking appearance than ""mousy"" hair color. If your natural hair color is boring, consider finding out about your color type and dying it a more flattering shade.

Pick out a cardigan sweater.
Pick out a little black dress. A good little black dress can be dressed up for semi-formal occasions or dressed down for a night on the town. For best results, look for a dress in a classic cut.
Have at least one pair of flattering jeans. Look for a timeless dark-wash denim and a classic style, such as boot cut or straight leg.
Also own a pair of flattering khaki pants. For some occasions, jeans are too casual and dress slacks are too dressy. Khaki pants are good for bridging that gap.
Purchase a fitted coat suitable for spring and fall weather. Think trench coats and pea coats.
Own a heavier fitted coat capable of keeping you warm in the winter.;
,


Keep a few casual sundresses handy for warm spring and summer weather.
Purchase capri pants for the warmer weather. Choose a length and cut—loose or fitted—that flatters your legs.
Consider purchasing a fitted pea coat for autumn and winter.
Look for a few heavy sweaters for the winter. Turtlenecks are considered classic, but many other styles also work well.

, Think black, gray, tan, dark brown, white, and cream. Neutral colors are the most versatile.

,


Think primary and secondary colors. A few brights and variations will not hurt, but try to stick with colors that are always considered acceptable. Avoid colors that are only ""in"" for the season.
Look for colors that coordinate well with your skin tone.
Consider a blouse or dress with a small polka dot print.
Search for pinstripe pants or shirts.
Try on a subdued floral pattern.

Start with building a basic, casual wardrobe.,
Once you have a casual wardrobe established, you may move onto the semi-formal and formal wardrobe.",How to Build a Basic Wardrobe (Men)," You will need: (at least)


Underwear (boxers, fitted boxers or briefs, your choice) and under shirts (muscle or t shirt). Make sure to purchase quality items that won't fade, stretch, or wear out.
Three Pairs of Jeans, dark blue and light blue. Other colors like black, white and tan can fade in and out of style, but blue is classic. Also make sure to avoid pre-torn or destroyed jeans. Try buying jeans with a light distress or faded wash on the knee or thigh areas, but be careful.
Two Pairs of Khakis. Make sure one is a more traditional color, such as British Khaki. The other can be a bit different, like grey, navy or Nantucket Red. There are many different kinds of cuts: straight leg, classic (more tapered) boot cut and loose. Try them all and find the fit and style you like.
Three Casual Oxford Shirts: Make sure to have 2 solid colors (blue and white are both classic) and one striped oxford shirt.
Four Polo Shirts. Stick to the classic colors: Navy, White, Black, Grey, Red, Yellow, Green. You can add more exotic colors later.
Two Solid V-Neck Sweaters. These should be neutral colors (Navy, Tan, Black, Grey, White).
One Casual Blazer. It can be two or three button, but two button jackets are more casual. Stick to solid colors; navy blue is best. Avoid patterns for now.
One brown and one black belt.
Brown loafers or Docksiders. Sperry Top-Siders are your best bet.
Sneakers. Avoid very athletic looking sneakers or running shoes unless you are in a gym. Stick to simple casual sneakers. An example would be solid color canvas sneakers or simple leather sneakers.
One or two bags in your wardrobe. Look for black and brown bags to start out. Olive colors can be incorporated as well. Messengers, totes, briefcases, and holdalls are always in so don't be afraid.;
, You will need:


At least one good dress shirt. If you are starting a new job that requires dress shirts, then you will want to get five: two white, two blue, one French blue.
One good pair of dress pants, 100% wool. Stick to Khaki, Charcoal or Navy.
A more formal navy blazer or sport coat.
Ties. These can really carry your wardrobe a long way; different ties can make the same suit look new. A good tie should be solid and versatile, 100% silk. There are so many ties to choose from, but in a formal setting, stick to solid color ties, simple striped ties, or subtle patterned ties. Avoid very seasonal ties, they are only good for a short amount of time.
One good suit, either navy or charcoal, 100% year round wool, single breasted, 2 or 3 button
Black Shoes and Belt
Trench Coat or Overcoat, Khaki or charcoal.
Black Tie attire (optional), Tuxedo with bow tie, cummerbund, and white shirt.

Make a list of how many clothes they need.,
Sort through all of their clothing.,
Keep plenty of underwear and socks.,
Let your child pick out which clothes they like.,
Choose items that you can mix and match.",How to Create a Minimalist Wardrobe for Your Kids1," Before you begin, try to identify what types of clothing your child needs as well as how many of each they require. Factor in how often you do laundry to help you decide how many items of clothing you can get away with.For example, you may decide that they need seven casual shirts, three pairs of pants, one dressy outfit, two hoodies, a coat, a pair of sneakers, and two pairs of pajamas.The age of your child may also influence this decision. A baby may only need three or four different onesies whereas a teenager may want a few more outfits.
Don’t forget to factor in both winter and summer outfits. You may need seven different shirts for summer than you do for winter. If you live in a rainy area, you might want a raincoat and boots.
If your child plays sports, they might need a uniform, proper footwear, helmets, or other gear.;
, Go through their entire existing wardrobe to see what you currently own. Make piles for clothes that you want to keep, clothes that you want to donate, and clothes that you are throwing out.Donate any clothing that no longer fits your child. Places like Goodwill and Salvation Army accept donations of clothing. Local churches, thrift stores, or children’s shelters may also want them.
If the clothing is torn or stained, throw it out. This includes old underwear.
If you’re not certain whether or not you want to keep something, put it in the maybe pile. Once you know what you are definitely getting rid of and what you are keeping, you can sort through the maybe pile.

, Underwear and socks cannot be re-worn like other items of clothing, so you will want to make sure that you have a good supply of them just in case. You may want to keep a little more than one week’s supply of each. Between ten and fourteen days’ worth may be sufficient.

, It is important that your child has some say in what they will and will not keep. Do not throw away any articles of clothing that your child loves to wear or that they wear repeatedly. You may also want to ask their opinion on certain items.If you have a maybe pile going, ask your child to pick one or two outfits from it that they want to keep.
If your child is having difficulty expressing an opinion, ask them how each piece of clothing makes them feel. Do they like how it looks? Is it comfortable?, Since your child’s wardrobe will be much smaller, you want to make sure that you choose items that can be matched and paired into as many different outfits as possible. This means keeping at least a few neutral items, such as blue jeans, khakis, and white shirts. While you can still have colorful or patterned items, it will be easier to use them in a variety of different ways.For example, if your child has a striped yellow and red shirt, they can wear it with khakis or jeans, with a sweater or no sweater, with a long-sleeved shirt underneath it, or under a pullover sweater.
If you’re having difficulty picking multifunctional items of clothing, you may want to choose three or four different colors for the entire wardrobe, and lose anything that does not work with these colors."

Choose a space that is easily accessible to children.,
Install shelves in the closet.,
Hang storage behind the door.,
Put a laundry basket in their room.",How to Create a Minimalist Wardrobe for Your Kids2," To help keep things tidy, you should teach your children at a young age how to put their clothing away. While a young child may not understand this right away, you can help them by putting their clothing in a place that is easy for your child to reach and handle.Some ways to keep the space accessible include:


Installing a low bar for hanging clothing
Putting in child-height shelves
Using soft-sided bins
Hanging clothing on child-sized hangers

, If you want to keep a minimalist design in the children’s bedroom, hiding shelves and drawers in the closet is a great way to go. When the door is closed, the clothing is hidden out of sight. You can do this by adding cubbies or shelves in the closet.


Cubbies with pull-out bins are easy for children to handle. You can store folded clothing inside of these. You even can buy modular cubbies. Modular cubbies are ones that you put together yourself. You only have to buy exactly how many cubes you need or have space for., The back of the closet door can be used for hanging storage. This makes the room look tidy when closed, but it provides a great way for individual storage for things like socks, underwear, scarves, belts, jewelry, and shoes.You can hang a string on the back of the door as a DYI clothesline. Hammer two nails directly across from one another on the back of the door, leaving a centimeter of space between the head of the nail and the door. Tie the string to the nails. You can tuck scarves and belts over the string.
Command hooks can be attached to the back of a door for jewelry, scarves, belts, or bags.
Soft hanging boxes can be used for shoes, underwear, socks, or accessories.

, To avoid clutter in their bedroom, make sure that your child knows where to put their clothing when it is dirty. Put a small laundry bin in their room. This can be in a corner, by the bed, or in the closet. Teach them to always put dirty clothing in the bin when they are done wearing it. This will prevent clothing from messing up their room.


Teach your children by showing them where the basket is. If they are young, hand them the dirty clothing and say, ""Put it in the basket."" Let them do it themselves to learn the habit.

"
"
Maintain a strict laundry schedule.,
Buy higher quality clothing that will last.,
Reduce the amount of clothing you buy.,
Teach your child to put away their own clothing.,
Teach children to accessorize instead of buying clothing.",How to Create a Minimalist Wardrobe for Your Kids3," Since your child will have fewer items of clothing to run through, you will need to wash their clothing more often, especially if they are prone to dirtying their clothes. Choose a day or two a week to do your laundry, and enforce this schedule so that you never run out of clothing.

, While cheap or used clothing can be convenient and cost-effective, they may not last very long, causing you to have to buy even more clothing for your child. Instead, invest in a few solid pieces that will last for a while.Sturdy pants, like jeans or khakis, are important.
If you live in a cool area, you may want to invest in a good winter coat and boots.
If you have multiple children, these nice items of clothing can be passed down from one to another.

, Try to resist buying more clothing for your children unless they absolutely need it. This means that you only buy new clothing when they have outgrown the old.


If your child needs new clothing and a holiday or birthday is coming up, you can ask for clothing as gifts. Send your friends and relatives a list of clothing that your children need along with their sizes., Even with a small wardrobe, children’s clothing can still clutter up a room if they are dumped on the ground or tossed around. Teach your child that their clothing has a “home” to encourage them to put it away in the right place. If the clothing is dirty, it goes into the laundry basket. If the clothing is clean, it goes “home” into the closet or drawers.You can create a simple statement like, ""Dirty clothing goes in the basket; clean clothing goes on the shelf.""
Reinforce this lesson when your child is cleaning their room by asking questions. You can say, ""Where is the home for clean clothing?"" and wait for them to answer.

, Older kids, especially tweens, may want to buy more clothing as they begin to develop their own unique style. Instead, encourage them to use accessories to make an outfit unique. Since children may go through many fashion phases, this will prevent unwanted clothing from building up.Some good accessories include:


Belts
Scarves
Hats
Jewelry
Gloves
Socks

Repeat colors.,
Pick a big print and a small print.,
Follow the 60-30-10 rule.,
Use a solid to break up prints.,
Mix two similar prints.,
Mix bold patterns with low-contrast patterns.",How to Mix Prints1," The most essential thing to remember when you're mixing prints is that the prints should have at least one color in common. Repeating colors is the way to help prints complement each other instead of clashing. Colors can pull two completely different prints together and make them look like they were made for each other!


One way to repeat print colors is to choose two prints with the same dominant color. For example, you might have a lime green-striped skirt and a paisley with a lime-green background.
For a slightly bolder look, choose a less dominant color from one print and match that color with your second print. For example, if you have an ikat print with a touch of rose, pair it with a rose-colored plaid.
The colors don't have to match exactly, but they should be close enough that it's clear they are meant to go together.;
, If you have too many prints in the same size, your outfit or home décor could end up looking busy. Think of prints in terms of their size, and choose a big size and a smaller size to go together. Having prints in a range of sizes creates visual harmony instead of headaches.


For example, if you have a skirt with a large floral pattern, try pairing it with a thin-striped top.
If your couch has a big plaid pattern, use throw pillows with a smaller print., If you're mixing three different prints, aim to have the largest print take up 60 percent of the look, choose a medium print to comprise 30 percent of the look, and have the smallest print make up the last 10 percent as an accent. This balances the overall appearance of the prints and keeps them from being too overwhelming.


For example, you might wear a maxi skirt with a large floral pattern, a mid-top with a medium stripe print, and statement necklace with a small colorful print.
In your home, try pairing wallpaper with a big, bold print with a chair or sofa with medium print and accent pillows or lamp shades with the smallest print.

, Sometimes two prints that would otherwise clash need something solid to break them up. Choose a solid color that matches both prints and feature it prominently in between the prints, rather than having the prints layered on top of one another. This gives the eye a chance to rest instead of jumping back and forth between busy prints.

, Prints that are similar in scale but come in slightly different colors can layer beautifully. This is a great way to mix prints if you're after a more conservative, monochrome look that works as well in the office as it does on a weekend.For example, if you have a peach and white polka dotted top, trying pairing it with a black and white polka dotted skirt.
At home, try working with 2 - 3 different plaid prints in one room.

, Another great way to incorporate a variety of prints is to choose one that's bold and another that's low-contrast, such as a neutral-toned ikat print. This allows you to create an interesting, finished look without too many overwhelming colors or prints.

Consider stripes a neutral.,
Mix polka dots with plaid or stripes.,
Mix two kinds of animal prints.,
Mix black and white prints.,
Use accessories to ease into print mixing.",How to Mix Prints2," Stripes are so easy to mix with other prints that they may as well be considered a neutral, like denim or black. When you're at a loss as to how to mix a complicated print with another one, just pick your favorite color from the print and find a striped version of that color to add as a second layer. Believe it or not, stripes match everything from paisley to ikat to polka dots, so when in doubt, let them be your fallback.

, Round polka dots offset the straight lines in plaids and stripes, adding interest to any outfit or room. Choose large dots and small lines or large lines and small dots, but remember not to mix two prints of similar scale.

, Style experts often say that ""animal on animal"" is the way to go when mixing prints. The organic patterns in animal prints like leopard and tiger stripes naturally look great together. Don't be afraid to use contrasting colors when you're mixing similar animal prints!

, You can't go wrong when you mix two different black and white prints, so this is a great option for beginner print mixers. Black and white polka dots look brilliant with black and white stripes or gingham. You can go bold with your print choices if your color scheme is black and white., If you're just not sure if those floral pants are going to look right with your paisley top, try experimenting with print mixing using accessories at first. For example, introduce a bold new print to your wardrobe in the form of a scarf or belt instead of a blouse. Wear a pair of patterned earrings instead of buying a funky-printed vest to see how it feels to mix prints. At home, go crazy with throw pillows, framed pictures and throws before you splurge on new wallpaper or reupholster your sofa. Once you get used to mixing and matching prints, you'll start sensing what works and what clashes."

Fray them first before bleaching.,
Start off by turning the shorts inside out.,
Once you're done you may want to thread the bottoms of the shorts, you repeat the same method but just separate the white all the way around the leg hole and leave all the blue to leave a messy look.,
Once you've done this they may not have turned out as you wanted and that happens every time!,
Afterward leave the shorts to dry naturally outside.,
Once the bleach is in the bowl, put your gloves on and think of where you want the bleach to be, you may want to buy some standard white elastic bands if you want a dotted or tie-dye effect.,
Once you're done take the shorts out and place lying down on an old towel or put on the washing line to dry naturally, lay down some newspaper underneath the shorts otherwise the bleach could stain the grass.,
You could finish this tutorial and here you have some bleached, distressed shorts!,
If the colour white isn't enough for you, once you bleached your shorts you can use fabric dye to make them a desired colour.,
To dye your shorts again just pour the liquid/powder into a bowl and dilute if needed.,
Finished.

",How to Bleach and Fray Shorts," This is so you can tell apart the white from the blue thread which makes up denim. If you skip this step then your whole shorts could get ruined because all the threads will be white and impossible to tell apart.;
, If you look closely at the denim you can see white and blue threads running horizontal against each other. Cut two horizontal lines across the shorts using scissors, leaving a strip of fabric in between the slits. Cut them the length you want your distressed/worn patch to be. Using a tool you want to remove the blue threads from the fabric you just cut. You could use a needle, safety pin, or food/salad clamps to remove the blue threads, you need to do this constantly until all the blue thread has gone and you only have white strings showing, it takes quite a while so do this when you have a bit of time, don't rush otherwise you could be left with just a frayed hole.

, You may want to leave some white and just cut it short to leave threads hanging to give an even better look!

, All you need to do is put the shorts in the wash and that will separate the threads even more to have more exaggerated holes and to remove all the excess thread that's not needed.

, Don't use a tumble dryer as the threads can get caught and break from the shorts, once they're done you're ready to start bleaching! Always wear protective gloves as bleach does burn straight through skin! Now, I wouldn't personally recommend any brand of bleach because you're not looking for the hygiene job, just how thick the bleach is. Of course you can't test the bleach in-store so you're going to have to find the best brand for you out of trial and error. Buy the thickest bleach you can afford and water it down when its in the bowl/container.

, If you only want a half an half effect there's no need for bands. Don't use red rubber bands otherwise the red dye used in the bands will leak onto the shorts leaving red stains and patches. Here are the methods to get the look you want-


All of the shorts in- All shorts will turn a whitey-blue colour.
Half of the shorts in- A two tone white and blue effect.
Tie rubber bands around shorts in a ball- Random spotty tie dye effect.
Tie rubber band knots randomly- Small clouds of white.

, Don't use any other methods to dry the shorts otherwise the effect and colour could change. Leave the shorts for 3 days to make sure they are definitely dry otherwise you could burn yourself testing if the shorts are still wet.

, But you can add more items to your shorts! Lots of DIY and accessory stores sell chains, studs and gems which you can sew or glue onto your shorts. Even though studding may take a lot of time it make shorts look even better and shop bought. You can write or design anything using the gems/studs! For example your initial, just covering a pocket or making designs like a cross or a skull. Id recommend HobbyCraft for their choice in clothes decorations.

, Blue isn't enough this summer and colour range all over the rainbow! Fabric dye can be very easy to get hold of and its not expensive either, you can buy fabric dye at all hobby stores or general DIY stores. Fabric dye doesn't contain anymore bleach so your shorts won't get ruined.

, Lay shorts in liquid for 30 minutes then take out and lye on newspaper to prevent staining. Leave shorts to dry naturally without any heat and there you have it! Your own pair of bleached, distressed jeans! Enjoy!

Do exercises that target the hips.,
Try yoga.,
Sit on your butt.,
Try a cream.,
Give birth.,
Consider surgery.,
Wait it out.",How to Make Your Hips Wider1," Side leg raises, hip raises and squat kicks should all be part of a hip-enhancing exercise regimen. The mac-daddy of hip-widening exercises may be the side lunge with dumbbells. This is a beefed-up version of a traditional lunge that allows for more resistance, and therefore, more potential muscle growth and hip width.


Plant your feet a little more than two feet apart. Turn your toes out slightly. Bend your right knee and come down into a lunge position. Your left leg will be completely straight and act as a pivot.
Come down until your thigh is parallel to the ground. Clench the butt muscle Then using hip power, push yourself back up, straightening your right leg. Do not put your feet back together. You are going to maintain the 2-foot distance between your feet during the entirety of this exercise.
Now, lunge down to the other side. Come down until your knee is bent at a 90-degree angle and then push back up. Again, straighten your legs and keep both feet in place. This posture protects your knees, lets you keep tension on the muscles better and use heavier resistance.
Add two dumbbells. Hold one dumbbell in each hand. As you lunge down to the right, the right-hand dumbbell should be on the outside of your right hip. The left-hand dumbbell should be held in front of your body down between your legs. Reverse your hand positions for the other side--left dumbbell on the outside of your left hip as you lunge to the left, right dumbbell down in between your legs.;
, There are many yoga poses designed to open your hips. This will build muscle and allow for greater flexibility, which in return will make other hip exercises easier. The Frog, the Pigeon, the Lizard and the Cow Face are all poses you'll want to get familiar with.

, You can get bigger hips (and a larger derriere) by simply sitting. According to a study published in the journal Cell Physiology, researchers determined that the pressure placed on the buttocks and hips from too much sitting can generate significant fat build-up in those areas. Cells respond to their environment. As one researcher explained, fat cells that are compressed by extended periods of sitting ""produce more triglycerides (the major form of fat stored in the body), and at a faster rate."", There are a number of hip enhancement creams on the market that claim to work through a variety of methods that include repairing lost collagen and elastin to increasing the rate of muscle generation around the hips.

, While you certainly wouldn't get pregnant for this sole purpose, a woman's hips will widen to make it possible for her to give birth. In some cases, hips will return to pre-pregnancy size with time, but in other cases, bigger hips become a permanent part of a woman's physique.

, If you're willing to go under the knife to achieve a Kim Kardashian look, there are procedures worth investigating. You can have the fat removed from various areas of your body via liposuction and then transferred to your hips. Or you can also get hip implants in which ""slices"" of silicone are placed under the skin and substructures to give you a more curvaceous appearance.

, Turns out our hips get wider as we age. Research findings suggest that it's not necessarily added weight that causes hips to look bigger as we grow older, it's pelvic growth. In a study that used participants ranging in age from 20 to 79, researchers found that the width of the pelvis, the distance between the hip bones and the diameter of the hip bones all increased as people got older and that the pelvic width of the oldest people in the study was, on average, about an inch larger than the youngest."

, Swinging your hips when you walk draws attention to this area and gives out a feminine vibe that can't help but draw a little male attention. Keep your back straight and pull your shoulders down and back. Relax your body. Put one foot in front of the other as you walk and let your arms swing naturally. You can emphasize the swing in your hips a bit as you walk, but don't overdo it. If it's too highly exaggerated, it could come off looking comical.

The exception to this is ankle boots in the same color as your pants/tights. Just make sure that there is no skin- or other-colored gap between your pants/tights and your shoes., If you’re wearing boots, consider the same principles as the horizontal hemline for skirts and dresses: an asymmetrical or v-shaped line will create a smoother transition between your skin at the fabric, making your legs look longer., Some stylists recommend against calf-hugging boots, but lower or higher ones can work well to lengthen legs.Aim for a boot that fits your leg snuggly, and wear it in the same color as your bottoms.

, In all of the exercises you do, be sure to maintain a good posture. If you’re standing, your shoulders should be back and down (not hunched), your abs should be firm (tummy pulled in), and your chin should be parallel with the floor.


If you’re on your hands and knees, your hands should be stacked below your shoulders, and your knees should be below your hips. When you look down, the creases between your hands and wrists should be horizontal and parallel with the front of your exercise mat. In addition, your stomach should be strong (pulled in), your shoulders should be pulled down and away from your ears, and your neck should be long, with your chin slightly tucked.

, You can wear ankle weights to add an extra boost to this exercise:


Stand with your feet together and your hands on your hips. Your knees should have a gentle bend to them — make sure they’re not locked.
Soften your left knee slightly and tighten your abs as you lift your right leg sideways as high as it will go, then glide your leg back down the same way you lifted it, until your foot is just above the ground.
Pulse your right leg back up twice before returning to stand with both feet beside each other.
Transfer your weight to your right leg and repeat the two-pulse leg lift with your left leg.
Continue to alternate legs until you’ve completed 20 reps on each side.

,
Take a big step forward with your left leg and then bend both of your knees to 90-degree angles to lower into a forward lunge.
Be sure that your knees are directly over your ankles and not extended past them. Your knees should not be hanging over your toes.
Use your left heel (front leg) to push back up into a standing position, then rotate your body and toes so that you come to a wide-legged squat. At the same time, pull your right arm back across your chest, as if you’re pull the string back on a bow and arrow.
Push through both of your heels to return to your left-leg lunge with your arms straight out in front of you.
Repeat 20 times on one side, then switch to the other side.

, Be sure to keep your abs tight, your shoulders down (away from your ears), and your neck long (chin slightly tucked) as you do this exercise:


Get down on to your hands and knees, with your knees beneath your hips and your wrists beneath your shoulders. To protect your wrists, make sure that your wrist creases are in line with your exercise mat (i.e. horizontal). Use a mat to protect your knees.
Pull your left leg backwards to cross your left knee and foot over your right calf.
Maintaining that angle, push your left knee out to the side — it should go slightly back and up — and then lower it back to its position over your right calf, being sure not to let it touch your calf or the ground.
Do 20 reps on before switching to your right side.

, Included in this article are just a few leg-lengthening exercises. Other exercises that will help make your legs look lean and long include pliés, leg lifts, squats and lunges, and leg rolls.

, Warming up and cooling down before and after exercise, respectively, will improve the quality of your exercise and help prevent soreness and injury.


The idea with warming up is to lightly work the muscles you intend to use in your main workout. Aim to do at least a few minutes of light cardio (e.g. walking) before weight-training or going for a run, for example.
Give yourself at least 10 to 15 minutes to do some light cardio and stretching after a workout session. As an example, after a run you might walk for a few minutes and then transition to a stretching session.

Pull your hair over the shoulder of the smaller breast.,
Wear an asymmetrical top.,
Wear a sports bra and a tight shirt to flatten your chest a bit.,
Change your posture.",How to Make Two Different Size Breasts Appear the Same1," If you have long hair, use it to your advantage by sweeping it over the shoulder of the smaller breast. Doing so will visually “pad” the smaller breast, balancing them out and making them appear to be the same size.;
, Asymmetry is a perfect tactic you can use to combat unevenness. It works similar to pulling your hair over one shoulder. An asymmetrical shirt has one side that is different than the other. It could be that the shirt’s neckline or hemline swoops lower on one side more than the other. Find an asymmetrical shirt you like. The unevenness of the shirt will work to balance out the unevenness of your breasts.

, The sports bra and tight shirt will press your chest down and compress it together. Binding them in this way will minimize the appearance of their unevenness. It’s best to select a sports bra that fits your larger breast comfortably. This will keep the larger breast from spilling out of the bra.

, The farther away something is the smaller it appears, while the closer something is the larger it appears. Changing your positioning can help to make your breasts appear the same size. This will help whether you’re out in public, or whether you happen to be naked.


If you’re near other people, position your larger breast away from them. Whether you’re standing or sitting down, you can do this by angling your body so that the shoulder above your smaller breast is directed towards the person or people you’re near.
If you’re taking a picture, assume the same posture and put your hand on the hip that is farthest away.

Wear a bra with a lined cup.,
Wear a bra with removable pads.,
Choose the pad that looks and feels best to you.,
Have your bra custom-made by a company.This is likely a more expensive way to make your breasts appear the same, but it is also very effective.,
Wear a mastectomy bra.",How to Make Two Different Size Breasts Appear the Same2," If there is only a slight difference in your breast size, then this is a simple fix to your situation. Bras with a lined cup include a molded bra, contour bra and a padded bra.With these types of bras, the bra maintains the natural shape of the your breast, allowing both breasts to appear to be the same size. For the best results, purchase a lined cup bra that fits the larger breast.


Because there is more than one type of lined bra, choose the type of bra that fits your chest the best. A padded bra is the more popular choice, but depending on the size of your breasts, it may not work for you. Because the padded bra contains the same amount of padding on each side, it may have the unfortunate effect of only making your breast bigger, while maintaining their disproportionate size.
The molded and contour bra may be a better option if there is only a small difference in the size of your breasts.They work to mimic and hold the shape of your larger breast, as opposed to providing only padding.

, You can get a more even appearance by wearing a bra with removable pads. This may work better than a lined cup bra because you can create better padded support by removing or adding pads on either side of your breast. You can the empty space of your bra where your smaller breast is with more padding, and you can also tone down the padding on top of the larger breast by removing some if necessary.

, There are different types of padding available for you to choose from, including silicone, foam, water, and gel pads.Choose your padding based on the size of your breasts and the feel of the pad. Insert double-sided body tape between your bra and the padding to keep it from slipping out.


Silicone, water and gel bra pads are heavier than foam and fabric pads. If your breast size is on the lighter side, consider the foam or fabric pads.
If one breast is considerably larger than the other, don’t double up on the heavier bra pads. They may make your breasts look even in size, but one side will appear heavier than the other.
If you’re going swimming, look for beach silicone pads.

, A bra shop will go beyond simply adding in extra padding. They’ll adjust the cut of the bra and the cut of the padding, and ensure it matches the look you want. For a less expensive fix, you can have a bra shop sew padding into your bra to make it permanent.

, If you’ve undergone a mastectomy, which is the removal of a breast, or any type of surgery to your breasts, a mastectomy bra will provide the comfort your breasts may need, while also helping to make them appear even.Due to the likely sensitivity your breasts may be experiencing, this type of bra comes with inside pockets, which allow you to insert either a pad or a prosthetic breast, and provides the support you need without applying much pressure to your chest.

Determine why one breast is larger than the other.,
Have your baby nurse on the smaller breast first.,
Nurse on the smaller breast more often than the larger breast.,
Use your breast pump to stimulate additional milk flow.,
Encourage your baby to nurse from the less preferred breast.",How to Make Two Different Size Breasts Appear the Same3," Having different size breasts while nursing can happen often, since one breast may produce more milk than the other. If this is happening to you, you’ll want to figure out why before you try to implement different nursing techniques. You’ll want to make sure it’s not something your doctor or your baby’s pediatrician needs to address.One of the reasons could be biological. Your body might have more working milk ducts and alveoli. Your milk ducts are made up of alveoli, which is where your breast make milk.More working ducts and alveoli mean more milk and a bigger breast. The shape of your nipples may be different, causing your baby to prefer one breast over the other.
If you can tell your baby prefers one side over the other, make sure it isn’t because of an illness or injury in either you or your baby. Your baby might have an ear infection or some other illness. If your baby just had a vaccine immunization, he or she may avoid nursing on one side to avoid causing pain to the injection site. Also, if you have a breast infection, the taste of your milk could change causing your baby to refuse that milk.
Maybe you prefer nursing your baby on one breast over the other, and are consciously or unconsciously offering your baby the larger breast more than the smaller breast.
If you’ve had surgery on, or injured your breast, the supply and flow of your milk may be limited, resulting in that breast appearing smaller.

, Since babies tend to nurse more strongly on the first breast during a nursing session, have them nurse on the smaller breast first. This will encourage the smaller breast to produce more milk.

, Make a conscious effort to offer the smaller breast to your nursing baby more often the larger breast. The more suction a breast experiences, the more milk it will produce. Within 3 to 5 days you should notice the smaller breast is larger and about equal in size to the other. Once the breast appears equal in size, you can then offer each breast equally.

, If your baby is having trouble nursing from the smaller breast, or still prefers to nurse from the larger breast, try using a breast pump to help your breast produce more milk. Use the pump for 5 to 10 minutes after your baby finishes nursing on the smaller breast to encourage more milk production.


There are many different types of breast pumps available to use, and not all provide the same quality. Refer to a lactation specialist or your midwife or medical provider for suggestions on a good pump.

, There are several techniques you can use to get your baby to nurse on the smaller breast, specifically if he or she seems disinterested in it.


You can try different nursing positions.
Nurse where there’s little distraction, like a dark and quiet room.
Try to manually compress your breast to help increase your milk flow out of the slow-flowing breast. While your baby is nursing press, put your hands around your breast and squeeze. Watch your baby’s sucking motions and try to match the length and rhythm of each squeeze with your baby’s sucking. You can also press your fingers against the top of your breast, right below your collar bone, and then slide your hand down towards your nipple. This will also help to express more milk.
Try nursing your baby on the less preferred breast when he or she is still half asleep and less alert.

Decide if surgery is right for you.,
Get breast implants.,
Get a breast reduction.,
Get fat transferred from other parts of your body into your smaller breast.",How to Make Two Different Size Breasts Appear the Same4," Camouflaging your chest and wearing padded bras is a temporary fix. If the difference in your breasts size is large enough that temporary fixes won’t work or if you’re suffering emotional distress because of your uneven breasts, then cosmetic surgery may be the option for you.Undergoing surgery to make your breasts appear the same is a serious step. It’s an invasive procedure that can be painful and risky. If you feel surgery may be the best option for you, talk with a professional.

, There are many ways to surgically correct uneven breasts. Breast implant surgery, also known as breast augmentation, is one of those ways. The implant is created when a silicone bag filled with saline, or liquid or gel silicone is inserted behind the breast. Deciding between a liquid or gel implant will depend on preference. A liquid implant will make your breast feel natural, while a gel implant will make it feel firmer.

, If your breasts are large and disproportionate, then a breast reduction may help them look the same. A breast reduction is an operation in which fat is removed from one or both of your breasts. The surgeon will likely reshape your skin and move your nipples to accommodate the new size of your breasts.


If you decide to go through with this type of surgery, you’ll likely have small plastic tubes sticking out of each breast for up to 48 hours to allow blood and fluid to drain from your incisions.
You’ll also be unable to work for a short period of time while you heal. And you must not smoke cigarettes for at least one month before the surgery.

, Fat transfer augmentation is similar to a breast implant surgery. But instead of a silicone bag being inserted into your breast to make it appear larger, doctors will use your own fat.


A surgeon would perform liposuction to remove fat from other parts of your body, such as your legs, belly and rear-end, and then inject that fat into the smaller breast.
More women are choosing fat transfer augmentation to increase breast size because it creates a more natural looking breast. Also, some doctors consider it to be a better alternative where an implant is not necessarily needed.
But it has its drawbacks. The results of the procedure are temporary. Your body will eventually reabsorb the fat, causing your breast to return to its original size.
Also, re-injected fat can cause calcified lumps, which can turn into cysts. You’ll need to have a lot of extra fat on your body for the doctors to draw from, so if you’re fairly thin, you may not be a good candidate for this procedure.

Build up your leg and butt muscles.,
Try some basic exercises like bridges or donkey kicks.,
Go for some more challenging exercises like squats or explosive lunges.,
Shrink your core.,
Stay away from cardio.,
Try butt toning sports.,
Work on your muscles as you walk.",How to Make Your Butt Look Sexy1," The best way to give yourself a sexy butt is to build a sexy butt. This takes a lot of time. Once you start lifting, you won’t see a noticeable difference for 3 weeks. Other people won’t start to notice until 6 weeks into working out. There are many exercises that will help you tone your butt., Bridges can also be done with or without weight. Lay on your back with your knees bent. If you wish to add weight, have a partner place a bar across your hips. Lift your butt toward the ceiling and then slowly lower it back down. Donkey kicks are a basic exercise too. Find an open area and get on all fours. One leg at a time, lift your heel up toward the ceiling. Hold at the top for 3 seconds and then slowly bring your leg back down to match up to the other one. To make it harder, add some ankle weights.

, Stand with your feet shoulder width apart. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees to a 90 degree angle. Rise back up. Performing them properly with weight on your shoulders is one of the best butt exercises. Explosive lunges require balance, coordination, and patience in order to get them right. Stand with your feet together and hands on your hips. Lunge forward with your right leg. As you come up from the lunge, jump, switching legs in midair, and landing a forward lunch with your left leg in the front.

, Doing core exercises will help cinch your waist. This gives the illusion of sexy curves. The smaller your waist, the sexier your butt will look.Planks are a great way to build up your core muscles. You can easily hit your glutes with this exercise at the same time. Start in a pushup position, on your hands and toes with straight arms. Hold this for as long as you can. Keep your back straight and core engaged the entire time. Squeeze your butt for an easy bonus.
Supermans are another great way to shrink your core while you grow your butt. Lay on your stomach on the floor, arms outstretched in front of you. Squeeze your core and butt to lift your arms, shoulders, and legs off the ground so that you’re balancing on your hips. Hold for 5 seconds and release.

, While cardio is known to help you lose weight, it is detrimental to any work that you’ve done to grow a sexy figure. It eats away at your muscle before fat. This will make you lose the curves that you’ve been working for. Stick to strength training. If you want to do some form of cardio, you can do circuits with intervals of body weight exercises., Volleyball, gymnastics, rollerblading, and basketball are all great sports to help tone your butt. They focus heavily on the glute muscles and they’ll help tone your core for better curves.

, This is another double benefit move. Focus on your posture as you walk. Keep your shoulders back, core engaged, and back straight. Doing this will naturally accentuate your butt. Walking like this will naturally tighten your core as well, helping you obtain a smaller waist.

Stand up straight.,
Use breast lift tape.,
Use make-up.",How to Make Breasts Look Firm Under Clothes Without a Bra1," Good posture lifts your chest, elongating your body and pushing your shoulders back. Don't just assume you've got your posture right: practice in front of a mirror. This will help you spot errors in how you hold yourself.;
, You can find breast lift tape in most specialty lingerie and bra stores.Take a strip of tape and attach one end underneath one breast. Then tape the other end higher on your chest to lift the breast up. Do the same for the other side. You can also add a strip of tape across the bottom of your breasts and secure each end to your ribs.


This will only work for smaller chested girls.
Leaning forward while taping can make this easier.
You can do the same thing with duct tape in an emergency. However, it will be extremely painful to remove.

, This works for when you're wearing a low-cut top. Apply a small amount of bronzer to your cleavage in a ""Y"" shape. Blend it in well so that it is not obvious. Top it off with some luminizing powder dabbed on your upper breasts. This contours the breasts and makes them appear to sit higher on your chest.

Wear straight-legged or boot-cut pants.,
Play with bold patterns and bright or light colors.,

Look for skirts and dresses that end either mid-thigh or mid-calf.,
Wear boots that are fitted in the calf.,
Watch out for heavy, chunky shoes.,
Draw the eye elsewhere.",How to Make Your Legs Look Wider When They're Thin1," The flare adds a little weight and structure to your leg and disguises a slim calf. Make sure the pants are fitted at the thigh--if they're loose all over, they'll overwhelm your figure and can actually emphasize your thinness.A straight-legged or cigarette pant that isn't skin-tight around your calf can create the illusion of a shapelier leg.


Avoid leggings, jeggings, and super-skinny pants, as they are meant to make the leg appear slimmer.If you just can't resist leggings, try layering with leg warmers or tall, thick socks. These will add a little bulk to your calf.;
, Tights or pants in lighter shades like off-white, pale blue or gray or bright colors like red or yellow will add dimension to your legs. Big, bold prints can make your leg appear wider--try florals, Fair Isle, plaids, or horizontal or diagonal stripes.Dark colors like black and navy, or denim in dark washes, have a slimming effect and should be avoided.Vertical or pinstripes will only make your leg look slimmer, so stick to the patterns that make your legs look shapely., Shorts with wide legs or legs that billow out can make your legs look tiny--all the negative space can highlight how your legs are not filling out your shorts.The middle of your thigh is probably the thickest part of your leg, and you can create the illusion that your thighs are just as thick all the way up.Shorter shorts will usually hit your leg right where you want, at the widest part of the thigh., These lengths are going to hit your leg at it's shapeliest points (the widest part of your calf muscle and the widest part of your thigh).When your hem is at the widest part of your leg, it gives the impression that the rest of your leg will continue to fill out underneath the skirt.Consider pairing shorter skirts with tall boots. This way, you only reveal the wider section of your leg.The straight lines of an A-line skirt can accentuate any curves in your legs. Just try not to choose one that flares out too much, or your legs can look lost in the middle of all that fabric.A maxi dress or skirt will cover your legs entirely, but make sure they are fitted at the waist and above so you don't like you're being overwhelmed by a dress that is too large., There shouldn't be a lot of empty space at the top of your boot, as this will emphasize the narrowness of your leg. If you can't find knee-length boots that don't make your legs look like matchsticks, opt for a mid-calf boot instead. It's easier to find a snug-fitting boot for this thicker part of your leg.A slouchy boot, like a Peter Pan style, is meant to fit a little loose, so it may not look unusual if they are a little baggy around your legs.Try padding out your boots with leg warmers or thick, tall socks., If you are clomping around in a heavy shoe, your ankles are going to look even more delicate. Lightweight flats and sandals with cuffs around the ankles will balance or even camouflage narrow ankles.A high-heel will cause your calves to flex and emphasize the muscle., If you're self-conscious about your legs, force people to look at something other than your skinny stems.Wear an embellished top, attention-grabbing lipstick, a gorgeous necklace or chandelier earrings.

Lose weight.",How to Make a Round Face Appear Thinner," Bronzer can help contour your face and make it appear thinner. Make sure you choose a bronzer that’s just one shade darker than your face so your makeup doesn’t look too jarring and pick a high-quality brush to apply it. Carefully apply it to the hollows of your cheeks, your temples, and the edges of your forehead to give your face a longer, more distinct shape.


Brush it along the top of your cheekbones, in line with the top of your ears.
Carefully brush it along the top right and top left of your forehead to make it seem less round.
If you want to make your nose look longer, too, then you should get a smaller angled brush and brush the bronzer along the sides of your nose up until the corners of your brows.
Run it along your jawline, with a darker shade just below the jaw. Make sure to blend it carefully with the rest of your makeup.
The most important thing is that you blend your blusher and highlighter well so your contoured look appears natural.;
, Highlighter, along with bronzer, can help contour your face and can make it look even thinner. As a rule, your highlighter should be just one shade lighter than your natural skin tone, so it can make your skin “pop” without looking too unnatural or dramatic. Carefully apply it in the places that you’d like to emphasize. Here’s where you should apply it:









The apples of your cheeks
The top of your nose
Your forehead

, You can do this by wearing bold eyeshadow, thick eyeliner, and black mascara so that people will look at your eyes first before naturally looking vertically down to create an illusion. You can also apply concealer to the circles under your eyes to make them pop even more. Emphasizing your eyes is a great way to make your face look thinner.









To emphasize your eyes even more, you can create cat eyes by making your eyeliner move up past the outside corners of your eyes.

, Giving your brows a bit more of a dramatic arch can help your face look a bit longer. Though you don’t want to overdo it, you should try to give your brows a nice arch in the center, so the arch lines up with your eyes, while keeping them pretty thick. Too-thin brows can drown out your face and make it look more round, so make sure you keep those brows fairly thick and arched.









For an even more dramatic look, you can fill in your brows with eyebrow pencil.

, Applying lipstick to your lips can make your face look a bit thinner because it will draw attention to your lips. For an added effect, use lip liner and create a slightly exaggerated cleft in your upper lip to make your face look even longer than it really is. If lipstick isn’t your thing, you can go for a more subtle color or a lip gloss instead.








, Hair plays a big role in helping your face look thinner. Though there’s no magical haircut that will fix all of your problems, there are certain haircuts that are better than others when it comes to making your face look thinner. If you want to make the most of your hair and use it to make your face look thinner, you can try some of the following looks:









Avoid bobs or haircuts that are shorter than above your ears. These generally make your face look even more round.
If you have bangs, make sure you have a soft fringe instead of a straight, severe cut. Softer bangs will make your face look thinner than harsher bangs.
Ideally, then your hair should fall between the top of your shoulder and the bottom of your ear. If it’s any longer, then your hair will make your face lose its shape.
Add layers to frame your face. A few layers around your face can help it look thinner.
Avoid giving your hair too much volume. If your hair is too poofy, then your face will appear a bit rounder.

, Getting the right haircut is half the battle. Now, if you want your face to really appear thinner, then you have to style your hair in the best way possible to achieve that look. There are a number of things you can do to your hair, whether it’s long or short, to make your face look thinner. Here are some looks you can try:









Wear your hair up in a high ponytail.
Wear it halfway up, even letting the top part “poof” up just a tiny bit if you want, in order to elongate your face.
Part your hair to the side. This will help keep your face from looking too symmetrical.
Opt for a low ponytail on occasion. This will also make your face look longer and thinner.

, Accessories will help to elongate the face, particularly dangly earrings and long, pointy necklaces. The jewelry should be long and eye-catching. Avoid stud or large round earrings, short necklaces, or any jewelry that does not elongate the face.








, Along with the right jewelry, you might want to wear a higher hat or sunglasses on top of your head, if that’s your thing. You can wear a scarf that hangs low, making your body and face look thinner, but you should avoid scarves that are tied too tightly near your neck, or they will make your face look even more round.

, If you want to do this, then you can try a slight pout, which will elongate your mouth and make your face look a bit thinner. You should also try placing your tongue on the roof of your mouth if you want to avoid a double chin. Another way to look thinner in photos is to make sure you’re being photographed from above and not below, so you look taller and longer in general.

, If you want your face to look thinner, then you can wear clothes that are thinning in general. To do this, you should opt to wear dark, solid colors instead of patterns. If you want to wear stripes, then pick an outfit with vertical stripes instead of horizontal ones, because these will actually make your face and body look longer instead of more squat.


Pick an outfit that opens up your face and neck a bit. Pick V-neck shirts or dresses, or just clothes that show a bit more of your neck and shoulders. If you wear a turtleneck or high-cut tops, then this will make your neck look shorter and will make your face look rounder.
Wear long skirts or jeans instead of shorter skirts or capri pants, which can make you look shorter.

, Though you may have heard of facial exercises, they have gotten mixed reviews as far as their effectiveness goes; in general, it’s not considered easy to lose weight in just one part of your body, so if you want to make your face look thinner by losing weight in it, you will have to try to lose weight in general. Even losing just a few pounds can make your face look a lot thinner, so if you think you need to lose some weight, this could be the trick for you.}


You don’t need to go on a dramatic diet. Just get at least 30 minutes of exercise a day and eat three balanced and healthy meals each day, allowing for healthy snacks such as almonds and grapes.
Having high-sodium foods can also make your face look a bit more bloated than usual; avoid high-sodium foods, such as potato chips, as much as you can.
Drinking alcohol can also make your face look a bit more bloated, so you should avoid it or drink less often if you want your face to look thinner.
Make a habit of moving as much as you can. Take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk to the store instead of driving, and make an effort to move whenever you can.

Define your waist.,
Add eye-catching detail to your butt.,
Wear heels.",How to Make Your Butt Look Sexy2," The most important part in having a sexy butt is showing the difference between your waist and your butt. Give yourself curves by defining your waist. Make your waist the smallest part of your body by belting it. Wear clothes that naturally accentuate your small waist because as your clothes flare from there, the eye is naturally drawn to your sexy butt., Once you’ve made your waist appear smaller, you need to be sure that you’re making your butt look as good as it can. To do this, you have to start by choosing the right bottoms. There are many options out there, and what works best for your friends probably won’t work best for you.Find the right fit. Baggy pants are going to hide your butt. If you have a small butt, skinny jeans are going to be the best way to make your butt look bigger. If these aren’t comfortable, you can also try boot cut jeans as long as they fit you well. Make sure they don’t have a saggy crotch—this means there is too much fabric and they’ll sit in an unflattering way on your butt.
Wear jeans with pocket flaps. This is an easy way to add volume to your butt. Make sure that the flap hits at the widest part of your butt. Anyone looking at you will see your small waist and their eyes will move over your curves down to your pocket flap.
Be sure pocket placement flatters you. The easiest way to portray a “mom butt” is by wearing jeans with pockets that are way too high or way too low. Small, high pockets will make your butt look larger. They should sit directly on the top of your butt.

, The higher the heel, the higher the sex appeal. The design of heels naturally changes the curve of your spine when you wear them. This causes your butt to protrude while you walk, giving it a sexier shape. They also help because they make your legs look more toned, which tricks people into believing you have a stronger butt. Heels exaggerate the difference between male and female gaits, creating sexual arousal in males."

They are around the same price as other jeans and available online and in some stores. The best way to find the ones that are right for you is to try them on. They have different levels of lift. Try combining these with one of the other quick fixes for a drastic improvement in how sexy your butt looks."

Get a traditional breast lift.,
Opt for a laser breast lift.,
Get an internal bra.",How to Make Breasts Look Firm Under Clothes Without a Bra3," This operation is called mastopexy.Under general anesthesia, the surgeon removes excess skin, lifts your breasts, and cuts away the nipples to position them higher on your chest. Because it involves cutting around the nipple tissue, you will risk losing sensation there. As with any surgery, other risks are infection and blood loss. You can minimize the risk of blood loss by telling your doctor if you are on any medication to thin your blood, and by refraining from drinking alcohol and taking aspirin prior to the procedure.


The recovery time is about three to five days for normal daily activities and four to six weeks to resume your exercise program.

, In this new procedure, the surgeon uses the laser to cut away just the outer layer of the skin so that the tissue just beneath can be cut away. He or she then attaches this tissue under the breasts to form an internal bra. This process is called ""pedicle de-epithelialization.""Many surgeons prefer this technique as it reduces blood loss and tissue damage while also improving the skin's firmness.


Like traditional breast lifts, it is done under general anesthesia.
The recovery time is the same as with a traditional breast lift.
Since the nipple is not removed, you won't experience any loss of sensation.
Some plastic surgeons claim that the results are longer lasting that a typical breast lift because of the internal support.
The risks are the same as with any other surgery.

, This procedure involves the surgeon placing a cup made of hard silicone inside and under the breasts.The surgeon then secures the cups with silk straps screwed to the ribs. This forms an invisible bra that holds the breasts in a perkier position. Three women in the United Kingdom have had this done so far.


This procedure is still experimental, and it may be a while before it becomes available to everyone.
No one knows how effective it will be in the long-term, as well as what the long-term risks are.

If it looks like you can't fill out your pants or they're two sizes too big, it just makes your legs appear smaller.This goes for accessories, too. A huge belt or belt buckle may overwhelm your lower half. Instead, try an eye-catching pattern on your shirt or tie to draw attention away from your legs., Pinstripes are a no-no since they'll only make your legs look longer and skinnier.

Avoid salty foods.,
Avoid bloating foods.",How to Look Thinner," You should always start by wearing clothes that fit. Clothes that are too small or too big will both make you look fatter than you are. Clothes should not be tight because this creates and emphasizes the appearance of fat rolls. Clothes should also not be too loose, because the added bulk and hiding of your form will only make it look like you're got more under there than you do. Instead, just wear clothes that fit: your clothes should lightly hug your form without squeezing.


This goes for underclothes too. You want to wear underwear and bras that fit. Many women, for example, wear a bra that is the wrong size. Underwear should not bite into your hips and bras should keep your chest supported and firmly in place without creating rolls at your sides or causing your breasts to spill out over the edge of your bra.;
, An easy clothing fix to make you look instantly thinner is to draw attention to your natural waist.This is the part of your waist that is thinnest. Choose fitted shirts that nip in at the waist and styles that include belts, patterns, texture or stitching that draws in your eye at the waist.


Shirts, for example, that have gathers and twisted material that swoops in at the waist can make you look smaller.

, You can make your waist look even smaller by emphasizing the size of your chest and hips. Wear shirts, skirts and dresses that flare out at the hips (if you're a guy, try wearing your shirt untucked, when you can). You'll also want to wear tops that make your chest look bigger. Women can wear shirts with ruffles or a cowl neck in the front, for example.

, You can create a lot of illusions regarding your size by tailoring where you're visually cut off. The hem line of skirts, jackets, shirts, and other pieces of clothing can all change how you look. Generally, you want crisp lines at your hips or chest and waist, and keep cut-off lines and outlines as close to those spots as possible.


For example, you'll want to avoid the clichéd ""tourist"" clothes, since most of these add bulk and bad lines: capris, calf-length skirts, and long, baggy shortswill do you no favors.
Straight leg, boot-cut jeans are the best choice for creating good lines. Women can also wear A-line skirts that hit at the knee or just above.

, You can also carefully choose accessories that get the look you want. Certain accessories will change how a persons eye moves around your body, creating the illusion that you are taller and thinner than you really are. Long necklaces will easily create a long, slim look, for example. Bold accessories, like large, brightly colored bracelets will draw attention to your slim wrists, making your whole body smaller by comparison.Earrings and headbands also make great distractions, drawing attention away from parts of your figure that you don't like. These are especially useful if you feel like your head looks small when compared to the rest of your body.

, You can use colors and patterns to create a slimmer look as well. Of course, the standard advice is the truest: wear black. Black is your friend. Black, and other dark colors, reduce the amount of shadows that can be seen on your body. This creates an optical illusion that makes you look thinner. Pair with bright accents and accessories at your waist, wrists, neck, and feet. This will make you look thinner. There are also a few pattern choices you will want to make:


Wear vertical stripes. Thin, vertical stripes will create a visual illusion which makes you look thinner and taller (making the two sides of your body appear to be closer together).
Avoid big patterns (and most other patterns really), as these can easily make you look bigger instead of smaller. Finding patterns that don't make you bigger is challenging, so err on the side of none at all.

, You'll want to avoid clothes that add bulk in the wrong places. Clothes that don't fit will obviously do this, but there are certain clothing styles that will also make you look bigger. Empire waist tops, for example, will make your waist look bigger and for many women will actually make them look pregnant. Thick sweaters are another example of clothes that add inches visually, distracting from a smaller form.

, You can actually make yourself look much slimmer by wearing underclothes called shapewear. These may be known colloquially as Spanx, which is a common brand. These are shirts, shorts, or bodysuits which are may of elastic fibers that hold in your body in key locations. You can get them to deal with or enhance all sorts of different parts of your body. While they are tight and often uncomfortable, they will work amazingly well. You can find them at most department stores, as well as online stores like Amazon.


You can also find these shapewear items for men, usually for the chest but also for the lower body as well.

, Standing with proper posture will pull in your tummy and make you look easily 10 pounds lighter or more. Keep your back straight and your shoulders back. Sometimes this can be very uncomfortable, if you're used to standing with poor posture, but it can make a huge difference visually.


Sleeping flat on your back can help you keep a straighter back during the day.
You can find more help with improving your posture here.

, When you wear heels, your posture naturally changes, rotating your hips to tuck in your bottom and helping to keep your back and shoulders straight. It will also lengthen your legs, making you look proportionally thinner by comparison. If you're a woman, wear high heels when you can to look thinner. If you're a guy, many dress shoes will have a bit of a heel, and you can get a minor version of the same benefits.

, You'll want to hold your head high, in addition to standing straight. This will keep fat from pooling around your chin (instead stretching it out across your face), making you look thinner overall. Chin rolls can make even a thin person look like they're carry more pounds than they really are.

, Take a page from fashion models and carefully angle your arms and legs to create a slimmer appearance. Crossing your legs, for example, when you're sitting down will taper the visual lines you create, making you look slimmer. Holding your arms out from your body, like with your hands on your hips, will also draw the eye to your thinner waist and break up a boxy shape that can add visual pounds to your frame.

, If you're wanting to take photographs, there are other things that you can do to combat the camera adding those dreaded pounds. Choosing a better angle, such as from above you, will make you look slimmer by cutting off how much of your body is visible. You'll also want to adjust the lighting of your photograph. Avoid setting up the photo in a way that leads to dark shadows around bulges. You might want to experiment with taking the photo from different locations if you don't know how to adjust the lighting, so that you can choose the best photos later.


Avoid taking photos from too high above you, however. This will give the clear ""selfie"" look and people will think you're trying too hard.

, You can also make your body actually thinner by avoiding salty foods. When you have too much salt in your body, your body will try to compensate by retaining more water. This will make you look bloated and chubbier, even if you're actually pretty thin. Of course, this is something that needs to be done in advance, since it will take a few days for your body to return to normal.


Foods to avoid include cured meats, bacon, chips, soup broth, and lots of restaurant and fast food.

, There are also some foods which create gas as they break down in your system, making you bloated and adding the appearance of extra pounds. Avoid these foods in order to make yourself look actually slimmer.


Bloating foods include beans, lentils, garlic, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and other foods.

Invest in a push-up bra.,
Try a padded bra.,
Get sized for a bra every year.,
Utilize silicone chicken cutlets.",How to Get Great Cleavage1," Push-up bras are an easy and affordable way to instantly gain a cup size or two. Push up bras make cleavage appear younger, firmer and larger and can be purchased at any specialty bra store or most stores where bras are sold.








Look for a push-up bra that pushes breasts up and together.
Opt for a bra with a wide backband – this will also help to support your breasts.;
, Padded bras work to boost your breasts at the bottom, lifting the breast upwards to sit on top of the padding. Look for a bra that sits snugly around your body and doesn’t cause your breasts to spill out of the cups.If you’re wearing a deep cut top, look for a padded plunge bra. These bras position the padding on the sides to centralize your cleavage.
Padded bras fit tighter than regular bras, so try a size larger than you might normally wear.

, If you have a favorite bra, you probably wear it regularly and that will cause it to stretch out. Additionally, your breast size may fluctuate due to weight loss or gain. Visit a department store once a year for a fitting and to replace any old bras that may not be working anymore.Continuing to wear old bras may cause your breasts to sag.
If your breasts are on the larger side, always wear a bra with underwire for maximum support.

, If your want full, gravity-defying cleavage like Kim Kardashian, wear a push-up bra and insert a silicone chicken cutlet into the bottom of each bra cup. The cutlets will help boost your bust and make your breasts look fuller.For deeper cleavage, apply the cutlet to the outside of each breast.Place the cutlet high on the nipple, instead of centered on top of it, for a perkier breast.
Buy your pushup bra in your correct size, but look for one with a tight band.
Cutlets can be purchased online, or in many stores that sell clothing and lingerie.

Don't go for the Botox.",How to Get Bigger Breasts Without Surgery," Push-ups are not only great exercise for your triceps, but they can also strengthen the pectoral muscles that are located below the breasts. Doing too many push-ups at once can strain your arms, so start by doing just 2 or 3 sets of 10 push-ups in one day, if you're already physically strong. If push-ups are new to you, start with 2 sets of 5 and work your way up. As you become a push-up pro, you can ""push"" yourself to do even more each day. Here's how to do a push-up:Start with your stomach on the floor and your hands directly below your shoulders.
Slowly push your body upwards into the plank position by pushing against the ground until your arms straighten as you rise onto your toes.
Lower down to the ground without letting your stomach touch the floor and lift yourself up again.
If this proves too challenging, start off by doing push-ups while keeping your knees and lower legs on the floor. This is still a great workout for your pecs.;
, Go to a gym and work with a trusted spotter if you're new to this process. This is another great exercise that can help strengthen your pectoral muscles. All you have to do is find some dumbbells that are heavy enough to have an impact but not so heavy that they cause strain, somewhere around 7-12 pounds, and raise them in the air. You can also just do this exercise at home without a workout bench. Here's how to do it:Hold the dumbbells in both your hands with your hands resting on your thighs. Your palms should be facing downward.
Lift the dumbbells in the air while keeping your hands straight, with your arms slightly bent.
Once the dumbbells are raised above your head, gently lower them to your sides and repeat.
You can think of this maneuver as mimicking the movements of a pushup while being on your back.

, To do this, lie flat on your back, with your arms out at either side, holding light weights, ranging from 4-6 lbs. The weights should be held sideways, so the top of the weight faces you and the bottom faces away from you. Simply move your arms all the way outward, so your body is in the shape of a cross. When your arms reach their maximum span, just move them back inward, so they meet right above your chest. Keep moving your arms all the way out and then back inward to meet up above your chest.Do 2 sets of 15 fly lifts for your first effort. You can do more once you're comfortable with this move.

, This is another version of the push-up and also works your upper arms and pectoral muscles. Stand about two feet away from a wall with your palms pressed against the wall and your arms straight. Then, lean in toward the wall until your elbows are bent, while keeping your legs pretty much where they were. Use your arms and biceps to straighten out again. You can think of this as doing a push up against the wall.Repeat 10 wall presses 2 times for your first endeavor.

, These exercises will trim some belly fat, and strengthen your ab muscles.

Lay down with your arms to your sides and your knees bent. With your feet and arms still on the ground, sit up. Then, lay back down with your legs and arms in the same position.
Repeat ten times for your first set. You do not want to overdo it, so about 1 or 2 sets a day is ideal.

, That's right. If you really want to naturally get bigger breasts, then all you have to do is gain a few pounds. Your breasts will fill out along with your stomach, thighs, and other parts of your body that tend to gain weight more easily than the rest. You may not want to gain weight in order to get bigger breasts, but it's the most foolproof way to do it. To gain weight, just increase your caloric intake, focus on fattier foods like cheeses and sugary foods like cookies. Or just eat more of the food you love so you don't feel like you're actively trying to be unhealthy.


This is a good move if you're on the thin side and could stand to gain a few pounds anyway. Obviously, though, this may not be the world's most appealing solution.

, Estrogen is a female hormone that is responsible for increasing the size of your breasts, among other things. Though your body will naturally produce estrogen while you're going through puberty and even until you are 18 or 19 years old, there's no harm in focusing on eating more foods that contain estrogen to help your breasts get a bit bigger. Here are some foods that are known to be rich in estrogen:Lentils and chickpeas
Lima and kidney beans
Dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt
Fenugreek seeds
Spices such as sage, clover, and oregano
Fruits such as apples, cherries, and plums
Vegetables such as beets, carrots, and cucumbers
Grains such as rice, barley, and wheat

, Phytoestrogen comes in handy when your estrogen levels are low, when phytoestrogen takes over and helps increase your breast size. Studies have shown that phytoestrogen tablets have increased the size of the breast tissue in pre-menopausal women, and lots of delicious foods contain it, so there's no harm in adding them to your diet. Here are some foods that are rich in phytoestrogen:


Nuts such as pistachios, walnuts, cashews, and chestnuts
Beverages such as red wine, white wine, black tea, and green tea
Fruit such as peaches, strawberries, and raspberries
Flax seeds
Green beans and winter squash

, While eating foods that contain estrogen and phytoestrogen in moderation may increase your breast size, your should not take estrogen pills simply for this reason. If you do think you have a need for these pills that goes beyond needing bigger breasts, then talk to your doctor, but don't go take these pills on your own. Unfortunately, the same medication that increases breast size has been linked to breast cancer, blood clots, and other ailments that are definitely not worth increasing the size of your breasts.Some studies argue that there is no proof that estrogen or phytoestrogen increases breast size at all.


, Studies show that as many as 8 out of every 10 women are wearing the wrong bra size. Wearing a bra that is too small may actually make your breasts look smaller, not bigger, and wearing a bra that is too big can make your breasts hang more loosely and therefore can also make them look smaller than they really are. The trick to making your breasts look bigger? Wearing a bra that fits you perfectly. Here's how to find one and wear it correctly:Focus on the width of your band, not your cup size. Cup size is important, but only if you know whether you're a 32 or a 36. That makes all the difference.
Don't wear your bra on the tightest hooks unless that's how it fits best. Otherwise, hook your bra in the place where it feels the most comfortable.
Don't ever let your band ride up your back.
Make sure your bra fits the type of outfit you're wearing. Don't wear the same style bra with different tops, or some may make your breasts look smaller than they really are.

, This is another quick and easy fix -- no stuffing necessary. A padded bra can make your breasts look a bit bigger, and a push-up bra can take that to the next level. If you're in the market for a padded or a push-up bra, you should get fitted before you try one on, just as you should do with a real bra. Just make sure you don't get a bra that is so obviously padded that you've increased the size of your breasts by 3 -- that will be a little obvious.


In fact, you should avoid stuffing your bra with Kleenex or anything else that cannot take on the actual shape of your breasts. It will look silly if nothing else, and could lead to some embarrassment.

, Sound extreme? It's totally not. Women contour their breasts with makeup all the time, especially on movie sets. This creates the illusion of a lighter size and only requires a few brush strokes and for you to take care to not get makeup on the top of your shirt. You can even buy a makeup kit for this purpose if you're really committed; first, though, it's best to start off just using the makeup you have to see if you like the effect. If you want to give it a try, follow these steps:Get dressed, bra and all. Put on the outfit you're actually going to wear.
Tuck tissue or toilet paper into the front of your shirt to protect it from makeup.
Apply darker bronzer or powder in the area down in your cleavage area, moving down in between your breasts.
Blend this color up and outward, making a v-shape along the natural curve of your breasts.
Brush a lighter shade of eye shadow or face powder, such as gold or peach, over the top half of your breasts.
Use a sponge to blend the shade to create a natural and more full look for your breasts.

, Your mother may have been on to something when she kept telling you to stop slouching when you were a little girl. This is the easiest and quickest way to make your breasts look bigger. Having good posture by keeping your spine straight, your shoulders naturally raised instead of hunched, and your arms at your sides instead of folded across your chest, will not only make you look taller and more confident, but it will also make your breasts look perkier and bigger.


When you're hunched over, so are your breasts. When you're standing tall and proud, so are they.

, This is another easy trick for making your breasts look bigger than they really are. Wear tops with frilly lace or patterns in the chest area, wear horizontal stripes that stretch out your breasts, and try shirts with low necklines that show your cleavage without revealing so much that your breasts actually look smaller. Wearing tops that have one color above your breasts and a different color below can also make them look bigger.Shirts or dresses that fan out just below the breast bone can also enhance the size of your breasts.
Wear a dress or a shirt with an underwire and your breasts will naturally perk up.
Wearing shirts that are too tight around the breasts, such as tube tops that are too tight or halters that don't quite fit, will actually make your breasts look smaller.
You can also call attention to your breasts by wearing a pendant necklace that hangs in between your breasts.

, It's true: some birth control pills are known to enhance the size of your breasts. However, you shouldn't go running to the nearest doctor to get a prescription for the pill just for this reason. If you've just started being sexually active, are suffering from difficult periods, or have another reason for wanting to try the birth control pill, then talk to your doctor about whether or not this is the right decision for you.


Starting to take the pill can lead to some potentially unpleasant side-effects, such as mood swings and longer periods, so it is definitely not worth taking just to make your breasts get bigger.

, If you're a young girl, your breasts may not have reached their full size yet. Puberty affects everyone differently, and while you feel that your breasts may have reached their full size already, they can grow naturally well into your late teens, or even later in some cases, as part of your development process. As you get older, you may also naturally gain a little weight or decide that going on the pill is right for you, and your breasts may end up growing without you noticing it.Don't rush off to change the size of your breasts before you've grown into your body.

, You will see many adds for pills, supplements, or even injections that are ""proven"" to make your breasts grow naturally. However, there are very few pills or supplements that have been proved to naturally work, and which have not been shown to have negative side effects. It's better to do things the natural way, through diet and exercise, or even throw creating the appearance of larger breasts, than to do something that can have harmful effects to your body.


Talk to your doctor before you take any so-called supplement.

, Many women between the ages of 30 and 50 are paying up to $2,000 to use Botox to give themselves a breast lift. While studies haven't yet confirmed whether this is a dangerous move, some doctors do say that the effect is barely worth it, described as being barely different from the effect of altering your posture -- which you can do for free."

Match your tones or go for a monochromatic look.,
Avoid large patterns; stick with solid colors and small patterns.,
Avoid baggy clothing.,
Practice good posture.,
Act confident.",How to Look Taller1," Think pinstripes, pleats, and vertical zippers. Vertical lines draw the eye up and down, which causes the eye to take in more height than width. Horizontal lines, on the other hand, draw the eye side to side, causing the eye to take in more width and less height.;
, Wearing different colors divides a person’s body into separate segments. Wearing the same color, or tones that are within the same range, creates one solid line for an observer’s eye to pick up. Having your body divided into fewer segments creates the illusion of height.

, Large patterns have a tendency to overwhelm the person wearing them, especially if that individual is slightly built. Solid colors and small patterns avoid this issue.

, People who wear loose, over-sized garments may end up looking “lost” inside their clothes, which may make them seem wider and shorter than they actually are.

, If you are slouched or hunched over due to poor posture and bad core strength, you will inevitably look shorter than you really are. Exercise such as yoga, rowing, and other conditioning exercises can help immensely.

, People who are confident come across as ""taller"" than a person of relatively similar size, but act without confidence.

Tape your breasts.,
Apply breast lift tape.,
Choose clothing that enhances your cleavage.,
Try a corset.",How to Get Great Cleavage2," While nothing can support your breasts like a bra, tape is ideal for instances where you can’t wear one (for example, if you’re wearing a dress with a plunging neckline or an open back).








Make sure your skin is free from lotions and oils before applying.
To apply, start with a piece of tape between 12 – 16” long. Place the tape over your nipple, then pull it up to attach it to your side, near your underarm.Trim any excess tape and smooth the tape flat against your chest.
Duct tape and gaffer’s tape yield the best results.
Avoid using this trick if you have sensitive skin.

, Breast lift tape works similarly to using duct tape, but is only applied to the portion of the breast, just above the nipples. To apply breast lift tape, place the adhesive directly over the nipple. Remove the paper from the upper half of the adhesive and attach the sticky upper portion to the upper portion of your chest.








Smooth the tape gently to remove any air-pockets.
Breast lift tape does not provide a great deal of support and tends to work better for women with smaller cup sizes.
Breast lift tape can be purchased online or in stores like Target.

, There are certain styles and cuts of clothing that are designed to make a woman's chest appear larger. Try wearing a dress or top in a bandeau cut - this will offer support and also push your breasts up so they look bigger and perkier.








Try wearing a bodysuit. Look for one with built-in foam cups to provide the support you would normally get from your bra.If you can’t find a bodysuit with cups, buy cups at a fabric store and take them to a seamstress to have them sewn in.
Try engineered shapewear for results that are designed to mimic the effects of plastic surgery., Corsets aren’t just for period pieces anymore – modern women use corsets to narrow the middle portion of their bodies and make their breasts appear larger and more pronounced.Look for a corset that has boning; this will serve as a makeshift bra.
Do not immediately tighten your corset after putting it on. Give your body a few minutes to adjust before lacing yourself in."

Wear the right top.,
Use bronzer to grow your décolletage.,
Lift your breasts through exercise.,
Sleep on your back.",How to Get Great Cleavage3," If you were blessed with full breasts, make your cleavage pop even further by wearing a t-shirt in a v-neck, plunging or sweetheart cut. Make sure you’re wearing a well-fitting bra underneath your shirt to prevent spillage.If your breasts spill over the tops and sides of your bra, it’s time to get remeasured.
Breasts should be lifted and separated when wearing a V-neck top. If they are too squished together, opt for a different bra.

, To makeup your breasts, you’ll need a soft powder brush, a bronzer that is darker than your skin and a bronzer that is light and luminescent.








Sweep dark bronzer from where your bra strap meets your cup down to the inner edge of your cleavage. Repeat on the other side of your chest.
Brush the light bronzer in a straight line down the middle of your cleavage and across your collarbone.
For best results, wear a push up bra when making up your chest.

, Working out your pectoral muscles as you’re getting ready can actually make your breasts look larger. To work out your pecs, grab two 20 oz water bottles and lie down on your back. Extend your arms to the sides to make a T shape, then lift your arms to meet over your chest.Keep your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor.
Do 25 reps a day for a noticeable lift.

, Sleeping on your stomach may cause wrinkles on your chest. Try to sleep on your back or side whenever possible and apply sunscreen and moisturizer to your chest if you’re planning to be in the sun.To further improve your breasts as you sleep, wear a sleep bra to bed. The sleep bra will help prevent your breasts from sagging long-term.

Avoid over-sized bags.",How to Look Taller2," Long hair can ""drown"" shorter women. A hairstyle that stops above the shoulder prevents a woman's locks from overwhelming her stature.

, If you prefer or must wear long hair, consider putting it back in high ponytails, buns, and other up-do's. Hair styled several inches above the head adds inches to your height.

, Long, straight hair that hangs down in a single layer has the most overwhelming effect. Adding choppy layers or highlights breaks up the monotony of long hair, which may help prevent it from dwarfing you.

, Whether you choose half-inch heels or three-inch heels, these shoes add height and make you look taller. Opt for skinny heels over thick ones, since skinny heels are more effective in creating a slender vertical appearance while thick platforms can make your feet look weighted and heavy.

, Showing more skin on your foot is a simple way to extend the appearance of your height. The more skin an observing eye notices on your leg, the longer your leg will seem. The longer your leg seems, the taller you look.

, Ankle straps cut your leg off with a horizontal line at the top of the foot, reducing the length of your leg as well as the appearance of height.

, A deep v-neck keeps the eye looking up and down, while crew necks, scoop necks, and other horizontal necklines draw the eye side to side.

, A hemline that stops at the knee or above it looks flattering on women of short to average height. Showing more leg makes your legs look longer, which maximizes the illusion of height.

, Think A-line skirts and boot-cut jeans. Styles that flare out at the knee or lower leg help balance out the natural width of your hips. Tapered styles may make you look top heavy which, in turn, can make your legs look shorter. Shorter-looking legs may make you look shorter overall.

, If you plan on wearing a dress with bare legs, consider a nude shoe. Alternatively, if you plan on wearing dark-wash jeans or black slacks, try a black shoe. Keeping your shoes and leg coverings in the same color range makes it more difficult for the eye to distinguish where the leg ends and the foot begins, making your leg look longer as a result.

, The eye naturally assumes that the leg starts at the waistline. By having a waistline that rests above your hips, you help your legs look longer, helping you to look taller. For this reason, you should also avoid low-rise pants that may only make your legs look shorter.

, A skinny belt tied around your natural waist can help define your figure, and may look flattering. A wide belt will define your figure, but the heavy horizontal line will also divide you in half and cause you to look shorter, rather than taller.

, Try long scarves and necklaces that drape down your front. These pieces draw the eye up and down, causing it to take in your entire height.

, Bulky shoulder bags and fanny packs cause you to look wider at the waist and hip. Anytime you cause the eye to take in width, you reduce the amount of height it takes in. Small clutches and tiny shoulder bags on narrow straps are much better alternatives.

Add height to your hairstyle.,
Consider wearing heel inserts inside your shoes.,
Try a dress shoe with a moderate heel.,
Wear cropped suit jackets.,

Keep your casual shirts short, but not too short.,

Avoid drawing attention to your limbs with shorts and short sleeved shirts.",How to Look Taller3," Keep the sides of your hair neatly trimmed, but leave plenty of hair on top. The extra volume on top, when matched with the decreased volume on the side, adds inches to your overall height. This trick works especially well if you use gel to create a spiky style.

, Heel inserts slip inside your shoe and lift your foot an inch or more, physically adding height. Avoid heel inserts if you anticipate taking your shoes off in public, however. Also avoid inserts if you already have a shoe with a thick heel.

, Some men's shoes look fine with a half-inch heel, but you must be careful about choosing the right style. For best results, stick with black loafer-style pumps or boots. Avoid wearing athletic shoes or regular dress shoes that simply have an extra heel.

, In general, jackets build up the shoulder, broadening your stature and creating the illusion of height. To maximize this illusion, consider a cropped jacket where the bottom hem cuts off at the same point as the wrists. A jacket that stops at that point shows more of your legs, making your legs look longer. Longer-looking legs will help you look taller overall.

, A narrow necktie creates a slim, vertical line that draws the eye up and down. Thicker ties have more width, which reduces the effectiveness of this tactic.

, A taller man typically wears a suit coat so that a half-inch of the shirt cuff shows beyond the edge of the jacket sleeve. Wear your suit so that only a quarter-inch of your cuff shows, instead. The narrower horizontal line makes your arms look longer than a thicker line would. Likewise, narrower folds along your collar or lapel also reduce the widening effect of these horizontal folds. Generally, the less wide you look, the taller you look.

, Shorter shirts expose more of your leg, creating the illusion of both leg length and overall height. Look for shirts that end somewhere around the base of your thumb. Shorter shirts may look as though they are too small for you, however.

, Pants that are too long will bunch up at the bottom, which draws attention to your short stature. Trousers and jeans should have a lower hem that strikes around your shoelaces. Also avoid pants that ""turn up"" or fold over at the bottom hem, since this has a tendency to create thick horizontal lines that shorten the leg.

, Low-slung jeans make your legs look stout and stubby. Keep your pants snapped and belted at your natural waist in order to maximize the length of your leg.

, Dark colors have a slimming effect, which make your legs look lean and long. Think black dress pants and dark wash jeans.

, Wear a pocket square or bright tie to add detail to a suit, or look at casual shirts with epaulets and upper pockets. When you wear details higher up, it encourages an observing eye to move up from your feet toward your head, causing the eye to take in more height.

, Short men are typically short because they have shorter limbs. Shirts and bottoms that draw attention to your limbs only emphasize the fact that you lack long limbs. Consider wearing longer garments made of lighter materials when the weather just barely begins to warm up, since these will keep you cool without drawing attention to your limbs. Save your short sleeve shirts and shorts for unbearably hot weather.

Test your posture.,
Stop slouching.,
Know what good standing posture looks like.,
Know what good seated posture looks like.,
Ensure that your work environment isn’t contributing to your poor posture.,
Take regular breaks.,
Fix your posture while you are at your desk.,
Correct your posture with a wall exercise.,
Do shoulder squeezes to stop slouching.,
Strengthen your core.",How to Get a Sexy Back1," This test will help gauge how good your standing posture is:Stand with your heels 2 to 4 inches away from a wall, and with your head, shoulder blades, and buttocks touching the wall.
Reach one hand back and, placing your palm flat against he wall, slide your hand behind your lower back curve.
The space between your lower back and the wall should measure roughly one hand’s thickness.
If there’s too much space, tightening your abs will help flatten the curve in your back. If there’s not enough space, gently arch your back until you can fit your hand between your back and the wall.;
, Computer work, lab and research-heavy jobs, and inactive lifestyles can weaken your back, chest and arm muscles, and cause you to slouch. Slouching can make you look saggy, tired, and heavier than you are.



Improving your posture will instantly boost the appearance of your back. It will also pull in your stomach and make you look taller and slimmer., Follow this checklist to ensure that you have good standing posture:Keep your shoulders back and relaxed. Don’t force them back to the point that you’re uncomfortable.
Pull in your stomach. Again, there is no need to be forceful here. Just gently pull in your stomach muscles (you’ll likely feel the lower part suck in and the upper part tense a little).
Stand with your feet hip-width apart.
Ensure that your weight is evenly balanced between both feet. (You can shift side to side and back and forth a bit to get a sense of how your weight distributes itself on your feet.)
Allow your arms and hands to hang naturally at your sides.
Keep your knees relaxed, with a gentle bend in them.
Ensure that your head is balanced on your neck. Your head shouldn’t be tilted in any direction. Your neck should feel like it connects in a long, straight line with your spine, as if a string is attached to the top of your head and is gently pulling you upward.

, Follow this checklist when you’re seated to ensure that you have good posture:Your feet should rest flat on the floor when you’re seated so that your knees are level with your hips. If this isn’t possible, get a foot rest.
Sit back in your chair so that the chair supports your lower back. If the chair doesn’t touch your lower back, use a pillow or rolled-up towel behind your lower back.
Raise your head toward the ceiling, and slightly tuck in your chin.
Your upper back and neck should be straight but comfortable.
Your shoulders should be relaxed. Make sure they’re not slouching, climbing up towards your ears, or pulled backwards.

, It’s particularly common to experience postural issues when working at jobs that require you to sit at a desk. Having a proper setup can improve your posture, and prevent pain and injuries.Your desk should be set up so that it’s as easy for you to sit as tall as possible while you work.Your screen should be at eye level and you shouldn’t have to turn or lean forward to see it.
Your chair should support your lower back, and keep your hips and knees on level with one another.
Your elbows should be kept at 90 degrees and close to your sides while working, so ensure that your keyboard does not sit higher up on your desk or too far away., If much of your day is spent hunched over books or a computer, it’s necessary to take regular breaks get up and move around, and stretch. Ideally you should stretch and/or get out of your chair every 20 to 40 minutes.If you can’t take breaks every 20 to 40 minutes, at the very least remember to do some gentle stretches while sitting, and/or to change your position in your chair.

, Improve your neck posture if you are used to looking at a computer screen. Extend your neck backwards, like you are trying to touch it to a wall, hold for 3 seconds and return it.


Repeat 10 times, doing several sets throughout the day.
This exercise will improve your neck muscles so that you’re less likely to slope forward when you stand. It will also remind you to keep your back straight while you work.

, Stand against a wall with your heels 2 to 4 inches away from the wall. Pull your shoulder blades together and touch them to the wall. Then, tip your chin down slightly and touch the back of your head to the wall.


Ensure that your back isn't over-arched and your shoulders aren't lifted toward your ears.
Hold the position for several minutes until it feels comfortable.
Return to the wall 2 to 3 times a day to check that you are keeping the correct posture.

, These are helpful if your arms tend to fall forward. Simply squeeze your shoulder blades together and hold them for 3 seconds. Release and repeat 10 times.


Perform several sets throughout the day. You can do this at your desk, on the couch, while you’re on the phone — really while you’re doing anything.

, Having a strong core will help improve your posture. Try doing yoga or pilates a few times a week. This will help build your core muscles and also strengthen and tone the rest of your muscles."

Make physical activity a part of your life.,
Remember to strength train.,
Add high intensity interval training (HIIT) to your weekly routine.,
Develop your power.",How to Get an Athletic Body1," At least 30 minutes of physical activity every day is recommended.If you can’t find 30 minutes straight to workout, try to break it up into 2 15-minute periods or 3 10-minute periods.Exercise at least 150 minutes a week. You can spread out this time throughout a week. You can do a mix of moderate and intense activities.Brisk walking, swimming or even mowing your lawn are great examples of moderate activities.For more intense activities, try running, dancing, or playing basketball.Once you’ve gotten a regular fitness routine down, you’ll want to focus on gaining athletic qualities like speed, power, agility and balance.;
, You should strength train your muscles at least twice a week. A good example of a strength training activity is lifting weights.Exercises you should include in your strength training routine include: squats, deadlifts, power cleans, bench presses, reverse bent over rows, pull-ups, military presses, and dips.Lifting weights or using weight machines is just one example of how to strength train. You can also take part in activities like rock climbing or heavy gardening., The high level of intense cardio will help you build your speed and help you lean out more quickly.


Start with 15 to 20 minutes of interval work once or twice a week. Hill sprints, sled pushes, treadmill interval sprints, and rower sprints are all great exercises to incorporate., Power is the ability to move weight quickly. You can teach your muscles to move quickly using an exercise you’re already familiar with.


Pick a lifting exercise like squats or deadlifts. Use a little less weight than what you’re used to. Lift the weight as quickly as possible, but lower the weight slowly and as controlled as possible in 3 to 4 seconds. Take a rest for 1 second and then lift the weight as quickly as possible again."
"
Do cardio exercise three to four days per week, every other day.,
Choose interval workouts over moderate intensity workouts.,
Pick walking, elliptical training, swimming or biking over long-distance running.,
Consider a cardio plus conditioning workout.,
Embrace hills or stairs while you walk, hike or run.",How to Get a Curvy Body1," Cardio keeps your weight stable while providing muscle toning. Remember that it is impossible to target fat loss in one area of the body; cardio helps you burn fat all over your body.


You can, however, target muscle growth. Move on to the hip and butt sections to learn how to do this.;
, You can increase your fat burning potential by alternating moderate and high intensity. 20 to 30 minute interval workouts can be more efficient than one-hour medium intensity workouts.

, If you are naturally skinny, high intensity workouts might burn off the fat in your bust and hips that makes you more curvy. Choose a total body interval workout or walking to stay in shape without losing muscle mass and hip or bust size.

, Flow yoga, barre method, body sculpt and aerobics can build lean muscle while they burn fat, saving you time in your schedule.

, They will burn fat and tone your butt, hips, thighs and calves.

Target muscles around the love handles.",How to Hide Love Handles," Most people tend to be smaller at the waist than at the hips, so wearing high-waisted bottoms will stop your pants from unnaturally dividing your hips and waist. Moreover, this will stop your waistband from cutting you off where you're bigger and creating a bulge.Look for bottoms that sit at or just above your belly button.Also, look for bottoms that have thicker waistbands—ones with at least two buttons—and that sit higher in the back than the front, as these won’t cut you off in an awkward area.;
, Clothes with empire waists are tighter at the waist and then flare out and down from there, and these garments are flattering because they accentuate the waist and hide tummies and love handles.


Similarly, A-line clothes are thinner at the top and flare out at the bottom, so skirts and dresses with this cut balance out larger torsos and make love handles less noticeable., While the old advice says that wearing darker colors is always more slimming, this isn't entirely true. Instead of wearing all black to hide your love handles and look slimmer, wear a darker color where you’re heaviest and a light color where you're smaller.For instance, if you want to make a large tummy look smaller, wear black around your middle and a pop of color on top. You can achieve this by wearing a high-waisted A-line skirt paired with a bright top tucked in, for example.

, There are a few shirt types that are more flattering for people who need some extra room in the middle, and they’ll also draw attention away from the love handles. Flattering shirts tend to have a little more flow to them, and these include:Kimono-style shirts
Kaftans
Wrap shirts and dresses

, Another way to hide love handles is to bury them under a bold print or pattern, or to cover them up with a ruffled design that will obscure what's underneath.Look for tops with ruching on the sides or some subtle ruffles
Experiment with intricate patterns, diagonal stripes, and eye-catching prints

, Foundation garments, also called shaping garments, are arguably the most successful way to hide love handles, because they're actually designed to shape and smooth parts of your body. These garments are meant to be worn under your clothes, and ones that will hide love handles include:Full bodysuits and body control dresses, which are great for when you're wearing a slimming dress.
Waist cinchers and control briefs, which are perfect for when you want to wear skinny jeans or tighter fitting pants or skirts.

, When it comes to hiding love handles, avoiding the wrong clothes is just as important as choosing the right ones. Tops that are tight and clingy without being shaping will only serve to show off your love handles, especially when paired with overly tight and unflattering bottoms.Fabrics to avoid include satin, full polyester, and elastane (Spandex and Lycra), all of which cling to your body and accentuate your silhouette., Unlike empires and A-lines, straight-cut clothing emphasizes your middle and stomach area, and this will draw all the attention to your love handles.This applies to pants, tops, skirts, and dresses.

, There are lots of recommendations out there saying to use belts to hide love handles, but even thick and oversized belts can cut into your sides and make love handles even bigger.If you want to wear an oversized belt, choose one that’s loose fitting, wear it around your lower hips, and pair it with a loose top.
Otherwise, stick with skinny belts that don’t cut into your waist.

, Tight underwear, especially ones with thin waistbands or straps, can cut into your flesh and make love handles bigger. In fact, thin, tight straps on underwear can even make you look like you have love handles when you don’t.


Like with bottoms, choose underwear with a higher waist and thicker waistband., This includes bottoms that are too tight and ones that don’t sit where they should.Don’t try to squeeze into bottoms that don’t fit, especially if they're tight at the waist.


For example, skinny jeans may be all the rage right now, but if you're bigger around the middle and choose skinny jeans with a low waist, your love handles are going to bulge out more than ever.

, The other way to hide love handles (or any feature you don’t like) is to draw attention away from it by drawing eyes elsewhere. There are a number of ways you can do this, including with jewelry. A bold and unique necklace will draw eyes to your neck and chest, and keep the attention off your middle.Avoid necklaces that are too long, as they will take the focus back to your mid-section.

, Working on the same theory as the necklace, a brightly color or boldly patterned scarf around your neck will keep the attention on your face and neck, and away from your love handles.You can still wear scarves in spring and summer, but to avoid overheating, look for thinner scarves in lightweight materials such as cotton and linen.

, Long, dangly, or bold earrings also keep attention around your face and away from your middle, and they can help change up your look if you don’t always feel like wearing necklaces and scarves.If you can't wear long earrings to work, or if you find them annoying, look for studs in bold and bright colors, or shorter earrings with loud patterns.

, Another way to bring attention to your chest and neck instead of your love handles is with V-neck, scooped, and plunging necklines. This is a great option for people who can't wear jewelry or scarves at work., You can tie the sleeves of a sweater or jacket around your waist to hide love handles as well, because the bulk from the sleeves will cover up any excessive bulging underneath.


Place the body of the sweater against your bottom, then wrap the sleeves around to the front of your body and tie them in a knot or bow.
In summer, you can use a lightweight, long-sleeved shirt to achieve the same effect.

, A tucked in shirt will fit closer to your body, and this will accentuate your love handles. Instead, wear a nicely tailored shirt and leave the bottom hanging loose. This will give you more room and let the fabric cover your love handles.When you have to tuck in your shirt, such as at work, consider wearing a jacket or blazer over top to hide your love handles.

, Shirts that are loud will draw attention to your middle and your love handles. Instead, choose plain shirts in dark colors that won’t draw the eye to your midsection. Avoid shirts with:Bright colors
Intricate designs or patterns
Stripes or plaids

, When you slouch, your shoulders roll forward and your belly compresses into the center and sticks out, and this will make your love handles look bigger.


When you sit or stand, your back should be straight and your shoulders should be back. Keep your head in line with your body, and activate your core to support your upper body.Proper posture will also help alleviate back pain, headaches, and make you look taller.

, Instead of wearing pants around your hips, wear them at your waist. This will help hide love handles, avoid cutting your body off at an unnatural place, and make you look slimmer overall.


Your waist is the thinnest part of your middle, just below your belly button.

, These are sometimes called shaping or concealing shirts, and they are great for containing excess fat, hiding love handles, and making you look slimmer.Make sure you wear the compression shirt as an undergarment layer beneath your regular shirt.

, It’s not actually possible to target fat loss in a specific area, but you can help reduce love handles by reducing the total amount of excess fat on your body. Exercises that get your heart pumping, such as cardio and aerobic workouts, are some of the best ways to lose fat. For the best results, workout for at least 30 minutes a day four times a week or more.Good cardio workouts include:


Swimming
Running and jogging
Circuit training
Cycling
High-intensity interval training

, Strength training is great because it builds muscles and burns fat at the same time. Even if you don’t have time to hit the gym and pump iron, you can do a simple body weight strength training routine at home:An easy routine is:


20 squats: stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, then squat down so your thighs are parallel with the ground.
10 push-ups: lie facing the ground, supported on the tips of your toes and palms of your hands with your arms straight. Lower your body all the way to the ground while keeping your body straight, then push back up to your starting position.
20 walking lunges: step forward with your right foot and go into lunge. Rise, take another step forward with your left foot, and sink back into lunge.
10 dumbbell rows: push two chairs together and put your right knee on one chair and your right palm on the other. With your left arm, pull a dumbbell (or milk jug or paint can) straight up beside your body, then back down. Repeat 10 times on each side.
15 seconds of planking: lie down facing the ground. Put your arms in front of you, then push yourself up onto your forearms, then push the rest of your body up so you're being supported by your forearms and toes. Keep your body straight.
30 jumping jacks.

, The muscles around your love handles are the obliques, and you can work these muscles to give the area more definition. Combine this with overall fat loss, and your love handles will become smaller and less noticeable. Good oblique workouts include:Side plank crunches: Lie on your right side and prop yourself up on your right elbow. Lift off the ground so your body is supported by your right forearm and the sides of your feet. Crunch your right knee in toward your left elbow, then return to plank. Repeat for 10 to 12 reps, then repeat on the other side.
Plank-to-elbow push ups: Start in plank position so you're facing the ground with your body supported on your toes and forearms. Without rocking your hips, raise yourself up to support your right side on your palm, then do the same with your left side. Then lower back down into plank on your right side, followed by the left. Alternate sides (left side first then right side first again) and repeat for 30 to 45 seconds.

Do back, chest, and shoulder exercises 3 times a week.,
Do the cobra pose.,
Tone your upper back with shoulder shrugs.,
Do kneeling reverse flies.These will help tone and build muscle in your back, arms, and abs:


Kneel on all fours, being sure to keep your hands aligned under your shoulders, and your knees aligned under your hips.,
Do the bird dog exercise.This will help work your upper and lower back, as well as your legs and core.,
Don’t forget about the classics.,
Go swimming.,
Be smart.",How to Get a Sexy Back2," This section lists some popular exercises for getting a sexy back by strengthening your back, shoulders, and chest.


You’ll need dumbbells (5 to 10 lb for women, 10 to 20 lb for men), a workout mat, and running shoes., This is a popular yoga pose that stretches and strengthens the chest, shoulders, and upper and lower back:Lie face down on the mat, with your elbows bent and hugged in at your sides, and your hands palm down, in line with or underneath your shoulders. Your legs should be stretched straight back, with the tops of your feet flat against the floor.
As you inhale, slowly straighten your arms to list your chest off the floor. As you do this press the tops of your feet and thighs, and your pelvic bone into the floor.
While your chest is lifted your tailbone should draw down towards your pelvic bone, and your stomach should be firm. Your buttocks should be firm but not flexed to the point that they are hard.
Draw your shoulders away from your ears so that your shoulder blades melt down your back. You should feel a lift through your sternum, without your front ribs pushing forward. Think of the back bend as being distributed evenly along your whole spine.
Hold this pose for 15 to 30 seconds. If you feel comfortable with it, you can lift your legs up as well. For an added punch, you can lift your arms off the floor and hold them straight out in front of you, moving into a superman pose.Exhale as you return to your starting position (lying face down on the mat), then repeat 9 more times (for 10 reps total)., Grab a dumbbell in each hand and stand with good posture. Your feet should be hip-width apart. Throughout this exercise your arms should hang naturally at your sides.


Lift your shoulders towards your ears, as though you are shrugging. Hold for 3 seconds, and then slowly lower them back down.
Repeat with 2 sets of 10 repetitions.

, Hold a dumbbell in each hand.
Flex your abs (this will pull your stomach in and make it feel firm), and then steady yourself in preparation for lifting your right arm out to the side.
Keeping a slight bend in your elbow and your palm facing down, lift your right arm out to the side until it is even with your shoulder.
Lower the arm back down slowly, and repeat 14 times (for a total of 15 reps) before switching to your left side.
Do 2 sets of 15 reps on each side.

, You don’t need weights for this exercise.


Get on all fours, with your knees aligned under your hips and your hands aligned under your shoulders. Your neck should be long, with your face (and eyes) pointed downward. Make sure you feel steady and that your weight is evenly distributed between your arms and knees.
Tense your ab muscles as you slowly slide your right leg backwards and lift it off the floor so that it is straight out behind you, at a height that is in line with your hips and back.
At the same time as you lift your right leg, lift your left arm up and hold it out straight out in front of you.
Hold the position for 10 seconds before slowly returning your arm and leg to the ground.
Repeat with the right arm and left leg. Alternate the sides so that you have between 5 and 12 reps on each side.
Your back should stay in the same position (straight, not dipped or hunched) during the entire exercise. If you can’t hold it steady while you raise your arm and leg, start with just the legs until you’re feeling more secure.
Once you’ve mastered this, you can try the challenging bird dog plank variation, in which you lift opposite arms and legs while in a plank position (as opposed to being on your hands and knees)., Classic moves like pushups, planks, and sit-ups will help build your core, improve your posture, and strengthen and tone your back.


You might even do these during some of your breaks at school or the office, if you can find a quiet place to do them.
You can do wall pushups (a standing variation of floor pushups) just about anywhere.

, Swimming is great because it gives you a cardio workout while strengthening and toning your muscles. It’s a great option if you have any joint or muscle problems as it is low impact., You want to challenge yourself by doing at least 5 of these exercises 3 times a week, but you also don’t want to overdo it. Give yourself a break in between workout days so that your muscles have time to repair themselves.


If you want more of a challenge, try increasing the reps or the weight for each exercise."

Reduce Stress.,
Change your diet.,
Stay hydrated.,
Stay clean.,
Get skin treatments.,
Try some light sun exposure.,
See a doctor.",How to Get a Sexy Back3," Stress increases the production of glucocorticoid, which can lead to skin abnormalities.Two surefire ways to reduce stress are to get enough sleep and to exercise regularly.


Adults should get 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Teens should get between 8.5 and 9.5 hours of sleep a night., A healthy diet might not automatically equal great skin, but it can definitely help.Follow these tips to reduce your susceptibility to acne:Don’t eat too many carbs. Healthy carbs are okay, but even then, eat them in moderation. Definitely avoid white flour, bread, cookies, sugary soda and other junk foods.
Minimize your dairy intake. It’s okay to have small amounts of cultured, whole milk dairy products containing natural probiotics (e.g. yogurt and kefir), but avoid cheese and ice cream as much as you can.
Eat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids. This include salmon, flax seeds, walnuts, and spinach, among other things.
Eat your fruits and veggies. These are natural sources of antioxidants, zinc, selenium, vitamin A and fiber, which can all help with acne.
Try to get as many of your vitamins and nutrients from food instead of supplements, as supplements are not always as effective. In fact, supplements can even be dangerous as they can lead you to take too much of a certain nutrient.

, Drinking enough water keeps your blood circulating and helps flush out internal toxins. There is little research to prove that toxins cause breakouts, but experts still recommend drinking plenty of water.To figure out how much water you should drink, divide your body weight in pounds in half. That’s how many ounces of water you should drink each day.
If you’re 150 pounds you should drink at least 75 ounces of water each day — more if you live in a hot climate or have an active lifestyle.

, Keeping the skin clear of sweat and oil will help reduce the chances of acne developing. If you have oily skin, you need to shower every day. You should also be sure to always wear clean clothes.If you can’t shower immediately after sweating, give your skin a swipe with some rubbing alcohol or other cleansing agent, and put on a clean, dry shirt.Wearing the same shirt twice could make you more likely to break out. Even if the shirt doesn’t smell bad or look dirty, it could still have old skin cells, oils, and bacteria in it from the last time you wore it.

, Dermatologists offer back facials and light peels that can help with acne. These can be done once a month until your skin clears up.If you have acne you might want to avoid exfoliating your skin, as this can cause the acne to spread to other areas of your back. The friction of exfoliation or scrubbing can also irritate the skin and cause acne to become worse.If your skin is just dry and a little dull, with few to no breakouts, you can exfoliate a few times a week to reveal smoother, glowing skin. Just be sure to follow it up with a moisturizer., This is only recommended for people who have severe acne. Be sure to do this only under the supervision of a medical professional.Remember that sun can cause enormous damage to the skin, including wrinkles, freckles, and skin cancer, so this really is only a last resort after you’ve tried everything else. Again, do this under the supervision of a medical professional.
In general, sun will actually make your skin worse, so protect your skin by using sunscreen (non-comedogenic if you have acne) whenever you’re out in the sun., If you are really struggling to get rid of your bacne (back acne), you may want to try seeing a doctor. There are different types of bacne, and not all of them can be treated in the same way.


A common type of acne that occurs on the back is called pityrosporum folliculitis. It has a different cause than the more well-known acne vulgaris, meaning it needs a different cure.Pityrosporum folliculitis is caused by yeast, so the way to treat it is to starve the yeast in your body, and use medications and skin treatments that target yeast specifically."

Stay hydrated.,
Consider supplements.",How to Get an Athletic Body2," Our brain and central nervous system require carbs to work properly. Eliminating carbs entirely will make you feel cranky, tired, and lethargic. You should eat the right amount of carbs first thing in the morning and after a workout.Get 45 to 65 percent of your daily calories from carbohydrates from whole grains, beans and legumes, and fruits and vegetables., Soluble fiber helps to improve your cholesterol and blood sugar levels. Good sources include oats, dried beans, apples, and oranges. Insoluble fiber helps to prevent constipation. Try eating more vegetables and whole grain to add more insoluble fiber to your diet. Women need 22 to 28 grams of fiber a day. Men need 28 to 34 grams of fiber a day., You need protein to grow and develop. Protein provides your body with calories and energy. 10 to 35 percent of your daily calories should be from protein. There are great protein options from both plant and animals. Foods high in protein from plant sources include beans, lentils, soy products and unsalted nuts. Meat, poultry, and dairy are good sources of protein from animals and should be lean or low fat., Fat has a lot of calories, which can lead to weight gain. Some types of fats do increase your risk of heart disease and other health problems. However, fats also help your body absorb vitamins, keep your immune system functioning and maintain cell membranes’ structure and function. All sources of fat should be kept to 20 to 35 percent of your daily calories. It’s important to focus on unsaturated fats from foods like lean poultry, fish, and healthy oils like olive, canola, and nut oils., Your body’s water supply needs to be replenished in order for it to function properly. Men need about 13 cups of water (3 liters) and women need about 9 cups of water (2.2 liters) a day.You’ll want to drink water before, during and after your workout. You’ll need to drink extra water when you exercise because you will lose more fluid when you sweat. An extra 1.5 to 2.5 cups (400 to 600 milliliters of water) is recommended for short periods of exercise under an hour. How much you need will vary depending on how much you sweat during exercise, how long, and the type of exercise, so adjust accordingly., Supplements can help optimize your well-balanced diet.


Supplements can be used once a well-structured diet is formed. Some popular ones for those looking for an athletic build include creatine, glycerol and glucosamine sulfate. Creatine is a substance that occurs naturally in our bodies. Used as a supplement, creatine that leads to improved strength and power. Glycerol is a supplement that keeps you hydrated for longer for better performance. Glucosamine sulfate helps to re-build cartilage and prevent joint problems.You should eat smaller amounts of protein throughout the day to make the most of its muscle-building and repairing abilities. Supplements like protein shakes and bars can be good sources of protein in-between meals. Make sure to eat protein-rich snack during the 30 minutes that follow your workout so you can optimize the amino acids."

Replace “I won’t” with “I will.” “I will do another 5 reps.” “I will complete an extra set.”

, It’s easy to let excuses stand in the way of your fitness. Common excuses include:


”It’s raining.” Don’t let bad weather stop you from continuing your workouts. Keep your exercise regime on track by exercising indoors.”I’m too tired.” It is important to allow your body time to recover. However, often times, you may just be feeling lazy. You want to stay in the habit of working out. It’s okay if you can’t give 100% every time you go to the gym. A workout that didn’t happen at all is the only bad type of workout., Make a fitness commitment to yourself by keeping up healthy habits.


Healthy habits can include exercising at the same time each day, making thoughtful dietary decisions, and being patient with yourself. Results take time, and it’s important to not give up."

Be Confident.",How to Look Skinnier or Thinner for an Event," This can be achieved by laying outside in the summertime (free), going to an indoor tanning bed ($3-$10 at a salon), getting a professional spray tan (recommended...about $25 at a tanning salon) or a do-it-yourself instant tan from home ($10 - $20 available at Walmart type stores).


Having a tanned body and face instantly slims, because the darker tone of your skin makes flaws and imperfections go unnoticed.





;
, Whatever you're trying to hide...arms, belly, back fat, or simply everything, a nice fitting black top will be so flattering every single time.

,, They are undergarments that instead of just going to your hips like regular underwear, they go all the way up to right below your breasts. They're made out of stretchy and compressing fabric, so it holds in all of your flab, rolls and extra inches. You can basically buy these anywhere they sell clothes. They can range in price from anywhere from $9 to $200, depending on the quality of the item.

, They instantly elongate your legs and make your butt, hips, and thighs just look generally smaller. Make sure you find a pair of jeans that FITS. I know that sounds like a simple tip, but so many women don't know how to do that. Try to find jeans that cover up your love-handles and are long enough to cover up your shoes. High water pants are never flattering on heavy people. However, appropriate capri pants (whether its your dark jeans rolled up, or real capris) are very flattering. Know the difference.

, Lifting and separating the girls makes your waist look smaller, because it creates a difference between your torso and your breasts. Think about it, when your breasts are hanging down and creating volume in your mid section, they can be confused with being a bulky top half. Get a good bra that really shows them off and makes them look their best! Remember: If you got it, flaunt it!

, Play it up with glamorous make-up! Are you the kind of girl who believes that her hair is her glory? Go get some fabulous highlights and a great new hair cut! Do you think you have some weight to lose, but your arms are always toned and sexy? Go for a sleeveless top! If you're not sure if you have a favorite body part that you want to show off, then do little things for yourself like buying a great smelling perfume, whitening your teeth, or paint your fingernails a shiny shade. All of these little things will take people's minds OFF of the weight and on to your best assets.

, Throwing your shoulders back, sticking your boobs out, and sucking your belly in will make you look taller, leaner, and more confident. Practice walking around your house like that and it will soon come naturally.

, The small shoes will only make your legs look way bigger then they actually are. Instead, opt for a nice open toed chunky heel.

, Carry a big purse, have big sunglasses, wear a big necklace...all of these things make you look more proportioned to your accessories.

, Walk in there like you own the place, and you are ready to blow them away. If you have that kind of confidence, others will feel the same way about you. When was the last time you saw a meek and scared woman in the corner hunched over and thought to yourself ""Wow...who's that girl???"" That;s right. Never.

Experiment.",How to Put Together Outfits," A lot of times when we don't know what to wear or how to put together an outfit it means that it is time to organize our closet. Organizing means it will be easier to locate the clothes you want for the outfits you'll be putting together and it will remind you what you own in way of clothing.


Get rid of anything you almost never wear. There is no point in keeping around something you wear only once or twice. Make space for the items you will wear. Make a rule for yourself: every 6 months clean out your wardrobe. The stuff you just can't throw away, put in storage and if in the next 6 months you haven't looked for it, to charity or friends it has to go.
When you're organizing you want to make sure that you will have easy access to your clothes. An easy way of organizing them is by item, so all the t-shirts together, all the sweaters together, all the dresses together, and so on. It makes it easier to find them when you know where the items of clothing will be. And if you organize them by color it's a win-win situation for you.;
, You'll need a few basic tops that are the foundation of your wardrobe. These tops should be versatile and trend-proof. It's best for your basic wardrobe components to be in neutral colors like black, navy blue, white, and ivory so that you can mix and match them easily. The best is to stick to more classical designs than to follow every season trend. Get a scarf or some jewelry that represents the season. Accessories can be an easy and cheap way to make the same outfit look different every day of the week. Casual tops: these are tops like short and long sleeve t-shirts, camisoles and tank tops (which are particularly good for under sweaters). Invest in good quality and simple colors.
A few dressy blouses. Blouses can be worn under blazers, or button-down cardigans. They can give a good bit of class to an outfit. Wear them with jeans, with a skirt and boots, or with jewelry.
You'll want to add some sweaters, button-down cardigans, or pullovers in neutral colors to wear with your casual tops and blouses. They are really good for layering purposes, especially if you live in a climate that runs warm and cold on the same day. Simply dress up as an ""onion"", in layers: t-shirt, blouse, light cardigan, scarf, jacket, etc.
Good basic jackets to have are a plain black leather jacket, a neutral peacoat, a lightweight neutral trench coat, and a blazer. Blazers especially can be worn on their own in a mild, spring-type weather or they can be worn with something like a peacoat. (A peacoat is a rough woolen jacket that has a row of buttons on either side, but only buttons on one side. You can sometimes see them on doormen for hotels.)

, These are the jeans and trousers and skirts that make up the basis of what you'll wear with the tops. Again, you'll want to go for neutral colors and styles that won't change with every fashion.


Trousers: you'll want a couple pairs of jeans (a basic pair that you can dress up or down, and a casual pair that's for down house projects and lounging around), some neutral dressier trousers. For colder areas, a thick tweed is a good fabric for dressier trousers. It's best to choose straight or boot-cut jeans in dark blue, works perfect with pumps or heels when you need a casual outfit. Every wardrobe must have black tailored trousers. You will wear them more than you think.
Skirts: having a tailored skirt and a casual skirt is good for your wardrobe. There are nice pencil skirts and more fitted skirts which are 'tailored' skirts, or the more floaty, knee-length spring skirts that are good for your more casual needs. If you have a pear-shaped figure, invest in an A-line, tailored skirt; it will compliment your figure and will work with nearly every sweater, blouse or jacket. It will look good with pumps or boots too.
Dresses: having some basic, neutral dresses can be a good basis for any outfit. The reason the little black dress is such a closet staple is because it is so versatile. You can dress it up or down and black, of course, goes with everything. If you're not into black, find a simple dress in navy, white, or ivory. Black dresses comes in so many different styles and shapes that once you find the right one it will become your second skin. Even for summer dresses you can stick with same style dress just in brighter colors. It's handy to find a good tailor to make needed alterations so you can have the best dresses possible.

, Accessories especially can add an individual element to your wardrobe without overwhelming you. Belts, jewelry, handbags, scarves and hosiery are great in neutral colors as well as funkier, brighter styles. A bright scarf with a black t-shirt and fitted jeans can be a fun, easy outfit. You don't have to invest a lot but you will still look great and stylish.


Handbags: if you have a specific color palate, (like you tend to wear greens and blues and grays) grab a handbag in a complimentary color (like a mustard yellow, or gold), to add a little spice to your ensemble. Make sure that your handbag is functional too. A good idea is to have one main bag that you use everyday (one in neutral colors so that it goes with your different outfits) and a range of bags that you use for more specific occasions, like going to a concert, or going out to a fancy restaurant.
Jewelry: jewelry is very much according to individual preference. You'll need to figure out what you like and work with that. Maybe you prefer chunkier, geometric jewelry, or pearls. Jewelry can be used as a highlight to your outfit, or can be the highlight of your outfit depending on what your specific style.
Belts: the best basic kinds of belts are wide and skinny belts. If you get them in neutral or complimentary to your wardrobe colors they can make a great addition. Wide belts especially look good on just about everyone as long as you find the right size. If your outfit is looking boring slip on a skinny belt to add a little fun.
Scarves: these are both functional (they can be warm and cozy) and great fashion statements. Getting a few neutral scarves is a great idea, but you can also mix it up with patterns you like and bright colors.
Hosiery: these include tights, leggings, and socks. Get some sheer black or nude tights to wear with skirts and dresses. Get leggings in neutral colors and get socks that go with your shoes (wearing black socks with white flats, for instance, can look a little weird). You can also get some fun hosiery like sparkly silver tights, or galaxy leggings. You could wear them with your little black dress, a nice cardigan and some exciting earrings.

, Shoes are really important to make a fun and comfortable outfit. You'll need a few different styles of basic footwear in your closet to draw from when creating outfits. Different shoes go better with different items of clothing. Something to remember, light colored shoes (especially white ones) can get dirty really fast, so make sure you consider that when picking your shoe color! You should have a pair of classic high heels ( black for winter, fall time and beige for summer, some basic pumps and boots).


Flats are great with jeans, with skirts, and dresses. They can be dressy or not depending on the occasions. It's good to have at least one neutral pair (again; neutral colors are good!) and a few that are more exciting, like patent red leather, or shiny silver.
Boots, especially in colder places, are very important. You can get some casual black or gray boots, or some fancy heeled ones that you can couple with jeans or a dress. Ankle boots are really good with skinny jeans and with skirts.
Casual sneakers for those casual jeans that you have. You can wear these out and about with skirts or use them when you go on a really nice long walk. They're comfortable and you can do housework or yard work in them (you don't want to get your nice things dirty).

, These are pieces that are very individual to you. They can be jewelry, hosiery, shoes, scarves, or all of the above. These types of pieces brighten up an otherwise neutral outfit and make it more exciting and more individual.


For instance, you could have a brightly colored floral dress that you could wear with black leggings, knee-high black boots, a green cardigan (to match the stems of the flowers on the dress) and a grey scarf. Or you cold get really bold and wear the dress with crimson pumps.
Another example could be a royal purple blouse that you wear with jeans, to dress it down, or with a black pencil skirt and grey boots.

, A good way to make putting your outfit together easier is to pick one item and craft the entire outfit around that item. Usually the specific item is one of the statement pieces, but it doesn't have to be.Example: If you're looking to showcase a big gorgeous necklace, wear a plain, neutral t-shirt with a neck that's cut so that the necklace can be seen. Pair this with jeans and a pair of flats. This way the necklace acts as the most important part of the outfit with nothing to draw attention away from it.
You can also work an outfit around a specific color. So for instance, one week you could wear something red each day and make outfits around that color and the next week you could move on to green. For instance you could pair a red skirt with a black blouse, navy tights, black boots and blue jewelry.

, This means find the two or three basic ensembles you like to wear and put together outfits using these as bases, while you mix things up a little. These will be the outfits that you feel most comfortable in.For example, you could find that you tend towards an ensemble of skinny jeans (black and denim), a few different t-shirts (both long and short sleeve) with varying footwear (for instance, you could dress the outfit up with a pair of ankle boots or some flats). If you wear a lot of jeans you could mix things up a bit by rolling up the cuffs (a good spring or summer variation).
You could vary between jeans and a sweater and skirts and a sweater. This would give you more range. The color and type of sweater could change and you could vary it with different jewelry, scarves and shoes, but the basic outfit would either be jeans and sweater or skirt and sweater.

, Mixing and matching clothing is your basis for choosing different outfits each day. This way you don't have to wear the same t-shirt and jeans routine that you always do (although that's perfectly okay if that's what you like).Using a black blazer as an example: you could put the blazer with jeans, a white t-shirt, a bright blouse and flats. You could pair the blazer with a pale spring skirt, ankle boots and chunky jewelry. Or you could put the blazer over a long, colorful summer dress and wear sandals.
With only 8 different pieces of clothing you can make a variety of outfits. Pick a solid colored and a print t-shirt, a pair of jeans, a skirt, a dress, a cardigan, a blouse, and a vest. You could wear the print t-shirt with the jeans and the vest and a pair of sandals. You could wear the dress, the cardigan and a skinny belt, or the dress, the vest and a pair of boots. You could pair the skirt with each of the tops in turn and wear either the vest or the cardigan over them. Pair with jewelry, a scarf, and a shoes.

, You can change your wardrobe around as the seasons change (if you live in a place where that happens). Save the warmer scarves and sweaters for fall and winter along with your warmer jackets.


Have boots work as your cool weather footwear, while flats and sandals can be your warmer weather go-tos.
Colors, too, can change depending on the season. In warmer parts of the wear you could wear paler colors to keep you cooler and more floral prints to reflect the flowers. In winter it's fun to wear some brighter colors especially if you live in a dark or rainy place, so that your bright gold scarf or red dress brings a flare of color to an otherwise drably colored day.

, As you try out outfits, mixing and matching and determining what your base style is, take pictures, or write down a description, of each outfit. This way you can remember what worked and what didn't, so that you either recreate the outfit, or you can remember that that particular outfit didn't work.


This can also help you decide what to wear if you're feeling unsure. Just go back through your outfit photos and pick the one you liked the best. You'll feel confident because you know it looks good and your decision will have been made.

, Look everywhere for outfit ideas. Look at mannequins in store windows, look a catalogs and fashion magazines, look at what people are wearing as you're out and about. These will give you ideas for what you can try out.


You don't have to go out and buy all new things based on an outfit you saw in a magazine or on the street. Instead, go through your wardrobe and see what clothing you already own that you can use to recreate the look. This way you won't be copying exactly, you'll be putting your own style onto it.

, This is the most important part of putting together outfits and especially in getting good at it. You have to try out different styles and clothes and outfits before you find the ones that you really like.


Only re-wear the outfits that you liked and that you felt comfortable and confident in. Comfort and confidence are the keys to looking good.

Make sure you are a pear shape as they can commonly be confused with the skittle or bell shape.,
FINDING THE RIGHT JEANS: Pear shape figures tend to have wide hips and full legs which curve down to the knee.,
TOPS/T-SHIRTS: First things first, get a well padded bra, preferably push up - it'll balance between your upper and lower body a bit more if that's what you need.,
SKIRTS: Most will work with your shape - but I'd say the best are from just above the knee to mid thigh length.,
COATS AND JACKETS: Anything that's belted.,
PROM DRESSES AND RELATED STUFF: I'd say the best are the ones that gather underbust, and follow your body shape to the top of your hips and then moves out for a loose bottom.,
HAIRSTYLE: I know, it's a weird thing to mention in relation to body shape, but a fuller hairstyle with more volume can help to keep the balance between your lower and upper body.",How to Flatter a Pear Shaped Figure,";
, To flatter this, I would recommend wide legs and boot cut, as they will follow this shape to the knee and balance it below. Flare legged jeans will actually accentuate the hips, as it narrows at the knee and makes the hips look bigger by comparison. Just make sure they're not too tight, so that the material isn't stretched and they don't make your bottom stick out (they'll also be more comfortable). When it comes to colour, I'd say dark blue is the best, along with grey and black. That way people are likely to notice your lovely shape without thinking ""she's trying to draw attention to herself"". Light blue and white jeans are especially bad for that, as they are bright and attract attention.

, Next, I'd say pick a t-shirt the right length -finishes two or three inches below the top of your trousers/skirt. Anything with ""cape"" type sleeves, or batwing sleeves, are good, as they can make your shoulders seem wider/stronger and provide balance to you hips. Make sure that it fits closer around the waist, as in pear shapes this is usually well defined and narrower than the rest of your body. Be sure to get one that's not too big - they can miss the waist out and create the impression that you are triangular. Blouses work with most shapes to be honest, but one of the best ways to wear them casually is with puffy sleeves (again, they create the illusion of wider shoulders) buttoned just up to the bust with a low necked t-shirt or vest top underneath, which creates the impression of a fuller bust. Any colour or pattern should work well. I'd also recommend tunic style tops that gather at the waist, and belted tops so you can control how much you emphasize your waist.

, This way you can show off your legs without over-emphasizing your thighs. Style wise, I'd suggest floaty/loose or straight cut, as these also don't over-emphasize your thighs and hips. Again, any style and colour that you like will work.

, This way you can avoid the possible triangle effect and flaunt your waist at the same time. Also, I'd say that long coats, finishing between mid-thighs and knees tend to look lovely.

, Similar style for day dresses but I'd advise against one made from t-shirt material as they have a habit of clinging to you.

, Try curls or beach waves to improve the volume of your hair further.

Wear trouser jeans if you’ve got an apple shape.,
Go with skinny flares if you’ve got an hourglass figure.,
Get stretch denim with long inseams if you’re pear shaped.,
Create curves with flares if you have an athletic shape.,
Wear boyfriend jeans if you have a boyish, supermodel-like shape.,
Wear low-rise jeans to balance out long legs.,
Elongate petite legs with high-waisted super skinny jeans.",How to Find the Perfect Jeans for You1," If your upper body is curvier than your lower body, opt for a trouser jean style. This style has a wider leg from hip to foot, which will help create proportionality.

As another option, you can pair skinny jeans with a flowy top to create balance.
Wear low rise jeans if you’re slimmer and want to create curve, and wear high rise if you’re a curvier apple shape.;
, If your bust and hips are similar in diameter and you’ve got a more narrow waist, skinny flare jeans will hug your curves, accentuate your shape, and add a sense of balance.High rise skinny flares will start right at the narrowest part of your waistline, which will enhance your slim middle.
Get jeans with medium-sized back pockets to best complement your backside.

, If you’re more curvy on the bottom than the top, get stretchy jeans with long inseams to give yourself a sleek silhouette and to seemingly elongate your legs.

Opt for either bootcut or wide flares to create balance.
Eliminate your muffin top with high rises., When you have a toned, athletic body, it looks great to add some curve to your thighs and backside. Try wearing a pair of flair jeans or bootcut jeans to create a nice silhouette and bring out your subtle curves., A slimmer-fitting boyfriend jean will look great on those with longer legs and straighter hips. Skinny jeans and skinny flares also enhance this body type, but make sure they fit snug around your thighs and behind.

Longer inseams will give you a sleek, clean look., If you’ve got longer legs and want to create balance with the upper half of your body, wearing low rises will create the illusion of a longer torso. To show off your long legs, do the opposite and wear high rises instead., Super skinny jeans will accentuate your tiny figure while the high-waist will create the illusion of length. Avoid wearing baggy jeans; this will drown out and cover up your small frame.

Try pairing your jeans with a heeled wedge to make your legs look even longer."

Wear white and cream together.,
Combine pink and red to project a sense of fun and brightness.,
Wear brown and black together.,
Try blue and green together.",How to Wear Colors That Tradition Dictates Should Not Be Seen Together," The tradition says to avoid this mixture but careful combining can make it a stunning color set. The trick to pulling off this one is to choose a cream that is obviously cream so that it doesn't appear to be ""dirty white"". Another way to ensure that this look works is to wear clothing that is textured, patterned, or of a very unusual cut.;
, This is probably the most well known color fashion no-no of them all and that makes it the most fun to break. To make this one work, tone down one color and allow the other one to dominate. For example, pale pink and bold red will work well together, whereas hot pink and bold red wouldn't.


Use accessories in the contrasting color when first experimenting with this color change. Let it grow on you gradually.

, To avoid appearing too somber, avoid darker shades of brown that will be lost too easily in the black. The brown shades that go beautifully against black include tan, beige, cognac, and camel.

, Blue and green should never be seen? As with red and pink, the trick is to ensure that one color does not overwhelm the other. Try a dark blue with an emerald green contrast and see how it works on you.

Go with chinos for versatility.,
Wear a cargo style for a casual look.,
Choose olive green for an accessible look.,
Opt for a slim fit to look work-ready.,
Make a statement with a bright green pair.",How to Wear Green Pants1," Chinos can be easily dressed up or down, making a statement color like green much easier to introduce into your wardrobe. Pair olive green chinos with a neutral-colored button-down shirt to create an office-ready look. Try a deep forest green pair with rugged boots and a plaid flannel button-down for a more casual style., Army green cargo pants are versatile when you’re going specifically for a casual look. Create a laid-back vibe by pairing green cargo pants in a relaxed fit with a loosely tucked in button-down. Sport loose-fitting faded cargos and a white v-neck t-shirt when running errands or hanging out casually with friends.Avoid cargo styles if you’re headed to the office or an upscale event.
To keep green cargo pants from looking sloppy, pair them with simple silhouettes and neutral colors.

, Olive is the easiest shade of green to wear, since the color is neutral and muted. You’ll probably get the most mileage out of an olive green pair, as well, since they tend to match with more items in your wardrobe. Olive green can look quite dressy and also very casual, so you can get a lot of different looks if you go with this shade of green.If you like to tailor your clothes to the seasons, create a great Fall look by pairing olive green pants with other jewel tones, such as burgundy, royal blue and pumpkin.

, Green pants can definitely work in an office setting, but the right fit is key. Avoid loose fitting green pants and opt for a streamlined pair with a slim fit. Try deep green skinny jeans or slim fitting khakis to create polished looks that are office-ready.When wearing green pants in a work atmosphere, the other pieces should also be slim fitting or, at the very least, not baggy. Go with fitted blazers and dress shirts.

, Dark and olive green pants are typically understated, but if you want to make a splash, try a bright grass or emerald green hue. To keep from looking too kitschy, pair bright green pants with a neutral colored t-shirt or simple button-down. It’s difficult to pull off bright green in an office setting, so save these for casual days."

Wear straight leg low-rises if you’re slimmer.,
Try slim fit, straight leg, or bootcut if you have an athletic build.,
Go for a relaxed fit with a wider leg if you’re muscular.,
Wear loose and relaxed jeans if you have wide hips or a large waist.",How to Find the Perfect Jeans for You2," If overall, you have leaner muscles, a flatter chest, and are relatively narrow, then straight leg low rises will give you the perfect amount of roominess.

Wide leg or baggy jeans will look too loose.
High rises may make your backside look flat., Men with a slim waist, muscular legs, and a muscular backside look best in any of these styles with a low rise.

Baggy jeans will hide your muscular legs.
Relaxed fit jeans will make your lower half look bigger than your upper half., Stocky men who frequent the gym fit relaxed fit with large deep pockets best. This jean style is just the right amount of snug, and does a good job of accentuating muscular legs without looking too tight.

Bootcut jeans will make you look wider than you actually are.
Skinny jeans will be extremely tight on your legs and backside., If you’re a little wider around your hips or your midsection, loose or relaxed fit jeans will create balance by adding some volume to the lower half of your body.

Avoid skinny jeans and low rise jeans."

Pick out a range of brands and styles to take into the dressing room.,
Pick washes and details that match the jean’s purpose.,
Move around the dressing room with the jeans on.,
Check the price tag.",How to Find the Perfect Jeans for You3," Different designers size their jeans in different ways, which means that your size may fluctuate between brands.

One pair of flare jeans may only flare out a little, while another pair from a separate designer may flare out a great deal.








, Try on as much as you can and study yourself in the dressing room mirror to get a thorough idea of what reflects your personal style and flatters you most.








, Think about where you normally like to go and what you normally want to do. Are you more active in your jeans? Do you only wear jeans with a pair of ankle boots and a fancy top? Do you constantly alternate between dressing up and dressing down your jeans? Consider where you wear your jeans and what you typically do while you’re wearing them to decide which styles to gravitate towards.









If you’re a female beach bum then you might get a lot of use out of a pair of light wash distressed jeans.

Stick to neutral colored pieces.,
Wear feminine pieces with green cargo pants for a military twist.,
Pair olive green pants with jewel-toned clothing.,
Keep things simple when you’re wearing bright green pants.",How to Wear Green Pants2," Even an understated hue like olive green can look a bit loud if paired with bright colors. When choosing a shirt and/or jacket, opt for neutral colors like navy blue, bright white, black and various shades of gray. These colors tend to work well with green pants, regardless of where they fall on the color spectrum.Avoid bright graphic t-shirts and busy patterns when wearing green pants.
For instance, try a pair of olive green skinny jeans with a black v-neck t-shirt and simple black sneakers.

, Cargo pants typically create a casual, no-frills vibe, but pairing them with pieces that are dressy and feminine can make for an eye-catching contrast. Wear army green pants with a light pink top for a trendy street-ready look. Choose pieces with delicate details, like lace or fringe, to emphasize the juxtaposition even more.For example, forest green skinny jeans would work well with a scalloped black top with lace embellishments.

, A muted shade of olive green works well with jewel tones like burgundy, deep blue and ginger, especially when you’re going for a Fall-inspired color palette. Wear olive green chinos with a deep blue blazer and burgundy scarf for an office-ready look.For a more casual outfit, try a deep blue v-neck sweater with a jewel-toned plaid button down underneath it. The visible plaid collar will provide a pop of understated color.

, If you’re wearing pants in a lighter or brighter shade of green, those should be the focal point of your entire outfit. Choose simple pieces with clean lines, such as button-downs and t-shirts, to go along with your pants. Something dark, like a black shirt, can temper the brightness of the green and make the overall look more accessible.


Avoid creating multiple layers and mixing different textures in the same outfit, since those extra details will clash with the bright green.

Choose black or brown shoes in sleek styles for dressy ensembles.,
Create an interesting contrast by pairing heels with green cargos.,
Inject a pop of color with a bright scarf or bag.,
Offset olive green pants with simple gold jewelry.",How to Wear Green Pants3," Green works well with dark neutrals like black and brown.

For example, olive green chinos with a deep blue blazer and brown leather dress shoes is an office-ready look.A pair of black peep toe booties can instantly jazz up a casual outfit built around green pants., Balance a pair of loose-fitting cargos with a pair of heels in a dark neutral like black. Heeled ankle boots in a rugged color like brown can look great with casual green cargos.For an even more interesting juxtaposition, choose heels with intricate details, like strappy pumps.


If heels aren't your thing, try lace-up ballet flats.

, An outfit built around a muted color like olive green can look great with a well-placed pop of color. Go for jewel tones, which pair well with green. For instance, you could toss on a wine-colored scarf or carry a royal blue handbag to spice up an understated outfit. For something more eye-catching, mix in an unexpected color, like a light pink handbag., When wearing green pants, its best to keep your other pieces simple, including jewelry. However, a sophisticated piece, like a gold watch or hammered bracelet, can be an excellent finishing touch on an outfit featuring olive green pants. The gold works well with that shade, and can provide a little polish to a casual outfit."

Go neon.,
Stand out in a red jacket.,
Opt for shades of yellow.,
Mix it up.",How to Wear Bright Colors in Winter1," If you love bright colors, consider a coat or jacket in a neon color, such as bright pink or electric blue. Make sure the rest of your outfit consists of mostly dark neutral pieces, which will balance out the loudness of the neon and keep the overall effect winter-appropriate.


For instance, you could pair a neon pink coat with black skinny jeans and a simple black and white striped top.Wear a neon green pea coat with basic blue jeans, a black sweater and statement heels.;
, Choose a crimson coat in your favorite style and wear it with solid neutrals for a polished look that still pops. For instance, you could wear a cherry red pea coat with an outfit centered around navy blue. The navy helps to temper the brightness of the red, while the red gives the blue tones warmth and life.For a more retro flair, consider wearing a dress or top with black and white polka dots with a cherry red jacket.You could also try wearing a red leather jacket with all black pieces. The red leather looks edgy, and the black keeps everything polished.

, A yellow winter coat can look great if paired with the right outfit. The shade of yellow is up to you – bright yellow works well, but a more muted mustard hue can also look sharp. The key to wearing yellow in winter is making sure the rest of your outfit is neutral.


For example, wear a long trench coat in a middle-range yellow color with sleek black garments and shoes.Black is the easiest neutral to pull off with yellow, but you could try charcoal gray or forest green, too., You don’t have to wear a statement coat that is one solid bright color. You can still make just as much of a splash if you go with a coat that is mostly neutral in color, but features bright detailing. For instance, you could wear a deep blue felt biker jacket with a faux fur color in an eye catching color like bright orange. Against the dark blue, the orange really pops.Consider coats that play with color-blocking, as well. This style makes it easy to work a few bright colors into a sophisticated geometric pattern that is mostly neutral.

Add a bright sweater or cardigan.,
Work red into your outfit.,
Layer orange and black pieces.,
Try a monochrome approach.",How to Wear Bright Colors in Winter2," Try wearing black pants and a charcoal gray long-sleeved tee, then adding a bright blue or red cardigan on top. Layering a dark neutral coat over the bright sweater adds another dimension and emphasizes the vivid color even more.


For example, you could wear an emerald green cardigan with dark-wash denim skinny jeans. Add a dark navy blue pea coat on top to add another dimension and emphasize the jewel green of the sweater.Instead of a sweater, try layering a bright green hoodie with a black tee, black yoga pants and black tennis shoes for a winter workout., Red can easily be pulled off in winter by layering charcoal gray and black around it. For example, you could wear a pair of wine red corduroys with a deep gray t-shirt featuring a graphic or logo in that same red shade. Layer a black jacket over that and add a pair of sleek black boots to finish the look., Even bright orange can be pulled off in winter if you style it with sleek black counterparts. For example, wear black tights under an orange dress, then top it off with a black cardigan. Add a pair of black booties and cat eye sunglasses to complete the look., A monochrome approach allows you to wear one color in a range of shades, which means you get to include both the darker neutral shades and their lighter, brighter counterparts. Try shades of violet, for instance. A deep royal purple is very taste tasteful and neutral, so center an outfit around that. Layer a royal purple skirt with splashes of lighter purple, such as a bright purple top and a lavender cardigan."
"
Choose a bright purse or bag.,
Wear a statement scarf for a pop of color.,
Wear statement shoes in an eye catching hue.,
Wear bright nail polish.",How to Wear Bright Colors in Winter3," Accenting a neutral outfit with a vibrant purse or bag is another easy way to spice things up a bit. Since the accent will immediately draw eyes to it, choose a purse or bag that has interesting or unusual details. For example, you could pair an electric blue purse with quilted details and silver accents with a neutral outfit.You could also show off a bright pink or green backpack by wearing it with dark black and charcoal pieces.

, Toss a fuzzy red scarf over your outfit to instantly liven things up. You could even look for one with unusual detailing, such as red faux fur trim, to make even more of a statement. Don’t be afraid to try bright stripes or other patterns, as well.


For example, you could wear a neon striped scarf with a black coat and dark neutral solids to emphasize the bright pattern even more.

, Try pairing a pair of red leather booties with black skinny jeans and a black leather biker jacket for an edgy look. Combat boots come in a rainbow of colors, as well. Go for an electric blue pair and wear them with black or dark gray pants to emphasize them.

, If you’re feeling uninspired by your winter wardrobe and need a quick fix, try experimenting with a range of bright nail polish looks. Go for a bright blue, a glittery violet, or a metallic shade to accent an otherwise neutral outfit. Cherry red polish is a classic – pair it with a black outfit and matching red lip to create a glamourous retro vibe."

Try a black dress shirt with jeans for an easy business look.,
Consider wearing a black hat.",How to Wear Black," Affordable, everyday black clothing can make a striking impression. Black somehow makes casual outfits look ""put together."" Best of all, since most people wear these sorts of clothes often in their day-to-day lives, you'll be getting a good value out any clothes you end up using.



Examples: Black t-shirts, jeans, shorts, socks, skirts, belts, baseball caps, tennis shoes, etc.

Notes: Try to avoid a 100%-black outfit when you're wearing casual clothing. One-color outfits can make your features blend together, giving you a ""formless"" look. For instance, a black t-shirt looks great with blue or grey jeans, but if you're wearing it with black jeans, you might use a different-colored belt to break up the monotony.;
, Black is perfect if you're trying to make a ""bookish"" or ""artistic"" impression. Use a single eye-catching black accessory to lend a little artsy flair to outfit or wear a black academic-inspired outfit to show that you're busy pondering life's deeper questions.



Examples: Black turtlenecks, flannel shirts, older blazers, scarves, boots, glasses, jewelry, berets, accessories, makeup, etc.

Notes: Quirky and antique-style accessories go great with these types of outfits. For example, an out-of-fashion scarf from the 1970s suddenly looks deliberate and fashionable on an intellectual with a black beret at the coffee shop.

, When it comes to formal occasions, always bet on black. ""Nice"" black clothes are a great investment because they're appropriate for almost any formal get-together, from weddings to funerals. Black formal wear is stately, elegant, attractive, and respectful all at once — you'll never be sorry to wear it when you're enjoying the finer things in life.



Examples: Black suits, dresses, tuxedos, veils, earrings, ties, scarves, cufflinks, dress shirts, dress pants, leather shoes, high heels, etc.

, Believe it or not, there's some scientific truth to the old saying ""black is slimming."" Black outfits absorb light, rather than reflect it, so they tend to make it hard to see the wrinkles, lines, and shadows that ordinarily form on a person's clothes.This can give black outfits a slimmer, sleeker look than similar colored outfits, making them perfect for when you want to play up your lean, athletic features.



Examples: Yoga pants, athletic shorts, ballet tights, workout clothes, ""under armor,"" skinny jeans, tight leather jackets, etc.

Notes: The fit of these clothes plays a big role in how they make you look — a big, baggy black workout shirt won't have a slimming effect, for instance.

, From Green Day to The Cure, many important rock acts have used black clothing as part of their image. This sort of clothing usually gives the impression of ""defiance"" — in other words, you know you look like a punk, and you don't care one bit!



Examples: Black skinny jeans, band t-shirts, studded clothing, distressed jeans, fishnet stockings, ragged skirts, painted nails, makeup, etc.

Notes: If you're looking to go all-out, consider extreme options like dyed-black hairdos, nose piercings, and so on. However, keep in mind that these fashion choices can be bad choices for certain situations. For instance, it's never a good idea to go to a job interview dressed like you've just gotten back from a headbanging punk show.

, It's not just black clothes that go well with almost everything. Black accessories are very versatile as well and can be used to spice up a huge variety of outfits. Use black accessories to add a touch of class to casual multicolored clothes or match them with mostly-black outfits for a deliberate, put-together look — it's all up to you!



Examples: Black horn-rimmed glasses, leather purses, messenger bags, gloves, watches, jewelry, piercings, hair bands, etc.

, Not all black clothes are created equally — different black fabrics will have different textures that can affect the way they look and feel on you. Knowing these variations will allow you to experiment and create the ideal black outfit. See below for just a few fabrics commonly worn in black:



Cotton: Breathable and comfortable. Flat appearance. A good general fabric choice when it comes to black clothing. Unlike other shades, black cotton doesn't darken when wet.

Polyester: Less breathable, but resistant to wrinkling. Soft and smooth. Good for black casual wear.Silk: Smooth, shiny, sleek.In black, it looks luxurious, even decadent. Generally best for men to limit themselves to one silk item per outfit — women can sometimes get away with more.

Leather: Strong and tough. Can be flat or shiny depending on the finish. In black, it can give a tough ""biker"" look or a sleek, ""clean"" one, depending on the fit and the smoothness of the leather.

, Understanding the idea of contrast is important when putting together a black outfit. When you're wearing mostly black, anything that isn't black will stick out visually and will naturally attract the eye. For this reason, it's a good idea to wear colored clothing and accessories near features that you want to show off — other people's eyes will spend a lot of time looking here.


Keep in mind also that, depending on your skin tone, exposed skin may also create this contrast. Use this to your advantage by making areas of contrast next to skin you want people to look at. For example, if you want people to look at your beautiful face, a black turtleneck that ends sharply below your jawline is a great idea.

, A completely uniform black outfit can be quite striking, but it's not your only option. Try using fabrics with patterns that incorporate black to add contrast and variation to your look. The black used in the pattern will automatically go with whatever other black clothes you're wearing, allowing you to maintain the black ""theme"" of your outfit without committing to a single color.


There are many different patterns that will work here. Polka dots, floral designs, plaid, pinstripes and more are all available in styles that incorporate the color black, giving you many different fashion choices.

, Another way to add visual contrast to a black outfit is to play with its texture. This is a little more difficult than simply wearing different types of clothes, but it gives you a great opportunity to express your creativity. There are two ways to do this:



Use materials with different visual qualities. For example, wearing a suit made entirely out of shiny black silk can be a little overwhelming, but wearing a black silk shirt inside a flat black cotton blazer will create an interesting contrast and call attention to the center of your torso.

Use folds, seams, creases, ruffles, etc. For example, a sheer black can look amazing on its own, but if you want to spice it up, adding horizontal folds to the back can give a completely new look.

, This is perhaps one of the most famous women's fashions from the 20th century and it still looks just as great today. Black dresses come in many different styles. Some are pleated, others are draped, and still others are Jersey knit. However, the basic idea is always the same: you'll want to wear a somewhat form-fitting solid black dress with mostly black accessories. This look is simple, elegant, and easy to put together — a classic.


Here, you're actually trying to avoid creating too much contrast in your outfit. A few non-black accessories (especially jewelry and makeup) look great, but wearing too much color can dampen this outfit's striking effect.

, Anyone can look and feel like a movie star with this outfit. Wearing a metallic shirt or jacket over black pants creates a gorgeous visual contrast and calls attention to your upper half. This is also one of the rare outfits where a shiny metallic top won't look over-the-top, making it a great opportunity to wear clothes you normally wouldn't.


This outfit is a great hit at events with a ""glamorous"" theme, like Oscar parties.

, Transparent, lacy wraps aren't a common choice in today's fashion landscape, but they're the perfect ""cherry on top"" of a semi-formal ensemble. Try throwing them on top of colored outfits to lend them a touch of seriousness or use them with a black coat for the perfect winter outfit. A pair of eyes peering out from behind a black scarf can be mysterious and enticing, so these accessories make a great choice for when you're in a flirty mood!

, Black jewelry (naturally) matches black outfits perfectly, but you can also use it with colorful, casual outfits for a look that's fun and dignified at the same time. You have many choices when it comes to black pieces of jewelry, including black pearls, black studded earrings, and black stone necklaces, so be willing to experiment!


As a general rule, the simpler your outfit is, the more jewelry you can get away with wearing. Simple black outfits (like the little black dress above) can benefit from lots of jewelry because of the exciting contrast created. On the other hand, jewelry can ""get lost"" in more complicated outfits where there's already a lot to take in visually.

, Indiana Jones, the Fonz, James Dean — these paragons of masculinity all knew that there are few things manlier than good leather. Well-fitting black leather jackets look great on top of casual clothes like jeans and t-shirts, but they also pair well with more serious shirt-and-tie outfits. While good jackets can be expensive, they last forever when well-maintained (and if you don't want to spend the money, you can always look for bargains at thrift stores).


If you want them to stay looking great in the long term, leather jackets require a little basic care. See our leather jacket care article for detailed information.

, One outfit that uses black and is fairly popular today is the ""skater"" look. For this outfit, you'll want to stick to black t-shirts (bands and logo prints are great for variety) and grey or dark-colored skinny jeans. Actual skating skills are optional — some enjoy this fashion all by itself, much to the chagrin of true skaters.


Good choices for accessories include flat-billed baseball caps, puffy Vans sneakers, Chuck Taylor All-Stars, and colored or studded belts.

, Late to the office? This outfit is quick, easy, and suitable for most ""business casual"" dress codes. Best of all, since it's harder to see wrinkles on black fabric, you may not even need to iron your shirt!


If you're looking for something just slightly classier, try throwing on a tie and a set of cufflinks to turn this outfit from business casual to semi-formal.

, Wearing a black hat doesn't necessarily mean that you have to look like the bad guy in a Western movie — in fact, men have a huge variety of styles to choose from in terms of black hats. Just a few great choices are below:



Black baseball caps: Great for casual outfits when home and out and about. Unlike many black accessories, these won't make your outfit look more serious or dignified.

Black beanie or knit cap: Warm, comfortable, and simple. Complements winter jackets and scarves. A great choice whether you're on the ski slopes or the front porch.

Black beret: Fancy, intellectual, and artsy. Great for hipster-inspired outfits and intellectual looks. Can border on looking pretentious.

Black driving cap/kangol: Gives an old-school, refined look. Goes well with leather jacket or peacoat.

Black fedora: Quirky, old-fashioned. Best for novelty wearing at parties, ska concerts. Wide-brimmed varieties not recommended.

Try the petite section.,
Take a friend along.,
Try high-waisted bottoms.,
Go for vertical instead of horizontal stripes.,
Call the tailor after a shopping session.",How to Dress when You Are Short1," If you are short, you might find standard cuts of clothing do not fit you as well as they should. Try shopping in the petite section of your favorite online or brick and mortar store. Seek out stores and brands that specialize in clothing for shorter men and women. These cuts will likely fit you better than clothing manufactured for people who are not short., Taking a friend along on a shopping excursion means you’ll have an extra pair of eyes when deciding if a particular outfit or pair of shoes is a good fit for your short physique. Try asking a short friend whose style you admire to join you on your next shopping trip.

, High-waisted bottoms can add the illusion of height. You can opt for pants with a high waist. Or if skirts are your thing, try complementing your short figure with a high-waisted skirt., An outfit that incorporates vertical stripes can flatter a shorter figure. Horizontal stripes, on the other hand, can make a small figure appear wider than it is. Try wearing pants, dresses, or skirts with vertical lines., Sometimes shopping in the petite section is not an option. Other times you find a sport jacket or suit that is perfect for you, but whose sleeves or hems might need to be shortened. A tailor can take these new purchases and mold them to your short stature, making you look and feel fabulous."

Try a monochromatic outfit.,
Pair a high-waisted bottom with a tucked-in top.,
Wear vertical lines on the bottom with a solid color on top.,
Stay away from layering.",How to Dress when You Are Short2," Wearing one color from head to toe can flatter a shorter figure. Monochromatic outfits lengthen the appearance of your body. Try wearing a structured white top with a pair of fitted white pants. You can also create a monochromatic look by wearing the same print on both the top and bottom., One way to add height and flatter your short figure is by wearing a pair of pants, shorts, or skirt with a high waist. High-waisted bottoms can make your legs appear longer than they actually are. Try wearing a pair of high-waisted trousers with a top that easily tucks into the pants. You could also try a cropped top with a pair of high-waisted linen pants. Top off the look with flats, boots, or heels., Pants with vertical lines will beg the eye to look up and down, effectively lengthening your look. Try a pinstriped pant with a matching suit jacket. You can also go for a high-waisted pair of pants with a thick stripe for a bold look., When you are putting together an outfit, you do not want to overpower a small frame with multiple layered pieces. Instead of creating a multi-layered look, instead opt for a single layering piece like a sweater or vest – not both."
"
Go for nude shoes.,
Wear shoes that are the same color as your pants.,
Go for pointed-toe heels.,
Wear a pair of flat boots.,
Don’t overwhelm your look with accessories.",How to Dress when You Are Short3," Wearing shoes that match your skin tone can help create the illusion of longer legs. If you want to elongate your legs, opt for a pair of flats, sandals, or heels in your own skin tone. Pair them with shorts, a dress, or a skirt to create the appearance of long legs., You can elongate your look and flatter your petite figure by matching the color of your shoes and pants.

, Flat boots can complement a shorter physique. These boots can lengthen your legs, and even add inches to your height. Go for a pair with minimal hardware, as hardware can disrupt an otherwise elongated look. Try a pair of simple black or brown boots with flat soles., Stick to one or two statement accessories to complement your shoes and outfit. This will ensure you don’t overwhelm your figure. Try a statement necklace, a handbag that pops, or a pair of killer sunglasses. Or go for understated jewelry, like a simple necklace and coordinating ring.

Dress for a Pear Shaped Figure: The pear is the most common female body type.,
Dress for an Athletic Shape: The women with the athletic body types have a straight, well-defined, and toned figure.,
Dress for an Apple Shape: The apple seems to be the more challenging body type of the three to dress.",How to Dress Your Plus Size Body Type," You can call yourself a pear if your upper body is noticeably smaller than your lower body. If you were to gain five pounds, four of them would go to your hips and thighs. You may have a long or slender neck, sloping or narrow shoulders, narrow back, small to medium bust, defined waist or full calves. You definitely have very curvy hips, thighs and seat. As a pear you should always emphasize your face, neck, bust, waist and arms. You want to bring the eye up and broaden the shoulder line, which can be done by wearing wide neck colorful tops. Your upper body is your best asset, so wear semi-fitted and tailored plus size tops. Necklines like cowl necks and square necklines will help broaden your shoulders. You want to maintain focus above the waist so use flowing comfortable bottoms to elongate your lower half. Straight skirts are your friend and Maxi dresses look amazing on pear shapes.;
, They tend to have broad shoulders, toned arms, toned/flat stomach, square hips, and not much curve to them at all. Athletic shapes will have square silhouettes, no matter what their height, and will have a lower ratio of fat to muscle than body types like the apple or pear. With this type of figure you have to create an illusion of curves by wearing certain types of silhouettes and belts definitely help with that. Try wearing flowy plus size tops with sweet details like ruffles or lace that can enhance the bust line, or soften the shoulders. Cinch up a flowy top or dress with a trendy belt to add a waistline. Choose a tulip or bubble style skirt or dress to play up your hips and toned thighs. If your hips are on the wider side choose a skirt or dress that has details along the hemline that will balance your curves and draw the eyes to another area.

, It also is one of the easiest body types to camouflaging your problem areas. Apples generally will have fuller breasts with a wide back, slim arms while your shoulders could be wide, slim hips and a trim backside, and they generally gain weight in the midsection. Basically if you are an apple your upper body is larger than your lower half. As an apple having slim arms and legs, can be used to your advantage. You can look slimmer and more shapely when fitted with the proper figure flattering silhouette. For tops try to pick styles with an empire waist that begins under the bust to draw attention away from the stomach. Also, plus size tops with a deep v-neck are great on apples and work to keep the eyes moving upward. Because apples are more top heavy you want to choose plus size dresses or skirts with a fuller silhouette and try for styles that come up to your natural waistline to hide a larger stomach.

Pull your hair away from your face.,
Get your materials together.,
Draw your face.,
Determine your face dimensions.,
Know the round face.,
Understand the heart shaped face.,
Interpret the oval face.,
Recognize the square shaped face.,
Know the oblong face.,
Understand the diamond shaped face.",How to Figure out Your Face Shape," To truly see the shape of your face, you need to pull your hair back into a ponytail or bun. You should also pin back your bangs or any other loose hair from around your face. Having your face clean and uncovered will allow you to see all the factors that determine your face shape.


You might also want to wear a top that does not cover your neck and chin, so try a scoop neck or v-neck shirt. You can also go topless.;
, You need to get a mirror and a writing utensil, such as an eyebrow pencil, lip or eyeliner pencil, or dry erase marker. You need to make sure the mirror is large enough that you can see your whole face. It also needs to be hung on a wall or able to sit up on its own so you can use both your hands. Make sure the room you're in is well lit and that your face is in full light. You will need to be able to see each edge of your face and you don't want to misread the shape of your face due to shadows., Stand in front of the mirror with your face centered in the mirror's surface. Mark the edges of your face. You can either draw the whole area of your face now or you can place dots around you face, noting the top and edges of your forehead, the edges of your cheekbones, points on the edges of your jawline, and the bottom of your chin. Once you've placed the dots, move to the side and connect the dots, making a facsimile of your face shape.You can also do this in the bathroom mirror after you get out of the shower. All you have to do is draw the outline of your face in the steam. Make sure to take note of the shape before the condensation fades away.If you don't have a mirror, take a picture of yourself head on with a relaxed face and draw around the outside of your face. You will get the same result., Once you've drawn your face, it's time to analyze the dimensions of your face. Look at the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline as well as the length from your forehead to your chin. Compare each side, judging which area is most prominent, which area is smallest, and how they relate to one another. Keep in mind a few questions. How wide is my forehead compared to my jawline? How wide are my cheekbones compared to my forehead and jawline? How long is my face? These spacial relationships are what determines your face shape. Look at the next section to figure out what shape your face is and understand what each face shape means.


If your face seems to be in between two shapes, you can try a more exact method to determine which areas on your face are larger than others. In a mirror, measure the length between the side edges of your forehead, between your cheekbones or temples, between the edges of your jaw, and from your chin to your hairline. Use these exact measurements to determine what the largest and smallest areas of your face are.
If you aren't exactly sure about the shape of your face, have a relative or close friend help you decide. Sometimes it's easier for others to decide because they see your face more often than you see your own., You have a round face if your face is almost as wide as it is long, you have more rounded edges to your face instead of harsh lines, and your jawline is round and full. Those with this face shape often consider their cheeks to be chubby, but the cheeks usually give them a young, youthful appearance.For round faces, avoid hairstyles that fall directly at the chin line because they accentuate the short, round qualities in your face. Instead, wear styles that fall below your chin, giving your face the appearance of added length., You have a heart shaped face if your forehead and cheekbones are wider than the bottom of your face, your jawline is angular, and your chin is prominent and pointy. These individuals often have a large forehead and may also have a widow's peak, which is the element that lends the shape its name. This shape is also described as an inverted triangle shape, given the prominence of the chin and width of the forehead and cheekbones.For heart shaped faces, wear your hair long and wavy with a thick bang, which hides your larger forehead and balances out your face, or wear it chin length, which helps even out the prominence of your jaw. Avoid hairstyles that are above the chin because they can make your face appear unbalanced., You have an oval face if your cheekbones and jawline are pretty much the same width with your forehead just a bit wider, your face is only slightly longer than it is wide, and your chin is slightly rounded and smaller than the width of your forehead.


Because the oval face is so proportionate, there are very few hairstyles that do not look good. Bangs, no bangs, long, or short, this face shape can pull off any style and look good while doing it. It is often considered the ideal face shape due to its proportions and ability to be styled in any way., You have a square shaped face if your face is nearly as wide as it is long, your cheekbones and jawline are nearly the same size, your hairline is flat, and your jawline is defined with minimal chin curves. The forehead can be large and is typically the same width as the cheekbones.For square shaped faces, wear long hairstyles that add length, retracting from your wide, prominent jaw. You can also have soft curls around your face to soften the harsh angles of your jaw or an off center part to draw attention across your face, adding length. Avoid blunt bangs and straight bobs because they accentuate the harsh angles of your face., You have an oblong face if your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are almost the same width, your face is long, your forehead is long, and your chin is slightly pointed. You face will be noticeably longer than it is wide, at least 60% longer, which is what sets this shape apart from the oval face. This type of face is often called rectangular shaped as well.For oblong faces, wear hairstyles that add width to your face such as long, wide curls.

, Look for belted jackets, trench-style coats, or other fits that draw in toward the waist. Short jackets that stop just above your hips accentuate your curves in a flattering way.

, Wrap tops and dresses pull the fabric in at the skinniest part of your waist, drawing the focus to your waist without adding any extra volume to your bust. Hourglass figures with a short waist or petite figure may not like this style, however, since it often falls out at the wrong part of their waist.

, These materials gently drape over your natural curves, keeping your bust in proportion with your hips. Avoid stiff fabrics, since these may end up making you look boxy.

, Look for V-necks, V-neck halters, sweethearts, and scoop necks. Narrow necklines slim down your bust, keeping it looking balanced, and low necklines draw the eye closer to your narrow waist. Avoid wide necklines like boat necks and squares, since these tend to make you look top heavy.

, Stay away from ruffles, bows, and other dimensional details that add volume. If placed at the bust, these details may make you look top heavy. If placed at the waist, they detract from your waist's natural narrowness.

, Muted patterns may also work, but solid colors flatter your figure best. You can ""color block"" by having contrasting shades above your waist and below your waist, or you can stick with a single, solid color top or dress to keep your bust evenly balanced with your hips.

, A supportive bra will help you lift and tame your bust, giving your upper half the right proportions.

, Some hourglass figures would rather look thin rather than curvy. If this describes you, slim down your upper half by wearing dark colors, vertical stripes, or vertical pleats.

, A top that stops just short of your waist will accentuate your curves, but if you would rather slim your curves down, look for a top that lengthens your torso by extending just below your hipbone or past your thighs.

, Look for materials that stretch or drape. A stiff skirt may make your hips look boxy and excessively wide.

, Think wide-leg and boot-cut styles. The flare keeps the bottom portion of your leg in balance with your wide hips. This also creates a longer, slimmer appearance for your legs.

, Skinny jeans make most hourglass figures look short and stout. If you have naturally long, lean legs, though, you may be able to get away with a tight-fitting skinny jean, especially if you pair it with high heels that add extra length to your leg.

, Avoid low-rise pants, since these may make your hips look wider and your legs look shorter. Mid-rise and high-rise cuts elongate the leg. Styles with wide waist-bands are especially flattering.

, Your trousers should have flat fronts and pockets without flaps or large buttons. You should also avoid decorative embellishments or other decorations at the hip.

, A belt worn around the narrowest part of your waist acts as the focal point of your entire outfit. Skinny belts often work for hourglass figures of all heights, but wide belts may shorten the torso if you have a short waist or petite height.

, Your curvy hips may make your legs look thick and short when you wear flat shoes. Heels elongate the leg, however, creating a slimmer, better proportioned look.

, A bright splash of color at your neck can add personality to your outfit. Look for short necklaces that hug your neck or long necklaces that come down in a ""V."" Necklaces that hang low and wide over your chest may make it look larger and unbalanced.


Long necklaces with a pendant close to the breast or waistline will draw attention to your waist.

, These will draw the attention of the eye to your waistline as well as the wrist."

Determine your proportions.,
Stand tall.,
Know where to shop.",How to Dress Well As a Tall Girl1," Your legs and upper-half may be equal in length, or you may have short legs with a long torso, or a shorter upper body with super long legs. This may affect how you shop and dress.;
, If your posture stinks, you're not going to look good, no matter how you dress. Tall women tend to slouch or hunch their shoulders in an attempt to appear smaller.

, Certain brands are known for catering to taller women. And with online shopping, you have even more options. Search for companies that focus exclusively on tall girls, and you'll have a much easier time finding clothes in your size.

Be aware that dressing all in one color (monochromatic) can make you look longer.

, Sleeves and hems that are too short can give your shirt that ""shrunken"" appearance. Unless it's a crop-top, look for shirts that at least hit you at the hip.


Look for 3/4 length sleeves or create them by rolling up sleeves that are just a little too short.

, A tall girl can rock a maxi dress like no other, or she can show off her killer legs something shorter. You probably don't want to be flashing your booty or underwear, however, so pay attention to skirts and dresses that are so short they don't cover the essentials. Remember a dress that is a flirty length on a shorter girl may look straight-up indecent on a taller girl.

Take proper care of your clothes and everything that's inside your dresser.",How to Dress Classy (for Men)," Wearing the same old expensive suit for all occasions will never help. A cool pair of denim jeans with a lightly colored, well-fitting shirt followed by a lightly colored pair of Converse shoes will do the magic. This combination is affordable and decent. That said, none can say that a well-fitted Raymond suit is not cool. That's the best a man can get but it's not the only option.;
, Attracting the opposite sex has been the main concern for men while standing in front of the dresser. However, almost every time its forgotten how much a stylish pair of sneakers helps to get anyone's eye on one. Mostly girls love guys wearing a good pair of shoes.

, For every skin tone there is a measure of permitted colors which will bring out the best of your look. However, bear in mind that there are limits; for example, a neon colored high-necked T with pink shorts can never be attractive, no matter what skin tone you have. Always choose decent colors. A lemon colored shirt with a white pair of skinny trousers can be a good option.

, Yeah guys, they are never cool unless you are in the pool or gym. Don't wear them home after exercising either!

, Even though dressing in a classy way never depends on the number or type of items your wardrobe possesses, it is still the case that having some standard, quality basics will always make it easy for you to dress with class.

A pair(s) of clean, well-fitted jeans
At least one good quality suit
One or two ties (neither too fat nor too thin)
Both dark and lightly colored shirts
Trousers in decent colors
Round neck and polo T-shirts
A pair of good quality sneakers and a decent pair of party shoes.

, Watches, shades, etc. do not necessarily need to be expensive but they must be decent and able to reflect a mature taste. Ask your girlfriend or elder sister to help you to choose.

, Do not forget to apply cologne, deodorant, antiperspirant or anything else that will help you to smell good. That's the icing on the cake. Even an alpha male with body odor will be found repellent to those with sensitive noses.

, Not necessarily a muscly one like Schwarzenegger but by adding some lean muscles, you will look good in almost everything. Hit the gym once or twice a week to keep it clean.

, Always remember that clean garments are the best option. Even an expensive shirt with a line of dirt around the cuff will kill the impression instantly. Always keep your clothes clean and tidy. The following suggestions might be a help:


Keep everything arranged neatly in a dresser or wardrobe.
Keep untidy clothes aside, perhaps in a laundry bag or basket.
Make sections for pants, shirts, blazers and under garments.
Clean your clothes yourself, as you know which parts need more cleaning.

Rock what you’ve got in tight clothing.",How to Dress for a Curvaceous Look," This is so crucial, whether you’re working with a large or small bust. If your bra is too small you’ll be squishing your breasts, and if it’s too large, you won’t be supporting them. To really accentuate your bust you should wear a push-up bra, which will lift your breasts and create some intense cleavage. Girls with naturally small busts should choose push-up bras with extra padding as well, to increase the overall size.If you can, go to a lingerie store to get fitted for a bra by a professional.
You can also measure yourself with a simple tape measure, using these techniques.

Make sure you replace your bras regularly. Daily wear and tear will gradually loosen up the straps, band, and underwire, decreasing the lift and support you need.;
, Keep in mind that dark colors are slimming, but also bust-minimizing! Colorful shirts can be the perfect pop to accentuate your chest. Showing off some skin can achieve the same effect— choose items that show off your shoulders and arms to highlight your upper body.Additionally, don’t shy away from tight shirts. Baggy shirts can make your chest look dumpy. Tight shirts will hug your chest, regardless of size, which will emphasize your curves.No matter what your bra size, drawing the eyes to your chest in any way will make you appear more busty.

, A plunging neckline, like a deep V-neck or scoop neck, is perfect for showing off the cleavage created by a perfect push-up bra.A sweetheart neckline is a fabulous neckline for both small and large breasts, because the curve of the neckline accentuates the natural bust line, while showing skin to draw attention to the area.If you really want to embrace the curvy look, don’t be afraid to show some skin.


When it comes to both style and neckline of shirts, you have to be able to wear it with confidence. The perfect color and cut won't mean anything if you are hunched over, self-consciously tugging at your clothing. Choose something that makes you feel sexy and self-assured, first and foremost.

, To do this, you’ll need a dark powder, preferably a bronzer, and a light face powder or eye shadow. Apply the dark color down the center between your breasts, blending it upwards along the top curve of your breasts. Apply the lighter powder on the top half of your breasts.The goal of this is to imitate or enhance the shadows created by generous cleavage.
It’s best to do this once you’re already dressed. Just make sure to protect your clothing with tissue!

, It may seem obvious, but standing up straight and tall is the simplest trick in the book to accentuate your bust. Your breasts will appear larger and perkier, and you'll also appear more poised overall. Try to pay attention to your posture, and train yourself to straighten your back when you find yourself hunching.Look in the mirror while you are hunching and then while you are stranding up straight. See a difference? That's your motivation to work on your posture!

, If you don’t feel comfortable wearing clothing that’s skintight everywhere, choose outfits that are at least formfitting at your natural waist. This will make your waist look smaller, thus making your curves above and below your waist look larger by comparison.Avoid “potato sack” clothing. If the fabric doesn’t define your waist, you run the risk of looking straight and boyish.
Fit and flare dresses are great for accentuating the waist, as well wrap dresses, peplum tops, pencil skirts, and high-waisted pieces., One simple belt can make a huge change in your silhouette. By marking your waistline with a thin belt or sash, you will can create an hourglass shape even in the baggiest of clothing. Use this trick to make any shapeless dress more flattering.Tucking your shirt in at the waist will also help to show off your waist, helping to accentuate your curves.
Another cute and easy way to accentuate your waist is to tie a shirt around it. You'll look effortlessly casual and curvy at the same time., Specifically, look for clothing that has a block of color down the middle, with different colors on the sides. When others see you, their eyes will be drawn to the middle color. The colors on the sides will be less noticeable. This will accentuate your waist by making it appear tinier, only the size of that middle block of color.Colorblock clothing works as an optical illusion to give your body that extra va-va-voom!

, Regardless of your size, wearing shapewear under your clothing can make your normal clothing even more flattering. Shapewear is usually made of spandex, which will smooth out the midsection to highlight your waist. In a way, shapewear “sucks everything in” so that you have curves in all the right places!Shapewear comes in all styles and colors, so you can find something that fits seamlessly under any outfit.

, If you wear fabric with no stretch, you run the risk of squishing your assets. This is exactly what you do not want to do. Find clothing that doesn’t flatten your curves, but rather lifts and accentuates them.Look for jeans that contain Spandex or Lycra. This stretch denim looks no different than regular denim, but will hug your body tighter while being flexible.Tight, stretchy clothing will draw eyes to your butt, and you don't want a glaring panty line distracting from your curves. Make sure you wear the proper underwear for whatever outfit you are wearing.
Tumble dry stretchy clothing. The heat will help the fabric retain the stretch it may have lost during wear., If you're wearing shorts, a skirt, or a dress, raise the hemline. When you show more leg, eyes will automatically be drawn to your butt. When you’re looking to accentuate your curves, this is perfect.If you don’t choose to show leg, strategically showing a bit of skin above the waist will achieve the same goal. Look cropped shirts or pieces with sexy cut-outs near the waistline.Show the areas that you feel confident showing. If you love your back, don a backless top. If you love your muscular legs, a mini skirt is perfect. Any bare skin near your booty will help you accentuate it, so choose clothing that makes you feel sexy.

, Wearing high heel actually raises the booty by around twenty to thirty degrees.This change in angle makes your figure appear more youthful and curvier. Heels also lengthen your legs, and this will draw eyes to your legs and butt.


Wearing heels may take some practice. To walk naturally, focus on putting your heel down first, then your toe., Even if you think you’re lacking in the booty department, don’t be tempted to hide it in loose clothing. Clothes that hug the curves you do have are your best bet for dressing for a curvaceous look. Wear clothes with confidence and embrace the body you’ve got!Pay attention to your body language. Stand tall, and walk in to every room like you own it. Flaunt whatever curves you have, and they are sure to be noticed.

Make sure you have an apple-shaped body.,
Draw attention away from your middle.,
Emphasize your bust.,
Show off your legs.",How to Dress an Apple Shape Body1," Before you begin to think about dressing for your body type, you should confirm that you do indeed have an apple shaped body. Some people mistake a pear-shaped body for an apple-shaped body. An apple shaped-body is heavy in the middle and above the waist, while a pear-shaped body is heavier below the waist and in the upper thighs. Here are some other characteristics of the apple-shaped body:A wide torso
Broad shoulders
An average-to-fuller bust
An undefined waist
Thinner arms and legs
A flat bottom
Hips that are narrower than your bust
You don't have to have a very large belly to be apple shaped -- it just means that your center of gravity, or your extra weight, resides in your belly area.;
, To dress your apple-shaped body, you'll want to take attention away from your middle, since it's already full. To draw attention away from your middle, avoid low shorts or pants, high-cut shirts, or any fabric length that cuts off below or above your middle. You'll want to distract people from your middle by directing their attention elsewhere or by creating more definition in your waistline.


You should also avoid wearing an outfit with a different pattern in the belly area. This will draw more attention to your belly.
Avoid wearing thick belts, which will draw more attention to your middle.
Avoid clingy shirts or dresses, which will also draw attention to your middle.

, If you have an apple-shaped body, then you must have a great bust, so don't be afraid to flaunt it. Showing off your bust will not only emphasize one of your most amazing features, but it will also take attention away from your middle. To emphasize your bust, you should wear v-necks, plunging necklines, or A-line dresses, to lengthen your body and draw attention to your bust.


Wear shirts or dresses that flow from under your bust, expanding at the waist.
Remember that drawing attention to your bust is different from looking top-heavy. You don't need to wear elaborate necklaces or tops with ornate patterns near the neck. You already have a great bust, so it needs no adornments.

, A great pair of legs often comes with the apple-shaped body. So, whether you're tall or on the shorter side, don't be afraid to show off your great legs. You can do this with a pair of short-shorts, or high heels that lengthen your body and balance out your bottom half.


Don't minimize your legs by wearing big heavy boots, leggings, or skinny jeans. This will only make your gorgeous legs look smaller.

Consider the primary features of the apple shape.,
Consider the primary features of the pear or triangle shape.,
Consider the hourglass or ""8 frame"" shape.,
Consider the rectangle shape, also called the ""banana"" or ""ruler"" shape.,
Consider the inverted triangle or wedge shape.",How to Determine Your Body Shape5," Apple shapes gain weight in the midsection, rear, and face. These figures usually have a large upper body, complete with large shoulders, bust, and waist. The hips are slim and the legs are slender.








, Pear shapes usually gain weight in the rear or thighs. These women have wider hips and thighs, but usually have a small bust and waist. Many pear shapes have hips that measure wider than their shoulders. Some also have short, full legs, but slender arms.








, Hourglass shapes gain weight proportionally in the hips, thighs, and chest. The bust and hips are similar in proportion, and the waist is very narrow, creating noticeable curves. In fact, the waist may measure anywhere from 8 inches (20.3 cm) to 12 inches (30.5 cm) smaller than the bust or hip.








, Extra weight gathers around the stomach and back regions. The waist, hips, shoulders, and bust are usually slim and fairly equal in size. The waist should measure somewhere between 1 inch (2.5 cm) to 8 inches (20.3 cm) smaller than the bust.








, The inverted triangle shape gains weight around the shoulders and bust. These women have a full upper body with broad shoulders and a large bust. The waist is flat and the hips are narrower than the bust and shoulders. Pear shapes usually have a flat rear and slender legs.

Pay attention to the cut of your top.,
Choose the right material.,
Choose the right shape.,
Wear the right dress.,
Pair your top with an appropriate jacket or coat.",How to Dress an Apple Shape Body2," Whether you're wearing a top or a dress, there are a few rules for wearing a top that flatters your bust and draws attention from your waistline.



Wear: tops with v-necks, plunging necklines, strapless, scoop, or tops with narrow bodices. This will draw more attention to your bust and elongate your upper body.

Avoid: tops with a halter, very high necklines, decorated neckline, off-the shoulder cut, or boat neck. This will make your shoulders broader and will draw too much attention to your chest.

, Don't wear a material that is too clingy, especially in the middle area. You can wear a textured fabric, such as a woven material, to draw more attention away from your middle. T-shirts that are ruched in the middle will also give definition to your middle.

, Though your shirt or top shouldn't be clingy, it shouldn't be boxy, baggy, or formless, either. If it's too loose, you'll only look more shapeless and your waist will look bigger. Instead, pick a shirt or top that flows downward from your bust, like a top with a high-waistline, empire waist, or A-line. Here are some things to keep in mind as you choose the shape of your top: A shirt or dress that has a tie at the waist will also help add definition to your figure.
Your tops should fall lower than your hip bones.
You can wear a long flowing top that falls below your bottom, or even a tunic shirt.
Wear tops with flare or cuff sleeves.
Choose a top with pretty shoulder details, like sequins or flowers.

, There are a variety of dresses that can flatter the apple shape. Go for a dress that has an A-line or a continuous pattern on it. Another strategy is to find a dress that makes the most of color blocking -- a dress with black or dark colors going all the way down your figure at both sides with white or a lighter color going all the way down your figure in the middle will draw attention away from your waist.Don't wear a dress with a built-in waistline, or it will only draw more attention to your waist.
You can pair your dress with a nice opened jacket that is nipped at the waist.

, The right jacket can help camouflage your heavy midriff. You should wear a jacket that is single-breasted and doesn't have too many details. Wearing a structured jacket or coat will create curves in your chest and hips and will minimize your waist. Layering your top will help create balance for your figure. Here are some other things to try:


Tailored blazers and coats
Opened cardigans or waistcoats
A duster coat that ends above the knee

"
"
Wear the right pants.,
Wear the right shorts.,
Wear the right skirt.,
Wear the right shoes.",How to Dress an Apple Shape Body3," You'll need to show off your legs to balance out your apple-shape. Drawing attention to your legs will help add more balance to your look. Don't downplay your legs by wearing skinny jeans, leggings, or any other too-tight fabric. This will make your legs look even smaller and will make your waist look even larger as a result. Here are some other tricks to try when choosing a pair of pants for your bottom half:Avoid pants that have a lot of zippers in the front, or this will draw more attention to your middle. Try to find a pair of pants with zippers on the sides instead.
Wear pants with back pockets. This will create definition in your flatter bottom and will balance out your waist.
Wear pants that are denim, trouser cut, flared, wide-legs, or boot cut.

, Don't be afraid to wear shorts just because of your fuller figure. A pair of short-shorts can show off your great legs and minimize your waist. You can even pair them with an elastic belt that isn't too bulky. You can wear them with nude sandals to create even more length.


Go for the high-waisted cut. Anything cut low at the waist may create a ""muffin top"" and will only draw more attention to your middle. Pick a cut that nips your waistline, making it slimmer and more defined. This applies to pants too.

, A great skirt can help define your apple-shaped body. Try wearing a skirt that has a bias cut or an A-line, or flatter your figure with a full circle skirt. Avoid skirts that are tight around the waist or which fall at your natural waist. You can also wear a trumpet skirt or skirts with a hanky hem.

, If you have an apple-shaped body, then you should create balance on your lower body by wearing shoes that emphasize your legs. Here are some shoes to wear and some others to avoid:Wear: platform shoes, wedges, calf-length boots, ballet flats, clogs, and strappy sandals. All of these will let you show off your legs and create a fuller bottom.

Avoid: kitten heels, buckle boots, Uggs, or any shoes that will make your feet look too big. This will in turn make your legs look smaller and draw even more attention to your waist.

Choose shirts with a V-neck or scoop neck.,
Look for longer shirts that will lengthen your torso and balance your frame.,
Avoid baggy clothing.,
Shop for wrap-dresses, which hit all the styling sweet-spots.,
Find a simple jacket that hits your mid or lower hip.A great jacket can break up the bustline, enhance your figure, and draw the eye downward.,
Accessorize with eye-catching earrings and necklaces that hang above your neckline.",How to Draw Less Attention to Large Breasts1," Shirts with high collars (including turtlenecks and polos) can be aging or give you the appearance of a uni-boob. A V-neck will visually break up your chest and flatter your figure.


A sweetheart, low-cut square, or punching necklines all flatter a larger bust.Avoid details that draw the eye to your chest. Sequins, writing, buttons above the bust line, pockets, and frills or lace at the neckline will all bring the focus back to your breasts.
Don’t get crazy with too much cleavage, as that will draw attention to your breasts.;
, Because you have more to cover in the chest area, your shirt will hit higher on your waist. You want it to hit about 4-5 inches below your belly button. This will slim your waist and make your torso look longer, instead making your hips and bustline look squished together.Notice sleeve length as well—sleeves that end right at your bust-line can make your chest appear wider. Try cap, three-quarter, or long sleeves instead.When shopping, choose shirts with a more rectangular shape than a square shape—these will be longer.
Wear long camisoles under shorter shirts to add length. If all your shirts are boxy and too short, invest in a couple of long camisoles you can layer underneath for the same effect., You might be feeling self-conscious about your breasts and want to hide in a baggy shirt, or you may be so frustrated trying to find something that fits that you just buy a shirt that is too big. But baggy clothes don’t make your breasts look smaller—they just make you look bigger all over.Try to find shirts that are fitted in the torso but have more space in the bust area. Fitted t-shirts that have extra length should give you the desired fit., Wrap dresses will cinch in your waist, and usually have V-necklines with more room for your breasts.Any dress that creates that “V” shape at the top (whether with fabric, seams, beading, or neckline) will give you a gorgeous hour-glass shape.Avoid dresses with halters or empire bust lines. These are generally not made with large-breasted women in mind, and you will either be spilling out or the empire line will hit you mid-chest.A dress that shows off your legs, either with a short hemline or a slit, will draw the eye away from your chest., A jacket that is too-short will make you look boxy, and lapels or double-breasted jackets (jackets with two rows of buttons) will make your chest look wide.Wear a jacket in a color that contrasts your shirt for a slimming effect.If you're wearing a blazer, wear it open or only button the button below your bustline. Don't button or zip all the way up.Avoid belted jackets. The material will bunch up and make your chest look bigger and your waist look wider., A long necklace will sit right in your cleavage or hang off of your breasts, where it will swing and draw attention. A shorter necklaces that hangs at least a half-inch above your neckline will bring attention to your collar-bone area rather than your chestConsider a big, chunky necklace, which may create the illusion of smaller breasts.A gorgeous pair of drop earrings, hoops, or chandelier earrings will draw the eye to your face.
Layering bangles can also draw attention away from your bust."

Consider a moisturizing makeup prep & primer.,
Begin by concealing dark circles around the eyes and any scars, spots or marks on the face.,
Choose a light foundation or compact powder matching your skin tone, if wearing one.,
Do contouring and highlighting as necessary.,
Use a dark colored eyeliner to make your eyes pop dramatically.,
Use neutral-colored eye shadow, or none at all, for a casual look.,
Groom the eyebrows to shape your face and eyes.,
Apply a good mascara, working up from the base of the lashes for the best results.,
Keep the blush light and rosy, only adding a little along your cheek bones for a pinkish glow.,
Use a nice, rosy lip gloss or stick to complete the casual, killer look.",How to Do Casual Makeup on Indian Skin1," This leads to healthy skin and helps your makeup stay on your face all day. At the very least, wash your face, pat it dry, and apply a light, oil-free moisturizing lotion.






;
, A well concealed, prepped face serves as a great canvas for whatever makeup you're planning to do! A simple liquid concealer should be used to clean up the dark spots under your eyes and hide any imperfections.









To apply a concealer: Don't take too much product on your finger. More product doesn't necessarily mean better application. Take a little bit of concealer on your finger tip, rub it between the thumb and the finger (to warm it up so that it applies smoother) - and apply in gentle tapping motions.

, Many people don't really wear foundation during the day, as it can dry your skin up and look cakey over time. If you have dry skin, use a moisturizing foundation, if you have oily skin, you may go for something that has a matter texture. Also make sure that you choose your foundation according to:









The climate of the place where you stay (in colder regions, you'll need more hydrating foundations while in hotter regions you'll need long stay foundations with more SPF).
The time of day. Avoid wearing heavy coverage foundations during the day as they can look a bit too overwhelming during this time (they are better for night-outs).
Your age. Many foundations have anti-aging ingredients like Olay's. They also have light shimmer in them that reflects well in light and helps in the reduction of appearance of wrinkles. If you are young, you have a wider range of foundations to choose from.
The occasion. As a general rule of thumb, you should do all your makeup according to the occasion. If you are going for a day at the beach, heavy makeup would not make any sense as it will not last too long.

, Even if you are not an expert in this area, the one thing you can easily do is make your nose look slimmer and smaller. Take a dark brownish lip color or eye shadow and with your finger tip apply a very small amount of the product on the sides of the nose bridge. Smudge it well so that no obvious lines are visible anymore.









Try choosing something in a matte finish, if not you can choose something creamy. But at all costs avoid anything with glitter, shimmer, gloss in it as it will give the most unnatural appearance to the nose. Choose a lipstick/eye shadow shade that is at least 2 shades darker than your own skin tone.

, On darker skin tones, the combination of green and blue eyeliners mixed with black looks really good. Line the inner half of the eyes with green eyeliner and the outer half with blue. Then take black eyeliner and draw a very fine line close to the eyelashes to add definition to the eyes.









You can use any two color combinations of eyeliners, not just blue and green. It will depend on your personal style and what you are comfortable with.

, Save the bright colors and dramatic shades for late night events and glamour.








, Your eyebrow grooming routine may include waxing/ tweezing/ trimming or threading. Although some people like to leave their brows alone and keep them natural. If you'd rather not trim, you can still use some clear eyebrow gel to brush through the brows for a neater, more maintained look. Use a good brow pencil that matches your natural brow hair in color and make small strokes with it to fill in any gaps in your brows. Then finish by brushing through with a clear brow gel.









Never use pure black, even with dark hair. It almost always looks out of place.
Don't use long, harsh strokes to fill the brows. Use small, light-handed (as light as you can manage without dropping the pencil) strokes to achieve the most natural looking strokes that resemble real brow hair.

, To give the illusion of heavier lower lashes, you can use an eyeliner to draw tiny dots and dashes along the lower lash line, then smudge these dots and dashes a little bit for a gradual look.









Avoid using a waterproof mascara unless you'll be going in the water or humid regions. They are more taxing to take off than regular mascaras, you end up rubbing your eyelashes a bit too hard and breaking them.

, Aim for blushes that actually fit your skin tone well, so that the blush is more of an accent and not an attention-drawing brightness. Use your blush brush for a nice, light dusting.








, Gloss goes well with this look, but you may choose another finish if you please. Before application, make sure your lips are well exfoliated and moisturized. Otherwise, you'll see flaky lips that aren't attractive no matter how pretty the lip color.









If your eyeliners consist of cooler shades such as blue and green, then make sure that your lip color also has a cooler undertone to it, like a darker red. If you've avoided eye shadows or coloring, find a lip coloring that matches well with your blush for a truly put together look."

Look at your eyes in a mirror.,
Ask yourself if your eyelid has a crease.,
Note the position of the outer corners.,
Take a closer look at the crease in your eyelid.,
Examine the whites of your eyes.,
Look into your mirror again.,
Examine the inside corners of your eyes.,
Consider the depth of your eyes.,
Compare your eyes with the rest of your face.,
Apply makeup according to shape.,
Take width into consideration.,
Consider eye depth, as well.,
Note peculiarities involved with small or large eyes.",How to Determine Eye Shape," Head to a well-lit location with a mirror. Bring the mirror as close to you as possible so that you have a clear view of at least one of your eyes.This will make it easier to apply the makeup.


A magnifying mirror is ideal, but any mirror will work well enough as long as you can clearly see your eyes in it. This includes stationary mirrors, like those hanging on a wall or cabinet, as well as movable mirrors, like those included in a small compact.
Natural light often provides the best lighting, but as long as you can get a clear view of your eyes, artificial lighting can be just as good.;
, Look at your upper eyelid. If this eyelid does not have a crease, you have ""monolid"" eyes. On the other hand, if your eyelid does have a crease, you will need to continue on before you can identify your eye shape.


Note that the eyelid crease does not need to be visible to be counted. True ""monolid"" eyes completely lack a crease.
The ""monolid"" counts as a basic eye shape, so if you have one, you do not need to progress through the remaining steps in the ""Shape"" section of this article. You can, however, move onto the ""Position"" section.

, Imagine that there is a straight, horizontal line extending through the centers of both eyes. Ask yourself if the outer corners of your eyes lie above or below this center line. If the corners are above this line, you have ""upturned"" eyes. Similarly, if the corners are below this line, you have ""downturned"" eyes.


Imagining a center line might be difficult, so if necessary, you can place a disposable coffee stirrer or thin pencil across the horizontal center of one eye. Use your unblocked eye to examine the outer corner position of your blocked eye.
If the outer corners of your eyes fall near the center line, you will need to progress further to identify your basic eye shape.
If you have ""upturned"" or ""downturned"" eyes, you can stop sorting through the steps of the ""Shape"" section and move onto the ""Position"" section.

, With your eyes wide open, ask yourself if the crease of your eyelid is visible or hidden. If the crease is hidden underneath the upper part of your lid or your brow bone, you have a ""hooded"" eye shape.


Stop here if you have identified your eye shape as ""hooded."" This is your basic eye shape, so you can skip the rest of the steps in this section and move onto the ""Position"" section of the article.
If the crease of your eyelid is visible, you will need to progress through the last part of this section.

, More specifically, look at the whites around the iris—the colored portion of the eye. If you can see any white around the top or bottom of your iris, you have ""round"" eyes. If you cannot see any white above or below the iris, you have ""almond"" eyes.


Both ""round"" and ""almond"" eyes are basic eye shapes.
If you have no other identifiable shape features, as indicated by the previous steps in this section, your eye shape can only be ""round"" or ""almond.""
This is the last quality you can take into consideration when identifying eye shape. The only other thing to take into consideration after this is the position of your eyes on your face.

, Just as you did when you identified your eye shape, you need to look at your eyes closely using a mirror while in a well-lit location. Unlike before, however, you should make sure that both eyes are visible in the mirror. One eye will not be enough to accurately determine eye position.

, More precisely, examine the gap lying in between the inside corners of both eyes. If this gap is less than one eye length in size, you have close set eyes. If this gap is larger than one eye length, you have wide set eyes.There is also the possibility that this gap is roughly the length of one eyeball. In this case, gap length is inconsequential and does not need to be taken into consideration.
This step only identifies your eye width. It does not influence depth or size, so you will still need to move onto the remaining steps in this section even if you have wide or close set eyes.

, Most individuals do not need to take depth into consideration when determining the position of their eyes, but some do have either deep set eyes or protruding eyes.


Deep set eyes appear as though they are tucked further back into the socket, causing the upper eyelid to appear short and small.
Protruding eyes, on the other hand, literally bulge outward from the socket and toward the upper lash line.
Since this step only identifies eye depth, you will still need to continue with the remaining step of this section to determine eye size.

, Compare your eyes with your mouth and nose. Average eye size will be similar to that of your mouth or nose, if not a little smaller. If your eyes are significantly smaller, though, you have small eyes. If they are larger than your other features, you have large eyes.


As with depth, most people will not need to pay attention to the size of their eyes.

, For most people, the shape of your eye will determine the best practices to follow when applying eye makeup.


For mono-lid eyes, create a gradient of eye shadows to add dimension. Apply dark colors close to the lash line, a soft neutral toward the middle, and a shiny color near the brow.If you have upturned eyes, apply dark shadow or liner along the outer lower corner of the eye, thereby making the outer corner look lower.
If you have down turned eyes, apply liner close to the upper lash line and blend the shadow across the socket, but only on the outer two-thirds of the eye. This ""lifts"" the overall appearance of the eye.For hooded eyes, use medium to dark matte colors and apply as little as possible to avoid overwhelming the eye.
If you have round eyes, apply medium to dark shades over the center of the eyes and use light shades to highlight the corners. In doing so, you “narrow” the overall shape of the eye.
If you have almond eyes, you have what many consider to be the “ideal” shape. You can try just about any look with your eye makeup.

, If you have notably wide or close set eyes, you may want to consider that quality, as well, when you decide how to apply eye makeup.


For close set eyes, use light colors on the inner corners and dark colors on the outer corners. Line the outer corners with mascara, as well. Doing this extends the outer corners of the eye.
For wide set eyes, apply dark liner as close to the inner corner as possible and use mascara on the lashes from your mid-eye to your nose. As a result, your eyes will look closer together.

, Eye depth does not necessarily play a huge role in the application of makeup, but there are a few things worth considering.


If you have deep set eyes, apply light colors on the upper lid over your eyes and a darker color and just above the socket line. This redirects the shadows of your eye, drawing it further out.
If you have protruding eyes, use medium to dark colors around the top and bottom of the eye, extending the color no further than the creases on either side. Using a little more color than normal adds more shadow to the eye, making it appear further back in the socket.

, The amount of eye makeup you should use may vary if your eyes are sized outside of the traditional norm.


Small eyes tend to be overwhelmed when you use dark colors, so stick with light to medium shades and avoid weighing down your lash line with too much liner or mascara.
Large eyes give you a larger palette to work with, so you can play around with a variety of looks. Medium to dark shades tend to look better, though, since light shades can make the eye look even larger than it already is.

Never try to fatten yourself up or get unfit just to get bigger breasts because this would be unhealthy.;
, Remember that you don't need to impress anyone. As long as you think you're beautiful, that confidence will show and people will notice. Generally, self-confidence is seen as an attractive trait. If you're confident in your body image, people will definitely find you attractive, regardless of your chest size., If you're worried that other people won't find you attractive, remember that the right people won't find you unappealing just because of your breast size.

Just as there are people who prefer brunettes and other people who are driven wild by blond hair, there are also people who like the look of small breasts.


Many models have small chests, and are able to sport their outfits beautifully!, Small breasts are more practical for physical activity, and are less prone to injury, sweating or other discomfort. If you need to run down the street at the drop of a hat to catch your dog who accidentally escaped, there won't be as much discomfort in your bust area when you only have a small chest to worry about., It's not as easy to detect a lump in the back of larger breasts behind all of that fatty tissue. For small-chested women, there are less layers to feel past, so it's easier to find a lump., Your chest doesn't require all that support from an uncomfortable under-wire bra!

Because you don't need a bra, you have the option of showing off your beautiful back with a backless shirt or gown. You can also make a bold statement and try bandeau tops which were basically made for flat-chested women and look great on them., Women who have a large chest often experience back pain, neck pain, migraines or shoulder pain. Sometimes, the pain can be so severe that the woman ends up getting a breast reduction.

A bra that provides proper support and fits correctly will help you feel comfortable and may improve your confidence.


Check that your bra straps don't dig into your shoulders. Your straps should not be working hard to support your breasts. You may need a smaller band size or a bra with wider straps.You can also buy padding that slips under your straps if your bra fits right but your straps still hurt.
Make sure the bra band (the strap that runs across your back) is parallel to the ground or lower. The bra band should provide most of the support, and the lower it is on your back, the more support it can provide.The cups should be smooth against your chest. If your breasts are spilling out the top or sides or it feels like your bra is cutting into your breasts, try a larger cup or a bra with a bigger cup design.You should be able to fit a finger under the front of your bra band. If it's too tight, you need a larger band size.A professional fitting can be extremely beneficial in helping you find a bra that fits correctly. An employee at a lingerie store or department store can measure you for the right band and cup size.

, The wrong bra can make your breasts look saggy but, even worse, can cause you significant pain. There are many different bra types on the market, and you'll need to find out which ones work for your body.


Try a multi-cup bra. The cups on these bras are made up of two or more pieces of fabric and they provide a ton of support. They will center your breast tissue, which will slenderize your silhouette.Try a long-line bra, which can relieve stress on your shoulders and back. The band on this bra is extended down to your waist, which distributes the weight of your breasts more evenly over your body. It can also act as shape wear, giving you a smooth line under your clothes.Try a minimizer bra, especially if you like button-up shirts. Minimizer bras minimize your breasts' projection, or how far they stick out. If you find your breasts cause gaps between the buttons in your shirts, a minimizer will push them back. Be aware that this can also create cleavage, which you may want to avoid if you're trying to deflect attention from your breasts., If you find that the stores in your area don't have bras that accommodate women with larger breasts, there are plenty of great online retailers that offer attractive bras that will give you the support you need.


Keep in mind that if you are above a DD cup, sizing will vary among different companies. Check the sizing on the website to make sure you choose the right bra."

Make safety your priority.,
Try to ignore cat calls or, if you want to confront the harasser, try to keep calm.,
Tell the harasser exactly what you want.,
Talk to a teacher, parent, or someone of authority if it continues.",How to Draw Less Attention to Large Breasts3," If someone is following you, touching you, or you feel threatened, don't be afraid to seek help. Find a friend or authority figure who may be able to help you. Don't confront someone if you think they may become violent or aggressive--just get away from them and get help.If someone is following you on the street, try slipping into a coffee shop. Find another woman and tell her you are being followed, and ask if she minds if you sit with her for a minute or if she can act like she's your friend. The harasser will see you joining your friend and probably go away. If you're still worried, call the police.

, These people are looking for your attention--good or bad--and ignoring them denies them what they want.If you feel you need to respond, stay calm, look directly at them, and don't swear or call them names.Say something like, ""Repeat what you just said to me,""""Stop harassing women,"" or ""Show some respect.""If they insult you or become defensive, don't respond. Again, they want your attention. Just walk away., Tell the boy who keeps staring at your chest, ""Stop staring at me."" Tell the guy who keeps asking you out, ""I'm not interested. Please leave me alone."" It can be scary and difficult to be blunt, but sometimes people don't get the hint, and you need to make it clear. Remember, they are the ones doing something wrong, not you.Attack the behavior, not the person. Don't say, ""Ugh, you're so gross!"" or ""You're a jerk."" Instead, tell them that what they are doing is not okay, it's harassment, and it needs to stop.
Remember that just because someone isn't intending to make you uncomfortable or doesn't realize their behavior is inappropriate doesn't mean it's not harassment. A group of guys who whistle, comment on your appearance, or stare every time you walk past might think they are complimenting you, but what they are doing is harassing you.Tell them to stop or talk to a teacher about what's happening.

, If you are constantly harassed at school, or someone groped you on the bus, or a customer is being inappropriate, talk to a teacher, the bus driver, or your manager. They can support you by talking to the harasser, asking them to leave, or even calling the police.Try not to worry about getting him in trouble. You may be afraid of what a classmate or coworker will do if you talk to your teacher or manager, but your school or workplace should have policies against retaliation that will get them in serious trouble. Remember that having large breasts doesn't give someone else the right to stare, comment, or touch you without your permission.

Start with a basic moisturizing cream and some light concealer.,
Keep the eyeliner colors close to your eye-lash line, sticking to blacks, greens, and blues.,
Apply a firm mascara, starting at the base of the lashes.,
Apply a light, semi-matte blush to the cheeks.,
Aim for a similar, but brighter shade, of lipstick so that it matches your blush.",How to Do Casual Makeup on Indian Skin2," Your secret weapon is going to be healthy, hydrated skin, which makes your naturally beautiful skin glow and shine. After moisturizing, apply concealer lightly around your eyes and any spots or dark patches for a nice, even skin tone.









A light, liquid concealer that matches your skin tone will usually do the trick.
If you're going out at night, a light dusting of foundation may help. It can, however, look cakey in daylight if you over do it.

, Whatever color you chose for your eyes, understated is best. Using a finely-pointed eye-liner, draw a nice, clean line right on the eyelash line on top of your eye. Then make a similar line on the bottom eyelid, but only do the outer 1/3 of the lower lash.









If you have time, use a pencil smudging brush to smooth out and blend the line, especially towards the outer edge.
If you want to use eyeshadow, keep it light. Apply it first, then use a dark eyeliner to add the essential contrast to your eyes and make them pop.
Use liquid eyeliner if you find it easier.

, Work from root to tip, adding a bit more of that darkness at the root of your eyes. This also offsets any coloring in eye shadow, helping for a more vibrant look.









You only need a little mascara on the bottom lashes.

, Save vibrant or out-there colors for the evening. For now, a lightly pink, darker blush, something a little closer to your skin tone but still with a bit of rosy pop, will give your skin a beautiful glow.








, You can add a darker colored lip liner as well, if you have time. Otherwise, a nice, bright lipstick will bring the whole look together with an alluring burst of color.

Use the color wheel.,
Avoid complementary colors as much as possible.,
Use analogous colors.,
Use primary colors.,
Don't mix certain colors together.,
Use neutral colors in your outfits.,
Use the value scale of color.,
Practice!,
Use colors with neutrals.,
Use warm neutrals.,
Use patterns with neutrals and plain colors.",How to Coordinate Colors," All the color wheel does is tell you how best to combine colors.There are particular color combinations in the color wheel that are particularly pleasing to the eye, called color harmonies. The basic primary colors of red, yellow, and blue are used to create the secondary colors. Tertiary colors are created by mixing primary and secondary colors together.There are warm colors and cool colors. Warm colors tend to be orange, red, yellow, etc. and cool colors are greens, blues, and purples. Mixing warm colors with warm colors and cool colors with cool colors can be a good way for a color coordination novice to get comfortable with the colors.
White, black, and grey are neutral colors (and are very important for properly coordinating clothing).
When a color is tinted that means that it's getting lighter (has white added to it) and when it is a shade it is getting darker (has black added to it). Tones in a color are created by adding grey. When you're coordinating clothes you'll need to see how different tints, tones, and shades work with one another.;
, These are the colors that emphasize one another and are opposites on the color wheel (say for example, orange and blue). Don't let the name fool you, these colors are complementary to one another and that doesn't mean that they'll be complementary to you!Now, you don't have to avoid pairing complementary colors completely, especially if you're a bold and confident dresser. A good way to use complementary colors to good effect is to pair 1 complementary color with a paler tint of its opposite color. For example, pairing a royal blue dress with a pale gold shawl and shoes.

, These are the colors that are right next to one another on the color wheel, like green and yellow or red and orange. Because they are close to one another they appear easy on the eyes when paired together.


An example of using analogous colors to good effect might be a scarlet red dress with gold jewelry and pink shoes.
Try to avoid putting no more than 3 analogous colors in one outfit. To use the above example you've already got 3 analogous colors (pink, red, gold), so you wouldn't want to go overboard and add in orange too or purple.

, Primary colors (if you can think back to your basic schooling years) are red, blue, and yellow. These are hard to pair together unless you're really brave, although they can look great when done right. Primary colors are great, though, for the monochrome look, which means that you use only one color.An example for the monochrome look might be a white top paired with dark blue skinny jeans, dark blue ankle boots, and a dark blue jacket. To alleviate all that blue you might add in red or bright purple scarf.
An example of a good use of primary colors together would be to use it in conjunction with multiple neutral colors. So you might pair red chunky heels with blue skinny jeans and yellow jewelry, while breaking up the colors with a black jacket and grey top.

, Some colors simply were not meant to be mixed and yet people still make the mistake of pairing them together. Avoiding these fashion faux pas will help you better coordinate your outfits.


Black may go with everything, but there are two colors it does not go well with. Don't pair it with navy blue. They are too close, but not quite to look good together. The other is brown. Don't pair black with brown unless you're really really certain.
White and cream also do not go together, because it makes it look as though you were trying to match your colors and failed (cream and brown, however, go together very well).
Brown and grey don't go well together, either. They are both too neutral and more or less colorless to enhance one another.

, This is one of the most important pieces of advice for creating well coordinated outfits. The neutral colors will enhance your chosen colors and will make them look better coordinated and not overdone.Grey is a particularly good choice for your outfit. Pair a grey skirt with a dark purple top and pale gold scarf, or a pair of grey slacks with a white shirt, a blue blazer and a red tie.
Remember that a fitted white shirt is the perfect complement to most outfits and it can be dressed up with a pair of black slacks and a tie or dressed down with a sweater or blazer and a scarf.
Avoid colored trousers, unless you pair them with a neutral top (like red skinny jeans with grey sweater). Usually, however, colored trousers can overwhelm an ensemble and take the focus.

, This basically means that each color has a variety of values, making it darker (shades) or lighter (tints) or more subdued (tones). When you're pairing things you usually want to to try to pair different values of your chosen colors.


For example you might pair a goldenrod tie with a pale blue shirt and grey or black slacks. The goldenrod is a darker value of color than the pale blue shirt (one is more pastel, the other is more bright).
try to image the colors you're using as part of a black and white photo. This will help you determine the gradations of the values so that you put the appropriate values together (darker with lighter for example).
While pastel colors with pastel colors tends to look a little sugary, you can make a bold statement with bright colors paired with bright colors. Take the above example of the goldenrod tie and pale blue shirt. Instead of the pale blue you might choose maroon to go with the goldenrod tie, which is more intense than the pale blue.

, You need to play with colors to find out from personal experience that you might not want to wear that bright yellow scarf with your bright blue shirt. Instead of bright yellow you might tone it down to a more buttery shade or darken it to goldenrod.

, When you're coordinating your outfits you'll want to make sure that you put neutrals together with your colors, so that you don't go overboard. Remember, the neutrals are there to enhance your colors.


Do 1 color and 1 neutral. For example you might pair a bright red blouse with a black skirt and red flats. Or you might pair your jeans with a white top and a blue scarf.
You could do 1 color and 2 neutrals. For example you could pair an orange dress with a white and black sweater and black converse and white earrings. Or you could pair brown trousers with a cream sweater and a golden scarf.
If you get braver you could try 2 colors and 1 neutral. You would want to pick two analogous colors if you aren't sure about your coordinating abilities. So for example you might do a red blazer over a white dress with orange shoes and bag. Or you could do black trousers, a dark blue sweater, and a maroon scarf.

, If you're feeling unsure you could stick to using warm neutrals like brown and cream which go very well together and make you look elegant. You can also put these with a more earth toned color (the colors that have been mixed with grey) like olive green.

, Patterns can be really hard to coordinate, so you'll want to make sure that you don't overdo it with your patterns or you don't overshadow the pattern with the rest of your outfit.


Try doing 1 pattern with 1 or 2 plain neutrals. For example you might pair a striped purple and black knit tunic with black leggings and grey boots. You could also pair a flannel shirt with brown corduroy trousers and a white undershirt.
You could also try putting 1 pattern with 1 plain color from within the pattern. For example if you have a red skirt with a yellow and orange sun pattern, you might match your shirt with the orange in the pattern (although you would probably want to make sure you have neutral shoes before you get too exciting!).

Prepare the dye.,
Dunk the lace in the dye.,
Add salt or vinegar.,
Let it sit for up to 30 minutes.,
Rinse.,
Wash and dry the lace.",How to Dye Lace1," Simmer the necessary amount of water in a saucepan and transfer the hot water into a large bucket. Add powder or liquid dye and stir until evenly dispersed.


The amount of dye you need will depend on how much lace you want to dye. If you have 1 lb (450 g) of lace, you will one package of powder dye or 1/2 bottle of liquid dye, as well as 3 gallons (12 L) of hot water.If working with powdered dye, dissolve it in 2 cups (500 ml) hot water first before adding it to the large bucket of water.
The ideal water temperature for your dye bath is 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).
Make sure that you add the dye to the water before adding the lace. If you add the lace first, you may cause spotting to occur.;
, Place your lace into the bucket of diluted dye. Make sure that it is completely submerged.


You might want to use a wooden or plastic mixing spoon to help keep the lace submerged. You could also use your hands as long as you have thick rubber gloves on.
It is highly recommended that you wear rubber gloves, a smock or apron, and clothes that you do not mind dirtying while working with dye.

, After the first 5 minutes, 1 cup (250 ml) salt to the dye bath or 1 cup (250 ml) white vinegar. Doing so will help intensify and set the color.


Use salt if your lace contains cotton, rayon, ramie, or linen. Use vinegar if your lace contains nylon, silk, or wool.

, For the strongest, richest hue, dye the lace for 30 minutes, stirring slowly and gently throughout the process.If you want a more subtle effect, only keep the lace in for 8 to 10 minutes. Lace absorbs dye quickly and does not need to sit in a dye bath for very long.
Stirring the lace is highly recommended since doing so helps the fabric dye evenly.

, Remove the dyed lace from the dye bath and rinse it under warm water for a couple of minutes. Afterward, rinse it under cool running water until the water runs clear.


Warm water rinses off the surface dye better, but cool water is recommended after you get this surface dye off since it discourages the color from bleeding out.

, Hand or machine wash the lace under a gentle cycle. Use mild detergent and warm water for the cleaning part of the cycle, but use cool water for the rinse cycle. Hang dry.


Note that the lace will be a slightly lighter shade when it dries.

Grab six objects, each a different neutral color.,
Look at your face next to each object.,

Keep in mind what you want to convey with your colors.",How to Choose Your Best Clothing Colors," You will want to mostly stick to colors that match your undertone. While there are many different skin tones, there are only two undertones: warm and cool. Warm skin has a yellow or orange tint, while cool skin has a blue or pale pink one. There are two main ways to figure out which category applies to you.


Vein test: Look at the veins on your wrist or palm. People with warm undertones have green-looking veins, while people with cool undertones have veins that are blue or purple.Jewelry test: Under natural light, wear a silver bracelet on one wrist and a gold one on the other. Look at each hand and figure out which enhances your complexion better. If it's gold, your undertones are warm. If silver looks best, your undertones are cool.;
, A rule of thumb is that warm colors have a yellow tint, while cool colors have a blue one. Understanding this dichotomy takes practice. A general list of warm and cool colors:


Warm: reds, oranges, yellows, yellow greens
Cool: true greens, blues, purples, In addition to your undertones, your main skin tone can also determine which color families look best. A good rule of thumb is that colors that create a contrast in brightness with your skin are more flattering. If your skin is dark, saturated oranges and yellows almost always look great, even if your undertone is cool.Likewise, bold ""jewel tones"" like emerald, ruby, and amethyst flatter paler skin regardless of undertone., If you want to make your eyes ""pop,"" make sure a flattering color is near them. You will want to pick either a color that matches your eyes closely or one that produces the greatest contrast. Deep reds also bring out the richness of brown eyes and serve as a stunning complement to pale eyes., In this context, the six neutrals are light and dark gray, light and dark brown, navy, and black. Grays and browns come in warm and cool variations, so pick ones that match your color profile. Make sure the object is roughly as long as your face and is almost entirely monochromatic.

, Do this under bright natural bright with a hand mirror. Try to decide which color makes you look your best. The right color will make your eyes look brighter and your skin healthier. Neutrals that make your skin look ruddy or sallow should be avoided. If you have trouble choosing, ask a fashionable friend for their opinion.

, These colors will make up the workhorses of your wardrobe. A majority of your pants, dresses, jackets, and shoes should be your chosen neutrals. Avoid mixing neutrals in an outfit.

, Pick a few of your favorite shades from your color group and make these your main colors. This part can be tricky, so be sure to do the mirror test to make sure these colors look great on you. Theoretically, you can pick as many colors as you want. However, the number is realistically limited by the sizes of your budget, your closet, and your patience for coordinating outfits. A good outfit is usually made up of one neutral and one main color with an optional small amount of accent color.More colors than these at once tend to make an outfit look busy.

, Use these sparingly if you want to liven up an outfit.An orange tie or pocket square can make you stand out in an otherwise conservative navy suit. Likewise, an aqua belt on a salmon dress can be an unusual but stylish choice.

, Even though they make up a small part of your outfit, the gleam of metal attracts the eye quickly. Using two different colors of metal can clash or look busy, especially if you're already wearing a few different colors. Silver and platinum are cool-toned metals, while gold and bronze are warm-toned.

, A fun and easy way to do this if your current wardrobe is limited is through picture boards online. Switch out each piece until you perfect your look. Come up with a few different combinations before you begin shopping to have an idea of what to look for. Once your wardrobe has matured, you can do the real-life equivalent with the pieces you own. If you're planning for an important interview or a night out, it's best to make sure your outfit definitely ""works"" ahead of time. Wear all component clothing and accessories and check to see how it looks in front of a mirror. If the weather is appropriate, be sure to match your outerwear for a sophisticated look.

, Earth tones and light, unsaturated warm colors can make you look friendly and approachable. Bright reds are attention grabbers. Dark, monochromatic colors can make you look stern or powerful. Wear muted or pale colors if you want to be noticed less. Bright, bold colors, especially purple, may make you seem more creative."

Prepare your work space.,
Prepare the dye.,
Consider soaking the lace.,
Load a thin paintbrush with dye.,
Apply multiple layers of dye as needed.,
Dry the lace.,
Set the color using an iron.",How to Dye Lace2," For this method, you will need to lay your lace out on a flat surface and ""paint"" the lace with dye by hand. As a result, this working space needs to be protected.


Spread a plastic bag, tablecloth, or dropcloth on the work space.
You should also fill a fine-mist spray bottle with water. This water will come in handy for touch-up work, and you can also use it to keep the lace from drying out as you work on other portions.

, Squeeze one to two drops of each dye into a separate compartment of a plastic paint palette, divided plate, or similar container. Dilute each color with 10 drops of warm water.The dye color is very concentrated, so you will need to dilute it with water. Do not paint the lace directly with undiluted dye.
If you want a stronger dye color, you can add another drop or two of dye. Similarly, you can create pastel colors by adding 5 to 10 more drops of water.

, Soaking the lace will help the material absorb, spread, and blend the dye. If you want more distinct colors, however, you should keep the lace dry.


If you decide to moisten the lace, soak it first in a bowl of warm water. Roll the lace in a towel and squeeze out the excess water until the lace is just barely damp.
Alternatively, you could also spray the lace with water from a fine-mist spray bottle to dampen it instead of soaking it first.

, Dip the tip of a fine-tip paintbrush into your first dye color. Lightly paint the desired section of lace with that dye color, using a very gentle touch.


Use the tip of the brush to paint the fine details. If you need to cover more material, you can use the entire brush head.
Thoroughly rinse and dry the brush before loading it with a new dye color.
If you are working with wet lace, mist the lace with water periodically to keep it damp.

, Use a gentle touch when applying the dye. After your initial application, go back over those same areas again with another layer of dye, repeating this until you achieve the desired shade.


Do not dampen the lace again when adding multiple layers of dye.
Lace absorbs dye very quickly, so if you get too impatient and use too much at once, you may end up making the lace too dark.
If the lace becomes too dark, you can blot away the excess dye with a paper towel. This works better if you are using a wet application instead of a dry application, though.

, You can dry the lace by air, but doing so may result in a spotty appearance. You will likely have more success if you use a hair dryer to quicken the drying process.


By speeding the drying process, you reduce the spread of dye color that comes about when the liquid component of the dye evaporates.

, Turn the lace over so that the wrong side faces up. Iron it on a wool setting with a standard iron for roughly two minutes. The color should be well set afterward.


Note that setting the color with an iron also helps soften the lace.

Prepare a small batch of dye.,
Soak the lace.,
Dunk the bottom third of the lace in the dye.,
Lower the next third in.,
Briefly submerge the final portion of lace.,
Quickly rinse the dye.,
Return the lace to the dye bath.,
Rinse and dry the lace.",How to Dye Lace3," Combine 1 Tbsp (15 ml) liquid fabric dye, 1 Tbsp (15 ml) salt, and 1/2 cup (125 ml) hot water in a glass or disposable plastic cup. Stir until evenly dispersed.Dye is fairly potent, so a small amount should do the trick. Do not dip the lace directly into the dye without diluting the dye first.
The salt is not strictly essential, but adding salt to the mixture can help make the final color more vibrant. It can also help the dye to set.
The ideal water temperature should be about 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius). You can heat the water in a microwave or on the stove if you cannot get it hot enough from the tap.
If the piece of lace you want to dye is too large to fit into a small cup, you can use a bigger container and increase the amount of dye, salt, and water in relative proportions.

, Dip the lace in hot water and gently wring it out with your hands. It should be damp when you get ready to work with it.


Damp lace will absorb the dye better. This is essential if you want to create an ombre dye effect since the shades of dye will need to blend together in a gradient. If you keep the lace dry, on the other hand, you will not be able to achieve this gradient effect.

, Lower roughly one-third of the lace into the dye bath and leave it in for 5 minutes. This will be the darkest part of the ombre pattern.


Agitate the lace continually by moving it back and forth and side to side. Do not move it up and down, though.
Agitating the lace as it dyes will produce a more even color.

, Lower another third of the lace into the dye bath while keeping the first third submerged, as well. Let it sit for another 3 minutes.


Continue agitating the lace in the same manner to produce an even color.

, Dunk the rest of the lace into the dye bath so that the entire piece is submerged. Leave it there for 1 minute.


Continue agitating the lace during this last part. If you are using your fingers, wear thick rubber or plastic gloves to prevent the dye from getting on your skin. Otherwise, you could use a coffee stirrer or disposable plastic spoon.

, Remove the lace from the dye bath and rinse it under lukewarm running water until the water runs clear. Examine the effect. If the ombre effect is not strong enough for your liking, continue with the remaining steps.


If you do like the effect you are presently left with, however, you can skip the second dye phase and simply dry the lace.

, Dunk the bottom one-third to one-half of the lace back in the dye for another 1 minute. Drain the dye when done.


To drain the dye, clip the lace onto the edge of an empty disposable plastic cup. Let it drain for 10 minutes in a vertical position.

, Rinse the lace in lukewarm water until the water comes out clear. Let the lace dry by air.


You could dry the lace faster using a hair dryer, if desired.

Examine your veins.The skin on your wrist, elbows, and temples is very thin and has blood vessels close to the surface.,
Give yourself the “white paper test.”The skin on your face often has reddish tones that might lead you to believe you’re cool-toned, but the red might be coming from hormones, if you’re a woman, or sun exposure.,
Give yourself the “jewelry test.”Again, you don’t want to compare colors against your face tones, so don’t use earrings for the jewelry test.,

Though your skin may grow lighter or darker depending on how tan you are (whether from purposeful tanning or just from seasonal sun exposure), your skin tone will remain constant.;
, If your skin color is light enough, you’ll be able to see the veins through the skin in these three locations.


If your veins have an olive or greenish color, you are warm-toned.
If your veins have a bluish color, you are cool-toned.
If you can’t really tell, or if there is a mix of both colors, you are neutral-toned.

Busty women have large breasts, but narrow hips and straight waists. They look best in dresses that draw attention to their faces and balance out their lower halves with a full or A-line skirt. Watch out that your skirt doesn’t get too short; it’ll make you look top-heavy.Pear-shaped women have wider hips and smaller breasts, with a well-defined waist. To create a balanced look, wear a dress which is strapless or has an open neck and has embellishments and detail around the neck or bust.A fitted waist is best, and a full or A-line skirt which is knee-length or lower will hide your wide hips—if you want to hide them.Apple-shaped women have long, slim legs and a short, undefined waist.

If you love your back, a dress with a low back or a beautiful keyhole will attract attention there. If you’ve got great legs, a shorter skirt or half skirt will let them take center stage.

, Depending on the event, some lengths may night be considered appropriate. If you’re going to a formal event, you will generally be expected to wear a longer dress (slits are generally okay, as long as they’re tasteful). At a more casual event, or a semi-formal event which calls for a cocktail or party dress, shorter skirts are acceptable, again, as long as they’re tasteful."

Place the most flattering colors nearest to your face.,
Try on accessories in the store as you try your dress on.,
Don't forget a bag.,
Select the shoes.,
Wear pantyhose.",How to Choose an Evening Dress by Color4," The color wheel is exactly what it sounds like: a big circle broken into different colors, which allows you to look at 12 colors at once. Each color on the wheel represents all shades of that color, so the green wedge on the color wheel represents dark, pale, and bright greens. Once you know the tricks of the color wheel, it can be super useful for figuring out which accessories in which colors will work best with the color of your dress.,
The color across from your dress color is its complementary color. A pair of complementary colors is vibrant and high-contrast, especially if you use bright shades of the colors. You should accessorize with complementary colors in small doses.
The colors next to your dress color are its analogous colors. These colors will work extremely well together and are easy to look at. To use analogous colors most effectively, choose one color to dominate (the dress) and one to support it (shoes, scarf, bag). If you want to use the third color, use it as an accent (small jewelry or details).
You may find it helpful to print out a copy of the color wheel and hang it up on the inside of your closet door. That way you can refer to it easily whenever you need to.
It’s generally a good idea to keep your outfit down to three main colors or fewer., When accessorizing, always place the colors that work best with your undertone (and eyes) nearest to your face—in accessories like your earrings, necklace, or scarf.

You can go simple and have the shoes match the rest of your outfit, or you can make the shoes your focal point and choose a color that stands out—try sparking red shoes with a little black dress for a unique but sleek look. And because shoes are as far from your face as you can get, they’re a great opportunity to rock a color that you love but that isn’t flattering on you.

, Hose can make your figure look smoother and thinner. Colored hose can also make your legs look longer when you match them to the color on your hem and shoes."

Women’s navy blue separates can often be matched with light grey garments for increased wear.

Dress to impress yourself.",How to Be Comfortable Wearing High Heels when You're Tall," If you don’t have much experience with wearing high heels, choose a lower heel to start. Start small, with a one inch heel, and continue increasing height as you become more comfortable walking. Once you’ve mastered the one inch heel, try a one and a half inch heel, and keep increasing your heel height by half of an inch.


If you want to try different kinds of heels without breaking the bank, try purchasing different types of shoes with heels that can be worn with different outfits. Start with a one inch heeled boot, then try a two inch heeled sandal, and eventually a three or four inch stiletto!;
, Heel height is not the only factor to consider when choosing the right heels for you. Shoes with a wedge or chunky heel can be much easier to walk in, especially if you’re unsure about your new footwear. Look for heels that will provide the support you need while you’re learning to walk in heels.


Wedge heels are a great option for a stable heel. Wedge heels come in a variety of heights and widths, and often times are significantly easier on your feet than other types of heels.
Stacked heels are wide enough that they are easy to walk in and also come in a variety of styles and heights.
Platforms are a great way to make heels feel shorter without losing any height. A four inch heel with a one inch platform gives the same stylish look, but feels more like walking in a three inch heel.

, A well made pair of high heels should cause minimal discomfort to the wearer, despite the stigma that suggest high heels are always uncomfortable. Don’t be afraid to purchase heels that are a size up or down from your regular size. Keep in mind that certain brands of heels may have a smaller fit and some have a larger fit.


Ask the retailer if they have high heels that contain hidden platform supports. Hidden platforms make heels easier to walk in, so you can feel confident and secure in your heels.
If it has been a while since you had your foot sized, ask the retailer to size your foot. Over time, the size of your foot may have changed, so having your foot professionally sized is always a good idea when investing in new shoes.

, When you’re trying on new heels, focus on how the width suits your foot. Certain high heeled shoes are better suited for those with a narrow foot, while some work better for a wide foot. Make sure you are measuring the length and width of your feet before determining which heels to purchase.


Heels with a boxed toe often work better for those with wider feet, while pointed toes often work better for a narrow foot.
If your feet are sized slightly differently, purchase the shoe size that is more suitable for the larger foot. You can always pad the other shoe with tissues or specialty padding material.There should be no extra space in between the sides of the shoe and your foot. Any extra space can cause sliding around, which may lead to blistering or discomfort., Make sure you are standing up straight, especially when you’re wearing your high heels. Maintaining good posture while you’re wearing your heels will make them easier to walk in. If you’ve made a habit of slouching to appear more petite, make an even stronger effort to stand tall!

, Once you’ve found the perfect pair of heels, strut your stuff! The key to wearing heels well is wearing heels that you love, that give your outfit a polished look, and that you are able to walk confidently in. Learning to walk in your heels perfectly takes practice, but it will all pay off when you’re getting compliments on your beautiful shoes.


When you’re wearing your heels, walk heel to toe. Make sure you’re setting your heel down first and then setting down the ball of your foot, as this will make your walk look natural and confident.Walk slowly and take small steps. Take your time when you’re walking in your new heels, so that you can avoid tripping over your feet.Lean slightly back when you’re walking, to counteract your body’s natural inclination to lean forward on your heels., Spend time at home walking on the balls of your feet without your heels, to strengthen your legs and ankles. Wear your heels around the house, so you can walk with confidence when you wear them out of the house. Make an effort to practice walking on a variety of floors, even going so far as to walk outside on pavement.

, Choose heels and outfits that you love and that make you feel good. When choosing your outfits to go with your new heels, ask yourself what look you want create. Heels are a great way to dress up a casual outfit, a stylish pair of high heels can make the most casual of outfits feel more elegant. High heels can also give you a boost if the hem of a dress or pant leg hangs a bit too low.


Wear high heels with skinny jeans to make your outfit appear less casual.
Try wearing a pair of high heeled boots with a skirt that falls around your thighs to showcase your beautiful boots.
Wear a pair of heels to elevate yourself in a dress that may be a touch too long to prevent the skirt from dragging and becoming damaged.

, If someone makes a rude comment about your height or your shoes, do your best to ignore them. Remember, you are not wearing heels to impress anyone, you are wearing them because you love how they look and how they make you feel. People who make rude comments about are often doing so because they are dealing with their own insecurities.


If someone says, “Do you really need to be any taller?” keep your cool and respond politely by saying, “No, but I do need to wear shoes that I love!”
If someone says, “Tall girls shouldn’t wear heels,” do not engage with them at all. If you feel compelled to respond, say something such as, “All girls should wear what makes them feel good about themselves,” and leave it at that. You know your shoes look great and don’t need to spend time convincing anyone else that they do.

, When you’re choosing the right pair of shoes, remember to choose a pair that are comfortable and that you love. Don’t feel obligated to wear high heels with any outfit. Instead, do so because they are the perfect finishing touch or focal point of your ensemble. If high heels make you feel strong and confident, then wear them as often as you like!

Love the person you are.",How to Get a Body Like Beyonce," Beyonce enjoys snacks to keep her energy levels up, foods such as fruit, oatcakes with cottage cheese, or yogurt-covered almonds.It's important not to skip meals; Beyonce aims for three meals with two snacks in between each day.Eat plenty of vegetables and fruit, whole grains, and two servings of fish each week.



Drink plenty of water, just like Beyonce.
Cut down on sugary foods, salty foods, and junk food, in general. But don't cut these out of your diet completely; after all, Beyonce allows herself treats occasionally, saying that ""When I'm being bad, I'm bad – burgers, pizza, French fries, the lot..."".Enjoy junk food in moderation now and then; just don't go overboard.
Provided you're exercising regularly, the aim is not necessarily to lose weight, and curves are good. The aim should be to tighten up your body with better nutrition.;
, Beyonce has to be able to handle the strenuous pace of dancing, singing, and touring. She works out five days a week and does 100 squats, 100 step-ups, and 100 walking lunges a day.Beyonce does circuit training, and runs two-and-a-half miles each day.If you enjoy running, this can be a great form of exercise. While you might find her schedule way too punishing unless you're doing a music tour too, you can borrow some of her ideas. For example, try choosing exercise that you can follow at least two days of the week; three is better. Have a day of rest between exercise days.You could try swimming, running, dancing, lifting weights, or doing aerobics, whatever exercise fits in with your working out strengths and is something that you enjoy.


Do your exercise to music. Beyonce suggests that this is how to make it fun,thereby motivating you a lot more.
Beyonce works out with weights, including 5 pound weights for bicep curls during an entire song, or 3 pound weights to box for the length of one music track.Beyonce loves cycling and dancing as fun ways to improve her fitness levels.
If nothing else, follow a walking program. Walking is easy, but it is one of the better overall exercises. Get one or more friends to walk with you for more fun and motivation.
Consider getting a personal trainer if you think this will help keep you focused and you can afford the expense.

, Beyonce has a goal and so too should you. She keeps a poster of an Oscar on the wall of her gym to inspire her to keep working at it.What's your goal? Perhaps it is to keep fit, or to stay healthy for all your life, or to get ahead in a career or hobby aspiration. Whatever your reason, ask yourself how will you represent this goal visually so that it can serve as a source of motivation for you. A poster, messages, or photos of your goal can all be good ways to inspire you. Be sure to put these in places where you'll be reminded often of the purpose of getting a great body.

, Beyonce works constantly to achieve her goals, including dancing all day long in high heels in order to get ready for a music tour.Set yourself regular exercise schedules that you can stick to, no matter what else is happening in your life.

, Beyonce has said that she ""wears skimpy outfits"" because she's ""proud of her body"".She's not afraid to show off what she's got, being proud to celebrate her body shape the way that it is. She accepts that she is not naturally skinny and she detests fad diets after trying them and finding they don't work.Take a leaf from her book and love your body the way it is and don't harm your health with fad dieting.


Love your curves. They are attractive and beautiful.

, Beyonce is renowned for wearing beautifully tailored clothes that make the most of her good features. If you can sew or get your clothes tailored to your own body shape, you'll find that you look your absolute best; clothes that fit properly flatter your body. Clothing off the rack is trying to fit a range of sizes that may or may not suit your own shape and this can be made worse by the broad-ranging belief that you should fit into a single size. The reality is that a good wardrobe may well be filled with the sizes that fit in each style of clothing you try on. That may mean that you have larger tops and smaller bottoms, or larger jacket and smaller blouse sizes. Don't make the mistake of preferring a smaller size in the hope it'll look better on you; something that looks too small will ironically make you appear larger! Get the sizing right and a lot of your quest to appear ""bootylicious"" is sorted.


Even jeans can be worn skin-tight with curves. Look for versions that are made with curves in mind, such as jeans with fake pockets around the thigh area, so that bulk is removed.Wear skinny jeans with high heels to elongate your look. The boot cut is also an excellent style for women with curves.If you can't figure out what looks best on you by yourself, invest in spending some time with a personal stylist to help you or search in stores and/or on the Internet for your body shape and what suits it.

, Don't seek to transform into Beyonce or be a dead ringer for her. You're a unique wonder in your own right and while she offers a great inspirational role model, your ideal image of her must be tempered by the realities of what's achievable with the body and lifestyle you've got. Love what you have and make the very most of it; use Beyonce's inspiration to motivate you to exercise regularly and to eat well.

Rather than focusing on the negative, challenge yourself to find positive things about your body.


Maybe you have your father's chin, or strong arms, or great vision. Your best features may not be the ones that others would recognize, but they make you who you are.
We tend to be our own worst critics, launching unreasonable and harsh critiques about our faces, bodies, and abilities. Do not allow yourself to say things to yourself that you would not say to a friend.;
, Affirmations are short statements that you can repeat to yourself (aloud or in your head) when you begin to feel self-doubt. They should only include positive words and should be short and succinct.Try standing nude in front of a full length mirror and making a list of all the things about your body that you like. Write these as declarative sentences.
Once you have become comfortable with affirmations about the parts you like, make a list of the parts of your body that you like the least, by writing ""My _____."" For instance, if you dislike the extra skin on your upper arms, you might write ""My arms."" Then, come up with at least one thing about teach body part that you are thankful for, and write it next to the body part to create a positive affirmation. For instance, you might write ""My arms are strong and work hard for me."" Others might include: ""My belly has given life and is a warm place for my children to cuddle.""

, When it comes to self-confidence, many people find that it is a lifelong challenge and not something that they can develop overnight. But acting as if you were confident even if you have self-doubt can still reap some of the rewards of confidence.


At home, spend time in the nude to normalize your relationship with your body. If you feel up to it, you might even consider working as a nude figure model to take your self-confidence up a notch and to help yourself become more comfortable in your own skin.
Wear the clothing and make-up you imagine yourself wearing if you had more confidence. Then practice good posture, squaring your shoulders and holding your head high. Speak up and look people in the eye. Others around you will notice how comfortable and confident you seem, and they will treat you like a person with self-confidence.
You will begin to believe it, too. The process of changing your self-perception can take a while, but with consistency and patience, if you act as if you had confidence and others treat you as if you had confidence, eventually you will find that you are no longer acting. Instead, it will be natural.

, Comparing yourself to others, especially celebrities, can be damaging to your self-confidence and self-esteem. There will always be those who have attributes that you don't have, and comparison can't change that. Instead it only expends emotional energy, wastes time, and puts you in a psychologically vulnerable place.


Comparison is really a form of judging. Instead of judging others' appearances, look at them as a whole person. Try to think positive thoughts about their personalities instead of judging how they look on the outside.

, Today, body image is developed earlier and earlier based on media consumption and socialization processes like daycare. In order to shield your child from negative body image issues later in life, you must begin early.Limit television consumption, and direct your child to shows that don't feature only physically stereotypical males or females. Look for healthy body sizes and characters that are not overly sexualized or valued primarily for their appearances.Be body positive in front of your children. Never criticize bodies (theirs, yours, or other people's) in front of your child. Even if you diet or exercise, be sure that you explain it as a choice to be healthy and active, rather than as a way to control your appearance or fix things you don't like about your body. Research has shown a connection between women's dieting behaviors and their daughters' likelihood to develop eating disorders and body dissatisfaction., Rather than obsessing about your physical appearance, commit to cultivating inner beauty. True inner beauty does not wrinkle or sag, never goes out of style, and will be remembered long after you are gone.


Think about what you value in a friend, and cultivate those attributes in yourself. For instance, if you make efforts to become trustworthy, honest, dependable, loyal, a good listener, and lighthearted, not only will you be developing your own inner beauty, but you will also attract similar people as friends.Give generously. Your time and resources are precious, and giving has deep psychological benefits for both you and the recipient of your generosity.Consider volunteering, sponsoring a child in need, or donating used toys and clothes. Take up a collection for the food bank or emergency infant services in your town. Or call the local hospital and see how to become a volunteer in the nursery or geriatric ward.

, A preoccupation with your body might mean you have too much time on your hands. It could also mean that the friends you are surrounded by are also preoccupied with their appearances, which is contributing to your own dissatisfaction.


Think about a sport, art, or social cause that you've always wanted to get involved with. Consider joining a local intramural team, taking knitting classes, or volunteering for a political campaign or at the animal shelter.
An added bonus of finding a new hobby or pass-time is that you will likely meet new people there who share your interests and can help redirect your focus off of your appearance and onto your shared hobby.

, Many things about your body are simply the result of your DNA and should be celebrated as unique aspects that make you who you are. Taking control of the areas that you can change can give you a sense of control and confidence.


Exercise. While your body has its own unique shape, you can tone and strengthen it in order to be healthier and have more energy. Even if you do not lose weight, exercise has psychological benefits, reducing stress, cultivating self-discipline, and improving self-image.Eat well. A balanced diet can improve your body's fitness and health, which will lead to more energy and confidence. Reducing sugar and carbs and ensuring that you have a healthy intake of good fats and protein can lessen symptoms of depression and anxiety and improve memory, weight, and heart health.Get adequate rest. Not only will this improve your body's functionality, but it will improve your emotional state as well, which might have the added benefit of helping you to be less critical of your appearance.
Respect yourself. Your body is a gift. Think about the things it has done for you! Whether you've given birth, hiked a mountain, or simply woke up this morning to another day, your body does amazing things for you.

, In order to develop self-acceptance of your body, you must first realize where your dissatisfaction originates. Your dissatisfaction is not just in your head; it is the result of ubiquitous social messages that you have received since you were a child.


We are not naturally self-conscious about our bodies. Very young children tend to be very unconcerned with their bodies' appearances, unless the media, adults, or other children draw their attention to it.
But by age 5, society has taught us that our appearances reflect our value, and many children begin to show signs of body dissatisfaction.Where do these social message originate?

, Our capitalist system operates by convincing you that you have needs, and then filling those needs through consumer purchases.


Think of all the products that are marketed to you on a daily basis in television, radio, internet, and print advertising: you stink! Buy this deodorant. Your jeans are out of style! Buy these new skinny jeans. Your teeth aren't straight! Spend several thousand dollars on orthodontics. The root message in nearly all consumer advertising is that you are not adequate on your own. A person who is perfectly happy with his or her body doesn't make a very good customer!
In fact, every media message is selling you an image. Celebrities and models are glamorous, beautiful, and thin, and they appear to be that way naturally. In fact, their airbrushed appearances mask hours of labor to achieve that ""perfect"" body: it takes hours in the gym every day and a whole team of makeup artists to maintain their image of perfection. Unless you have a ton of wealth and unlimited free time, comparing yourself to these unrealistic standards of beauty will always leave you feeling dissatisfied with yourself.
Celebrity culture plays a huge role in the maintenance of consumer culture. Think about how magazines and internet articles encourage you to ""get the look"" by purchasing particular make-up products or clothing or by altering your exercise routine.

, While its true that the media and broader social influences can impact your self-image, its also crucial that you surround yourself with positive people who don't contribute to your discomfort with your body.


Consider the people in your life whose opinions matter most to you. Do these people constantly talk about their appearance, worry about their weight, or adjust their hair or makeup? Does being with them make you feel comfortable and confident, or inadequate in some way?
What about your romantic partner, if you have one? Does he or she make critical remarks about your appearance, or does s/he build you up and compliment you? Critical comments from someone you care about can make it very difficult to build self-confidence, and can also be a warning sign of an emotionally abusive relationship. Consider eliminating toxic relationships from your life, or at least seek counseling to see if the relationship is worth salvaging.
If you have close friends who you consider a positive influence, ask them to help you build confidence by not pointing out your flaws (or theirs) and by highlighting areas that they think are your best assets. Remember, your best assets are not always physical!

, Although society wants us to focus on our bodies as if they are the most important part of our selves, the truth of the matter is that eventually, all of our bodies will grow old and wither. For now, they serve a purpose of helping us to achieve our goals in life.


What is it you want to accomplish in life? How will your body help you reach those goals?

You might also be able to secure the shirt with safety pins or fashion tape, so don't give up if you find one you really like. A tailor can also alter the shirt so it flatters your figure without gaping or pulling.

, While there are many theories and guidelines about how women with larger busts should dress, it is ultimately your decision and you should wear what you feel most comfortable and confident in. This will help you accept your large bust.

Do daily cardio exercise.,
Build and tone chest muscles.,
Learn about breast reduction surgery.,
Talk with your doctor or a medical professional about your concerns.,
Meet with a counselor.",How to Accept Having a Large Bust3," If you are having a hard time accepting your large bust and want to explore non-surgical options to reduce your bust size, focus on doing daily cardio exercises for 45 to 60 minutes. This will help you lose body fat, and since breast tissue is composed mostly of body fat, you will likely notice a reduction in your bust size, and improved general health.Since it can be uncomfortable for women with large busts to run and jog, try lower-impact cardio exercises such as walking, using an elliptical, or riding a bike.

, Building and toning your chest muscles, especially the pectorals, may decrease your bust size and help improve your overall health. Here are a few exercises that will tone and tighten your chest muscles:Push ups.
Barbell Bench Press.
Dips.
Even if you do not notice a reduction in breast size, these exercises can help tone and strengthen your body, preventing the back pain and discomfort that often plagues women with larger busts.
It’s a good idea to work with a personal trainer who can tailor a workout plan and recommend specific exercises to tone and tauten your chest.

, If you are unable to accept your large bust size or are experiencing health problems as a result of your bust size, conduct research on breast reduction surgery. This procedure, also known as reduction mammaplasty, removes excess tissue and skin from the breasts so they are reduced in size. If you are a teenager or young adult uncomfortable with their larger bust size, physicians usually recommend waiting on the surgery until your breasts are fully developed.
Some doctors also suggest waiting until you have had children or your family is complete since pregnancy leads to changes in breast tissue, which may impact the results of the surgery. Research suggests that breastfeeding after this surgery is also more difficult.
If you are considering breast reduction surgery, meet with a board-certified plastic surgeon to discuss the procedure, learn about the cost, and decide if you think it would improve your health and body image.

, Before you decide that surgery is the best way to deal with a larger bust, talk with your doctor or a medical professional about your concerns. If your large bust size is affecting your health or causing you discomfort, your doctor might have a way to address these issues and alleviate these problems.

, If you are struggling to accept your large bust, consider meeting with a counselor or mental health professional. They can provide support and advise you about how you can learn to accept your body.


While it is natural to feel unhappy about a certain aspect of your physical appearance, if these thoughts become overwhelming and interfere with your daily life, you may be experiencing body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). People with this condition tend to focus on or obsess over a perceived flaw in their physical appearance. A mental health professional will be able to diagnose and treat this condition."

A good non-hormonal birth control option is the copper IUD, which is good for 7-10 years.
Remember that other hormonal factors can also increase bust size, like pregnancy and breast feeding. These are temporary and should not be combated.;
, If your are older than 35, and even if you are younger, breast cancer may play a role in large breasts that are disproportionate. If one breast is significantly larger than the other and uneven or you can feel a lump, please get this checked out by a doctor.

, Talk to your doctor about medical ways that may reduce your breast size. There may be medications or natural remedies that can help, but these will usually be give only after other methods have been tried first.

, Don't worry about surgery if you're young. You struggle now but with time you will come to love your body and your breasts. Surgery should only be considered if your breasts cause you significant pain and back or neck problems. It is, however, an option and may even be covered by health insurance (depending on the situation).

, If you do not have outstanding medical causes for large breasts, the most likely solution will be to lose weight. If you are already thin, this should not be considered. If, however, you are overweight, then losing weight will not only significantly reduce your bust size but it will also improve your health and experience of life in general.


You'll find advice on how to lose weight in a healthy way in the later sections.

, In order to lose weight, you'll have to create a calorie deficit. Calories are our body's fuel, and when you eat fewer of them then your body is forced to start burning fat. You can do this by matching your activity level to your diet, your diet to your activity level, or doing a little bit of both (this is the healthiest option of all).


This calorie deficit is only temporary. Once you reach your target weight, you should balance your calorie intake with your activity level.

, A great place to start is by minimizing how much salt, unhealthy fat, and sugar you eat in your diet. Salt causes your body to retain water and bloat, sugar contains inefficient calories that make you more hungry, and fat...well...that doesn't need explaining.


Salt is found in canned soup broth, many meats (hot dogs, salami, and bacon, mostly), pizza, chips, and many other foods. Your sodium intake should be less than 2300 mg per day. Don't cut it out entirely, however: salt is necessary for your body to run properly, especially once you start exercising.
Sugar is found readily in candy, of course, but you can also find it in many commercial coffees (like Starbucks), soda, and juice. Even eating too much fruit can tip you over on sugar!
Unhealthy fats are things like trans and saturated fats, found in red meat, butter, mayo, and fried foods. Healthy fats, such as unsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, are good for you and found in foods like fish and nuts.

, Eating foods that are rich in nutrients will help make you feel naturally more full from eating less food. Just switching to fruits and veggies won't be enough: there is a world of difference between a celery stalk and broccoli.


Nutrient rich grains include oatmeal, quinoa, barley, and brown rice. If you're buying bread, make sure to get whole grain and not multi-grain. Whole grain is the healthier option of the two, with no nutritional benefit over white bread for multi-grain.
Nutrient rich vegetables and fruit include lemons, cranberries, bananas, kale, spinach, broccoli, asparagus, and brussels sprouts.
The best protein sources are chicken, fish, eggs, nuts and beans. These are low in unhealthy fats, while still containing the protein that you'll need to power through your day and exercise routine.
Good dairy products include non-fat plain yogurt (spice it up with fresh fruit), cottage cheese, and non-fat milk.

, You'll need to not only eat healthy foods; you also have to eat them in the right proportions. You body needs lots of carbohydrates from grains, and lots of vitamins and fiber from vegetables, a certain amount of protein, and much less sugary fruit and dairy. See the official recommendations for how to balance your diet, and avoid fad diets which recommend only eating one or limited food groups. Your body needs all of these food groups in order to stay healthy!

, Most people eat way too much food at once. Eating too much food stretches your stomach and makes you feel hungry, even when your body doesn't need any more food! Use a side plate instead of a dinner plate in order to help you properly portion your food. If you're still hungry 15 minutes after you finish your first plate, then you can have another half-portion of food.


It's important to learn how to communicate with your body. Really analyze how you feel. Are you really still hungry? There's a big difference between feeling full and feeling stuffed, but we can be trained to forget what one feels like over the other through overeating.
Avoid restaurants and if you do eat out, ask for a doggie bag. Almost all restaurants serve way too much food in one sitting. Another option is to order just an appetizer. This is usually closer to a healthy portion of food.

, Eating more often can help you feel less hungry. It's also better for your metabolism, since this is how humans are designed to eat (the gatherer portion of hunter-gatherer). Eat smaller meals more frequently throughout the day in order to help you stick to that lower daily calorie count.


For example, eat a small bowl of oatmeal in the morning, a banana around 10am, a turkey sandwich for lunch, a bowl of cottage cheese and a slice of toast for a mid-afternoon snack, and a salad for dinner.

, It's important to understand that while some diets, trainers, and exercises may promise to take fat off of just one area: they're lying or very confused. It is impossible to target fat removal on your body through exercise. The only thing you can do is to lose fat overall. The same is true whether you're trying to reduce your tummy or make your bust smaller. You'll have to exercise your whole body if you want to achieve your goal.


This is why if you're already pretty thin, exercise and diet can't reduce your bust size. Your body has already burned as much of that fat as it can.

, You don't have to spend 10 hours a week at the gym just to slim down. You can increase your body's use of calories just by getting generally more active and a great, easy way to do this is by walking. Walking for at least 15 minutes at a time for at least 30 total minutes a day can play a significant role in weight loss.


A good way to get some walking in is to stop taking elevators and escalators and instead using the stairs.
Another basic option is to walk further to get to the places you need to go. Choose the furthest parking spot at the mall or at your office or school and take the chance to fit in some walking.

, You can easily burn a couple extra calories by exercising while you do your normal activities. Get a standing or treadmill desk for work and sit on an exercise ball instead of a chair. You can also fit some exercises seamlessly into your daily activities, like doing a couple of squats while you wait for the microwave or before you get into bed. Every little bit helps!

, Exercising as a way of getting around is another good way to fit exercise into your day. You can bike to work or school, walk to the grocery store, or walk or jog to work, if you've got space to get cleaned up afterwards.


If you've got a lot of distance to cover, try taking a bus part of the way and then biking or jogging the rest.

, A lot of people lose steam on exercise because they do things like sit ups, which are difficult to do and don't work very efficiently, meaning it takes a long time to see results. Efficient exercises will take a smaller chunk out of your day, making them easier to do consistently, while still achieving impressive results.


Efficient exercises include squats, planks, and burpees, all of which you'll find described in this article.

, Staying motivated is crucial to making exercise work because you have to be consistent and you have to make it a long term part of your life. 30 day diets and exercise plans will work for a short time but the fat (and big bust) will just come right back. Stay motivated by doing exercises that you enjoy in a way that can at least reasonably fit into your lifestyle.


For an added boost, listen to music while you exercise or exercise with a partner. This can do wonders for helping you get ""into the mood"" and sticking to your plan.

, A high quality, maximum support sports bra is probably the most basic way to hold in your bust and reduce it most comfortably. Buy these from reputable brands for the most effect. Low quality sports bras will wear out quickly and stop having an effect.

, You can also buy normal bras that can ""reduce"" the bust in that they do not do anything to make it look bigger. These are called minimizing bras. Again, high quality from a good brand is your friend here. These mainly only work with busts in the C-DD range, however.

, Simply wearing a minimally lined bra in the correct size can have roughly the same effect as a much more expensive minimizing bra. This will also be more comfortable than any other option and is just generally good advice.


It is estimated that 80% of women wear the incorrect bra size, for example. , If you're really desperate and other options aren't working, you can try chest binding. Never use Ace Bandages to bind, as they are meant to compress sprains and bones and will disfigure your ribs and lungs. Instead, consider buying a chest binder made for transgender individuals, which are safe.


No matter what you use, do not bind for more than 6-8 hours.
This trick will not work for women with extremely large breasts. It works best for those who wear a US B-DD cup. Anything larger and it is unlikely to make much of a dent.

, Of course, you should never let something cosmetic affect what clothing you wear in terms of style. You have the right to dress like you. But some small adjustments can make a huge difference in how your chest looks.


Avoid clothing that is too tight, although you do want to choose clothes that fit (aren't baggy).
You should also avoid wearing a cut that accentuates your chest, such as natural waist items, cowl neck tops, or tops with puckers and gathers at the bust.
Instead of these items, accentuate your hips. This will make your breasts appear smaller by comparison.

Find the right size.,
Make an adhesive bra if you have a very petite bust.,
Wear a balconette bra if you have a small to medium bust.,
Wear a bra with an underwire if you have a medium to large bust.,
Wear a push up bra for dramatic cleavage.,
Wear a bustier for both figure and cleavage accentuation.",How to Accentuate Cleavage1," Use a cloth measuring tape to measure your band size (under your bust, across your ribcage, and under your arms) and your bust size (the fullest part of your breasts). To deduce your cup size, subtract your band size from your bust size and use the total difference to refer to a standard cup sizing chart, such as https://www.realsimple.com/beauty-fashion/clothing/shopping-guide/how-to-measure-bra-size/calculate-your-cup-size.


You can also drop by or schedule a bra fitting at any lingerie boutique or department store. The clerk will measure your band size, bust size, and determine your cup size. ;
, Adhesive bras are stretchy, sticky strips of rayon that provide backless support. Cut the adhesive bra one to two inches from the bottom and remove the backing on the remaining piece. While pressing your breasts together with one hand, apply the sticky side of the adhesive strip against the outer edge of one breast (close to the areola), run it on the underside of both breasts, and around the edge of the second areola. If you don’t plan to wear a cloth bra over the adhesive bra you can wear pasties (nipple stickers).

, This is a type of demi bra, also referred to as an unlined bra, that supports your bust from beneath without showing harsh lines through your top. The balconette provides ample push, but lacks the restraining security for larger bust sizes.

, Underwire bras not only help avoid the dreaded droop that bustier women struggle with, but they also provide an extra “boost and press” that accentuates your natural cleavage curve., Push up bras come in various amplification sizes that offer a simple yet effective way to accentuate cleavage for any bust size. They are designed to lift and press your breasts together to create the desired double arch effect, but provide more security than a balconette or adhesive bra.

, A bustier is an undergarment that gently draws in your mid-section and upper torso via a stretch satin or rayon material, while providing cupped support for your bust. These undergarments are designed to accentuate your bust by tightening your mid-section and pressing your breasts upwards. "

Wear plunging necklines.,
Try a crop top to enhance bust size.,
Go with horizontal stripes.,
Wear bottoms with high waists and figure hugging dresses.,
Try styling your hair out of the frame.,
Wear a bold necklace or pendant.",How to Accentuate Cleavage2," Purchase tops and dresses with V shaped and deep necklines that expose your cleavage area. Make sure to choose an appropriate neckline for your specific bust size. Women with larger busts should consider a supported V neck, while smaller busts are complemented by support and depth effects. , Crop tops instantly draw the eye upward to the bust. The design of the crop top provides a natural drape over the breasts, which accentuates a smaller bust and makes it appear larger. A high-necked crop top will accentuate breast size rather than cleavage. If you wear a crop top make sure to incorporate a low neckline.

, Horizontal stripes have an effect of widening areas of the body. Wearing a top that has horizontal stripes exclusively across the bust area will create a more voluminous look. , A plunging neckline isn’t the only garment style that draws attention to cleavage. Pants and skirts with chic and flattering high waists and dresses that cling to the mid-section draw the eye inward and upward. They also emphasize an hour glass figure, which naturally accentuates the bust. , Hair is a great accessory, yet can be distracting. Styling your hair away from your face and neckline, such as a bun, pony tail, or twist, will help cleavage stand out as a central asset., Just as a plunging neckline attracts the eye, necklaces with bright colors, large pendants, or beautiful designs naturally draw the interest of onlookers. Placement of your jewelry is key. Make sure that the pendant or necklace swoop lays strategically at the crest of your cleavage or along the upper curve of your breast.

Use a bronzer to highlight your bust line.,
Use a self-tanning lotion for the summer months.,
Go to a tanning salon for professional contour tanning.",How to Accentuate Cleavage3," Dark bronzer across the top of the breast will define your breast shape, while a lighter, slightly gold hue dusted between your breasts will create depth. Put on your bra before applying makeup. If possible, get completely dressed and protect clothing in the area where you'll be applying the makeup with some facial tissue or toilet paper.

, Use a powder puff to apply a light layer of self-tanner to the area below your collar bone and over your bust. Next, use a makeup applicator pad to apply a second layer of self-tanner directly to the collar bone, breast arch, and cleavage crevice. This layer will dye your skin darker in key areas creating the illusion of rounder, larger breasts. After blending harsh lines with a clean makeup brush, use a hair dryer set on cool to quickly set and dry the tanner. With the powder puff, draw crescent moons along the natural curve of each breast as you are blending the first layer of self-tanner.
After the second application, dab baby powder in the middle of your breasts to slow the darkening process.

, Professional tanning salons are now offering specialized contouring services. Using spray tanner, the spray tan artist will highlight your nature curves with lines of bronze, which create depth. "

Know if your posture makes your breasts look larger today, or not.,
Practice having good posture.,
Build up your upper pectoral muscles (working out lower pecs will actually decrease your bust size).,
Focus on your waist.",How to Make Small Breasts Look Bigger1," Do the mirror test. Looking in the mirror sideways, see if you can draw a straight line from your earlobe through your shoulder, hip, knee, to the middle of your ankle. If you can draw this line, your posture will make your breasts look bigger and perkier, as well as making you look slimmer and taller.;
, This is by far the least expensive and fastest way to make your breasts look bigger. Do the mirror exercise several times a day to correct your posture. It is more important to build ""muscle memory"" so that you unconsciously and naturally maintain correct posture without fatigue.

, Increasing the bulk of the muscles beneath your breasts will make them appear firmer and more rounded. Regular push-ups are one way to achieve this; build up slowly until you can manage to drop and do 15 push-ups all at once. There are also many weight training exercises you can do to build chest muscles.

, Slimming and shaping your core (the muscles around your waist and ribs) will make your breasts appear larger by comparison, without actually adding any breast tissue. Try yoga and pilates exercises that can help you burn calories while simultaneously strengthening your core muscles.


Note that losing weight cannot make your breasts smaller. So, don't worry about it.

"
Wear the right bra size.,
Know how to put on a bra correctly.,
Wear bras that enhance your breasts.",How to Make Small Breasts Look Bigger2," Sadly, most women wear incorrect bra sizes because they've never been appropriately measured. The right bra should sit snugly beneath your breasts and cup all of the tissue closely, as well as making it easier for you to stand up straight. Measure your bra size yourself, or go in for a free professional fitting at a department store. (Don't feel shy about being professionally fitted––usually the ladies who do fittings are chosen for their warm and accepting demeanor. Remember, she's probably seen it all.)


A bra that is too big, will look lumpy.
Ditto for stuffing tissue or other things into your bra. Don't do it, it will look funny. If you want to put something into your bra, try one of the other methods below.

, Once you've been properly sized, check that you're putting on your bra in a way that will achieve maximum lift and comfort. Slip the straps over your arms, facing forward, so that the unhooked clasps are at your back. Bend over so that all of your breast tissue falls forward, and maneuver the bra over your breasts. Still bent over, reach back and clasp the bra. Adjust the band and straps as necessary.

, There are many options available, so the best way to work out what gives you your desired effect is to go and try lots of different types on. The following types of bras are the best for women wanting bigger breasts:


Push-up bras are designed to push your breasts up (as the name implies), and move the breasts closer together, creating more cleavage. They push the breasts up using padding usually made of foam. The best known brand for making push-up bras is Wonderbra. However, most lingerie stores supply some variety of push-up bra.
Padded bras, like push-up bras, contain foam padding in the cups. They are designed to give fuller-looking breasts to small-chested women, but don't lift them or create extra cleavage.
Gel, air or water padded bras are the same as padded bras but are designed to look and move more naturally, and to give a more noticeable enhancement. The only downside to these is that they often cost more money. Also, air padded bras often need the padding replaced as the air leaks out.
Many women report good success from the Chicken Fillet silicone bra insert.

"
"
Wear clothes with a detailed neckline.,
Use patterns and colors to your advantage.,
As a last resort, use makeup to create the impression of larger breasts.",How to Make Small Breasts Look Bigger3," Lace, ruffles and jewels, gathered material, pleats, ruching and twists are some examples of neckline details that enhance breast size appearance. These sorts of details provide a visual boost and help to make the breasts appear larger. When wearing ruffles, be careful that they are not so big that they overpower the size of your breasts; this risks going the other direction and making them look smaller!


Stay away from low V or low scoop necklines, as give the appearance of shrinking the size of your breasts. Instead, wear moderately high, asymmetrical, crew or gathered necklines. These are the most flattering for women with smaller breasts as they enhance their shape and make them appear bigger.
Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing. Obviously, such clothing reveals all––what is and what is not there. Loose, roomy tops and layers are a better choice when you don't want to draw attention to smaller breasts.

, Appropriate patterns and colors can help to change the way the proportions of your body look. Generally, light colors make something look larger, and dark colors make something look slimmer:


If you're wearing patterns or bright or light colors, then wear them on your torso, not your bottom half. Wear duller colors on your bottom half to help make your figure look more in proportion.
Wear dark trousers and a top with horizontal stripes to make your hips appear narrower––your breasts will appear larger in comparison. The top should be in light colors.

, Put a darker shade of foundation than your usual shade where you want shading to go to give the impression of cleavage. However, this is not recommended for everyday use since it could smudge and look odd. But, for photos, or for a special occasion, it may be worth giving a go. Don't rush it, you'll feel uncomfortable if somebody realizes that you've painted your cleavage on.

Live with the reality.,
If you are a teen, your breasts may get larger naturally.",How to Make Small Breasts Look Bigger4," Small breasts aren't the burden they may seem to you. For starters, not everyone loves large breasts. Indeed, it's an exaggeration that men only like women with large breasts––everyone has their own preference. Moreover, small breasts tend to hold up best over time, and gravity tends to be lot kinder to the small-breasted woman as you age; you'll sag a lot less than your big-breasted sister. As long as you are healthy, try to be happy with your body.

, It may seem like it will never happen, but it just might!


There is many a teen girl who at 16 thinks her breasts will always be small, but finds out at 20 they are not. It just happens.
You may find your breasts get larger and stay that way after pregnancy and breast feeding. It tends to be all over the map, some report breast sizes increase, some decrease, some decrease and then increase.

Concentrate on health--not just looks.,
Know that muscles are not everything.,
Deal with pressure from people you know.,
Realize you’re not alone.,
Be skeptical of idealised images.,
Consider counselling.",How to Feel Comfortable Having Small Muscles1," Big, masculine muscles are considered indicators of strength and health. However, while there is some truth to this, many very strong and healthy individuals do not look like body builders.


Look at a variety of athletes; the type of muscles develops depends quite a bit on the sport trained for. Weightlifters will look quite different than divers, speed-skaters, or professional dancers. But all have to be strong and healthy.
Many athletic people are not ""ripped"". While a very dedicated athlete likely has a great physique, even good amateur athletes are not necessarily outstandingly muscular. In fact, many athletes (such as marathoners) tend to look scrawny rather than brawny.
Think of reasons to exercise other than your physical appearance.
Exercising to have fun, relieve stress, improve concentration or vitality, or socialize creates a better relationship with your body and exercise.;
, For men especially, focus on a muscular appearance tends to be the ideal. But this narrow focus tends to ignore the fact that rippled muscles are not the only feature that people find attractive.


Just as men find attraction in different features, women do too. Some women swoon over big biceps. But others prefer a more slight build. Others are more impressed by other things. Women are diverse in what they find attractive...not just muscles.
Different physical attributes are good for different things. Very large and muscular people often lack the flexibility, agility and coordination of someone with a slighter frame.
Not everyone excels at sports and physical activities, and many people do not have that as a requirement for attraction..
Remember that other talents attract romantic partners. Playing the guitar, being a great dance partner, being able to get a computer working can all be just as ""sexy"" as a muscular body. , Sometimes the hardest pressure you can come under about your body is from people you know, especially friends and family. We learn from the people with whom we spend the most time, so if you grow up in a house of people who take body image very seriously, you are likely to feel under more pressure to conform to this standard.


The same is true for your friendship groups, where you are likely to spend time talking about clothes and appearance.
Despite pressures you may feel to go along with what others say and do, remember that these standards are created and not fixed or natural.
Try to spend time with people who have a healthy relationship with their bodies, physical activity, and food., If you have a negative body image, you are not alone. It has been suggested that around half of men don’t like to be photographed or seen in swimwear.Other research has revealed that a majority of men feel that part of their body is not muscular enough. The research also reported that more men than women would sacrifice at least a year of their life in exchange for what they perceived to be a perfect body.


More than half of those surveyed said body talk affected them.
63% said that they thought their chest or arms were not muscular enough.The high percentages of men unsatisfied with their bodies reflects the prevalence of idealised images and the difficulty of achieving them in reality.

, If you want to try to develop a positive body image, it’s important to try to think critically about the idealised physiques that are so prevalent across culture and society. It can be very difficult to escape these images, so rather than trying to avoid them altogether, be appropriately skeptical about what they are presenting.Realize that advertising images do not reflect reality; they are something created to try and make you want to buy something.
Whereas women typically feel under pressure to lose weight, men generally feel under pressure to gain more muscle mass.Remember that photographs in magazines and advertising are often altered and Photoshopped, with imperfections removed, muscles enhanced, etc., If you find that you are very down about your body, and your mood is negatively affected when you think about how you look, consider getting some professional counselling or guidance. This is especially recommended if you find yourself developing destructive and harmful behaviours, such as compulsive exercise or binge eating.


Contact your doctor in the first instance and explain how you are feeling.
Your doctor may refer you to a counsellor who can talk through everything with you, and help you take steps to develop a healthier body image."

Determine the contributory factors.,
Learn about physiology and genetics.,
Consider potential knock-on effects.",How to Feel Comfortable Having Small Muscles2," Body image, both positive and negative, is shaped by a number of different factors and experiences. Most immediately, comments you hear from people you know about their own, or other people’s bodies, will influence how you think of your own body. The ideas that we ourselves develop about physical appearance, and how we compare ourselves to others, also have a major impact. Other contributory factors include:


Exposure to images of idealised physiques, as opposed to more normal bodies.
Any experiences of physical, emotional, or sexual abuse.
Experiences of prejudice or discrimination based on ability, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, gender identity.
A range of sensory experiences, including pleasure, pain, and illness., The typical image of a “ripped” man, with 6-pack abs and highly muscular yet lean physique is reproduced everywhere from advertising to action figures. This image of masculinity does necessarily represent an achievable reality for everybody, no matter how much they work out. It is physiologically impossible to gain unlimited pounds of muscle mass while maintaining a lean physique.


Once you reach your optimal muscle mass, any further weight gain will be from fat as well as muscle.Men who are bigger, with larger muscle mass, do tend to have higher body fat percentages too.It may seem like attaining an idealised version of your body just takes hard work and commitment, but genetics are also a major influence.
You can be fit, strong and healthy without looking like a fitness model or action figure., A negative body image is increasingly prevalent amongst men, and research suggests that body anxiety can have significantly harmful effects beyond self-esteem and image. In particular, research has shown that a negative body image can impact a man’s sexual well-being. In some cases it was considered a contributory factor to more aggressive and risky sexual behaviour.A heightened concern about body image and being insufficiently muscular has also been found to put people at greater risk of dangerous practices to alter their bodies.
Things such as extreme dieting, compulsive exercise, steroid abuse, and laxative abuse have all been linked with body image anxieties."

Determine if you are underweight.,
Reach a healthy weight.,
Increase your strength and flexibility.",How to Feel Comfortable Having Small Muscles3," If you feel that your physique is small, there is a chance that you are actually underweight. The health dangers of being overweight are well-known, but there are also significant problems attached to being underweight. Evaluate whether you are underweight and consider steps to develop a healthier physique. This isn’t about becoming a bodybuilder, but is about being healthy and happy.


Use a BMI healthy weight calculator to assess your weight and size, like the one here.
If you are underweight you may not be getting enough calories, which can leave you tired and lethargic.
Being underweight can mean your body lacks the nutrients to develop fully. Your immune system will also suffer, making you more susceptible to illness., If you are underweight you should aim to gradually gain weight until you reach the recommended level for your age and height. This doesn’t mean eating a lot of fatty and sugar-filled foods to pile on the pounds. Doing this will increase your body fat, rather than your lean body mass. You should instead try to eat three meals a day, and three snacks a day, which are based on the principles of a healthy balanced diet.


High-energy foods are particularly effective if you are trying to gain weight.
Try oatmeal with whole milk for breakfast, with smoothies for snacks.
For lunch, a baked potato with tuna gives you lots of energy.
Peanut butter on wheat toast is a great high-energy snack to have between meals if you want to put on some weight., Achieving a healthy weight and physique does not mean building enormous muscles. Having a toned, athletic, and flexible body will help you stay healthy. Try to couple strength exercises, such as push up, squats, and crunches, with exercises that improve your flexibility, such as yoga or pilates.


Remember: you should not try to emulate an idealised or unattainable physique.
Think about how physically fit you feel, rather than what you look like.
Exercising regularly will help keep your body healthy. Try to do some muscle-strengthening exercises twice a week."

To say ""hey,"" say ""hej."",
Say ""witam"" when you are greeting guests and you are the host.,

To say ""goodnight,"" say ""dobranoc."",
To say ""how are you?"",
To say ""goodbye,"" say ""do widzenia."",
Say ""thank you"" when asked how you're doing.",How to Say Hello in Polish," This very common, albeit somewhat informal greeting, is pronounced roughly like ""cheh-sh-ch."" Non-Poles may find it difficult to pronounce this word correctly. Following a ""sh"" sound with a ""ch"" sound is something that is almost never done in English.


""Cześć"" is a little informal to use in serious social situations. While it's fine for friends and family members, some etiquette-conscious Poles may be offended if you use it the very first time you meet them.""Cześć"" may also be used to say ""bye."";
, This greeting, which literally translates to ""good day,"" is pronounced as ""jayn DOH-bry."" The first syllable in this phrase sounds almost like ""Jane."" The final ""y"" sounds like the ""i"" in ""fin,"" ""dinner,"" and ""sick.""


This is a more formal way to say ""hello,"" and is suitable for situations where you're dealing with people that you don't know, or that you know in a professional context (e.g., customers, bosses, teachers, etc.)
""Dzień dobry"" can also mean ""good morning.""

, This is pronounced as ""DOH-bry VYEH-choorh."" ""Dobry"" is pronounced the same way as in ""dzień dobry."" The W at the beginning of ""wieczór"" is pronounced like a V, not an English W.


As in English, this greeting is used when meeting people after the sun has begun to go down but before it has gotten completely dark. ""Dobry wieczór"" has the same level of formality as ""dzień dobry.""

, This is pronounced exactly like the English ""hey."" It is a very familiar and informal greeting. You won't want to use it for formal situations or people that you're interested in maintaining a professional relationship with. It is best used among close friends.


""Hey"" in Polish works the same as saying ""hey"" in English.

, This word is pronounced as “vee-tahm.” The W in the first syllable is pronounced like the English V. The second syllable has a soft ""ah"" sound, as in ""apartment.""


""Witam"" is not always an appropriate greeting, especially to strangers. It can subtly imply that you occupy a higher social station than the person you're talking to. It is best reserved for when you are greeting guests to your home., Unlike what is common in many English-speaking countries today, for Polish people, it's not typical to greet someone you've never met before as if you are already friends.Greetings are more reserved and formal than what many English-speakers are a little used to. Thus, it's often best to use the more formal greetings at your disposal, such as ""dzień dobry,"" rather than risking an informal ""hej"" or ""cześć.""


Of course, once you've gotten to know someone, you can usually progress to the informal greetings for casual conversations. However, unless you're a confident Polish speaker, you may want to play things safe and follow the lead of the person you're talking to.

, Respect is an important concept when it comes to greetings in Polish society—especially those occurring in a business/formal setting. Because of this, you will want to address the people you meet by their proper titles until you are invited to address them on a first-name basis.If you don't know the honorific for the person you are talking to, use ""Pan"" for men and ""Pani"" for women.


""Pan"" has a soft ""ah"" sound to it, as in ""apartment.""
""Pani"" starts out just like ""Pan,"" but has a long ""e"" sound at the end, as in ""bee"" or ""see.""
Polish last names ending in ""ski"" change depending on gender. Polanski would be used for a man, while Polanska would be used for a female.
Don't be offended if you don't get invited to address someone by his or her first name. Getting invited into this ""inner circle"" is a big social step to Poles. Many business and professional relationships go on for years before ""making the jump.""

, When attending a social event, such as a party or a business meeting, it's important etiquette to greet everyone that you encounter in the room. Passing someone over, or not acknowledging him or her, can be seen as rude and disrespectful. Traditionally, women are greeted first in Polish society. Usually, your host will handle the introductions, so you probably won't have to worry about this.

, You will also want to shake hands (again, with eye contact) upon leaving as well.

If you are male, and the woman you are greeting extends her hand to you (palm down), you may take it, bow down, and give it a delicate kiss; never lift the woman's hand to your lips. This is a little old-fashioned, but still considered good etiquette., While adult males and teenagers who aren't well acquainted typically greet with a handshake, people who know each other well will often greet one another with a friendly kiss on the cheek. This isn't a sign of romantic affection at all. It can be done innocently by almost any combination of two people as long as they're close (e.g., people of different sexes, people of the same sex, siblings, parents and their children, and so on.)


In Poland, it is customary to use two to three kisses: first on the right cheek, then on the left, then on the right again.
Hugs are almost common among Polish people. Don't be alarmed if an overly friendly host gives you one as though you were an old friend.

, When visiting someone's home, it is not uncommon for the guest to bring a small gift, such as cut flowers, sweets, or alcohol. Flowers are the most common and expected, however. If you are bringing flowers, try to pick out an odd number instead of an even one.Do not bring chrysanthemums, which are often used for funerals.
Skip on the very expensive gifts, as this might embarrass the host.
Do not be offended if you are a host and do not receive a gift. On the other hand, if you do receive a gift, be sure to thank your guest, and to open the gift.

, In Polish, a rude person who ignores social etiquette is called ""prymitywny"" (literally, ""primitive."") Luckily, avoiding this label is simple: just give an honest effort to greet the people you meet with respect and treat them with the courtesy and kindness you'd want for yourself. Unless you're an excellent Polish speaker, you'll probably make a few minor breaches of etiquette in during your time in a Polish-speaking community. As long as you do your best to be polite and acknowledge your mistakes, you'll be fine. Anyone who gives you grief for minor slip-ups in a language you're not familiar with is prymitywny.

, This is pronounced as ""doh-BRAH-nohts."" The ""oh"" sounds are soft, as in ""ocean."" The a is a soft ""ah"" sound, as in ""apartment.""


This word is used similarly to the way you'd use ""good night"" in English—you can say it to someone as you depart at night, right before you go to bed, and so on., say ""jak się masz?"" In many languages, it's customary to ask how someone is after saying ""hello."" Polish is no different. This phrase is pronounced as “yahk sheh mash.” Both of the ""a"" sounds are soft ""ahs,"" as in ""apartment.


This is also informal, and is best used after ""cześć"" or ""hej."" It's not suitable after more formal greetings, such as ""Dzień dobry"" or ""dobry wieczór.""

, When it's time to leave, use this phrase, which is pronounced ""doh veed-ZEN-yah."" The only item of note here is that the W here receives the customary V pronunciation. The rest of the word is fairly easy to sound out. It's pronounced almost how it would be if it were an English.

, If you want to really impress your Polish hosts, offer this up when someone asks you how you are doing after the initial greetings. The implication here is that, by asking about you, someone has shown an interest in your affairs. By saying ""thank you,"" you are graciously acknowledging their interest and paying them a social courtesy in return.


""Dziękuję"" is pronounced like ""jen-KOO-yeh.""
""Proszę"" (prosh-eh) means ""please."" It can also mean ""you're welcome"" if it follows ""dziękuję.""
""Dobrze"" (doh-b-jeh) means ""good.""
""Bardzo dobrze"" (bard-zoh doh-b-jeh) means ""very good.""

Pronunciations come after the word inside /.../; please come to them after finishing this ""How to."",

Note also that in Italian all vowels are pronounced.,
Notice that all the Italian words end to a, e, i, and o.",How to Pronounce Italian Words1,"
vowels (vocale /vo-ka-le/),
consonants (consonante /kon-so-nan-te/),
double (doppio /dop-pjo/) consonants,
silent (muto /mu-to/).;
, Some vowels come as diphthong similar to American pronunciation of letter 'a' in ""hand,"" contrasted with British (diphthongs are also called as double vowels).

, For example,


'e' in English word ""mate"" is not pronounced, but it is a hint to contrast it with mat. In English this hint already was in the form of a diphthong, ""mayt"" which still exists in ""Cockney"" British accent.
The same 'e' in Italian ""pane"" (bread /pa-ne/) keeps 'a' without hint and is pronounced independently: 'a' like 'a' in English ""car"" and 'e' sounds like 'a' in English ""pay"".

,


Few words end to u.

A sounds like the ä in ""Father""
E is pronounced like è in ""Vendor""
I like ï in ""Naive""
U is ù as in ""Goo"".;
, Many Italians have some difficulty in pronouncing the English ""th"", and so pronounce it as either ""t"" (as in ""Think""), or ""d"" (as in ""The""), respectively.

, Since you are pretending to be a foreigner your working knowledge of the vocabulary would not be complete.

, In Italian, words such as ""Azzurro"", ""Pollo"", or other words with double consonants are pronounced twice as long as single consonants. Thus, it would be ""Bet-ter"" and not ""bedder"".

, This is an optional step, and obviously not done every time. The Italian language uses it, and thus, Italians are familiar with it. Example: ""You are going later, no?""

Study in frequent short bursts.,
Trust flashcards.,
Work with new words, don’t just look at them.,
Read, write, and repeat phrases to cement them in your brain.,
Make friends with a conversation partner.",How to Learn Vocabulary in a Foreign Language1," Learning a foreign language well takes time - there’s no way around it. Long, infrequent cram sessions just won’t work. Instead, study or quiz yourself in short bursts of 5-10 minutes. Try to do several of these throughout the day.Once you build up a good knowledge of the language, you will retain more from longer sessions.;
, While they seem like the bane of any language student’s existence, flashcards are actually a proven way to learn vocabulary. They’re also cheap and easy to make. You can keep a stack of flashcards on you and quiz yourself whenever you have a few spare minutes throughout the day. Just focus on a few words at a time.You can use index cards for a traditional choice, or websites or apps to create virtual cards.
The key to flashcards is repetition--use them often, and quiz yourself on old flashcards, too. Use the words as often as you can to help them stick.

, Studies show that learners need to encounter words several times in different contexts before they really stick. To speed this process up, whenever you learn a new word, look at how it is used in context, and then follow a series of steps:Pronounce the word and spell it
Study the meaning of the word (look it up if you don’t know it)
Create a sentence in your own words using the word
Write the new word and its meaning several times

, The same holds true for learning a new phrase. Say it outloud, check their meaning if you aren’t sure, and make up new sentences that use the phrase.To retain vocabulary, keep using these words and phrases, even after a test or after moving on to new topics.

, Practicing your foreign language with native speaker or someone who knows it well supercharges your learning. Not only will you have the chance to put your knowledge into action and build confidence in speaking, you’ll also learn new vocabulary from you partner. All while having fun!You can find a friend, tutor, or teacher who you can practice with. Check with a language instructor, look online for language groups in your area, or look for someone to practice with online via language learning sites.
You can also try a tandem partnership with someone who is trying to learn your language. Spend part of the time practicing the language that is foreign to you, then switch to your own language and help your partner learn.

Know that a language is not created in a convention in a closed room at a certain time by a limited number of people.",How to Pronounce Italian Words9," It has been evolved among people living near and far from each other as an unwritten exchange of vocal symbols. The prodigy of human mind is that it follows such a set of discoverable rules on a consensus and similarity among such a vast population talking that language.

Get creative with some mnemonic devices.,
Visualize the meaning of words.,
Try diglot weaving.",How to Learn Vocabulary in a Foreign Language2," Making things interesting and funny greatly increases the amount of vocabulary you retain. Get in the habit of coming up with memory aids, or mnemonic devices, for new vocabulary. Have fun--the sillier, the better! For instance: You can develop some devices based on sound. If you’re learning the word “mesa” (“table” in Spanish), say to yourself “Yolanda made a huge MESS all over the MESA.”
You can create other devices based on meaning. For instance, if you’re learning the word дом (dom or “home” in Russian), recognize that shares a root with the Latin word “domus” (“home”) and related English words. Think of a silly phrase like “Donald has a dozen DOMESTICATED dogs in his DOM.”

, Even if you can’t get super creative with all of the words and phrases you learn, it still helps to simply create a visual picture of what you are learning. This can be as simple as imagining the thing you are studying. If you’re learning “el pan” (“bread” in Spanish), picture a loaf sitting in a pan. If you’re learning “ir” (“to go”), picture a fast car going down the street., While it sounds like a complicated term, diglot weaving is actually a simple and fun way to learn new words. Simply replace a word in a sentence in your native language with the corresponding word in the foreign language. Since you can lean on your native language while learning foreign words, it’s great for beginners. Examples of diglot weaving include:”My friends and I split a pizza at the lunch Tisch” (when learning the German word “Tisch,” or “table”).
”Romeo told Juliet he’d lover her siempre” (when learning the Spanish word “siempre, or “always”).

Learn vocabulary in phrases to maximize retention.,
Draw on multimedia sources to enrich your learning.,
Read often to build context.,
Try language learning apps.,
Group words into categories to pick them up faster.,
Focus on cognates to build confidence.,
Make sure to learn to gender of nouns, if applicable.",How to Learn Vocabulary in a Foreign Language3," Words aren’t much good unless you know how to use them. Learning vocabulary in phrases rather than as isolated words is most helpful because it gives you context to help remember the meaning and gives you practicing using the vocabulary in natural ways.“J’en ai marre” (“I’ve had enough” in French) is an example of a phrase.
Learning vocabulary in phrases helps you determine which words to use to “sound right” (called collocations).
For instance, “I had a cup of powerful tea” and “I had a cup of strong tea” are both grammatically correct in English, but the latter sounds right because it is said more often.

, Watching television, films, and other videos in foreign languages gives you chances to learn new vocabulary and to hear how it is used in authentic speech. If you are interested in the sources, you are more likely to pay attention and learn, so choose some that you love!Podcasts, YouTube videos, streaming films and programs, songs, and similar sources can all be great ways to learn.
As you watch and listen, pay attention to any vocabulary you know, and write down new words and phrases you hear.

, You can pick up lots of vocabulary quickly from reading, especially if you read out loud. When learning a foreign language, make it a point to read at for at least a few minutes each day. Read whatever you find interesting.Studying a variety of texts is a surefire way to pick up vocabulary. Try reading the news, fiction, essays, comics, and even advertisements.
When you encounter new words, try to guess their meaning first, based on the context. Then write them down and look them up later for practice and study.

, There are tons of possibilities out there, including Duolingo, Drops, and Memrise. While you can’t really learn a language just from studying apps, they can be a great way to build vocabulary in a fun, interactive way.Most apps involve games (like matching words to pictures) and other tools that can make the learning experience engaging and help you retain words.

, Groups of words together that relate to a common topic are easier to learn than lists of words that are all over the place. Textbooks usually present new words in this way, but if you’re learning on your own, you can follow the same principle. For instance, if you are studying German and interested in music, you could study not only “die Musik” (“music”), but also words and phrases like:


”Die Band” (“band”)
”Der Jazz” (“jazz”)
”Das Konzert” (“concert”)
”Ich spiele Gitarre” (“I play guitar”)
”Mein Lieblingssänger ist Michael Jackson” (“My favorite singer is Michael Jackson”)

, If you’re feeling overwhelmed by the amount of vocabulary you have to master to in order to understand and use a foreign language, look for cognates. These are words that look the same or nearly the same and have similar meanings in different languages. That means they’re easy to remember.For example, “computer” in German is “der Computer.” Likewise, “to drink” is “trinken,” which looks very similar.
Just watch out for “false friends,” or words that look the same but actually have different meanings. For instance, “actuel” in French does not mean “actual,” but “current” or “up to date.”

, Many languages (like Spanish, German, and Russian) group nouns into different grammatical genders, which usually have to relation to biological gender. Learn the gender together with the noun's spelling and meaning so you’ll know how to use it properly later on.


For instance, “dog” in French is ""le chien"" and NOT “la chien.” Learn the vocabulary as “le chien” and not simply “chien.”
Similarly, if you're learning verbs, make sure to study their correct conjugation.

The way to know how to speak Chinese is by learning the phonetic or Pinyin system.,
Know the Pinyin system, remember each vowel / consonant, and master the sounds by heart.,
Understand Chinese tones, know the four tones---But don't worry about this, you will be understood by Chinese people most of time even if your tones or accents are not correct!,
Neutral Tone


Some syllables in Chinese Tones are in the neutral tone or toneless, i.e.",How to Learn Chinese Pinyin Quickly,"


Over the years, many different Romanization systems have been devised to pronounce Chinese characters. The most commonly used Romanization system for speaking Chinese is Pinyin.;
,


Spend enough time on practicing until you can memorize and pronounce each sound properly. Trust me, that will save you a lot of time in the long run.
A good method to learn pinyin is by listening to songs and following the lyrics. There is a pinyin song with lyrics that almost every kid in China knows, and it is certainly an easier and quicker way to remember and learn Pinyin.

Tone is the variation of pitch, it can be rising, falling or continuing. Chinese is a tone language. In Mandarin, there are four distinct tones, five if the neutral Chinese tone is included.
Since there are only about 430 basic monosyllables which can be combined to pronounce Chinese characters, the use of tones is one way to substantially increase the number of available monosyllables.
Look at the table below for detailed explanation about the four Chinese tones:

Remember that you do not need to learn grammar like a professor or researcher!,
Learn to know Words and their forms

No tenses for verbs, one verb has only one form.——Chinese grammar has no tenses and each verb has only one form.,
Learn about ""Multi-character word"", phrases and idioms


""one-character word"" and ""multi-character word"" in Chinese——While there are only three one-letter English words, a, I and O, one-symbol Chinese words are common.,
Chinese syntax


""Word Order"" and ""Sentence structure"" (important, key to understand the Chinese sentence!),
Verbs and tense (important!)",How to Learn Chinese Grammar Quickly," In fact, the core grammar rules are very limited.


If you want to learn all those grammatical phenomena one by one in the sea of textbooks, yes, you will never finish learning. But never forget that your aim of learning grammar is to understand the sentence and article, not grammar itself.
Remember that native speakers usually know little about grammar.
Then why should learn grammar? Because native speakers learn the language by being immersed into the environment from Childhood, and by forming the ""language sense"" in so strong a language environment. But for non native speakers who have no that environment, grammar is the quick way, because grammar is the summary and essence of a language, it is the formula with which you can make unlimited sentence with limited words.
Notice that the formula is not so hard, and the core part of grammar is really a small part. What is hard is those ""phrase"", ""idioms"", ""slang"" and other conventional expressions.;
, No matter what noun or pronoun you use, the form of the verb remains the same. With simply adding characters for indication of tense, there's no need to learn about conjugating verbs, let alone irregular ones. (For details about tense, see ""Chinese syntax"" part below) For example: I go to school - 我去学校；I went to school yesterday - 我昨天去了学校






No plural form for nouns and pronouns——To form a plural, just add certain characters (e.g. 们, mén) . For example, I learn Chinese - 我学中文；We learn Chinese - 我们学中文






No comparative or superlative form for adjectives——There's also no worry about adjective changes for comparative or superlative. Additional characters will be used to express those concepts. For example: small - 小的；smaller - 较小的







, For example, the character 天 means day or sky; the symbol 空 means empty in English.Combination of two or more characters brings a new word. For example, 天空 means sky in English. Because the Chinese characters usually don't have space between each other except when there is punctuation, you must firstly be able to identify and understand those ""multi-character words"" when reading in order to understand the whole sentence and article.
Phrases and sense group (important!)——Combination of two or more words can form a phase, an idiom or a “sense group” which is a difficult but important point in learning Chinese. Because the Chinese characters usually don't have space between each other except when there is punctuation, you must firstly be able to identify and understand those ""phases"", ""idioms"" and “sense groups"" when reading in order to understand the whole sentence and article.

, Like English, word order in Chinese syntax is subject-verb-object. For example, 我学英文 ( I study English ) follows exactly the same order as in English.
A sentence can be divided into several different parts. Sentence elements are the parts that play different grammatical roles in a sentence. The core sentence elements are Subject, Predicate, Object (Just like those in English!); Other elements accompanying noun, verb and sentence: Attributive, Adverbial, Complement.
Subject (Noun)，Predicate (Verb)，Object (Noun)——Most subjects are at the beginning of a sentence followed by the predicate part; it is the theme of a statement. For example: 我爱读书 ( I love reading books ) - 我 is the subject in this sentence. The predicate part is the part that states the subject. In the following sentences, the underlined part is predicate.
Attributive (The sign is “的"") ——Attributive is used to modify a noun or a nounal phrase that is usually acting as the subject or object in a sentence. In Chinese, ""的"" is the sign of Attributive. For example: 南京是一座美丽的城市( Nanjing is a beautiful city ) - 美丽的 is an Attributive to describe object 城市 (city).
Adverbial (The sign is “地"") ——Adverbial is the modifying element prior to a verb (Usually the predicate), or in some cases, at the beginning of a sentence. In Chinese, ""地"" is the sign of Attributive. For example: 他迅速地离开了( he left quickly ) - 迅速地(quickly) is the Adverbial in this sentence to modify predicate 离开(left).
Complement (The sign is “得"") ——Complement is the complementary description element following a verbal or adjective phrase. For example: 她的英文说得好( She speaks English well ) - 好( well ) is the complement element to describe verb 说( speak ).


,


The particle "" 着 "" is suffixed to a verb to indicate the continuous aspect of an action. For example:足球赛进行着 ( The soccer game is carrying on )
The particle "" 已 "" is suffixed to a verb to emphasize a completed past action. For example: 我已读完书 ( I finished reading a book.), 她已走了( She left )
The particle "" 了 "" is added after a verb to emphasize a completed past action. For example: 我读完了书 ( I finished reading a book.), 她走了( She left )
The particle "" 过 "" is suffixed to a verb for things that have happened some time in the unspecified past. For example:我去过北京 ( I have been to Beijing ), 我读过这本书 ( I've read this book ).
Verb 要 or 想 ( want ) can be used to indicate the future. For example,她想学中文 ( She wants to learn Chinese )

"
Start by talking to the child's immediate family.,
Do background research.,
Spend time with the child.,
Form a good relationship.,
Keep things positive.,
Decide what the child is, and is not, capable of.,
Figure out how to teach the child.,
Decide who and when the teaching will take place.,
Get started with the teaching.,
Regularly review the targets and methods you are using to teach the child and keep in regular contact with the parents.",How to Teach Special Education Kids," Parents are children's first and most important educators, they will have a wealth of information about their child to share with you. You will need to listen to what the parents have to say with an open mind. It's important to keep your opinions to yourself at this stage, as you have not gained the parent's trust or respect and you have not even met the child yet. Questions you can ask include:


What are his/her favourite activities or toys?
How does she react to other children and adults?
What would you like your child to learn?
What does he/she need help with?


Some settings may have a care plan for younger children, which you could fill out together.;
, If the special educational need is already identified when the child comes into your care, you will need to research this particular condition. One word of warning - do not let the information you read dictate how you view this child. Think of it as a heads up of what may happen, rather than a manual! You can also ask for reports from other professionals involved or from previous teachers. Again, be prepared to make up your own mind about this child. Children can change from one day to the next, therefore old reports can offer out-of-date views on the child, or may reflect another person's specific biases.

, Given your background research and reading up, you will have gained a good insight into what the child likes/dislikes. Start off by observing the child by waiting in the background. This will help you get to know his/her facial expressions and body language. It may take hours, days, weeks or even months for the child to feel comfortable around you and for you to fully get to know him/her.

, Before you can begin teaching children with special educational needs, you will need to develop a relationship with them (as with any child). You want to become a positive part of this child's life therefore the best way to start building a relationship is by using things that the child finds enjoyable.


For example, if the child has a fascination with round objects, find some and show them to him/her. You will know the child well enough to establish when/if they are ready to start accepting you into positive parts of their day.

, It is important to keep things positive as you are beginning to build your relationship. You will need the child to trust in you when you're teaching him/her something new or tricky. You will know when you're ready for the next stage when the child in your care has developed a bond with you and will take notice of you.

, Then, along with the parents and any other professionals involve, decide what to teach the child. Try to think about the bigger picture in terms of skills to learn. It's more important that children can get dressed independently than it is for them to push pedals on a bike.


You will also need to think of what skills are needed. For example, the child needs to be able to follow instructions before you can teach him/her how to put his/her coat on.

, There are many many different teaching methods for children (with and without special needs) and it is easy to get confused. What you need to think about is how the child learns best or with most ease. For example:


Is she/he a visual learner? Does she/he look at pictures you show, does he/she notice displays on walls? If so, think about getting some visual aids and timetables.
Does your child prefer to run around and be very energetic or sit quietly by him/herself?
Does your child have particular toys that they find very rewarding? You could use these to encourage some other desirable behaviour.


There are many informative sites offering teaching information once you get to know how your child thinks, learns and behaves.

, Will short formal teaching be best for your child? Or, will teaching opportunities arise throughout the day? Would your child benefit from having multiple teachers? If you have really got to know the child in your care, the questions should be easy to answer.

, Once you have your plan together you can start. It's important to be flexible and always have the child's best interests at heart. It may be frustrating for you but imagine how frustrating it can be for the child. Always keep in mind that plans can be changed and adapted, and that information should always be shared with the parents, even if something is not working.

, Enjoy what you are doing and always stay positive!

Take a look on the statistic of Chinese immigrants in the city.,
Take a look on the number of universities.,
Don't assume that Northern China, where the standard putonghua was born, must be more ideal to learn standard mandarin than the South.,
Avoid rural areas, except popular tourist areas, like Yangshuo or Lijiang in Yunnan province which is very popular among Chinese tourists.",How to Learn Chinese in China," The influx of Chinese immigrants with different backgrounds often makes Standard mandarin more widely spoken. For example, in Beijing and Shanghai, although local accents and dialects are very common, over 10 million immigrants from different provinces have to speak standard (or close to standard) to communicate with each other.;
, Most undergraduates who were born after 1980s are well exposed to standard Mandarin. They can help create an ideal environment for practicing standard pronunciation.

, For example, Henan, the province next to Beijing, was an important cradle for ancient Chinese culture, but the local dialect is overwhelmingly spoken than standard mandarin. And to some ears, the accents in Dongbei, north-eastern China which was the home of Royal family of Qing Dynasty, are regarded as vulgar and not standard.

, In these tourist spots, you can meet a lot of people from different parts of China. Their accents are often close to standard, but it also gives a good chance to expose to different accents.

Learn some basic vocabulary.,
Learn some basic phrases.,
Learn the tones.,
Work on your pronunciation.,
Work on grammar and sentence structure.",How to Learn Chinese1," The first thing to do when learning a new language is to memorize some simple yet important words and start practicing with them as soon as possible. Although things like grammar and sentence structure are important, they mean nothing until you develop a basic vocabulary. Here's a short list to get you started:



Hello = nǐhǎo, pronounced With 2 third tones. Not ""ho"" or ""how"" somewhere in the middle. Listen to a native speaker as a reference.

Yes = shì, pronounced "" But not as in ""sure"". ALWAYS listen to a native speaker, as describing with English pronunciations in the learners minds will be difficult.


No = bú shì, pronounced look above.

Goodbye = zài jiàn, pronounced Morning = zǎoshàng, pronounced """"

Afternoon = xià wǔ, pronounced There is almost no clear way to describe the ""x"" in pinyin with English pronunciations. Look it up and listen to a native speaker say it. Contrary to popular misinfomation, the ""x"" DOESN'T AT ALL sound like ""sh""!

Evening = wǎn shàng, pronounced Head = tóu, pronounced with a 2nd tone, that goes up.

Feet = jiǎo, pronounced Hands = shǒu, pronounced With a 3rd tone, this goes from neutral to lower to neutral.

Beef = niú ròu, pronounced but not with the soft ""r"", more defined ""r"".

Chicken = jī, pronounced Egg = jī dàn, pronounced ""dan"" has a 4th tone, that goes down. Slightly forceful sounding. (not too forceful sounding!) Literally ""chicken egg"".

Noodles =miantiao pronounced Always look up pronunciations of every word spoken by a native speaker. Most Mandarin pinyins just simply cannot be described perfectly with English sounds!;
, Once you've built up a little vocabulary, you can start working on some basic phrases and expressions that will help you to navigate everyday conversations. Here's a few to get you started:



How are you? = nǐ hǎo ma? pronounced (see above for pronunciations)

I'm fine = wǒ hěn hǎo, pronounced Thank you = xiè xiè, pronounced There is almost no clear way to describe the ""x"" in pinyin with English pronunciations. Look it up and listen to a native speaker say it. Contrary to popular misinfomation, the ""x"" DOESN'T AT ALL sound like ""sh""! The ""ie"" part sounds close to ""yieh""

You're welcome = bú yòng xiè, pronounced Sorry = duì bu qǐ, pronounced Like with the Mandarin ""x"" a proper pronunciation described with English letters is almost impossible. As always, I can't stress enough the importance of looking up native speakers pronouncing the pinyin.

I don't understand = wǒ bù dǒng, pronounced What is your surname (family name)? = nín guì xìng, pronounced (I'm sure you know by now why I just put ""x"" instead of the phonetics.)

What's your name? = nǐ jiào shén me míng zì, pronounced ""


My name is _____ = wǒ jiào _____, pronounced , Chinese is a tonal language, which means that the same word can mean different things depending on the tone used to express them (even if the spelling and pronunciation are the same). This can be difficult for English speakers to grasp, but learning the tones is essential if you want to speak Chinese properly. There are four major tones in Mandarin Chinese, as well as a neutral tone:



The first tone is a high, flat tone. It is expressed in a relatively high voice, with no rising or dipping. Using the word ""ma"" as an example, the first tone is expressed in writing as ""mā"".

The second tone is a rising tone. It starts at a lower level and gets progressively higher, like when you say ""huh?"" in English. The second tone is expressed in writing as ""má"".

The third tone is a dipping tone. It starts at a medium level, then dips lower before rising again, like when you say the letter ""B"" or the word ""horse"" in English. The third tone is expressed in writing as ""mǎ"".

The fourth tone is a falling tone. It starts at a medium level and gets progressively lower, like when you are giving a command (such as telling someone to ""stop"") in English. The fourth tone is expressed in writing as ""mà"".

The fifth tone is a neutral tone. It does not rise or fall, like the first tone, but this tone is expressed in a flat voice.. The fifth tone is expressed in writing as ""ma"".

, Once you have learned the correct pronunciation of the tones by listening to native speakers (Youtube is good for this) and practicing them yourself, you need to work on applying them to words.


This is essential, as the same word can have a completely different meaning depending on which tone is used. For example, using the tone ""mā"" instead of ""má"" could be the difference between saying ""I want cake"" and ""I want coke"" -- two completely different meanings.
Therefore, when you're learning vocabulary, it is not enough to learn the pronunciation, you must also learn the correct tone. Otherwise you could use the word in the wrong context and be completely misunderstood.
The best way to work on your pronunciation is to speak with a native Chinese speaker who can encourage you when you get it right and correct you when you're wrong.

, It's a common misconception that Chinese is a ""grammar-less"" language. Chinese has quite a complex grammar system, it's just very different to that of English and other European languages.


Luckily, when learning Chinese you will not have to learn any complicated rules involving verb conjugations, agreement, gender, plural nouns or tense. Chinese is a very analytic language, which makes it quite simple and straightforward in some respects.
Another bonus is that Chinese uses a similar sentence structure to English -- subject-verb-object -- which makes translating back and forth between the two languages somewhat easier. For instance, the sentence ""he likes cats"" in English is translated as ""tā (he) xǐ huan (likes) māo (cats)"" in Chinese even when the pronouns change!
On the other hand, Chinese has its own grammar structures which are very different to those used in English and can therefore be very difficult for the English speaker to grasp. These grammatical features include things like classifiers, topic-prominence and preference for aspect. However, there's no point in worrying about these things until you've mastered basic Chinese.

Learn pinyin.,
Learn to read some Chinese characters.,
Learn to write some Chinese characters.,
Read Chinese texts.,
Write a little Chinese everyday.",How to Learn Chinese2," Pinyin is a Chinese writing system which uses letters from the Roman alphabet instead of Chinese characters.


It is useful for Chinese language learners as it allows you to get started with reading and writing Chinese without the time involved in learning traditional characters. There are many Chinese textbooks and learning materials available in Pinyin.
However, it is important to be aware that even though Pinyin uses letters from the Roman alphabet, its pronunciation is not always intuitive to the English speaker. Therefore, it is important to use a proper pronunciation guide when learning Pinyin.

, Although the ability to read traditional Chinese characters is not necessary for learning Chinese, the idea appeals to many people and makes them feel more in touch with traditional Chinese culture.


Learning to recognize and read Chinese characters is no easy task. In order to read a newspaper, the average Chinese reader will need to be familiar with about 2000 different characters -- and that's just the beginning. It is believed that there are over 50,000 Chinese characters in total (though many of them are no longer in use).
The major benefit of learning to read Chinese characters is that you will have access to a broad array of other literatures, including Cantonese, Japanese and Korean -- all of which use Chinese characters (or a simplified version of them) in their writings, despite the fact that the spoken languages are very different.

, Once you have learned to read Chinese characters, you may be interested in learning how to form them yourself. Writing Chinese characters is a complex skill, which requires patience and a touch of artistry.


The first step in learning how to write Chinese characters is to learn the ""radicals"" -- these are the individual brush strokes that form the building blocks of each character. There are 214 radicals in total -- some can stand on their own as individual characters, while others are only used as part of a more complex character.
When writing Chinese characters, the order of the brush strokes is very important and you must follow a specific set of rules -- such as top to bottom, left to right and horizontal before vertical. If the stroke order is incorrect, the completed character will not be accurate.

, If you want to improve your Chinese reading skills, you'll need to practice a little reading for at least 15 to 20 minutes a day.


To begin with, you could try using some children's readers or workbooks (which are nearly always written in Pinyin) to practice your basic reading skills. You should also be able to find some good resources for reading Chinese online.
You can also try to incorporate your Chinese learning into your everyday life. You can do this by reading the Chinese labels on food products at the Asian supermarket, or asking your server for the Chinese language menu at a restaurant.
Once your reading becomes more advanced, you could try to get your hands on a Chinese newspaper (which are printed using traditional Chinese characters) and do your best to read through the articles. This is also a good way of familiarizing yourself with Chinese culture and current affairs.

, In order to practice your Chinese writing skills, you should try to write a little everyday, whether in Pinyin or in Chinese characters.


One option is to keep a small personal diary in Chinese, where you write down simple things like a description of the weather, how you are feeling that day, or what you did. If you're not to shy about it, you could ask a Chinese-speaking friend or acquaintance to look it over and check for any mistakes.
Alternatively, you could try to find a Chinese pen-pal to write letters to. This could be mutually beneficial, as you could get some practice writing in Chinese, while your pen-pal could practice their English. You could also ask your pen-pal to include the corrected version of your original letter when replying.
A last way of practicing your writing is to make simple lists in Chinese, like your shopping list, or to make Chinese labels for items around the house.

Practice with a native Chinese speaker.,
Listen to Chinese tapes/CDs.,
Watch Chinese films and cartoons.,
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.,
Consider taking a trip to China.",How to Learn Chinese3," The absolute best way to learn Chinese is just to speak it with a native speaker -- this will force you to think on your feet, help with your accent and expose you to more informal or colloquial forms of speech that you won't find in a textbook.


If you have a Chinese-speaking friend, ask them if they'd be willing to sit down with you for an hour or two each week. They'd probably be happy to help -- as long as the coffee's on you!
If you don't know any Chinese speakers personally, you could try placing an ad in your local paper or online forum. Alternatively, you could look into finding a Chinese conversation group or oral Chinese class in your local area.
If all else fails, you could try to connect with a Chinese speaker on Skype, one who'd be willing to exchange 30 minutes of Chinese conversation for 30 minutes of English.

, Listening to Chinese podcasts or CDs is a great way to immerse yourself in the language -- even when you're on the go!


It doesn't matter if you can't follow everything that's being said -- just try to be an active listener and attempt to pick out key words and phrases. Slowly but surely your overall comprehension will improve.
This is a great option for people who have long commutes as they can simply stick a Chinese CD on in the car or listen to a Chinese podcast on the train. You could also try listening while exercising or doing housework.

, Watching Chinese films and cartoons is a more fun, relaxed way of immersing yourself in the language, however, it will still help to expose you to the sounds and structure of Chinese.


Try watching short cartoons or clips on Youtube, or rent a full length Chinese film from your local movie store. You may need to use subtitles at first, but try not to rely on them too much -- see how much of the dialogue you can understand on your own.
If you're feeling particularly proactive, you could pause the film after particular words or phrases and try to repeat them -- this will help your accent to sound more authentic.

, The biggest obstacle that will stand in your way of learning Chinese is your fear of making mistakes.


You need to try to overcome this fear -- and even embrace it -- if you are to reach your goal of fluency.
Remember that everyone makes mistakes when they are learning a new language, and you are bound to have your fair share of embarrassing mistakes and awkward moments, but this is all part of the process.
Remember that you are not aiming for perfection when you are learning Chinese, you are aiming for progress. So go ahead and make as many mistakes as you like -- as long as you learn from them and continue to improve.

, Can you think of a better way to immerse yourself in the Chinese language than a trip to its native land?


China is an amazingly diverse country -- from the busy, bustling streets of Beijing to the ancient majesty of the Great Wall. There is something for every traveler -- whether you're looking to immerse yourself in traditional ethnic cultures, to sample the many delicious Chinese delicacies or to travel to the sites of ancient ruins and epic battles.
Alternatively, you could take a tour of other places with large Chinese-speaking populations, like Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. Just make sure that you are prepared for differences in dialect (not all are mutually intelligible) before you book your flight!

The tones can be level, rising, or falling in pitch. You don't need perfect pitch to speak Cantonese, but you do need to be able to control your pitch enough to make it rise, fall, or hold steady.


The high level tone is transcribed as ""ā"" in Yale. It is a high, steady pitch.
The mid rising tone is ""á"" in Yale. It starts at your normal pitch and ends higher.
The mid level tone does not rise or fall, but continues at your normal pitch.
The low falling tone, ""àh,"" starts slightly below your ordinary pitch and ends lower.
The low rising tone, ""áh,"" starts slightly below your ordinary pitch and ends at your ordinary pitch.
The low level tone, ""ah,"" begins and ends in your ordinary pitch without changing.
You will need to take classes or listen to recordings to learn how to properly vocalize and recognize the tones.;
, A great way to practice Cantonese tones and sounds is to learn to count to ten. When you count, lilt the numbers up and down, beginning up with one, then down with two, then up with three.


1 一 yāt
2 二 yih
3 三 sāam
4 四 sei
5 五 ńgh
6 六 luhk
7 七 chāt
8 八 baat
9 九 gáu
10 十 sahp
Once you have learned to count to 10, learn double digit numbers. To say 11, 12, 13, and up, say ""sahp"" (ten) and then the second digit. 11 is ""sahpyāt,"" (ten-one), while 12 is ""sahpyih."", Find and practice the words and phrases you need to build your most ordinary phrases. It is wise to cluster your vocabulary: learn related words together, instead of randomly or in alphabetical order.


Study along with a guide that provides recordings, such as learningchineseez.com
Learn how to say temporal markers: now (而家 yīgā), late (遲 chìh), early (早 jóu), morning (朝早 jīujóu), afternoon (晏晝 ngaanjau), and evening (夜晚 yeh máahn.)
Learn basic greetings, such as Hello (你好. Néih hóu), How are you? (你好嗎? Néih hóu ma?) and the less formal How are you recently? (近排點呀? Gahnpàaih dím a?), and the answers: Fine (好. Hóu)
Practice your formal goodbye (再見 Joigin), and your informal goodbye (拜拜 Bāaibaai, as in ""bye-bye"").
Learn to ask basic questions, such as What is your name? (你叫乜嘢名呀? Néih giu māt'yéh mèhng a?) or the more formal ""How do I address you?"" (請問點稱呼? Chíngmahn dím chīngfū?)
Memorize the answers. My name is (我個名叫, Ngóh go méng giu), and Nice to meet you (幸會. Hahng'wúih).
Learn to say Please (請. Chíng), to thank someone for helping you (唔該. M̀h'gōi), and to thank someone for a gift (多謝 Dōjeh). To say You're welcome, say ""唔使客氣. M̀h'sái haak-hei.""
To get attention, say Excuse me (唔好意思. M̀h'hóu yisi) and to get past someone say Excuse me like this (唔該. M̀h'gōi or 唔該借借 M̀h'gōi jeje)
To apologize say Sorry (對唔住. Deui-m̀h-jyuh. If you're apologizing in Hong Kong, just say Sorry in English.

, In Chinese, you ask yes-no questions by stating both the positive and negative form of a verb, then adding an ""ah"" to the end of the sentence. For instance, if you are asking ""are you John?"" you would say ""nay hie-hm-hie John ah,"" literally ""you are-not-are John?""To answer, you would not say ""yes"" or ""no,"" as there are not standard words for these in Cantonese.
Instead, you would repeat the negative or positive form of the verb. If you are indeed John, you would say ""hie"" (am). If you are not, say ""hm hie"" (am not).

, Search your phone directory or look online for Cantonese language schools in your area. Other than Spanish, Chinese is the most common non-English language in the United States. It can be easier to find Standard Chinese lessons, but Cantonese schools and Cantonese classes at Language schools are still common.


Chinese classes at Chinese language schools are often designed for children. Look for classes for adults, or consider taking classes at a community college or community center.

, Meeting for one on one practice with a tutor will help you learn conversational skills and manners as well as vocabulary and grammar. Contact a tutoring service or a language school to find a Cantonese speaker.


Many speakers of Cantonese come to the United States for college. Try contacting the language department of local universities to see if they know any foreign exchange students who are interested in tutoring you.

, There are many MOOCs and distance-learning courses available for students of Cantonese. You can take free classes at your own pace, or you can sign up for a class. If you pay, make sure your class gives you access to quality media and at least one teacher who can answer your questions over email, Skype, or chat.

, Sign up for an immersive language program abroad. Find a highly-rated program that will have you speaking only Cantonese for the entirety of your visit. Alternatively, arrange for a visit in Hong Kong or Macau and take classes part-time while immersing yourself in the culture in your free time.


If you go abroad to study Cantonese, be sure to vet your options thoroughly. There are many institutes advertising classes, but the quality is highly variable. Check the credentials of the staff before committing to a class. Teachers with degrees in Chinese or in Education are your best bet.
Consider taking a class at the Chinese University of Hong Kong,or a class at The University of Hong Kong through the Chinese Department.Cheaper classes can be found at Hong Kong's YMCAs, but check the ratings before you sign up.
To find classes of good repute, visit websites like goabroad.com and search for Cantonese schools.Classes in Hong Kong might be more expensive (you might pay about 400 for a week of classes), while classes in a less expensive place, like Guangdong, might be cheaper but more difficult to locate and verify.
Consider accent before you choose a teacher or city. If you plan to do business in Hong Kong, but would like to save money by studying in Guangdong, you will likely pick up an accent that will not serve your ambitions.

, Keep a notebook of words you would like to learn in Cantonese. When you hear a word you don't know, or when you realize you don't know how to say something, write it down and look it up later. Build yourself vocabulary lists based on themes (weather, time, food, family, business, vacation) and break them into vocabulary flashcards to study.


Memorization is a huge part of learning any Chinese language. Bring flashcards with you so you can study while you wait in line, while you eat, and while you're riding on public transportation.

, There are two standard forms of written Cantonese: formal and informal. The informal version is close to spoken Cantonese, while the formal version is very similar to Standard Chinese (Mandarin). Many Cantonese speakers learn to read and write in Standard Chinese with Cantonese pronunciation.Written Cantonese is unusual outside of Hong Kong.Colloquial Cantonese in Hong Kong includes standard Chinese characters plus over a thousand Cantonese characters.There are several forms of Romanization for phonemic written Cantonese, including Cantonese Pinyin, Jyutping, and Yale.
For Standard Chinese Romanization, learn Pinyin.
Depending on your language interests, you may choose to study formal or informal Cantonese pinyin and characters, Standard Chinese pinyin and characters, or select words and characters of any of these options for travel purposes.

, Thanks to online streaming video services, it's easy to find Cantonese films and television shows. Try watching movies, and get hooked on a quality show like ""The Insider's Guide to Happiness.""Watch with the subtitles on, and pause to look up words or check plot summaries to make sure you are absorbing as much as possible.


Rewatch episodes and pay attention to moments you felt you didn't understand.
Watch out for subtitles. If you are practicing your Chinese by watching English-language films with Chinese subtitles, you are likely to come across mostly Standard Chinese. However, some shows, such as The Simpsons, are subtitled in written Cantonese.

, It is more challenging to access written Cantonese than it is to find written Standard Chinese. If you are learning Standard Chinese with a Cantonese accent, you will have a wider variety of literature and media available to you. However, there are options for the Cantonese reader.


To determine whether or not a text is in Cantonese, check for common words that are not used in Mandarin, such as 佢 or 姖 (he/she)., Speakers of Cantonese observe many different religious and spiritual practices. Look up local Buddhist temples and Christian churches to find services in Cantonese. Make sure to look up the etiquette of the place you are going before you visit—you don't want to offend anyone, especially if you are planning on returning!


If you have any friends who speak Cantonese or who attend a Chinese religious center, ask for tips, or ask to be brought along.

Find someone from China to help you with tones!,
First tone is a high, flat tone.,
The second tone is most similar to the tone used to ask a question in English, as in ""You asked who?"".,
The third tone is a deeper rising sound.,
Fourth tone starts high and falls rapidly.,
Technically, there is a fifth or ""neutral/zero"" tone.,
Learn the Pinyin alphabet.,
Consonants: B (bo) P (po) M (mo) F (fo) D (de) T (te) N (ne) L (le) G (ge) K (ke) H (he) J (ji) Q (qi) X (xi) ZH (zhi) CH (chi) SH (shi) R (ri) Z (zi) C (ci) S (si) Y (yi) W (wu)

,
Vowels.,
Tonal accents go over the a, o, e, i, u , ü-- in this order.",How to Improve Your Mandarin Chinese Pronunciation," There are four main tones: ā, á, ǎ, à. (flat, rising, falling/rising, falling).;
, In pinyin, this is written as ā.

, It starts in the middle of the voice and rises. In pinyin, second tone is written like á.

, The tone starts low, and then rises. It is differentiated from a second tone because it starts lower, dips down just a little, and then rises. The closest approximation in English is probably ""huh?"" when said in disgust. In pinyin, third tone is written ǎ.

, It is the shortest tone. It sounds like an emphatic ""No!"" Sometimes fourth tone is described as a ""scolding"" tone because it is terse and quick.

, Particles and the second syllables in some words lack a tone. The exact tone that these syllables take depends on the tone that came in the previous syllable, but the neutral tone is always short, about half the length of a full syllable. If it was a first tone, the neutral tone is a little lower than the first tone. If it is after a second tone, the neutral tone is near the same pitch as the high end of the second tone. If it is after a third tone, it is after a little higher than the end of the third tone. If it is after a fourth tone, the neutral tone is a little lower than the end of the fourth tone. Neutral tone words are not marked with anything in pinyin.

, (Note that the letters are not pronounced as in English and that the pinyin is very different from English spelling!)

,, A (a) O (uo) E (e) I (i) U (wu) Ü (üe) AI (ai) EI (ei) UI (uei) AO (ao) OU (ou) IU (iu) IE (ie) ÜE (üe) ER (er) AN (an) EN (en) UN (un) ANG (ang) ENG (eng) ING (ying) ONG (ong)

, So, if a word has both A and I in it, such as XIA, the accent goes over the A when written. Exception: When U and I are in the same word, the accent goes over U.

Check your assumptions.,
Pretend that you are a consumer.,
Pretend that you are a supplier.,
Picture yourself at a market with three apple stands in front of you.,
Picture yourself as the owner of one apple stand.,
Let's assume that at a price of one dollar a piece, suppliers bring 100 apples to the market and consumers are willing to buy 90 apples at that price.,
Now let's assume that at a price of ninety cents a piece, suppliers bring 100 apples to the market and consumers are willing to buy 110 apples.,
See that the market will correct itself until a point of equilibrium is reached.",How to Understand Supply and Demand," The laws of supply and demand are easier to understand if you consider commodity goods like lumber, crude oil or concrete. A commodity is a good that is perceived to be worth the same amount regardless of the supplier.;
, This is easy because you are a consumer. Let's say that you buy 7 apples a week at a price of fifty cents per apple. If the price of those apples goes up to one dollar per apple, will you buy more or less apples? When the price of a good rises, the demand for that good decreases and when the price falls, the demand for that good increases. This is the law of demand.

, This may be more difficult to do. Let's say that you own a farm and you sell apples along with other fruits. One day, you sell your apples at the farmer's market for fifty cents per apple and sell out. The next day you sell your apples for a dollar a piece and you run out of apples again. Now you are making twice as much revenue from apples. Since you know you can sell apples for a dollar a piece, will you bring more or less apples to the market? Will you plant more or less apples next year? When the price of a good rises, the supply for that good increases and when the price of a good falls, the supply for that good decreases. This is the law of supply.

, Also assume that all of the apples look exactly the same as far as you can tell. Two of the apple stands are selling them for sixty cents an apple and one of the apple stands is selling them for fifty cents an apple. How much will you pay for an apple? Perfect price information and equivalency of goods are some principles of perfect competition.

, You sell apples for fifty cents a piece and run out of apples. The next day you sell apples for sixty cents a piece and run out of apples. How much will you sell your apples for the next day? Instantaneous price adjustments are another aspect of perfect competition.

, There is a surplus of ten apples. The only way to sell these surplus apples is to lower the price or perhaps give them away. Next time you come to the market, you may sell your apples at a discounted price to increase the demand (see law of demand) and eliminate the surplus. Another solution would be to bring less apples to the market next time or plant less apples in the future. Both of these options are called market corrections.

, There are ten people who want apples and do not have them. This is called a shortage. If the seller wants to make a greater profit, he will bring more apples to the market or sell the apples for a higher price the next day. These options are also called market corrections.

, That is, until there is neither a surplus nor a shortage.

Use self interest to motivate yourself and others.,
Embrace the idea that value subjective.,
Make decisions knowing that you may be giving up other opportunities.,
Embrace competition.,
Think about the implications of any choice you make.,
Rely on fair trade and commerce as a way of building healthy relationships.,
Admit that all things have costs.,
Accept that correlation is not causation.,
Know that your actions may have unintended consequences.",How to Think Like an Economist," When acting on just about anything, people will seek their own benefit. As a result, you shouldn't be ashamed to use self interest to motivate others or to act to benefit yourself.


People will push back or resist doing things if they don’t see a benefit in completing the action. For example, your employees won't work longer or harder unless they get compensated (or realize another type of benefit).
Incentives work. For example, give an employee a bonus for achieving a milestone ahead of time.;
, While people may only act if they see it benefiting themselves, it is important to realize that the way you value things may be different than someone else.


It is impossible to establish an objective value system for all people. For example, you can't just declare that a chair is objectively worth $5. While the chair might be worth $5 to you, it could be worth more or less to someone else.
People from different cultures around the world may view self-interest differently. They may see acting for the good of the community as something that directly benefits them.
This idea is known as the subjective theory of value. Most economists today embrace it., Economists understand that people constantly consider trade-offs and alternatives to different actions. In other words, people are constantly considering what could be gained if they did something else.


Always consider the opportunities you may miss by picking one course of action. For example, if you choose to pursue a high paying career, consider the loss of family time and the extra stress you may incur.
Many economists articulate this idea as the “marginal benefit” of one action over another. An example of this would be if you offered a child a dollar to clean their room or fifty cents to walk the dog. The child will weigh these two choices against each other to determine what benefits them more. They might decide that they’d rather walk the dog for less money but have extra time to watch TV, or they might decide that sacrificing more time for more money is worth losing their TV time., Competition is a constant factor in human interaction. Not only do businesses compete, but individuals compete for resources all the time.


Use competition as a way to drive yourself and others. For example, when completing a project at work, consider judging yourself against other workers completing similar projects. This may drive you to work harder.
Competition often results in “creative destruction.” Through the competitive process, certain individuals or firms decline and make room for new innovative entities to dominate the marketplace., Interactions between people constantly introduce new and unplanned factors into the decision-making process. As a result, you should reflect on potential outcomes before you make an economic decision.


Consider how your spending habits impact your community. For example, if you shop at a local hardware store instead of a big box retailer, you'll likely benefit people who live near you instead of very wealthy people hundreds of miles away., Ultimately, mutually agreeable exchange tends to foster friendships between people. As a result, when conducting business, treat others fairly with the goal of forming long-term relationships.


Seek your own self interest, but consider that making someone else happy and treating them with respect might be in your long-term benefit.
When buying or selling something, consider offering or asking less money if you think you might do a lot of business with the person in the future., Realize that all things in an economic system have costs. These costs can be realized in real substantial terms or in the terms of trade-offs.


Nothing is free. All benefits come at some sort of cost to someone. For example, if the residents of a community pay to maintain a park, other people who live outside the community but use the park are “free riders” – they do not realize costs associated with maintaining the park., Many economists are dedicated to the idea that correlation is not causation. What this means is that just because two things appear similar or appear to be connected, doesn't mean they are.


Two things that appear related may not be related at all. For example, the fact that the number of radios owned by Americans in the early twentieth century increased along with the number of squirrels living in Central Park in New York City does not dictate a connection or causal relationship between the two., Before taking any action, understand that it may have repercussions that you may not anticipate.


What this means is that economists – or anyone else – can’t predict an outcome because there are often unforeseen interactions that occur. For example, if a government lowers taxes with the intent of stimulating the economy, it could harm the economy because tax revenues along with government expenditures would decrease – harming industries that are dependent on government contracts."

Begin with a positive comment and thank the teacher for his efforts to date.,
Offer a diplomatic explanation of the problem.,
List neutral facts about your child's IQ.,
Show an understanding of the school's policies and procedures.,
Request a meeting to discuss the details of your proposal.,
Avoid including any of the following elements in your letter:

Long and detailed background information on the child's development
Using the term ""gifted"" if you feel it will get you off on the wrong foot
Rigid demands
Denigration of the current situation; anger
Comparisons to other teachers or classrooms
Seeming to know the solution - sometimes this works better if they connect the dots themselves

,
Wrap up as you began, with a positive tone.,
Follow up in a week if you have not heard back from the teacher.",How to Write a Letter to Your Child's Teacher About Giftedness," Regardless of how frustrated you are with the previous lessons or lack of challenge in the classroom, it is essential to set a positive tone and let the teacher know you are not his adversary. Some possible initial lines include:

""Dear Mrs. Smith: I am writing today to discuss my son, John Smith.  John has been working hard in the third grade, and is enjoying the literacy program in your classroom.""
""Dear Mr. Jones: My daughter, Alice Jones, is a student in your homeroom.  You may know her as Medusa, a role in the history play that she very much enjoyed."";
,  If your child is bored out of his skull in class, it will not further your case to describe it that way.  Instead, try phrases such as:

""While John does enjoy the several hours he is able to spend reading while he is in class, we are concerned that he may need additional challenge in math.""
""Alice has been able to consistently finish her homework while still in the classroom, and we believe she is ready for deeper and more difficult work.""

,  The teacher may be aware that your child is a quick study, but may not have realized the extent of his or her abilities.  Or, he may be perfectly cognizant of your child's breadth of knowledge or impressive processing speed, but may have chosen to set this information aside because his attention is otherwise occupied by other children in the classroom.  Remind him in a non-judgmental way:

""Because John is quiet and reserved, you may not have realized that he scored a 135 on a recent IQ test.  He memorized his multiplication tables at age five, and reads algebra textbooks for amusement.""
""As you may know, Alice recently completed the WISC-IV test of giftedness, and was designated as Highly Gifted.  Because she is able to learn so quickly, she spends a lot of time without meaningful work to do.""

,  If your district offers only pull-out enrichment programs, do not request that your child be placed in an all-gifted classroom, especially as your first volley.  For example:

""We understand that Main Street Elementary does not allow subject-level acceleration, but we would like to request an alternative.  Is it possible to assign John a mentor from an upper grade, or perhaps allow him to study the fifth grade math textbook independently? We would hate for John's enthusiasm for math to wane.""

,  This will make it more difficult for the teacher to ignore your letter.  Ask for specific return communication by phone or email.

""Please give me a call at (800) 555-1212 to set up a time for us to get together.  I would be happy to bring John's independent math testing results.""

,,

""I look forward to your suggestions to enrich John's mathematical education.""
""Thank you for your attention to this matter.""

,  Be prepared to bring your case to the administration or the school board, if necessary.  More information on this is available in the sources of this article."

Quantities. You will want to devote the first column in your chart to the total number of units produced. Your quantities can increase by 1, such as 1,2,3,4 etc. or they can increase by larger increments, such as 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 etc.
Fixed costs and variable costs. During production there are certain costs, such as rent, that are fixed. Other costs, such as the cost of materials are variable according to the quantity. Make columns for each of the costs next to the quantities and input the figures.;
, You can also choose to do the work on a spreadsheet; however, you can understand the marginal cost calculation better if you write out the formula initially.

If you are using a spreadsheet program, you can insert a formula in the total cost column that will add together the fixed and variable costs on each row to calculate total cost.

,

, Your first line in the column will remain blank, because you cannot figure out a marginal cost based on no units of production.

, $40 minus $30.

Don't capitalize the name of the month.,
Write ""primero"" for the first of the month.,
Abbreviate the date using letters and numbers.",How to Write the Date in Spanish1," In Spanish, unlike in English, you write the date by putting the day first, followed by the month and then the year. The numerals can be separated by periods, dashes, or slashes.For example, if you wanted to write the date December 12, 2017 on a document, you might write ""30/12/2017"" or ""30-12-2017."";
, Use the same ""day, month, year"" format when you're writing the date out. The day and year are represented by numerals, while the month is spelled out. The elements of the date are separated by the word ""de,"" translated as ""of.""For example, if you wanted to write the date ""October 3, 2017"" in Spanish, you would write ""3 de octubre de 2017"" (literal translation: third of October of 2017). There's no need for a comma in Spanish as there is in English., In Spanish, unlike in English and some other languages, there is no need to capitalize the month name. When you're writing the date, make sure the month is all lower-case., Typically when you're writing the long form of a date in Spanish, you'll use a numeral for the day. This changes with the first of the month, when the word ""primero"" (meaning ""first"") typically is used.For example, you could write January 1st as ""primero de enero.""
If you wanted to write the first of the month with a numeral, you would use a ""1"" followed by a superscripted ""o,"" like this: 1º.

, Each month of the year has a three-letter shortened form in Spanish. Occasionally you will see the date written with this numerals for the day and year with this three-letter abbreviation for the month.For each month, the three-letter abbreviation used is the first three letters of the name of that month.
For example, you might see the date ""July 11, 2017"" abbreviated in Spanish as ""11-jul-2017.""

Write the months in Spanish.,
Learn the words for numbers in Spanish.,
Learn the words for numbers after 10.,
Write the year in full if you want to practice your skills.",How to Write the Date in Spanish2," If you want to write the long form of a date, you need to know and be able to spell the names of each of the months in Spanish. Knowing how to spell the names of the months also is essential to recognize the abbreviated form of the name.January is enero.
February is febrero.
March is marzo.
April is abril.
May is mayo.
June is junio.
July is julio.
August is agosto.
September is septiembre.
October is octubre.
November is noviembre.
December is diciembre.

, It's true that you don't need to write out the word for the day of the week when writing the date in Spanish. But understanding how the words are spelled will help you when you're reading a written date aloud.The first day of the month can be written as ""uno"" (""one""), ""el primer día"" (""the first day""), or ""el primero"" (""the first"").
Two is dos.
Three is tres.
Four is cuatro.
Five is cinco.
Six is seis.
Seven is siete.
Eight is ocho.
Nine is nueve.
Ten is diez.

, Since there are as many as 31 days in a month, you can't stop learning the numbers at 10. In Spanish, the numbers 11 through 15 have their own names, while the names for the rest of the numbers follow a pattern.If you don't already know number words in Spanish, reading and writing dates can be a good way to practice.

, Just as you don't typically have to write out the day in Spanish, you certainly shouldn't ever have a need to write out the year in words. But it's still helpful to understand it so you'll say the date correctly.Spell the year out in thousands and hundreds. For example, the year ""1900"" would be spelled out in Spanish as ""mil novecientos,"" which translates literally to ""one thousand, nine hundred."" There is no Spanish equivalent to the phrase ""nineteen hundred,"" which is how you would say it in English.
Follow with the tens and ones after the thousands and hundreds. For example, you would write out the year ""1752"" in Spanish as ""mil setecientos cincuenta y dos.""

"
"
Spell out the days of the week.,
Refer to days of the week without dates.,
Mention the season.,
Ask about the date in Spanish.",How to Write the Date in Spanish3," Sometimes when you're writing a date, you also want to include the day of the week that date falls on. As with the months of the year, the days of the week are not capitalized in Spanish as they are in English.Sunday is domingo.
Monday is lunes.
Tuesday is martes.
Wednesday is miércoles.
Thursday is jueves.
Friday is viernes.
Saturday is sábado.

, When you're writing about a particular date, or especially about several dates, you may find it more convenient to use other words such as ""today"" or ""tomorrow."" These words make your writing seem more natural and easy to understand.For ""today,"" write ""hoy."" Yesterday is ayer, while ""tomorrow"" in Spanish is ""mañana.""
The word for ""week"" in Spanish is ""semana."" If you want to write ""the weekend,"" you would write ""el fin de semana."" Refer to ""this week"" as ""esta semana"" and ""last week"" as ""la semana pasada."" If you want to write about ""next week,"" use the phrase ""la semana que viene,"" which literally translated means ""the week that comes.""

, When you're writing about a date, you also might find it relevant to talk about the season in which that date falls. Keep in mind that south of the equator, the seasons are the opposite of those north of the equator.Write ""la primavera"" to refer to spring.
Use ""el verano"" to write about the summer.
Write ""el otoño"" when writing about autumn.
Use ""el invierno"" when you're writing about winter.

, The question ""¿Cuál es la fecha de hoy?"" is used when you need to know what the date is. For example, if you were writing a story in Spanish, you might need to have a character ask the date.You can also ask ""¿Qué día es hoy?"" You typically use this question, which means ""what day is today?"", when you want to know what day of the week it is. But it also can be used in some circumstances to ask for the date, similarly to English.

Write the word ""gracias"".,
Emphasize your thanks by adding ""muchas"" or ""muchísimas"".",How to Write Thank You in Spanish1," Gracias is the word for thank you in Spanish. It can be used in almost any context, in order to express gratitude.


The word gracia in Spanish means ""grace"", so gracias literally translates as ""graces"" or ""lots of graces"".The word gracias is pronounced as ""grass-ee-ass"" by Spanish speakers in Latin America, and as ""grath-ee-ass"" in Spain.;
, If you wish to say something along the lines of ""thank you very much"" or ""thanks a lot"", you can either say muchas gracias or muchísimas gracias.

Write ""thank-you"" as a noun.",How to Write Thank You in Spanish2," ""I am grateful"" in Spanish is written as ""estoy agradecido"" if you are male, or ""estoy agradecida"" if you are female.

, The phrase ""thank you in advance"" is written as ""con gracias anticipadas"" in Spanish.

, ""Thank you sir"" is written as ""gracias señor"" in Spanish. ""Thank you madam"" is written as ""gracias señora"". Don't forget to put the diacritical tilde on the ""n"".

, To say ""thank you again"", for example, at the bottom of a letter, you can write ""con gracias repetidas"".

, If you want to write ""thank-you"" as a noun, you would use the word ""agradecimiento"". For example, the phrase ""she sent a thank-you for the wedding gifts"" would be translated into Spanish as ""ella envió una nota de agradecimiento por los regalos de boda""."

However, Excel allows one to reverse the columns when charted, so that it all works out for cases like this one in which x is the dependent variable. We will be using tricks like taking the standard formula for a line, y = mx + b, and standing it on its head to become x = mP +b where P=y; we can do so because the dependent and independent variable have exchanged roles.

, This group should consist of key students, teachers and parents who will keep the momentum going. Once you have the group in place, join The Green Wave. It is important to note that only one project is permitted per school, so being coordinated with everyone in the school is important.

, Organizing your school's tree-planting activity requires student-generated research. Involve the students in as much of the planning as possible, so that they understand the process:


Encourage students to do some research online or in the local and school libraries. Students might also want to interview workers at a local tree nursery or other local tree experts. You may want to compile a list of possible resource people, make the initial contact and match students to resource people.
Have the students answer such questions as:

What is tree biodiversity?
What are some general considerations for tree planting?
What tree species will you plant? (For example, the 2008 theme for IBD is biodiversity and agriculture. Planting a historically important variety of fruit, nut or spice tree would be a good fit with the 2008 theme.)
Why this particular species?
What care does it require?
Where will you plant the tree?
When is the best time to plant the tree? If planting on 22 May is not appropriate in your area (because of the climate, final exams or something else), choose another date.
Who will take care of the tree? How often?



, Again, involve the students in as much of the planning as possible during the research phase, so that they have a sense of ownership over the project. Select some of the group members to assist with the planning for the event. Remind students that it’s a good idea to create an action plan or schedule and assign each person a role. Don’t forget to set due dates!


Some planning questions students should answer are:

Who will the adult and student participants be?
What will be each of their roles in the preparation?
What will your celebration on 22 May – the International Day for Biological Diversity (IBD) – be like?
Who will be invited (e.g. media, local officials, parents, members of the public, etc.)?
Where will the celebrations be held?
When will the celebrations be held?
How will you publicize the event (before and after 22 May)?
What information will your group post online on your group’s page?



, Post planning, it is time to register your tree. Don't worry if your activities evolve over time - you will always be able to update the information.

, Plant your tree. On 22 May:


Count down to 10:00am (local time)
At 10:00am, water your tree (whether it is in the ground or in a container or in a plastic bag) to create a symbolic “green wave” around the world
Take a photograph

, Once you have finished the event, it is important to upload your information as soon as possible - the sooner the submissions are submitted, the sooner they will appear on the website! Note that text submissions can have a maximum of 200 words (excluding picture captions).


If parental permission is given, include the student contributor’s name and age;
Have students write a short 100-200 word text. They could write about one part of the experience in a poem, an article, a story, an interview or other creative piece;
Have students draw a picture. Their imagination is the limit!;
Have students choose three pictures or photographs; and
Upload the group’s submission to The Green Wave website.

, The interactive map will “go live” and you can see projects around the world.

, With your group, talk about the good and not-so-good parts of The Green Wave experience. Send your feedback to The Green Wave team so they can make next year’s event even better.

, Keep checking The Green Wave website and dreaming about next year’s event.

For example, cuarenta is a combination of cuatro (4) and the suffix -enta, with the ""t"" removed as well.To write numbers through 99, all you need are the tens and the second digit, separated by the word y. For example, 34 would be ""treinta y cuatro,"" which literally means ""30 and 4.""

, To create the full word for a number in the hundreds, you simply add the word for the other digits to ciento or cientos.For example, two hundred is doscientos. The only exception is the word for the number 500, which is quinientos.

, When writing out large numbers in Spanish, you need an y between the second and third digit of each grouping of three digits. This is the case regardless of how many groupings there are.For example, if you wanted to write the number ""999,999"" in Spanish you would write the words as ""novecientos noventa y nueve mil novecientos noventa y nueve."" The literal translation of this into English is ""nine hundred ninety and nine thousand, nine hundred ninety and nine.""

, In Spanish, you use ""mil"" for ""thousand."" If you're writing about something that is exactly 1,000, you should only write ""mil,"" not ""un mil."" The plural form of ""mil"" is ""miles.""There is an exception if you're writing a check in Spanish and the amount begins with ""one thousand."" Then you usually should write ""un mil"" rather than ""mil"" to prevent someone from altering the check – even though this is technically incorrect.

, Write the words just as you would in English, by writing first the number of millions there are, and then writing the rest of the numbers., In Spanish, extremely big numbers in the billions and trillions are counted differently than they are in English. If you fail to recognize this, you could make a significant error when writing numbers in Spanish.In Spanish, the number you would call ""one billion"" in English is called ""mil millón,"" or ""thousand million."" The Spanish word ""billón"" is equivalent to the number you would call ""one trillion"" in English.

, In Spanish, if you're speaking of exactly 100, you must shorten ciento to cien. The numerals uno and veintiuno also are shortened to un and veintiún if they are immediately before another number, a noun, or an adjective.For example, if you were talking about one dog, you would write ""un perro.""
When you're using the feminine forms of these numbers, however, they are not shortened. For example, if you were writing about one ball, you would write ""una pelota.""

, One of the biggest differences between written numbers in Spanish and written numbers in English is the use of decimal points and commas.When you write numbers in Spanish, separate thousands with a decimal point – not with a comma as you would in English. For example, you would write ""126,342"" as ""126.342"" in Spanish.
Decimals, on the other hand, are written using a comma. For example, if you wanted to write pi in Spanish, you would write ""3,14159265359.""

, While decimals are still acceptable to use when separating thousands as you write numbers in Spanish, it also is acceptable to simply use a space.This method has become more common as a way to separate thousands because it keeps the decimal point from being confused with the comma.

, If a number word describes a feminine noun, you should write it so that it ends in -a rather than -o. Unless you're referring to exactly one thing, the noun also must be pluralized.For example, if you were referring to 20 houses, in Spanish you would write ""veintiuna casas.""
Keep in mind that in Spanish, anything that isn't exactly one must be pluralized. For example, on an invoice or spreadsheet, you would pluralize the noun even if the quantity listed was ""1,00"" (expressed in English as 1.00)., In English, you might write ""April first"" in a paragraph about April Fool's Day. However, in Spanish, you would write ""1 abril,"" putting the day first and using the cardinal number rather than the ordinal."
"
Use ordinals to put things in order.,
Make ordinals agree with the thing they describe.,
Maintain gender agreement with abbreviations.,
Create multiples similar to English.,
Change the word form to create verbs and adverbs.",How to Write Numbers in Spanish2," Cardinal numbers are used to count things, or describe the number of things there are. Ordinal numbers, on the other hand, describe the placement of something in an ordered list, such as the placement of runners who finished a race.As in English, the lowest ordinals, such as primero (first), and segundo (second), typically are used the most.

, Since ordinals are used in a sentence as adjectives, they must use the same gender form as the thing they describe. You do this by changing the o at the end of the ordinal to an a.For example, if you were referring to ""the second house"" on a street, you would write ""la segunda casa.""

, In English, you've probably seen ordinals abbreviated as ""1st"" or ""2nd."" Ordinals can be abbreviated in Spanish too. For example, ""1st"" in Spanish would be written 1ª if the first thing is a feminine noun, and 1º to describe a masculine noun., Multiples are words such as ""double"" or ""triple"" that indicate a multiplication of a number. These words are vary similar to the words in English – for example, ""double"" in Spanish is ""doble"" – so they should be fairly easy to learn and remember if English is your first language.All but the first seven multiples are created by adding the suffix -plo to the root of the cardinal number word. Be careful of accent marks, which indicate which syllable should be stressed.
The first seven ordinals also have forms that end with the -plo suffix (such as ""duplo"" and ""triplo""), but they are seldom used by Spanish speakers.

, In Spanish as in English, you might want to use multiples as a verb (doubled or tripled) or as an adverb (doubly or triply). To form these words in Spanish, you must change the word form.To create a verb, change the -plo suffix to -plicar. To do this with the first seven multiples, you'll have to use that seldom-used -plo form. For example, ""to double"" in Spanish would be ""duplicar.""
To create an adverb, you simply use the standard adverbial suffix -mente – similar to adding an -ly to form an adverb in English. For example, ""triply"" would be ""triplemente.""

"
"
Learn the word form for different fractions.,
Use parte with fractions.,
Write fractional nouns as one word.,
Choose the correct gender for fractions.,
Use por ciento to express a percentage.",How to Write Numbers in Spanish3," While halves and thirds have unique words in Spanish, fractions from fourths to tenths are the same as the ordinals for those numbers. The powers of ten also are ordinals.All other fractional words are formed by adding the suffix -avo to the correct cardinal number. For example, if you wanted to write out ""one-eleventh"" you would write ""onceavo.""

, When you are using the fraction as an adjective, you might add parte immediately after the fraction, just as in English you would add the word ""part.""For example, if you wanted to express ""I took the third part,"" you would write ""tomé la tercera parte.""

, In English, fractions typically are written out as hyphenated phrases. However, in Spanish any fraction you write using words is written as one word, no matter how long that word is.For example, if you wanted to write out the fraction 1/59, you would write ""cincuenta nueveavo.""

, The basic rule is that fractions in Spanish are masculine if you are using them as nouns, and feminine if you are using them as adjectives.Fractional nouns that express powers of ten can be either masculine or feminine. Which you use depends on where you are in the world – in Spain they typically are feminine, while in Latin America they typically are masculine.
For example, if you wanted to write ""one tenth"" in Spanish you might write ""décimo"" in Guatemala, but in Spain you would probably want to write ""décima"" to ensure you were understood.
Fractional nouns other than the powers of ten are always masculine.

, Percents are expressed in Spanish the same way they are in English. You can either write it out with the words or the % sign. For example, you could write either ""7 por ciento"" or ""7%."""

Choose an activity that helps teach your lesson.,
Ask students to reflect on the activity.,
Apply the activity directly to your lesson.,
Reinforce what was learned in the activity.",How to Use the Experiential Learning Model1," This is the first step to integrating experiential learning into the classroom. Not just any game or group activity will do. You need to find one that meets your educational goals. If you can’t find an experiential learning activity for your topic, you can also consider modifying an existing activity or creating your own.For instance, if you’re teaching the democratic process, hold a mock election. This can use any combination real and fictional candidates and bill proposals for your students to vote on.
If you’re teaching economics, put students in groups, give them a budget, and tell them to spend their funding on a business idea. Then, have them determine how they’ll turn this startup into a thriving business.;
, Challenge your students to take time to consider the lesson they’re meant to learn. This can be done individually by asking students to write in journals or respond to you verbally, or they can reflect in a group discussion. Don’t get frustrated if students don’t seem to understand right away. Ask more direct questions to help them get to the point.In the example about democratic process, you can ask questions like, “How do you think this outcome will affect citizens or businesses?”
For the economics project above, you can ask something like, “How does the concept of supply and demand impact the efficacy of your business plan?”
For struggling students, ask something specific like, “Do you think the election of this candidate will lead to changes in legislature regarding education?”

, Have your students take a quiz, write a paper, or otherwise directly address the topic you’re teaching. The goal of experiential learning is to improve the students’ comprehension of the topic, so make sure they have actually learned the topic by applying your lesson more directly to an assignment or test.For instance, if a local school board voted to extend the school day by twenty minutes for high school students, your students could write an analysis regarding the effect of extra class time or time between courses and how it affected their learning ability.

, Now that your students have completed the in-class experiential learning assignment, reflected on how it relates to the course, and directly applied their learning to the topic, it’s time to reinforce the subject matter. This is the “Now what?” part of experiential learning.In the economics example, you could ask your students to consider the economic ramifications on existing businesses.
If they were going to use their money to open a book store, you could ask them to consider whether or not their new business would impact profits for Barnes & Noble, Half Price Books, and Amazon.

"
"
Create a project that teaches core principles.,
Provide specific standards for success.,
Analyze what students learn.,
Reflect on the lessons of teamwork.",How to Use the Experiential Learning Model2," In most cases, these are group learning experiences, but these experiential learning projects can also be assigned to individuals depending on your specific educational needs. Modify or build your own project based on a list of the core subjects that need to be learned.For a democratic process project, you can assign topics that students will speak for or against, then have them present their side of the argument.
If you’re teaching younger students, use a simple project like having students make a picture books about a history lesson.
Give younger students time to work as a group during class, or let them do a project on their own.
If you’re teaching middle or high school or college age students, you may want them to practice leadership and time management skills by having them meet outside of class.

, Give students a rubric at the start of the project, so they clearly understand your expectations. If you don’t usually use rubrics, keep it simple. Make an outline of each step in the project, and explain what percentage of the students’ grade or amount of focus should be dedicated to each step.For example, a rubric for the debate project above may include researching topics, writing the speech, delivering the speech, and answering questions following the presentation.
To provide more specific guidance, consider including examples of good, better, and best. For ""research"" in the sample above, you could say “good” research includes a variety sources that support the issue, “better” research includes ten or more sources on both sides of the issue, and “best” research represents comprehensive analysis of both sides of the issue using primary sources.

, Following the group project, take time to assess your students’ comprehension of key ideas. This can be done in a number of ways. Give a quiz, assign a written essay explaining what they learned from the project, or simply conduct a class discussion about how the project related to your lesson plans., If you choose a group project, it’s important to build in an opportunity for your students to assess their experience with the group. Many students struggle to work together, and high achieving students especially may struggle to relinquish power over their grades to their peers. At the end of the assignment, ask each student in the group to evaluate the other’s performance and their own.Ask students to outline their personal contribution to the project. Then, request an outline of the contributions of the other group members.
Ask students to write a short reflection about the experience, any issues that may have arisen, and provide feedback about their experience working in this group.

Make a museum or zoo your classroom.,
Assign a trip to the theater.,
Visit nearby shops, restaurants, or parks.,
Require internships or job shadowing.",How to Use the Experiential Learning Model3," Don’t just take a field trip when you take your class to an educational site. You may need to enlist the help of some other adults, but you can use community museums, zoos, arboretums, or historical sites as an interactive classroom for experiential learning. Talk to the curators or other directors of the sites before you visit to make sure this is okay. Then, use the subjects on display to teach your students about a given subject.For example, if you’re studying biology, visit a zoo and discuss how the animals adapt to their habitats.
If you’ve just finished up a history lesson on the civil war and there’s a battle site nearby, take a trip. Discuss the battle that occurred there, and what its impact was on the overall war effort.

, If your students are learning about drama or theatre, don’t just talk about it, try to see a performance. This might be a professional show, local amateur theater performance, or simply seeing the school play. However, attending the performance is not in and of itself experiential learning. Start students out with themes to consider while watching, ask them to write a review or complete a quiz following the show, or discuss the performance as a class.In some cases, you can work with theaters to schedule a question and answer session for your class with the performers and directors of the show. Call your local theaters to find out if they have any educational programs like this.

, You’ll be surprised how easily you can incorporate a walk in a nearby park or trip to a local store or restaurant into a class lesson. For instance, if your students are studying economics, have them visit several local stores and compare prices on specific items. You can turn a trip to a local park into a political lesson by discussing who runs the park, how the park is funded, and where the funding comes from., For many courses, this can be the most effective form of experiential learning. In addition to actually completing their internship or job shadowing, you’ll need to include avenues for reflection and application to your course to ensure the student is making these connections.


For instance, if your student is shadowing a local property attorney for your political science course, you may require them to research property law and how it fits into the larger context of the federal judicial system."
"
At the beginning of the semester, take a few minutes during class work time (or individual reading time) to pull each student aside and discuss learning goals for that semester.,
Explain that this portfolio must contain, at each grade level, two different samples of creative writing (for example, a poem and a short story - but not two poems or two short stories), one of an essay, one of a written assessment for a novel study/unit test, and one of a presentation/project, all to represent parts of GLO and SLO various requirements pertaining to each of these categories.,
Take some class time to give students the chance to go through past assignments and decide what they feel is an accurate representation of improvements on their goals.,
Revisit and reassess goals at mid semester.,
At the end of the semester, have students write a self reflection based on the achievement of their goals.,
The following year, review past goals with each student.",How to Use Portfolios in the English Class Setting for High School," There should only be two or three goals, as any more than that would be unrealistic to really focus on for achievement, and any less would not be enough for accurate well-rounded assessment of student learning. To increase accountability and productivity of work, be sure the students know that a mid-semester assessment of these goals will occur, just to see how things are going. At that time the goals may be altered slightly if they turned out to be less realistic than they seemed.;
, Remember, the contents of the portfolio have already been graded to assess the GLO and SLO requirements of the students, so including them for the purpose of further assessment of learning outcomes is unnecessary.


The beginning of their portfolio should consist of a table of contents, dividing it into the separate grades. At the beginning of each section for the different grades, the goals for that semester should be presented.

, It is recommended to take at least half an hour to forty-five minutes every three to four weeks to complete this. At this time you can also photocopy any necessary documents to save onto the computer or flash drive, to be added into the electronic portfolio.

, Any unreasonable goals can be tweaked at this point and altered to better suit the students' abilities if necessary. The point of the portfolio is to set each student up for success, not failure. Leaving unreachable goals as they are because the student was overexcited about what they wanted to achieve, or suggested the goal(s) in an attempt to impress the teacher is unacceptable and defeats the purpose of the portfolio, which is to increase motivation to try through pride and proof of personal improvement. By altering any goals that were over (or under) shot, students are also taught that this happens in real life as well and changing goals to make them more reachable is acceptable and likely necessary.

, They must include whether any alterations were made to their goals and why; what, if they would, change about their previous goals and think about when setting their goals for the next year; for after the first grade the portfolio is started in (whether it be nine or ten, depending on the school system) what improvements they have noticed in their personal writing, achievements they have accomplished that they didn't feel they previously could, and what they would like to do differently next time. Self-reflection on the entire process allows the student to entire higher level thinking of analysis, synthesis, and evaluation of personal progress. One rubric, the same for all grades and all English classes, will be given to the students at the beginning of the semester so that students are aware of what is expected of them.


This self-reflection will be the only thing graded for the portfolio. It will be a student-given grade out of five (five being that they achieved their goals with flying colours, and one being that they didn't even try). This way the student can't possibly get a grade of zero, which again would defeat the purpose of the portfolio as a means of motivation. The teacher also presents a grade for the student, out of five, and the two are averaged together for the student's overall grade for this portfolio assignment. By averaging the two grades to make one grade, the student will not feel as if the teacher's grade is more important than their own. As a total, the portfolio will only be worth 10% of the student's overall grade. Of course, any grade given must be justified and completely obscure grades (if the student were to award themselves a 5/5 on a portfolio that clearly deserves a 3, or a student gives themselves a too modest grade of 2 or 3 out of 5 when they deserve higher) will be discussed between the student and the teacher and potentially changed to become a more accurate assessment of the student's abilities to set and reach goals, assess themselves on past work and evaluation of how to alter future work.

, Based on the student's self assessment and accomplishment of past goals, the teacher and the student will decide if they should advance that goal, create new goals if previous goals were mastered, or continue with the same goals if results were not satisfactory. This teaches the students how to make goals, assess the quality and probability of them, alter them to make them more achievable, and then create new goals built and based off previous ones. This is a valuable life skill that has outside-of-the-classroom application.

With your class(es), introduce yourself in a way that makes you seem friendly and trustworthy.,
Everyday, make sure you have everything planned out.,
There is a very delicate balance between disaster and control, so don't treat every kid like a baby.,
When teaching the class(s), teach almost everything in a fascinating way.,
With homework, make it a fair amount.",How to Teach Science," Most students don't feel comfortable with teachers because, to be honest, most seem snappy. Therefore, have a calm, sweet complexion and attitude on the first few days of school. Talk about the classroom, where to get supplies, and what the rules are. Do not add a sour feeling when you speak of the rules, speak of them as if they were classwork.;
, Have a list of what to teach per day, for how long, and keep track of homework and assignments. Speaking of what to teach, start off with the main things you need to know about science. Speak, for example, about what science is, how it works, and what you will need to know in general. In science textbooks, it will usually list the standards students must master before they pass their science class. Also, when you teach, teach the students in a way that is understandable. Like, don't say something so complex that it goes through one ear and out the other, okay? Although, it is good to teach the students academic vocabulary just in case they use it on tests. Keep this in mind. Usually, those fancy vocab words are included in the textbooks.

, Treat everyone alike and also keep the balance of nature even. When someone isn't following the rules, just snap them back into attention in a quick way. Don't embarrass them, you wouldn't like it if anyone did it to you. Although, constant rule breaking seems worthy of detention or writing lines. Just make sure this saying is well known in your class: You are nice and fun, but serious when you need to be. You will take action when you desperately need to.

, If you are teaching the periodic table and everyone needs to memorize the elements, create a catchy song about it! List every element in the song and make it based on a popular tune. Use some imagination. Keep things interesting and try your best to help students become motivated and truly try to help them. This gets kids in the mood to pay attention and see you as a plus in school. This will make the info get into their minds faster.

, Like, don't give them piles of homework that go to their eyeballs! At a local bookstore or maybe online, you will find workbooks and printable science pages. Usually, homework should be something the class isn't the best in. Like, something that the class seriously doesn't get. Although, a little review on the mastered subjects isn't bad either.

Familiarize yourself with your local sex education requirements.,
Make sure teaching sex education is possible in your situation.,
Understand the different approaches to sex education.,
Plan your own lessons or curriculum.",How to Teach Sex Education1," Every school, state, province, or country will have its own set of requirements on how sex education can be taught. In most cases, if you are a professional educator, you will most likely be required to follow a certain curriculum provided for you. For example:


In the United States, the U.S, Department of Health & Human Service identifies 28 evidence-based curriculums that are eligible to be taught.Your school or program may provide you materials and information from these curriculums.
The Public Health Agency of Canada provides Canadian Guidelines for Sexual Health Education. It is a guide that provides specific curricula and teaching strategies to teach sex education. Canadian sex education teaches key concepts like health, health promotion, health education, sexuality, sexual health, and sexual rights.In the United Kingdom, sex education is compulsory after age 11 and focuses on teaching children about reproduction, sexuality, and sexual health.Sex and relationship education (SRE) is part of the national curriculum and is based on the Personal, Social, and Health Education (PSHE) framework of knowledge.Guidelines can be found on the UK government website.;
, In some countries, cultures, religions, and schools, sex education for children is not compulsory or mandatory. In these situations, teaching sex education to children can be difficult for many reasons. For example, sex education might not be welcomed and you may run into roadblocks before you are allowed to teach it. Before teaching sex education, you may have to:


Speak to local officials about implementing sex education in your area. This might mean speaking to schools, your community, or members of your government.
Prepare resources and evidence that sex education is needed.
Join an organization or group that advocates for the implementation of sex education for the community.
Plan your own sex education curriculum. You may be able to teach sex education but there are little resources available to you that provide tested and reputable sex education programs that can be taught in your area. In these cases, you may need to do extensive research, talk to sexual health professionals, and collaborate with institutions to come up with an effective sex education program.

, In North America, most curriculums advocate the need for comprehensive sexual health education where multiple topics are discussed and taught extensively. Issues taught include contraception, gender, sexuality, abstinence, abortion, sexually transmitted diseases, and much more. Comprehensive sexual health education is just one approach to sex education. Some other approaches include:Family life education: This program places emphasis on preparing children for family life and reproduction.

Population education: This program focuses on the sociological, environmental and economic consequences of population growth.

Medical/disease education: This program emphasizes on avoiding disease and provides medical information about sexual health.

Fear-based approach: This program emphasizes the risks of sexually transmitted infections, diseases, and HIV.

Abstinence-based education: This programs focuses on abstinence from sex a way to avoid pregnancy and does not provide much coverage on how to use contraceptives, how to have safe sex, and how STIs/HIV work.

Sexuality education: This approach places more emphasis on the individual, sexual activity, sexology, biology and behaviour. It presents sexuality as a key part of life and includes message that sexuality and sex are pleasurable.

, Some sex education programs may already have detailed lesson plans for you to follow and some may only provide you with guidelines and will require you to come up with your own lessons. In the case that you will need to plan your own lessons, it is best to follow the established and accurate curriculums for sex education at your school, community, or sex health care provider. These programs have been tested for effectiveness and will provide helpful advice, approaches, and strategies to aid you in teaching sex education.


Reach out to other educators who have already implemented or taught sex education. Ask them what was effective, what didn't work, and how they approached sex education with their learners.
You may need to establish your own curriculum if you are teaching groups that need special attention, such as learners who have mental disabilities, LGBTQ+ learners, or if you are teaching in a community with specific beliefs and religious views.

"
"
Educate yourself on sex and sexual health.,
Understand who you are educating to.,
Determine what your goals are when teaching sex education.,
Provide a safe environment when talking about sex.,
Prepare to tackle complex issues like gender and sexuality.,
Practice talking about sexual health.,
Contact your learners' parents or guardians with information about the content you'll be teaching.",How to Teach Sex Education2," To better prepare yourself to answer any questions a learner might ask, it's important you understand the material you will be teaching. You can go online, to your local library, or bookstore to find information about sex, sexual health, and sexuality. There are also many organizations that provide courses and materials to help educators teach sex education.


Sex education is more than just teaching about sexual behaviours.This means you should also educate yourself on issues such as abstinence, body image, gender, sexuality, sexual development, sexually transmitted diseases, sexual health, and sexual pleasure.
Use established, evaluated sex education sources and curriculums to aid in your research. There are many myths and misconceptions that surround sex education and sex in general. Knowing what the truth is and having accurate information about sex education can help you teach better and prevent you from relaying inaccurate or negative information to your learners.
Educating yourself about sex can help increase your comfort level with talking about sex or certain topics related to it to others.

, Age is an important factor that will shape how you educate sex to your learners. Some parents, guardians, and educators will be uncomfortable with sex being taught to children as young as kindergarten. But using age-appropriate information to teach sex education can help ease worries and discomforts about teaching such a sensitive topic like sex.Different issues or topics will be taught depending on a learner's age. Established curriculums will have versions that are tailored to the age of the learner.
Knowing the stage of sexual development of your learners will aid you in answering questions and help you provide age-appropriate information and resources for your learners. This way, you can avoid situations where you overstep boundaries or teach beyond what is appropriate to your learners.

, Defining your goals or what you would like your learners to achieve after you teach is a helpful way to organize and teach your lessons. In general, most sex educators strive for these goals:


To reduce negative outcomes from sexual behaviours such as unwanted or unplanned pregnancies and infection from sexually transmitted diseases.To provide appropriate knowledge and skills for learners to make healthy decisions about their sex life and future.
To build self-confidence in learners.
To help learners develop positive relationships and experiences with their sexuality.
To provide medically accurate information about concepts like abstinence, contraception, and other health concerns.
To respect community, social, and individual values and beliefs regarding sex., If you are a teacher or someone who works for the community or a sexual health organization, you will most likely be teaching in a classroom setting. Whether you're a teacher, parent, guardian, or a friend, it's important you set up a safe environment to talk about sex. A safe environment:


Allows learners to feel positive and confident as they learn and ask questions.
Is free of negative judgements.
Discourages censorship and instead, promotes an open and honest environment.
Can be in a classroom, at a community centre, or at home.

, Gender, sex, and sexuality are different concepts that are often confused together. By differentiating them, you can help ease a learner's confusion about their identity, especially for those who are struggling with ""non-normative"" identities. These identities include people who may have gender identity issues like trans youth or those who may be questioning their sexuality.


Reach out to the community to obtain a better understanding of these complex issues. There are many organizations within the LGBTQ+ community that can provide you with materials, resources, and even curriculums for you to follow.
Advocate for safer policies regarding issues like homophobia or transphobia. Trans and LGBTQ+ youth are more likely to be harassed and abused verbally, physically and sexually.By educating or approaching the community with these issues, you help save lives of LGTBQ+ individuals and foster a more accepting environment.
Partner with professionals that specialize in certain topics to ensure your curriculum covers everything accurately and effectively. For example, you may ask invite a member of the LGBTQ+ community to lead a lesson and talk about their experiences and share their knowledge about sexual health and well-being to your learners.
Make sure your curriculum is age-appropriate, culturally sensitive, and respects the beliefs and values of differing groups. This may be difficult to do but it's not impossible. By getting feedback from other educators, professionals, and parents or guardians of learners, you can help ensure your curriculum is appropriate.

, This can be very beneficial if you find the topic of sex education uncomfortable to discuss. Try talking casually and openly to a peer or a close friend about sexual health. Or practice teaching your lesson to someone you're close with. This exercise can help you with become comfortable talking about sex and also provide you with feedback on how effective your teaching is.Practicing can help you avoid mistakes like being overly critical of someone else's opinion about sex, laughing in times of discomfort or embarrassment, and avoid lecturing or talking down to people when you're teaching.

, While teaching young learners, it's extremely important you keep parents and guardians involved in the process of sex education. Send parents and guardians a letter detailing the sexual health program you will be teaching to their children. This way, learners can choose to either opt out of the lesson or provide you with comments before you start teaching.


Many sexual health organizations and curriculums can provide educators with a sample letter to use to send to parents and guardians.
You can send simple outlines of each lesson or a detailed summary of the whole program.
If you are teaching adult learners, it is also important to let them know what you plan to teach. Some learners may have differing beliefs and values and may choose to opt out of certain lessons or from the entire program you'll be teaching.

Remind yourself that sex education for infants is not about acts of sex.,
Teach children the correct names of body parts, including their genitalia.,
Tell children about the basic rules of privacy.,
Observe young children's gender expressions.,
Teach the basics of reproduction.",How to Teach Sex Education3," The thought of teaching sex education for infants can be daunting and taboo, but most parents, guardians, and caregivers already teach infants sex education without even knowing it. From age 0 to 3, children will begin to explore their bodies, learn the differences between males and females, and start to form their own gender identities. Sex education for infants takes the form of teaching children about their bodies and helping them form healthy relationships and bonds with caregivers. If you are teaching infants about their sexual health, you are most likely their parent, guardian, or primary caregiver. Most institutions do acknowledge the importance of sex education for infants but it is unlikely there are any formal educational programs out there for children that young.
By making the conscious effort to teach infants about their bodies, about genders, and by promoting good relationships, you are creating a positive foundation for their future sexual well-being.

, Children start to learn body parts as infants and are often told to show caregivers their nose, eyes, and ears, for example. At this time, infants should also be taught the correct names of their genitalia. By teaching children early, they will become comfortable and familiar with their bodies and be more aware of sexual or reproductive health problems as they age and will be more likely to seek help.


Use opportunities like bath time or diaper changes to teach infants about their bodies. It can be as simple as pointing to a child's genitals and saying, ""That is your penis"" or ""That is your vulva"".You can also start to make associations between sex and genitalia by saying, ""Females have vaginas"" and ""Males have penises"". However, it is important to understand the difference between sex and gender and decide how you would like to teach your child about gender.

, Many children will develop curiosity about the body as young as 2 years old. They may start engaging in behaviours such as asking each other about their bodies, peeking at each others bodies in bathrooms, or even showing private body parts to each other. Young children may also start to hug, kiss, and touch each other. At this point, it is important to talk to children about the basic rules of privacy, such as:Your body is your own. Children should learn that their body belongs to them and no one can touch it without their permission. They should be taught how to say ""no"" to kissing, hugging, and other types of physical contact they don't want whether it is appropriate or not.

Good touch versus bad touch. Children should be taught how to recognize appropriate and inappropriate touching. A good way to teach this is to use The Underwear Rule. This means touching anywhere that is covered by underwear is inappropriate. They should also be taught to consult with a trusted adult or family member when bad touches happen.

Good secrets and bad secrets. Teaching children that there are bad secrets and good secrets helps prevent sexual abusers from manipulating children into keeping secrets like if they are being touched inappropriately or being abused.

, By two, a child will begin to understand what gender is and even identify their own gender identity. However, it is common for children to experiment with their gender identity through role playing and dressing up. It's important to be aware of your child's gender expression so you can prepare for certain situations:


Some children may start to show signs of being transgender.
Children may ask questions or make assumptions about what is correct behaviour for a certain gender.
Other people or children may disagree with a child's gender expression and cause the child distress.

, Children at this age will begin to ask questions about babies such as ""Where did I come from?"" or ""Where do babies come from?"" You can start to tell young children the basics of reproduction:


""Babies grow in the uterus of a woman.""You may use different language like, ""You came from mommy's belly"" or ""Mommy made you"".
""A male and female is required for reproduction."" or ""Mommy and daddy made you"".
It is always recommended to use accurate and correct language to eliminate confusion in the future and allow children to be comfortable with talking about reproduction.

Explain to children the process of puberty.,
Anticipate that children will start to explore behaviours that may be sexual in nature.,
Acknowledge children's struggles with body image, social skills, and sexuality.",How to Teach Sex Education4," Children as young as 8 may begin to experience puberty both physically and mentally. It is important to make children aware what changes may follow, such as:


Physical changes like the growth of genitals, breast development and menstruation in females, and growth spurts.
Sexual feelings that may lead to sexual attraction to others and masturbation.
Emotional changes that affect how children see themselves, their self-image, and how they relate to others like their parents, family, and friends.

, Elementary-aged children may start to become physically intimate with each other and start dating, kissing, or touching. Some older children may even begin to explore the idea of being sexually intimate with someone.


Some education programs will start to educate elementary-aged children about protection and contraceptives when engaging in sex. As well as the effects of HIVs/AIDs and STIs/STDs.
The continuation of teaching children that their bodies are their own will help them engage in safe and healthy relationships with others.

, At this time, children will come across difficulties with expressing themselves or have trouble understanding what is happening to them as puberty begins. It's important to address issues such as:



Sexuality. Since children at this age will start to develop attraction towards one another, some may experience difficulty adjusting to their sexuality, especially if they identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or anything other than what is assumed as ""normal"". Provide resources and comfort to help children adjust to their sexuality.
Gender identity. Some children may be expressing their gender differently or identify as transgender. Validate these differences by providing children tools and resources to better navigate their gender and also protect them from discrimination or bullying.

Masturbation. In most sex education programs, masturbation is seen as a healthy and normal activity. Many may have questions about masturbation or about their sudden development of intense sexual feelings that might have lead to incidents like having ""wet dreams"".

Family life. Family life may be affected since parents or family members may start to give more responsibilities to older children and even divide tasks based on gender. At this time, sex or gender discrimination is an important topic to cover.

Body image. With all the physical changes happening, it's important to address healthy ways to deal with low self-esteem or issues with body image.

"
"
Emphasize the importance of consent when engaging in sexual activities.,
Teach children how to use protection and contraceptives.",How to Teach Sex Education5," Some children from 15 to 19 years old will be sexually active so it is important to talk about what consent is, what it looks like, and stress the importance of it. Teaching consent will decrease the likelihood of sexual violence and also promote healthier relationships and better overall sexual health. An overview of consent includes knowing that:


Consent is a voluntary and enthusiastic ""yes"". It is not based on silence, previous sexual activities, or what the person is wearing.Consent needs to be asked and given. Both parties should ask each other if they would be willing to engage in a certain sexual activity and both parties should answer.
Consent is not coercion. Pressuring someone into sex, threatening them, intimidating them, blackmailing then, or guilt-tripping them into sexual acts are all forms of coercion.

, Depending on your program or curriculum, you may need to teach children how to use protection or about contraception. You may need to provide them with demonstrations, resources, and discuss the benefits and effects of using protection and contraceptives.


Be sure to talk about the wide variety of contraceptives available. For example, condoms can be used by both females and males.
Teach children the effects of having unprotected sex. These include having an unwanted or unplanned pregnancy, and receiving and transmitting diseases.

"
"
Learn the teaching strategies required of your program.,
Choose activities that encourage students to work cooperatively.,
Use visuals and media to aid your teaching.,
Encourage students to reflect through journal writing.,
Evaluate and assess your students' learning.",How to Teach Sex Education6," If you are following a specific program or curriculum, it is most likely you will be given teaching strategies to learn and use. In most cases, these strategies were tested, researched, and judged as the best way to teach a certain sex education program.


Some curriculums will be very specific, providing you with detailed lesson plans, activities, and strategies.
Many educators will work with their school, community, or sexual health organization to figure out what the best approaches and strategies to teaching sex education are. If there are particular strategies or approaches that you believe are effective, you can always find a way to become involved with how sex education is taught to others. Join organizations, your school board, or speak to officials about ways to better sex education in your area.

, Most sexual health organizations encourage educators to adopt cooperative learning strategies. This means students or learners work with others in assignments, discussions, and projects. This gets students involved in their learning and helps them construct meaning from information on their own. Some examples of cooperative learning strategies include:



Inquiry-based learning: This approach places students' questions, ideas, and observations in the centre of their learning experience.You will act as a ""provocateur"" or someone that introduces students to ideas or topics that is of interest to them or what matters to them. Students are guided to investigate and look for answers using critical thinking skills, problem-solving skills, and evidence-based reasoning.

Problem-based learning:This approach begins by presenting a problem to students before they receive any knowledge about a topic. This method gives you more control of what topics or problems to focus on. After students are informed of the problem, they are encouraged to seek knowledge and solutions cooperatively together. For example, you could make up a hypothetical problem like ""Sally doesn't want to have sex with her boyfriend. How can she tell her boyfriend this?"" and then ask students to come up with a solution.

Project-based learning: This approach has students working on a long term project that addresses and investigates complex questions, problems, or challenges in sex education. A popular project-based learning approach used in sex education is to simulate what having a baby is like. Students bring home a life-like baby doll that cries, eats, poops, and pees, and is asked to care for it for an extended period of time. The project helps students realize that caring for a child can be difficult and teaches them responsibility.

, You can use pictures, diagrams, videos, or visual demonstrations to keep students engaged while you're teaching. Try these activities:


Fill in the blank diagrams. This is especially helpful to demonstrate the human body and things related to it such as the menstrual cycle, genitalia, areas affected by puberty, or the reproduction cycle.
Watch informative videos. In most sex education curriculums, videos will be provided to help you teach your students.
Demonstrate how to do things. In many sex education courses, educators will demonstrate with objects how to put on a condom, how to use a menstrual pad or tampon, how contraceptives work, and how sexually transmitted diseases work.It's important these demonstrations only simulate the actual action. You may have seen educators put condoms on bananas or use small cups of water to demonstrate how a tampon works.

, Journal-writing encourages students to record, reflect, and write about their health learning. Many health care providers encourage people of all ages and life stages to use journal writing to keep track of their health concerns. Having a health care journal can:


Keep track of your health. It's easier to detect patterns if you record any concerns you have about your health the moment it happens. A constant ache or pain could indicate a bigger problem if it has been happening for days or weeks. A injury in the past might explain a new health concern today.
Keep track of medications. A journal could help remind you to take medication, get tested regularly, or inform them of what medications they have used in the past.
Provide an overall review of a person's health. Just by recording all things health-related, a health care journal can give a brief summary of your health.

, After teaching your students, it's important to evaluate how effective your teaching was. There are many ways you can assess your students:


Do a comprehension check. You can simply ask students to reiterate what they learned after a lesson. Or give them a quiz or do a review exercise.
Observe your students. You may notice a few disengaged students, or you may realize a certain topic makes everyone feel uncomfortable. By observing your students, you can assess how effective your lesson was.
Assess projects and assignments according to a rubric. This is a more accurate way to measure the success of your lesson. Many curriculums provided by your school or a health care organization will have rubrics to help you assess students' learning.

"
"
Establish the ground rules before starting the lesson.,
Inform students that you will respect their privacy.,
Actively promote critical thinking and open-mindedness.,
Relate with your learners what they have learned in the past.,
Allow learners to ask questions anonymously or privately with you.",How to Teach Sex Education7," Rules help create a safe and open discussion during your lesson. Tell your learners to:


Listen and speak appropriately during your lesson. This might mean raising their hand, speaking only when called, and using appropriate language when talking.
Respect other students. Some students may be reluctant to share information or ask questions that might sound ""silly"" to others. Respecting each other means being non-judgemental towards one another.
Maintain confidentiality during the lesson. Personal experiences and information might be shared during the lesson and students should be told not to share these stories or information to others outside of the class.

, Let your students know that you are here to discuss facts and opinions about sexual health -- not to expose or push students to talk about their own or any sexual experiences.


Refrain from talking about your own sexual experiences if it doesn't enrich or benefit the lesson and your learners. In some situations, especially if you have a very close or casual relationship with your learners, sharing stories and experiences can help relax students and even open them up to express their own opinions and questions. However, it's best to avoid this unless you have a very good and mutual understanding with your learners. In some situations, sharing explicit personal information about yourself can make learners feel uncomfortable.

, A great educator is not only someone who is able to relay information to their learners, but is also one who is able to listen and inspire their learners. There are many ways you can encourage your students:


Refrain from taking a one-sided point of view on a issue. Instead, express an open attitude and willingness to listen and discuss any and all issues relating to sexual health.
Show that you value a learner's opinion or what they have to say. Use validating responses or phrases like, ""That's an interesting comment you've made"" or ""I think what you said is very important"" or ""I understand your concern"".
Ask for your learners' opinions on an issue. After explaining an issue or concept, open the discussion by asking if anyone has questions, concerns, or comments they'd like to make. Ask what they think about what you've just taught them.
Be flexible when teaching your lesson. Sometimes learners will have burning questions that they can't keep until the end to ask. Encourage and allow students to ask questions or make comments whenever they arise, even if they might steer the discussion towards an unintended topic in your lesson plan. However, always use judgement: not every question is worth answering right then and there.

, Every learner will enter a sex education course or classroom with different ideas on how sex or sexual health works. A good way to ease into the beginning of a lesson is to ask your students to share what they know about a certain topic.


This activity encourages students to actively participate in discussions.
Knowing what the students already know can help give you an idea how to go about the lesson. You will have a better sense of what issues to focus more on and any misinformation you will need to correct.

, In any setting, there will be learners who are shy or feel uncomfortable asking their questions in front of a large group. Give opportunities to these learners by:


Providing resources to them. Direct students to reputable resources where they can find their own answers to their questions such as websites, books, or information from sexual health organizations.
Giving them a point of contact to discuss their concerns with their own sexual health. It can be a guidance counsellor, a sexual health professional or service, or even you.
Let learners submit questions anonymously. A helpful activity to try in class is to have all your students write down their questions or concerns on a piece of paper and submit it to your anonymously. You can then answer these questions in front of the class or incorporate the questions in a future lesson.

"
"
Reinforce what is an appropriate or inappropriate question.,
Validate students' concerns.,
Answer questions as honestly and as best you can.,
Determine if you will be answering questions about personal behaviour.,
Diffuse questions asked to ""shock"" others.",How to Teach Sex Education8," Although you should encourage students to openly ask questions, you should also evaluate which questions are appropriate to answer and which are just asked to produce a reaction rather than to enhance learning. Tell your students:


""If I don't answer a question, it's not because it's a bad question. It might be that I feel it isn't an interest to all students.""
""If you ask a question and I don't answer it, ask me again after class in private.""

, Even if you don't answer a question or come across an opinion or question you can't respond to, you can validate the student's comment. Some helpful ways to respond to students' comments is to:



Give affirmation: ""Thanks for asking"", ""That is a great question!"", or ""Please tell me more about what you'd like to know.""

Ask for clarification positively: ""Sounds like you have a real concern. Can you please tell me more about what's on your mind?"" or ""That sounds like an important question. Could you explain it to me a bit more?""

Address feelings: Some questions may be loaded with feelings such as embarrassment or disgust. Try prefacing your answer by saying, ""We are all embarrassed sometimes, but it's important to discuss it"".

Normalize the question: ""Many people ask that question!"" or ""That's something a lot of people have wondered about"" but never use the word ""normal"". Normal is not a proper term to use as it has a heavy social meaning to it rather than a medical meaning. In one setting or culture, something ""normal"" might be ""abnormal"" in another.

, If there is a question you don't know the answer to, let your students know. At the same time, validate their questions or concerns to let them know you understand them and will be working hard to answer their question eventually.


If a question makes you uncomfortable, let your students know. You might not be able to control your reaction or feelings toward a question and letting your students know how you feel about a question can help clarify why you can't answer a question. Try saying, ""I'm a bit uncomfortable with this question"" and follow up with validation.

, Students might ask questions about their own personal behaviours that you may or may not want to discuss with the class. You might be asked questions like, ""Is it normal to...?"" or ""Did you... when you were growing up?"" These questions might be religious or culturally loaded and may question morals rather than the facts you are teaching. Deal with these questions by:


Reinforcing the ground rules. If you choose not to answer personal behaviour questions, tell students, ""We won't be discussing personal behaviour questions during this class.""
Referring students to other resources. Other sexual health care professionals, parents, guardians, or religious organizations may be better equipped at answering questions about morals surrounding sexual health.
Speak to them privately about their concern. A question about a personal behaviour might be better understood in context. You might find out a student's family is religious after they ask you if abortions are okay. You might then refer them to the appropriate person to speak to about such an issue.

, Some students may ask questions to shock others into a reaction. They might have a real concern but are too embarrassed to address it seriously, or they feel the need to divert attention away from the topic being discussed. Never assume these questions are silly or tell students that their question is silly. Instead, remind students of your ground rules and try to guide this question into a teachable topic.


Reword any slang vocabulary to diffuse the question. A student might ask, ""Why do balls hurt when they're hit?"" You could respond by saying, ""First, the proper term for balls is testicles. Testicles are very sensitive and do hurt when they're hit"" and proceed to answer their question.
Students may also criticize certain topics and say statements like, ""Guys only want sex from girls!"" You can respond by addressing the underlying concern in a question or statement. In this example, you can respond by saying, ""It seems like you are concerned about respect in relationships.""

"
"
Follow the policies provided to you by the community.,
Prepare to respond to people who oppose sex education.",How to Teach Sex Education9," Each institution, community, and country will have different policies that dictate how sex education can be taught. These policies might come from the community or they could come from larger bodies of governance. In some cases, a conservative community will have certain views on how sex should be talked about and taught. However, that does not necessarily mean that is how sex education should be taught. And instead, the education system may have differing views and policies on how to teach certain sexual health topics.


Discuss with community leaders, educators, and organizations on what sex education looks like in a conservative community. They may have advice or provide you with guidelines on how to communicate with learners and their families, and even how to manage controversy and criticism about sex education.
Remember, the goal of sex education is promote sexual health to learners. Do what is best for your learners but practice judgement.

, People who oppose to sex education are not limited to conservative communities. The first thing to do if you come across someone who opposes sex education is to listen to their point of view and their reasoning. Do not belittle them or antagonize them by telling them they are misinformed or lack knowledge. Instead, respond to their concerns calmly and be as helpful as you can. There are many reasons why someone might oppose to sex education:


They lack knowledge about your program and don't know how you will implement sex education. Give them information about your program, the lessons you will be teaching, and your goals while teaching. If a whole community is opposed to sex education because of this reason, bring written material about your program to community meetings, to community members, and discuss your program with them.
They fear they sex education will distress or corrupt young people. Let them know that sex education advocates for responsible sexual health and does not always primarily focus on sexual activities or behaviours.
They believe talking about sex leads to sexual activity. There are many reputable and authoritative studies that show sex education does not increase sexual experimentation. Instead, sex education only changes the way sex is performed, usually meaning people who have had sex education are more likely to use contraceptives and get tested for STIs.
Sex education opposes their moral, religious, or cultural beliefs. Let them know that it is perfectly okay to opt out of sex education. Or let them know when certain topics will be discussed and allow the option to opt out of classes that go against a certain belief.

Choose a TV series.,
Explain time management.Emphasize to the student that ""contact"" time should only count for less that 50% of their total learning time.,
Incorporate the 4 approaches.,
Conclusion - Total time: Listening 30 + Reading 40 + Speaking 50 + Writing 30 = 150 minutes.

",How to Tutor English to a Private Student in Taiwan," Let the student choose an English television series that they like or that is applicable to their line of work. A physical therapist, nurse or doctor can, for example,choose a series like Grey's Anatomy. They should then choose a 10 minute segment for every week.;
, They should spend at least one hour previewing, preparing, correcting and reviewing on their own for every contact hour.Because work and life can keep us busy, it's sometimes hard to find an hour during the week, suggest to split the time up in three or more 20-minute time slots. Much more effective and not so tiring.

, Listening, reading, speaking and writing.


Listening. - Preview and review, private time - 10 minutes.The student watches the video clip of the week(without subtitles). Of course there will be words and phrases they won't understand. That is fine! Identify the  words and phrases that will be mastered in the week. They e-mail you the video clip or the name and timestamps. You should also watch it.
Reading - Preview, private time. - 10 minutes.Most series' subtitles can easily be downloaded at sites like www.subscene.com. Use the timestamps to find the exact words in the video clip. After watching the video clip, the student should read the subtitles aloud and note the words and sentences they don't understand. Print it out and use a pencil to circle all the new words and make notes.
Writing - Preparation , private time - 20+ minutes.Ask them to write about what happened in the video clip. Describe the people, their emotions, sequence of events etc. As if they're writing to somebody that hasn't seen the clip. They can also watch the clip again with subtitles.
Speaking - Preview, private time - 10 minutes.They should practice telling the story to themselves, a friend, a family member, a pet, anyone!
Speaking - Contact time - 20+ minutes. They tell you what happened in the clip, like a story! They can refer to their notes if necessary. Give them some feedback on their written work, they make notes to correct it later and them e-mail it to you during the week.
Reading - Contact time  -  10+ minutes.They read aloud the corrected writing assignment of the previous week.Make sure they understand everything.
Listening and speaking - Contact time - 10+ minutes.Choose about 10 words of phrases from the clip that you think they might not understand. Test them verbally to see if they do. They should explain to you what it means, if they can not, explain it to them.
Speaking and reading - Contact time - 20+ minutes.The student asks questions about the new clip. If they don't have any specific questions you can go through the subtitles together and discuss. Also discuss the previous week's grammar and pronunciation corrections.
Writing - Correcting, private time 10 minutes.Send the student the corrected writing assignment to be re-written.
Listening - Review,  private time - 10 minutes.The student watches the video clip again, but this time understanding more!(without subtitles)
Reading, speaking - Correcting, private time - 10 minutes.During the contact time you should record the whole session. Listen for any grammar or pronunciation mistakes at home and make a list of short sentences for the student to practice reading aloud. Send it to them via e-mail.

""Drive” to your final destination. Move from 810 to 815. Measure the distance and write down the answer: 5.
Add together the 4 measurements: 2+400+10+5=417. Therefore, 815-398-417."

Before learning to round, students must be able to skip count. Skip counting allows students to identify the nearest ten or nearest hundred to a number that is being rounded. Students also need to understand the difference between counting by ones, tens, and hundreds, to activate their understanding of place value.;
, Choose random tens, and ask the students which ten is above it.


Students can use a hundreds chart if need be.
For example, after the students can count by tens to 100, ask, “What ten is above 20? 30 is the ten above 20.”

, Choose random hundreds, and ask the students which hundred is above it.


Students can use a thousands chart if need be.
For example, after the students can count by hundreds to 1,000, ask, “What hundred is above 400? 500 is above 400.”

, The skip counting you do will depend on the type of rounding you expect the students to do.


For example, if rounding to the ten thousands place, practice skip counting by thousands and ten thousands.

, Choose a number that has different digits in each place value, for clarity’s sake.


It is essential that students have a complete understanding of place value before attempting to teach them rounding. If students have already mastered place value, you can skip this part.
This assumes you are teaching rounding to the tens or hundreds. If you are teaching rounding to the thousands or more, you might want to write a number that has 5 or more digits.
For example, you might write the number 3,892.

, Point to the digit farthest to the right. Explain the value of the digit in the ones place. Count by ones until you reach the value.


You can use base 10 blocks or other manipulatives to help illustrate the value of each digit.
For example, in the number 3,892, point to the 2 and explain that the 2 is in the ones place, and the value of 2 twos is 2. Count: “1, 2.”

, Point to the digit second from the right. Explain the value of the digit in the tens place. Count by tens until you reach the value.


For example, in the number 3,892, point to the 9 and explain that the 9 is in the tens place, and the value of 9 tens is 90. Count: “10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90.”

, Point to the digit third from the right. Explain the value of the digit in the hundreds place. Count by hundreds until you reach the value.


For example, in the number 3,892, point to the 8 and explain that the 8 is in the hundreds place, and the value of 8 hundreds is 800. Count: “100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800.”

, Point to the digit fourth from the right. Explain the value of the digit in the thousands place. Count by thousands until you reach the value.


For example, in the number 3,892, point to the 3 and explain that the 3 is in the thousands place, and the value of 3 thousands is 3,000. Count: “1,000, 2,000, 3,000.”

, Rounding is changing a difficult number to a number close by. We round a number to make it easier to use.For example, if you are trying to figure out about how many total cookies you and your friend ate last year, and you ate 327 cookies while your friend ate 286, you could round both numbers to 300, because 300 + 300 is easier to calculate than 327 + 286.

, We often round to the nearest ten, hundred, or thousand. Review what place value the students are rounding to.


For example, you might want student to round to the nearest hundred. Review where the hundreds place is, if necessary.

, The number should go to at least the same place value students are rounding to.


For example, if students are rounding to the nearest hundred, you might choose the number 892.

, Determine the value, and ask for the rounded number above it.


For example, if rounding 892 to the nearest hundred, students should locate the 8, and understand that its value is 800. Ask, “What hundred is above 800? 900 is above 800.” Emphasize that students are rounding to the nearest hundred.

, The number on the far left of the line should be the value of the digit in the target place value. The value on the far right should be the rounded number above it. Use hash marks to skip count up the number line.


For better accuracy, it is helpful to use preprinted number lines instead of hand-drawn number lines.
For example, if rounding 892 to the nearest hundred, the number on the far left of the number line would be 800, and the number on the far right of the number line would be 900. In between, the hash marks would skip count by tens: 810, 820, 830, 840, 850, 860, 870, 880, 890, 900.

, Mark this point on the line.


You can mark the point with a star or dot, or you can trace over the first half of the number line in one color, and trace the second half of the number line in another color.
For example, if using a number line that begins with 800 and ends with 900, the halfway point would be 850, so you would draw a star on the 850 hash mark.

, Use the additional hash marks on the number line to denote other place values as necessary. Draw a dot on the appropriate hash mark, and write the number above the dot.


For example, if plotting 892, you would draw nine hash marks between 890 and 900, and draw a dot on the second hash mark after 890.

, Determine whether the number is closer to the first number on the number line, or the last number on the number line.


For example, ask students if 892 is above or below 850. Since it is above 850, it is closer to 900 than it is to 800.

, Whether we round up or down depends on which rounded number our actual number is closest to.


If the actual number is closer to the lower rounded number, or below the halfway point, we round down.
If the number is exactly at the halfway point, explain that the rule is that you round up. If the actual number is closer to the higher rounded number, or above the halfway point, we round up.

, Circle this number on the number line, and draw an arrow pointing to it from the actual number.


For example, since 892 is above the halfway point, we round up to 900. So 892 rounded to the nearest hundred is 900. Draw an arrow pointing from 892 to 900. Circle 900.

, The number should go to at least the same place value students are rounding to.


This part is for students who can think more abstractly about rounding. It is helpful to use only after students have mastered rounding using a number line.
For example, if students are rounding to the nearest hundred, you might write down the number 892.

, Circle the digit in this place value and determine its value. Ask students what rounded number is above it.


For example, if rounding 892 to the nearest hundred, students should circle the 8, and understand that its value is 800. Ask, “What hundred is above 800? 900 is above 800.” Emphasize that students are rounding to the nearest hundred.

, The place value below gives us the information we need in order to determine whether we round up or down. It is the deciding digit. Underline the deciding digit in this place value.


For example, if rounding 892 to the nearest hundred, students should look to the tens place and underline the 9.

, If the deciding digit is 5 or more, we round up. If the deciding digit is 4 or less, we round down.It might be helpful to draw a 5 next to an arrow pointing up, and a 4 next to an arrow pointing down.

, Determine whether it is tells you to round up or down.


For example, in the number 892, you would look at the 9. Since 9 is above 5, it tells you to round up.

, Draw an arrow pointing from the original number to the rounded number. Make sure students can identify what place value they were rounding to.


Students can be confused when rounding down using this method. For example, they might think they should round 412 down to 300, because 300 is the hundred below 400. Emphasize that they should consider the original number they are rounding and find the hundred below the original number, not the hundred below the hundreds place of the original number.
For example, 892 rounded to the nearest hundred is 900. Draw an arrow from 892 to 900.

, In this context, the word amo means love. Now you have written yo te amo or te amo, which both mean ""I love you"".

, Te amo is the romantic way of saying ""I love you"", therefore it should only be used when speaking or writing to a lover or spouse. It is a very serious and intimate way of saying ""I love you"", so it tends to be used less commonly than te quiero."

If you plan to print your letter on letterhead, you don't need to include your name and address.
When writing an email, you normally don't include the addresses at the top of the page.;
, If you're sending a formal letter, it is customary to write the date the letter was written at the top. In Spanish letters, the date may be preceded by the city where you are located when you write the letter.For example, you might write ""Acapulco, 23 de diciembre de 2016."" Spanish dates follow the convention of writing the day first, followed by the month, with the year last. If you're using just numbers, you would write the same date ""23-12-16.""
For letters printed on letterhead, or more casual letters to friends or acquaintances, place the date in the top right-hand corner where you normally would put your name and address.
Formal business letters typically have the date on the left-hand side of the paper below the names and addresses.

, How you greet the person to whom you're writing in Spanish depends on the person's relationship to you and how well you know them. Casual greetings that might be appropriate for a friend or acquaintance might be offensive to someone who is older than you, or who you don't know personally.You can address your letter A quien corresponda: (or ""to whom it may concern"") if you don't know the name of the specific person who will read the letter. This greeting is appropriate for general business letters, such as when you're seeking more information about a product or service.
If the person is older than you, or if you're writing them for the first time, use Estimada/o plus the person's surname. Address them as señor or señora where appropriate. For example, you might write ""Estimado Señor Lopez."" This greeting literally translates to ""Esteemed Mr. Lopez,"" but is similar to writing ""Dear Mr. Lopez"" in English.
When you have a close relationship with the person, you can use Querido/a followed by their first name. For example, you might write ""Querida Benita,"" or ""Dear Benita.""
In a Spanish letter you should follow your greeting with a colon, rather than with the comma that is commonly used in English.

, In the first line of your letter, you want to let the person know who you are. Begin your letter by saying Mi nombre es and writing your full name. If it's important to your letter, you also should add your job title or relationship to the receiver of the letter.For example, you might write ""Mi nombre es Sally Sunshine."" Follow that with a sentence that explains who you are, such as if you are a student at a university or you are related to a friend of theirs.
If you're writing on someone else's behalf, you would add Escribo de parte de followed by the name of that person. For example, you might write ""Escribo de parte de Margarita Flores.""

, Immediately after you've introduced yourself, you need to explain briefly why you're writing to that person or what you want from them. You'll go into more detail in the body of your letter, but you want to set up the purpose of the letter immediately.You can think of this as a summary of your letter. For example, if you're writing a letter to inquire about a job or internship being offered, you might write Quisiera postularme para el puesto, meaning ""I wanted to apply for the post."" You would then go on to describe where you saw the post advertised or how you came to know about it.
This section should be no more than a sentence or two, and will conclude the first introductory paragraph of your letter.

, Even if you're on relatively good terms with the person to whom you're writing, Spanish letter writing uses more formal and polite language than you might use if you were writing the letter in English.In Spanish, formal writing tends to be more passive than language you might be more accustomed to using in English. Speak conditionally (quería saber si ustedes estarían disponibles or ""I wanted to know if you would be available"") and use the formal ""you"" (usted or ustedes) unless you are on close personal terms with the person.
If you're unsure how formal your letter should be, err on the side of formality. You are less likely to offend someone by being overly polite and formal than by being too casual or overly familiar.
If you've met the person several times before, or if you're responding to a letter they've written you, use those previous exchanges to guide your formality. You should never be less formal than the other person was to you.
Even if you're writing an email, colloquialisms or slang and abbreviations used in texting or casual conversation on the internet are not appropriate to use when you are writing a letter in Spanish.

, For the body of your letter, state your points or information in decreasing order of importance. Aim to write in a clear, concise way so that your letter ends up being no more than a page long.A personal letter, such as a letter to a friend describing your experiences on vacation, can be as long as you like. But for a business or other formal letter, be respectful of the receiver's time. Avoid going off on tangents that are unrelated to the purpose of the letter. You will impress the person more with your ability to write a formal letter correctly.
It may help to outline your letter briefly before you start writing, so that you know exactly what points or statements you want to make, and how you want to make them. Having your organization down ahead of time makes writing easier, especially if you're not writing in your first language.

, Your letter should be single-spaced, with a double-space between each paragraph. A paragraph doesn't need to be more than two or three sentences long.For each separate idea or point in your letter, you should have a separate paragraph.
For example, suppose you're writing a Spanish letter to apply for an internship. You have two basic points that you want to get across: your experience, and why you would be the best applicant for the internship. Your letter will include an introductory paragraph, a paragraph about your experience, a paragraph about why you're the best applicant, and a closing paragraph.

, Begin your closing paragraph with a sentence or two that summarizes your reason for writing. You also want to include any closing remarks that are relevant to the subject of your letter.For example, if you are writing to apply for a job or internship, you might include a statement in your closing that you have references that are available upon request.
If your letter is only a couple of paragraphs, this may not be necessary. However, it can be helpful for longer letters that are a couple of pages long, as it will bring your reader back to the reason you wrote to them in the first place.
This portion of the closing paragraph also typically isn't important if you are writing to a close friend or family member.

, To end your letter, let the person to whom you're writing know what you expect as a result of the letter. In this final sentence, you will let them know what decision you hope for them to make or when you expect to hear from them.For example, if you simply want a reply, but don't have any definite timetable, you might write Espero su respuesta, which means ""I await your reply.""
If you anticipate that the recipient may have questions or want to talk to you further, you might write Cualquier cosa estoy a su disposición, which means ""I am available should you have any questions.""

, Much as you would end a letter in English by writing a word or phrase such as ""Sincerely yours"" or ""All the best,"" a similar word or phrase in Spanish will close out your Spanish letter.Closing greetings in Spanish tend to be a bit more formal than they are in English. Commonly, you would use something such as Saludos cordiales, meaning ""Cordial greetings."" If you're asking the person for something, you might use Gracias y saludos, meaning ""Thank you and greetings.""
If you don't know the person at all, and they are older than you or in a position of authority, you might use Le saludo atentamente. This phrase is the most formal closing greeting, and can be literally translated as ""I attentively send greetings."" It is so formal that you're almost implying that you may not even be worthy of greeting the person.
When writing to a close friend or family member, use a closing greeting such as Besos, which means ""kisses."" It may seem more intimate than a closing greeting you would use in English, but it's a common way to close Spanish letters.

, Particularly if you wrote your letter using a word-processing application that defaults to English, you may have significant errors in punctuation or spelling. A sloppy letter reflects poorly on you and may signal that you don't respect the person to whom you're writing.If you have auto-correct enabled on your word-processing application, check your words carefully – especially if the application's default language is English. It may change some words to their closest English equivalent without you noticing.
Pay particular attention to punctuation. For example, Spanish questions begin with a ""¿"" and end with ""?"". This construction is unique to Spanish, and if you're not used to writing in Spanish you may omit the opening mark.

, Even if you have contact information at the top of the letter, it is customary to include direct contact information under your typed name. This is particularly important if you are writing in your capacity as an employee.For example, if you're typing your letter on your employer's letterhead, the letterhead typically includes general contact information for the company – not contact information for you personally.
Include the information that corresponds to your preferred method of communication. If you want the recipient of the letter to call you, put your phone number after your name. On the other hand, if you'd prefer they send you an email, give them your email address.

, When you're certain that your letter is error-free, print and sign it just as you would an English letter. Typically you'll leave a few blank lines under the closing greeting and then type your name.When you sign your letter, sign it above your typed name.
If the letter is for an official purpose, you may want to make a copy of your signed letter for your own records before you mail it off.

Change the spelling of verb stems that end in vowels.,
Memorize other irregular verbs.,
Place accent marks correctly with reflexive verbs.,
Use present progressive only for current actions.,
Speak in simple present tense if your action is interrupted.,
Avoid present progressive tense to discuss future actions.",How to Use the Present Progressive Tense in Spanish," To conjugate estar, you need to know the gender of the verb's subject. Unlike English, gender in Spanish is not limited to people and animals. Everything has a gender, including inanimate objects.For living creatures, you use a noun that corresponds to the gender of the creature in question. Nouns that end in ""o"" are masculine, while nouns that end in ""a"" are feminine. For example, if you were talking about a male cat, you would say ""el gato,"" but if you were talking about a female cat, you would say ""la gata.""
If you're talking about a mixed-gender group, you use the masculine gender. This is the case regardless of how many males or females are in the group. For example, if you were talking about a group of one niño (boy) and five niñas (girls), you would say ""seis niños.""
Some noun endings are gender exclusive. If the noun ends in -sión, -ción, -dad, -tud, or -umbre, it is feminine. On the other hand, nouns that end in -ma are masculine.
Be aware of exceptions to the general rules. For example, there are Spanish words ending in ""a"" that are masculine, such as día and planeta. There also are Spanish words ending in ""o"" that are feminine, such as foto and mano.;
, Spanish verbs have a different form depending on the gender of the subject of the verb, and whether the subject is singular or plural. Once you know the gender and quantity of the subject, you know which verb form to use.For singular subjects, use yo estoy (""I am""), tú estás (""you are""), or él/ella/Usted está (""He or she is."" Usted is a formal version of ""you,"" used when you want to convey respect to an authority figure or older person. It takes the third-person form of the verb, so translated literally this says ""You is."")
For plural subjects, use nosotros estamos (""we are""), vosotros estáis (""you all are."" Note that vosotros is only used in Spain, not in Latin America, which only uses ustedes as the plural of ""you""), or ellos/ellas/Ustedes están (""They are."" Note that Ustedes takes the third-person form of the verb, while vosotros takes the second-person form.)For example, ""Yo estoy un niño"" means ""I am a boy"" or ""I am a child."" This can also be said ""Soy un niño."" You don't always need the pronoun when speaking or writing in Spanish, since the verb form tells the listener or reader the identity of the subject.

, The past progressive verb tense refers to an action that was continuous, but happened in the past and is not ongoing in the future. Continuous actions in Spanish require the imperfect form.For singular subjects, the imperfect form is yo estaba (""I was""), tú estabas (""you were""), and él/ella/Usted estaba (""he/she/You was"").
For plural subjects, the imperfect form is nosotros estábamos (""we were""), vosotros estabais (""you all were), and ellos/ellas/Ustedes estaban (""They were"").For example, Estabas bailando means ""You were dancing.""

, To create the present participle, you remove the ending letters of the verb and replace them with the correct ending. This is similar to the English practice of adding ""-ing"" to a verb stem to indicate a continuous action. In Spanish, you typically remove the last two letters to reach the verb stem.Spanish verbs end in -ar, -er, or -ir. When you see those two letters, the part of the word that precedes them is the verb stem.
For example, the verb stem of hablar (""to speak"") is habl. The verb stem of comer (""to eat"") is com. The verb stem of vivir (""to live"") is viv.

, The ending -ando is used for verbs that end in ""ar,"" while -iendo is used for verbs ending in ""er"" or ""ir."" Provided you're dealing with a regular verb, the result will be the present participle of that verb.To form the present participle of -ar verbs such as hablar, remove the -ar and add -ando to create hablando.
To form the present participle of -er or -ir verbs such as comer and vivir, replace the last two letters to create comiendo and viviendo. Note that while it looks like you're only taking away one letter from -ir verbs, you still should think of it as replacing both to avoid confusion.

, Verb stems that end with vowels are irregular verbs, but the present participle is relatively simple to form. You just add a ""y"" so the verb is spelled like it is said, then add -endo.For example, if you take the -er ending off of verbs such as creer (""to believe"") or leer (""to read""), you would be left with cre and le. Add a ""y"" and -endo to create the present participles: creyendo and leyendo.


Ir (""to go"") is another irregular verb. It seems to be made entirely of the ending you're supposed to remove, so you would be left with nothing. However, all you have to do is treat it like a verb stem that ends in a vowel. That makes yendo the present participle.

, For other groups of irregular verbs, you will change the vowel in the verb stem as well as adding -iendo to form the present participle. Since there isn't much of a formula to figure out which verbs these are, it's easiest to memorize them as they come up in your study of Spanish. In some verbs the ""o"" in the verb stem changes to a ""u."" For example, morir (""to die"") becomes muriendo and dormir (""to sleep"") becomes durmiendo. If someone asked about your sister, and she was currently taking a nap, you would say ""Ella está durmiendo"" (""she is sleeping"").
For other irregular verbs, you'll change the ""e"" in the verb stem to an ""i,"" then add the ending. For example, the present participle of pedir (""to ask"") is pidiendo and of repetir (""to repeat"") is repitiendo.

, In Spanish, you use a reflexive verb to indicate that you are doing something to, on, or for yourself. This typically involves actions related to personal care, but other verbs also can be reflexive.When you add the reflexive pronoun to the end of the verb, it throws off the typical Spanish pronunciation. When a Spanish word ends with a vowel, or with an ""n"" or an ""s,"" the standard rule is to stress the second-to-last syllable.
However, with a reflexive verb this would mean you were emphasizing the wrong syllable. For this reason an accent mark typically is appropriate. For example, ""I am washing my hands"" in Spanish would be ""Estoy lavándome las manos.""
If you're unsure about whether to use an accent mark when forming the present participle of reflexive verbs, say the word aloud. If you stress a syllable other than the second-to-last, you need an accent mark over the vowel in the syllable you stress.

, The present progressive tense is made up of the correct conjugation of estar plus the present participle of the action verb. While this is similar to the way the present progressive is formed in English, in Spanish this verb tense is used in a more limited context.For example, in English you might say ""I am studying Spanish,"" to mean it is something you are doing generally. For example, you might be currently taking a class in Spanish, or majoring in Spanish at a university. However, you would only use the present progressive tense in Spanish if you had your book out at that exact moment and were in the midst of your Spanish studies.
Present progressive tense will be used most often in Spanish for actions that you can perform while talking. For example, you can wash your hands while talking to someone. If you're in the bathroom and someone calls through the door, you might say ""Estoy lavandome las manos!"" (""I am washing my hands!"") to let the person know that you are nearly done.
Keep in mind that often you can even use simple present tense to talk about an action that you are in the midst of doing at the moment you speak. When in doubt, this may be the easiest way to avoid confusion.

, Since present progressive is only used in Spanish for actions you're currently doing, simple present tense is appropriate if you stop doing the action to talk to someone else.For example, suppose you are sitting in your living room talking to your friend Juan when the phone rings. The person on the other end of the line asks what you're doing. ""Estoy hablando con Juan"" (""I am talking to Juan"") wouldn't be accurate – you are no longer talking to Juan.
In that example, you also could use past progressive tense to indicate that you were talking to Juan before the phone rang, and plan to resume that conversation later. This generally communicates to the person who called that they interrupted your conversation with Juan.

, In English, the present progressive is used when you are discussing ongoing actions or actions that are happening at some point in the future. Present progressive is not used in Spanish in these contexts.For example, if you were planning a trip to Mexico over spring break, and someone asked you what you were doing for spring break, you might say ""I am traveling to Mexico"" in English. However, if you were speaking in Spanish, you would only say ""Estoy viajado a México"" if you were actually en route as you spoke.
Keep in mind that when you use present progressive, a Spanish speaker will take it to mean that you are currently in the midst of doing that action. Limit your use of present progressive to prevent confusion.
For example, if you are a student and someone asks you what you are studying, you would say ""estudio español"" if you were a Spanish major. The literal translation of this is ""I study Spanish,"" but in this context it means the same thing as ""I am studying Spanish,"" which is the phrase you might use in English.

Conjugate the verb ir (pronounced like ear).,
Add the word a (pronounced ah).,
Finish your phrase with the infinitive.",How to Use the Near Future Tense (Spanish)1," The Spanish verb ir means to go. When constructing the informal future tense to talk about something that's going to happen in the near future, conjugate this verb in the present indicative to agree with the subject of the sentence.In the first person, ir is voy. In Spanish, ""yo voy"" means ""I am going.""
If the sentence you are writing is in second person, you would write ""tú vas"" (too vahs) which means ""you are going.""
For a singular third-person subject, such as él or ella, you would say va, as in ""él va"" (ell vah) or ""ella va"" (AY-yah vah). Remember that Spanish has a formal and informal you. Conjugate ir as you would with a third-person subject if you are using the pronoun usted.
First-person plural, nosotros (we) is vamos (no-SO-trohs VAH-mohs). Second-person plural, ustedes (you all) is van (oo-STAY-days vahn). With third-person plural, ellos or ellas, ir is conjugated the same. Your readers or listeners will understand the subject from the context of the sentence.;
, In English, infinitives include the word to (think ""to walk"" or ""to drive""). Spanish infinitives don't necessarily include this word, so if you want to say you are going to do something in the near future, you must include a after the verb ir.A means to in Spanish. For example, if you wanted to say ""I am going to learn Spanish,"" you would say Voy a aprender español (boy ah ah-PREN-day ess-PAN-yohl).
Keep in mind that in Spanish, you simply use the present tense for continuous actions that are taking place in the present and the future. While in English you would say ""I am going to the store"" to indicate that you were on your way to the store, in Spanish you would simply say ""Ir a la tienda"" (Ear ah la tee-END-ah, literally translates as ""I go to the store"").

, The infinitive expresses the action that the subject of the sentence is going to do at some point in the near future. The entire phrase is a lot like English, when you say you are going to do something.For example, if you wanted to say ""I am going to study a lot"" in Spanish, you would say Yo voy a estudiar mucho (yo boy ah ess-too-DEE-ahr MOO-choh).
You also can add a word or phrase to indicate when the action is going to take place. For example, Yo voy a estudiar mucho mañana (yo boy ah ess-too-DEE-ahr MOO-choh mahn-YAHN-ah) – I am going to study a lot tomorrow.

"
"
Determine whether the future action is certain.,
Conjugate the verb in present tense.,
Add a word or phrase to indicate timing.",How to Use the Near Future Tense (Spanish)2," In Spanish, unlike in English, you don't use the future tense to talk about actions that are certain to happen in the future. Instead, you typically would use present tense.This rule applies both to the informal future tense and the simple future tense. Use present tense when the action is certain, or when it is going to happen very soon (in the near future).
When in doubt, try simply using present tense. A Spanish speaker typically will understand what you mean, but if your reader or listener doesn't understand, they can ask for clarification.

, Using present tense to indicate future actions is relatively simple. Provided you already know how to conjugate the verb, you simply make it agree with the number and gender of the subject of the sentence in present indicative tense.For example, if you say ""Te veo en la escuela"" (tay vay-oh in lah ess-KWAY-lah) you are literally saying ""I see you at school."" However, if the person to whom you're speaking is a classmate and you are talking to them over the weekend, they will understand that you mean ""I will see you at school,"" since the two of you are not at school at the moment.

, Since you're using present tense, your listener or reader may assume that the action is taking place right now unless you tell them specifically when it will take place.To return to the previous example, if the classmate to whom you were speaking was someone with a different class schedule than yours, you might say ""Te veo mañana en la escuela,"" or ""I (will) see you tomorrow at school,"" to indicate that you will be on campus tomorrow.
You also use present tense for events that are scheduled to take place, or that are certain to take place. In those instances, the even may occur further in the future. For example, you would use present tense to say ""Me caso el 6 de mayo"" (may CAH-soh ell says day my-yoh – ""I am getting married on May 6,"" literal translation ""I marry on May 6""), even if that date is several months into the future.

"
"
Form the verb in simple future tense.,
Memorize irregular verbs in future tense.,
Use simple future tense to wonder or make assumptions.,
Make predictions about the future in simple future tense.",How to Use the Near Future Tense (Spanish)3," When you conjugate verbs in simple future tense in Spanish, all you have to do is add the correct ending onto the infinitive form of the verb. There's no need to remove the ending to get to the verb stem, as when you conjugate in other tenses.The simple future endings are -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, and -án. The accent mark indicates that you should place emphasis on the last syllable when you say the word. When you add one of these endings to a verb stem, you are saying the same thing in Spanish that you would be saying in English if you said something will happen in the future.
For example, take the Spanish infinitive escribir (ess-CREE-veer), meaning to write. You would conjugate this verb in simple future tense as yo escribiré (I will write), tú escribirás (you will write), usted/él/ella excribirá (formal you/he/she will write), nosotros escribiremos (we will write), vosotros escriberéis (you all will write – note that this pronoun is only used in Spain), and ustedes/éllos/ellas escribirán (you all/they will write).

, In some Spanish verbs, the spelling of the verb stem changes when you add the ending for simple future tense. About a dozen of these verbs are relatively common verbs that you may find yourself using frequently.Typically, you change the verb stem by adding a consonant to it. For example, when forming the simple future tense of the verb haber (pronounced AH-vair, meaning ""to have""), you add an r: yo habré (yo ah-VRAY – I will have).
In other irregular verbs, you substitute one consonant for another. For example, for the verb hacer (pronounced AH-sear, meaning ""to do or to make""), you exchange the c for an r to make the simple future tense: yo haré (yo ah-RAY – I will make).
Find a list of these irregular verbs – there are many available free online from Spanish language websites – and memorize the ones you believe you will use frequently. Return to this list when you encounter a verb you don't know.

, If you make assumptions or wonder about something in English, you typically use present tense (although you can use future tense in some circumstances), but Spanish is different.Simple future tense is most often used in Spanish to express a probability that something is happening in the present, or to speculate or guess about the present. For example, if it's close to lunch time and you're speculating that the children might be hungry, you would say ""Los niños tendrán hambre"" (lohs NEEN-yos ten-DRAHN ahm-bray, meaning ""the children might be hungry,"" or literally ""The children will have hunger""). Note that this sentence uses the verb tener (to have, to be), which is irregular in simple future tense.
If you're unsure about something taking place in the present, and are wondering aloud about it, you also use simple future tense. For example, if you're getting ready to go out but can't find your keys, you might say ""¿Dónde estarán mis llaves?"" (DOHN-day ess-tay-RAHN mees YAH-vays, meaning ""Where could my keys be?"" or literally ""Where will my keys be?"")

, The future tense in Spanish recognizes that you can't literally predict the future. If you believe something will happen in the future, but have no guarantee that it will take place, use the simple future tense.For example, if you have a well-educated and experienced friend who is currently seeking employment, you might say ""Encontrará un trabajo bueno"" (in-cohnt-rah-RAH oon trah-BAH-hoh boo-WAY-no, in English ""He will find a good job""). You have reason to believe that this will happen, but there is no guarantee.

English: I like the food.
Spanish: Me gusta la comida.


Even though ""I"" is the subject of the English sentence, it is not the subject of the Spanish sentence. This much is obvious because of the way ""gustar"" is conjugated. ""Gusta"" is the third person singular form of gustar, so ""gusta"" refers to a single thing or person—in this case, it refers to ""la comida.""

If ""gustar"" referred to the first person singular ""I,"" it would be conjugated as ""gusto.""


Instead of ""I like the food,"" a more direct translation of ""Me gusta la comida"" would be ""The food is pleasing to me.” This version of the sentence places ""the food"" in the position of subject, as it is in the Spanish version of the sentence.;
, An indirect object describes to whom or to what the action is done. In other words, the indirect object in ""gustar"" sentences refers to the person doing the liking.


In the previous sample sentence, ""Me gusta la comida,"" the indirect object is ""me."" This is the term used for the first person singular indirect object and roughly translates into ""to me.""
As such, saying ""me gusta"" would be the same as saying ""it is pleasing to me"" or ""I like it.""

, In every sentence using ""gustar,"" you will need to change the subject of the English translation to the indirect object pronoun in the Spanish version.


No matter which verb tense you use in the indicative form, the indirect object pronouns will remain the same. Those pronouns are:First person singular: Me (to me)
Second person singular: Te (to you)
Third person singular: Le (to he/she/it)
First person plural: Nos (to us)
Second person plural: Os (to you all)
Third person plural: Les (to them)



, Since gustar is almost always used to describe love for objects instead of people, you will almost always use the singular or plural third person conjugation.


For the present indicative:

Third person singular: gusta
Third person plural: gustan


Example:

""You like the book"" becomes ""Te gusta el libro.""
""You like the books"" becomes ""Te gustan los libros.""


The conjugation of ""gustar"" will always depend on the subject of the Spanish sentence, but this subject is the object of the English version of the sentence.

, Now that you know which parts of the English sentence match up to which parts of the Spanish sentence, you should be able to correctly string the parts of the Spanish sentence together.


Example: Translate ""We like the movie"" into Spanish using the ""gustar"" verb.

""We"" is the subject in the English sentence, so it will become the indirect object of the Spanish sentence. The first person plural indirect object pronoun is ""nos.""
The object in the English sentence, ""the movie,"" becomes the subject of the Spanish sentence, ""la película.""
Since the subject of the Spanish sentence (la película) is singular, ""gustar"" needs to be conjugated into its third person singular form, ""gusta.""


When you piece the entire thing together, the Spanish translation would be: Nos gusta la película.


, You can technically use ""gustar"" when discussing like for another person or people, but doing so implies physical attraction instead of platonic/friendly affection.The only time you would use either first person or either second person conjugation of ""gustar"" would be if you are referring to physical attraction toward yourself (first person) or toward the person you are speaking to (second person).

Example: ""Me gustas"" in Spanish means ""You are pleasing to me"" in English.


You may also use either the singular or plural third person form of ""gustar"" when describing physical attraction toward another person or group of people other than the person you are speaking with.

Example: ""Me gusta ella"" in Spanish means ""She is pleasing to me"" in English.



, Oftentimes, the reader or listener will not know who the indirect object pronoun refers to when you use the third person singular form. As a result, you may need to add a little more to the sentence for the sake of clarification.This is usually done by adding ""To _____"" before the indirect object pronoun. In essence, you are referring to the same indirect object twice in the same sentence. This might seem strange in English, but it's normal in Spanish.

Note that the English ""to"" translates to ""a"" in Spanish.


Example: If you wrote, ""Le gusta la cocina,"" the reader would have no way of knowing who the kitchen (la cocina) is pleasing to (le gusta). ""Le"" can refer to too many possibilities.

If Pablo likes the kitchen, you would need to precede the sentence with, ""A Pablo.""
As such, the correct sentence would be: ""A Pablo le gusta la cocina.""



, Even when the indirect object pronoun can only refer to one specific person, you may still see the ""A ___"" construction.


In these instances, you are emphasizing the way the indirect object feels.
For instance, someone saying ""A mí me gusta la silla"" would be emphasizing the fact that he or she really likes chair (la silla). Usually, this is done to draw attention to or contrast against other opinions.

, When you want to talk about something that is disliked, you will need to add “no” before the verb “gustar” just as you would with any other verb. This “no” must also come before the indirect object pronoun.


Do not place the “no” in between the indirect object pronoun and the verb.
Example:

English: I dislike the book
Spanish: No me gusta el libro.



, As it applies to ""gustar,"" the present indicative should be used to talk about something that is presently liked.


Example: ""We like you all,"" Nos gustáis.

yo: gusto
tú: gustas
él/ella/usted: gusta
nosotros/-as: gustamos
vosotros/-as: gustáis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustan

, The preterite indicative is a past tense verb form. You should conjugate ""gustar"" in the preterite indicative to describe something that was definitely liked in the past but no longer liked in the present.


Example: ""Raquel liked baseball when she was young,"" A Raquel le gusta el béisbol cuando era joven.

yo: gusté
tú: gustaste
él/ella/usted: gustó
nosotros/-as: gustamos
vosotros/-as: gustasteis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustasteis

, The imperfect indicative is another past tense verb form, but it varies slightly from the preterite tense. Use the imperfect indicative of ""gustar"" when you want to describe something that was concretely liked in the past and may still be liked in the present.


Example: ""You have liked us,"" Te gustábamos.

yo: gustaba
tú: gustabas
él/ella/usted: gustaba
nosotros/-as: gustábamos
vosotros/-as: gustabais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustaban

, The conditional indicative tense describes something that is true only if another condition is also true. As it applies to ""gustar,"" this verb tense suggests that something is definitely liked as long as another defined condition is also definitely true.


Example: ""You all would like the book if you read it,"" Os gustaría el libro si lo lee.

yo: gustaría
tú: gustarías
él/ella/usted: gustaría
nosotros/-as: gustaríamos
vosotros/-as: gustaríais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarían

, When talking about definite future events and feelings, you would use the future indicative tense. Conjugate ""gustar"" in the future indicative to describe a like that will definitely exist in the future without needing any special condition.


Example: ""They will like the news,"" Les gustará la noticia.

yo: gustaré
tú: gustarás
él/ella/usted: gustará
nosotros/-as: gustaremos
vosotros/-as: gustaréis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: gustarán

, Things that occur in the present and repeatedly often get the present tense in Spanish. For example, ""I talk on the phone in the evenings"" and ""She only eats junk food"" would be in the present tense.

, Just like in English, statements like ""A zebra has white and black stripes"" and ""San Francisco is a small city"" would be in the present tense.

, The Spanish present tense can be used to describe what someone is doing right now - for example, ""Hablan"" for ""They talk"" can be used to more or less convey that people are talking now. However, there is also the present progressive tense which can convey this more clearly. It's similar to saying ""I am talking"" in English. For these cases, you may want to use the present progressive, rather than simple present tense.

, Some Spanish sentences in the present tense can end up seeming a bit unclear; does ""Hablan"" mean they talk now, they talk every day, or they talk regularly? You can add adverbs to make this more clear and precise.

, To understand the present tense, you first need to understand conjugation. In grammar, conjugation is the variation of the form of a verb; in other words, the variety of changes that can be applied to a verb. In Spanish, you must first know which type of verb is to be conjugated. It may be any of these verbs:


-ar (verb ending)
-er (verb ending)
-ir (verb ending)
Spelling-changing verbs
Stem-changing verbs
Irregular verbs

, The second step in conjugating a verb is to determine its stem, or root. The stem of the verb holds the meaning of the verb. To find the stem, remove the infinitive ending (-ar, -er, -ir). To the end of the stem, add the appropriate ending depending on who the subject of the verb is. The ending indicates who is doing the action at what point in time. The ending will also depend on which verb group the verb belongs to (-ar, -er, -ir). Some examples of roots include:


Hablar - Habl-
Comer - Com-
Escribir - Escrib-

, Depending on the subject of your sentence, you'll add a new ending to the root to explain who is doing the action. For example, ""Hablar"" becomes ""Hablo"" for ""I speak"" and ""Hablan"" for ""they speak"".


The endings are generally as follows:

I - o (""yo"" - I)
You - as (""tú"" - you as singular familiar)
He/She - a (""usted"" - you as singular formal, or ""el/ella"" - he/she/it)
We - amos (""nosotros/as"" - we)
You (plural) - áis (""vosotros/as"" - you as plural familiar)
They - an (""ustedes"" - you as plural formal, or ""ellas/ellos"" - they)



, Spanish has several verbs whose spelling changes in order to preserve the pronunciation presented in the infinitive.


If memorizing the rules is too confusing or just too much information, remember that most spellings only change to preserve the original pronunciation of the infinitive. For example, if you hear a G sound in the infinitive, make sure the spelling reflects that same sound in all the conjugations.
Example Conjugations: Proteger - To protect

protejo
proteges
protégé
protegemos
protegéis
protegen



, In all three conjugations of verbs (-ar, -er, and -ir) there are some verbs whose vowels change within the stem. These stem-changes occur in all persons except nosotros and vosotros. These two persons maintain the regular stem. There are six varieties of stem-changes: o into ue, e into ie, e into i, i into ie, u into ue, o into hue.


Each of these is described below with examples.

quiero
quieres
quiere
queremos
queréis
quieren



, As in every language there will be verbs that do not seem to follow any of the rules. Irregular verbs are verbs that violate conjugation rules for one or more persons and do not fall into any of the stem-changing or spelling-changing categories. And unfortunately, these are usually the most useful and regularly used words in the language.


The following words are irregular only in the yo form. They are regular in all other conjugations.

caber - quepo (to fit)
caer - caigo (to fall)
dar - doy (to give)
saber - sé (to know)
traer - traigo (to bring)
ver - veo (to see)

If you know how the word sounds, find the accented syllable.,
If a word has an accent in it, the syllable containing the accent is the one that is stressed or emphasised.,
All ""flat"" words have an accent if they end in a consonant other than ""n"" or ""s"" (the letter ""y"" is considered a consonant).,
All ""high-pitched"" words have an accent if they end in a vowel, n, or s. These are words that have the accent on the last syllable: caerá, alhelí, así, camión, jamás.

,
The word ""aun"" is written with an accent only when it can be substituted for the word ""todavía"", for instance to mean ""still"".,
This word ""sólo"" (meaning ""only"") has an accent in case of ambiguity about its adverbial form, in other words when it means ""solamente"".,
Place an accent in the word ""sí"" when it means ""yes;"" omit the accent if it means ""if."",
For adverbs ending in -mente, use the accent if the word that forms the stem originally had an accent.,
Learn the accent rules for pronouns.",How to Use the Accent Correctly in Spanish," The accented syllable is the one that gets the most emphasis or that you dwell on a bit longer. For example: comida, teléfono, chocolate.;
, For example: teléfono, sólo.

, These are words that have the accented syllable second from the end: fácil, césped, mártir, álbum.

,, For example, Aún podemos hacerlo. (We can still do it.), Aún hay esperanzas. (There is still hope). On the other hand, aun has no accent if it means ""even"". For instance, Aun cuando quisiera, no podría hacerlo (Even when I want to, I couldn't do it.) Aun él tendrá que escucharme. (Even he will have to listen to me.)

, If it means ""alone,"" no accent is needed.



Sólo sé que no sé nada. (I only know that I know nothing.)

Luís vive solo. (Luís lives alone.)

,



Sí, puedo ir si mi mamá me permite. (Yes, I can go if my mom lets me.)

, For example rápidamente (quickly, rapidly) has an accent because rápida has an accent. Thus, ""rápida""+""mente"" has an accent. By contrast, posiblemente doesn't have an accent, since posible, originally, doesn't either. Hence, ""posible""+""mente"" has no accent.

, In general, use the accent if the pronoun is a subject or object. Do not use the accent if the pronoun is possessive. The words ""conmigo"" and ""contigo"" have no accents.



Me dió el libro a mí. (He gave the book to me.)

Mi libro está en el escritorio. (My book is on the desk.)

¿Dónde está tu llave? (Where is your key?)

¿Me llamaste tú? (Did you call me?)

¿Quieres ir al cine conmigo? (Would you like to go to the movies with me?)

Find existing flashcards.,
Learn language characters.,
Make a list of simple words.,
Search online for related images.,
Imagine an image for gendered words.,
Make grammar cards.,
Shuffle your cards.,
Read the cards out loud.,
Flip the cards over.,
Customize what you learn.,
Repeat practice.",How to Teach Yourself a Language Using Flashcards," Making and customizing your own is the most impactful way to learn, but you can also buy flashcards or find them online. Check retail stores or phone applications. You can use programs to make your own simple flashcards that you use the same way as you would paper ones. This is at the very least an easy way to start before you tailor your own flashcards to your needs.Sites or applications such as Quizlet or FlashcardExchange allow you to make or share flashcards.
Be wary of shared flashcards. They may be incorrect or not relevant to you.;
, Some languages have their own separate alphabets from the one that you’re used to. If you want to speak Japanese, for instance, you’ll want to start at the most basic level, which are the characters of the kana. Search online for the alphabet. Practice writing the character and then put it on one side of the flashcard. On the other side, write down the pronunciation.For even better flashcards, if you know a word that includes the character or character’s sound, write the word on the front. Highlight the letter and ask for its pronunciation.
Mnemonic devices help. This is when you attach the subject to something that helps you remember. For instance, the Japanese hiragana symbol for the sound “te” may resemble a table to you. The association with the word table helps you remember the character’s shape and sound., Search online for a list of the most common words or think of them yourself. For instance, in any language you’re most likely going to need to learn “hello” or “yes” before you learn “elephant.” Prioritize those words. Write them down on the front of note cards.

, Instead of writing the definition of the word on the back of the flashcard, try using a search engine. Type the word into an image search. Choose the image that stands out the most, keeping in mind the unique meaning of the word, and print out the image. Paste it onto the back of your flashcard for a visible reminder of the word’s meaning.In English, for example, the word bark can mean tree bark or a dog’s bark. The pictures will remind you of the context.The more memorable or personal the image, the easier the word will be to remember. Try using pictures that stand out, such as a colorful dress or your mom’s memorable dress to remember the word dress.

, Some languages use gender tags in their grammar. Highlight these in different colors on some of your cards. Come up with a significant image that will help you remember the gender assigned to the word. Once you get the hang of the language’s grammar rules, you won’t need to keep doing this.In Spanish, for example, in the word “la radio,” the article “la” means the word is feminine. You can choose an image for “la” words such as the object melting into a puddle. Picture the radio melting into a puddle when you come across this flashcard.

, Once you’ve gotten the basic words, it’s time to put them into sentences. Write a sample sentence. Substitute the verb you’re trying to learn for a blank line. You can leave the infinite form of the verb (for example, to dance) in brackets to remind yourself to conjugate dance. Include an appropriate image. On the back of the card, write out the correct answer.Your mind will work through the verb forms and use them in context, which works better than remembering a list of them from a book.
Search Google Images in the language you’re trying to learn for phrases you can use. Try searching in Google Translate for translated phrases with pictures., Separating similar cards of foreign words may sound difficult, but this is the best way to learn. Leaving similar words together or keeping them in alphabetical order creates confusion. The words sound too much alike or have similar meanings, so they’ll both come to mind later when you want to recall the word.

, When you pick up the flashcard, read the entire card. Sound out the words and do the same for the answer. Take your time doing this. By speaking and hearing the language, you’ll create an even stronger connection that will help you remember later.

, Many of your cards work in reverse. If you learned the Spanish word for dog by reading “perro” on the front, start from the other side. Using the imagine of the dog or the word dog, try to recall the Spanish word. Doing this gives you a new angle for learning, which keeps you from simply memorizing cards.

, Once you have the basics, it’s useful to tackle the areas of most interest to you. For instance, if you plan on visiting restaurants, study up on the relevant language. Make cards with food words and the phrases you’d say to a waiter.

, Your mind requires refreshing in order to keep the memory strong. Practice your recall by reshuffling your flashcards every few days. Go through them the same way as before, reading and answering the questions. Make new examples if you feel like you need to freshen your memory.Over time, the repetition helps you commit the lessons to memory. The more you remember, the less often you’ll need to review.

Consider roadblocks to adult language acquisition.,
Assess and assist learner motivation.,
Facilitate student interaction.,
Build vocabulary directly and “incidentally.” It is estimated that an adult needs to understand about 3,000 word families (think, thought, and thoughtful are in one word family, for instance) to be able to understand a foreign language from context.Traditional vocabulary-building methods, like memorization, drills, and tables, can still be utilized in the classroom with success.,
Be flexible.,
Compare classic and modern approaches.,
See the pros and possible cons of newer views.,
Don’t ignore traditional methods.,
Find the right balance.,
Let the adults be kids.,
Help students help one another.,
Offer goals and rewards.,
Don't skip the work.",How to Teach Adults a Foreign Language," It is well-established that young children are, on average, more adept at acquiring second (and beyond) languages than older teens and adults. The reasons for this, however, are not as clear.


Small children tend to excel at picking up spoken languages through simple exposure to them, and some theorize that this skill is lost around the ages of 12-14 as the brain reallocates its precious resources to other, more important areas. Essentially, you are likely to have learned to communicate by then, and thus no longer need to expend substantial brain power toward that ability.Whether or not changes in the brain make language acquisition more challenging for adults, it is certain that adults tend to be busier, more stressed, and less singularly focused on picking up the language. Adults have also picked up a lifetime of assumptions, conventions, perspectives, biases, and habits, all experienced via the native language, that can make developing “communicative competence” in a second language (with its own cultural “baggage”) a more arduous task.;
, With any desired skill, talent, or ability, having a clear goal in mind makes the process of acquiring said competency more manageable. The same holds true for language acquisition.As a teacher, it may benefit your adult students if you help them define a clear, and ideally short-term, goal for why they want to learn a particular foreign language. Instead of promoting language-learning as beneficial in and of itself (even if it is), help them focus on their desire to connect more deeply with a grandparent or be prepared for a long-awaited trip abroad.
As you help students find their motivation, feed it through targeted tasks. For instance, offer a project that involves interviewing the grandparent in his/her native (and the student’s second) language. Be aware, however, that motivation will vary in intensity class-to-class, so be prepared to take advantage of high points and offer encouragement during lower ones.

, While you have an essential role as the teacher, the students in the class can also be critical to each other’s ability to learn a new language. Learner-to-learner interaction tends to help both parties “notice the gap” between their communication in the language and the proper form.Offering learner-to-learner tasks, such as having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another, who must draw it, can not only be fun but helpful in enabling students to work through gaps in their comprehension.
While such tasks need not replace more traditional methods of teaching vocabulary and grammar, this more indirect method of teaching the “nuts and bolts” of a new language does seem to be at least as effective at instilling them in the long run.

, However, simply encouraging students to read level-appropriate and interesting passages, both in class and at home, can be an effective strategy.
This is especially true when the readings are combined with vocabulary-building activities. Games like Bingo, Password, and Concentration can facilitate “active meaning negotiation,” where task-oriented problem solving helps build an “incidental vocabulary” — almost, in essence, picking up new words without realizing it.

, There are as many ideal ways to learn a new language as there are people wanting to do it. Some even say that foreign languages cannot be taught, but only learned, implying that each learner’s unique motivations and skills must be prioritized.Each time you teach a new student or new class, then, your methods will likely need to adjust in order to have the most impact. Be flexible and willing to work with your adult learners, while drawing from a range of theories, strategies, and practical advice.

, Whether you learned a second language by drills, flashcards, and rote repetition, or by visiting a foreign country for the summer, there is likely a language theory that matches your method. Familiarity with the bases of such approaches will help you formulate your teaching strategy for adults.From the time of ancient Greece to well into the last century, new languages were almost invariably taught by what is often called the “audio-lingual method.” If your high school French class involved a lot of rote learning, repetition, oral and written testing, emphases on grammar and translation, and constant correction by your teacher, you’re already familiar with this method.
In the last half-century or so, a more (so-called) “natural approach” has become predominant. It tries to replicate the childhood process of acquiring a language through immersion, play and tasks, constant usage in a low-pressure environment, and indirect emphases on grammar and vocabulary.

, Modern “natural” or “immersion” methods encourage leaners to jump right in to the foreign language without the drudgery of vocabulary lists, grammar lessons, and constant repetition. Therefore, they are often a more appealing prospect to harried, hurried adult learners.Such task-based methods are based on the premise that students will naturally “work out” vocabulary and grammar as they interact with the language (and the other students). The struggle to do so, essentially, is part of the learning process.
Critics, however, say that this leaves too much vital material for the student to address on his or her own, and that the teacher’s guiding hand in areas like grammar is vital, even if it can sometimes be less than enthralling., Despite the reputation they’ve assumed as “boring,” “sterile,” and “outdated,” there is a reason why classic approaches were used almost exclusively for thousands of years. Even in the modern world, they can still have a place in the language classroom.


The “audio-lingual” emphasis on habit formation, mimicry, memorization, and repetition can provide a clearer sense of the goals, processes, and achievements for some students. Likewise, a focus on grammar and translation, guided in the first language, can build essential skills that some adult learners may be keen to acquire.That said, for many adults, traditional methods will feel too much like being back in school as children, and can dissuade them from continuing the process with enthusiasm. This is why variety and flexibility in your teaching methods are essential., For all the value in understanding theories, learning happens in practice — and usually, through practice. Simply put, teaching an adult a foreign language requires not only your mastery of the language as a teacher, but also a clear understanding of your student’s background, motivation, goals, learning style, and needs.


Holding fast to traditional methods simply because they have been in use for centuries is usually not the answer, nor is tossing all the old ways aside for the new vogue in language education. It is up to you, the teacher, to determine the mix that will work best for your classroom and your student(s)., Learning a new language can be a stressful experience for many adults, and can make them feel like children struggling to pick up something new. Build on the positives of this perspective by enabling your students to have some fun with it.


Most adults like to reminisce about their own childhood, or that of their growing / grown children. Let them pick a favorite kids' book from one of those times that is available in the foreign language, and read it together in class. It will seem familiar but new, and fun but challenging.Listen to songs, even sing songs together in class. Use familiar nursery rhymes and lullabyes in the foreign language, along with songs distinct to that language / culture.

, Most adults will be sympathetic to the experiences of the other students in the class, and want to help each other succeed. And, according to the notions of task-based learning discussed in this article, having students learn from each other's successes and mistakes is vital to adult language development.One good paired activity is the aforementioned ""information gap"" game of having one student describe a picture in the foreign language to another, who must draw it. A similar option is having students do a variation of the old ""pass a secret down the line"" game, except having them alternate the language in which the sentence is whispered -- (essentially translating back and forth down the line).
Even simply encouraging your students to listen to each other carefully as they attempt to solve problems and answer questions can be quite useful. Hearing others struggle and succeed provides both consolation and challenge.Each student will also naturally ""notice the gap"" between the response given, how they would have responded, and/or the correct response, thereby helping to build confidence and competence., Unlike many child students, adult learners usually have a specific goal in mind for wanting to learn a foreign language. Crafting activities that support this goal, and offering related goals and rewards along the way can fuel motivation and a sense of achievement.If your adult student hopes to land in a foreign country and be able to ""jump right in,"" consider having them watch episodes of a program in that language (without subtitles!), and attempt to summarize what they can from full-speed conversations in the foreign tongue.Set up a pretend restaurant, for instance, in the classroom. Offer simple prizes for the student(s) who do best in ordering lunch. Adults like to be rewarded for small achievements just as much as children.

, No, the adult classroom, just like the child one, cannot be all fun and games. Most adults will want it to be a fun experience, but in the end, learning the language is the goal.


Some of the traditional methods that have at least partly fallen out of favor may be of more value to adult learners, especially those who are self-motivated to learn the language. They will be more willing to copy down verb tables and go through flash-card drills.Speaking of copying down information, encouraging your students to write down information longhand may be beneficial. (It will also probably be easier to convince adults to do this than their tech-savvy kids.) Research indicates that handwriting information aids memorization more than typing, as it requires more active participation in the process."

Be able to act.,
Use body language.,
Begin teaching with modifiers and quantifiers.,
Make lessons interesting.,
Use media in classroom.,
Audio visual aids lessen the burden.,
Regroup the learners.,
Use the language of the learner.,
Practice makes a man perfect.,
Avoid descriptive grammar.,
Build confidence in the learner.",How to Teach English As a Foreign Language," Teaching is not only a profession but also an art. A good teacher is he who performs well. It has become a form of acting. A good teacher should be a good actor, especially when it is a matter of teaching a language. This task has become challenging as well as rewarding. Here are some practical suggestions for the teachers of languages.;
, A good teacher is a good actor as told earlier. He should act according to the meanings of the word. He should wipe out sweat and fan with his hands if he is telling about hot weather. In the same fashion he should do his best to illustrate the meanings with the gestures of his body and facial expressions. It becomes extremely helpful while teaching second language.

, The best way for the beginner is to familiarize him with nouns pronouns and adjectives. Avoid using verbal hints in the very beginning. Modifiers and quantifiers are the best cues for this purpose. Performance on the modifiers is easy and leads to the easy understanding of verbs later.

, There are many ways to make lesson interesting. Some kind of joke anecdote or recitation of poetry rise interest in the learner.

, Use of media in classrooms has proved very useful. It enables a teacher to use few words.

, Example is better than precept. Always keep this proverb in mind and openly use audio visual aids. A lot of words fail in making learner to understand an idea while a little picture make it easy to comprehend. These can be more helpful in teaching vocabulary, prepositions and verbs.

, After some preliminary teaching a teacher comes to know the abilities of his students. He should divide the students in groups according to their mental approach and learning capability. This grouping help the learners as well the teacher. The group should be made to practice together the lessons taught to them. Individual practice is always helpful in learning and grouping is the best way for this kind of drill.

, If a teacher is well conversant in the language of the learner he should use it as the base of his material. The bilingual method that can also be called as translation method becomes very beneficent for the learner. It saves a lot of burden of the teacher too.

, Practice of anything makes one perfect in his art. Language is a thing that is quite a complex thing. It needs severe repetitions. Not only learners but also teacher should repeat his lesson at least two times in the class. Every sentence he speaks should speak two times with intervals or continuously. This repetition will make the learner expert and would produce in him the language skills.

, Descriptive grammar should be avoided in teaching language. It deviate the learner from his real objectives. It may be used in disguise. The teacher should not stress on the rules but the function of the words. Too much corrective attitude of the teacher may annoy the learner and he may become disappointed.

, Second language learners are conscious of their weakness of not knowing the language. Sometimes they may become emotional or irritated. It is the duty of the teacher to provide him safer atmosphere for language learning. He should take the learner into confidence by telling him that every second language learner does not know the language. The mistakes are not to disappoint but to correct his language ad are made by all.

Understand the differences in Scottish dialects.,
Set your oral posture.,
Pronounce like words the same, join syllables in words, and drop ""g"" endings.,
Replace ""o’s"" with ""ae"" sounds.",How to Talk With a Scottish Accent1," Just like American, Canadian, and English accents, Scottish accents vary widely based on region. If you are wanting to speak with a Scottish accent, chances are you are thinking of the kind of Scottish accent you hear in movies and on television. These accents are typically from the Lowlands and Midlands.


A ""generic"" Scottish accent is hard to define because there are so many types. But, you can learn to speak with a general accent that non-Scottish people would be able to identify as Scottish.
Most of the Scottish accents that you may hear come from the Lowland and Midland areas. These are the regions where the more populated cities such as Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Galloway reside. However, even the accents of these more populous regions will differ. Galloway, which is south-west, sounds slightly closer to Irish as it’s close to Northern Ireland. Additionally, there is a difference in the accents from Glasgow and Edinburgh, not unlike how a New York and Boston accent differ from one another.;
, Oral posture, or vocal tract posture, is the way you position your jaw, lips, tongue, teeth, and even vocal chords to speak a certain way. There are some basic techniques you can employ with the positioning of your articulators (lips, teeth, tongue, hard and soft palate, etc.) to speak with a Scottish Accent.


Set the tip of your tongue far back in your mouth. When you speak, pull your tongue back toward your throat. Doing this will help you get the harsher, guttural sounds associated with Scottish accents.
When speaking, you still want to keep a lot of movement or action in your lips and jaw. Keep your lips out and open your mouth as if to get your lips around each sound and word. Because you are pulling your tongue back, you may be tempted to close or tighten your lips. To counteract this, focus on keeping your jaw loose and unclenched.

, Unlike in American English where ""pull"" has a slightly different pronunciation than ""pool"", in a Scottish accent, both words sound like ""pool"".


When trying a Scottish accent, think of ""u"" sounds as ""oo"" sounds.
If there are two short words together, pronounce the two as one. ""Did not"" often becomes ""didnae"" or ""dinnae."" However, avoid speaking too fast.
Drop the 'g' sound from words ending in a 'g.' For example, say ""evenin’"" instead of ""evening."" ""Sewing"" becomes ""sewin’"".

, The ""ae"" sound, officially known as the Near-Open Front Unrounded Vowel, is an ""ah"" sound with more emphasis on the ""a"" and less on the ""h"". You hear this sound when you pronounce words like ""have"" and ""that"" in American Standard English. Try making the ""ah"" sound in words like ""Not"" to become ""nae."" Words that end in ""oo"" sounds get more of the ""ae"" pronunciation as well.


""To"" is pronounced as ""tae"". ""Do"" becomes ""dae"". Additionally, ""no"" gets a bit of an ""aw"" sound at the end making it sound like ""naw"" or ""nae"".
Another example of changing how you pronounce words is in the sentence ""I am going to the shops over there."" In a Scottish accent, it would be pronounced as ""Am gan tae the shoaps oor air.""

"
"
Play with the glottal stop.,
Learn to roll your ""r's"".,
Follow Aitken’s law.",How to Talk With a Scottish Accent2," The glottal stop is made when you close off airflow in your throat during a word to pronounce your ""t’s"". Think of it like an absence of sound. For example, if you were to say ""glottal stop"" with a Scottish accent, you would say ""glo’al stop"".
The glottal stop is not used for every ""t"" sound in a Scottish accent. If you have a ""t"" at the beginning of a word you would still pronounce the ""t"". For example, ""that"" would sound like ""tha"". And at the end of the word, you would constrict your throat to stop the airflow.

, Roll your ""r's"" only once. Do this especially after a ""d"", ""t"" or a ""g"".


Words like ""draw"", ""trip"", and ""grand"" all get a rolling ""r"" sound.
Words like ""where"" can get a bit of an ""r"" roll, but here you want to touch the tip of your tongue to the roof of your mouth after the ""r"" sound. This action forms a sort of ""de"" sound. So ""where"" becomes more like ""wherde"". This is also called tapping your ""r’s"".

, Aitken’s law is the vowel length rule that characterizes how different Scottish vowels are formed. Before learning each specific vowel pronunciation, you can generalize vowel pronunciation to help you get a feel for speaking in a Scottish accent. Generally, vowels which are followed by consonants are short.
Short vowels appear in words like ""bead"" which is pronounced ""bid"". In a Scottish accent, the word ""mood"" rhymes with ""good"" as you don’t elongate the ""oo"" in ""mood"".
Long vowels occur when a word ends on another vowel. For example, you would pronounce a word like ""key"" as ""kee"". The same applies for a word like ""done"". Here it would sound more like the word ""dome"" but with an ""n"".
The vowels are key in a true Scottish accent. As a general rule, vowels are less hard sounding in a Scottish accent. Vowels may be short or long, but you pronounce the vowel with more of an open mouth. Remember to keep your jaw loose and not clenched.
An exception to Aitken's law is the last name ""Livingstone."" You do not pronounce the ""o"" in it a long vowel sound, although this word did end on a vowel. Rather, you pronounce the ""o"" as the ""o"" in the word ""ton.""

"
"
Learn slang.,
Shorten and change certain words.,
Listen to people speaking the accent.",How to Talk With a Scottish Accent3," If you wish to pass for a Scot, you must learn to speak like one. Familiarize yourself with the slang of the Scots. Part of using slang is following the vowel and consonant rules. Certain words are also just pronounced differently. ""Yes"" often becomes ""yae"".


Instead of saying ""go away"" you can say ""oan yer bike pal."" Note, a bike doesn’t have to be present. But this is a colloquial term you may here in the Midland or Lowland areas.
While you might say ""I don’t know"" or even ""I dunno"" in your normal speaking voice, it sounds quite different in a Scottish accent. To say ""I don’t know"" in a Scottish accent, you might say, ""I dinnae ken."" or simply, ""I dinnae"". The word ""ken"" is typically only spoken in Midland dialects.
""Instead of ""hello"" you can greet someone with ""awright ya?""
Oftentimes, instead of saying ""yes"" or asking ""yeah?"" you would simply say ""eh?""

, It’s hard to get every colloquialism down, but a lot of Scottish terms are simply changing American, Canadian, and English words by employing vowel and consonant rules. For example, instead of saying ""everybody"" you could say ""aab’dy"". Here you are condensing the word from five syllables down into roughly two. ""I am not"" becomes ""am no'"". Here, ""am"" serves the same purpose as ""I’m"".

, The best way to develop a Scottish accent is by listening to it. Get to know any Scots you may know a little better, watch Scottish movies or even go to visit Scotland.


Television shows like Doctor Who often have Scottish actors who speak in his or her natural accent. Karen Gillan, David Tennant, and Peter Capaldi are all Scottish. Listen to how these actors speak compared to the English actors on the show.
James McAvoy and Gerard Butler are two other Scottish actors to listen to. Watching interviews of these actors is a good way to listen to the accent.
Both the film and the book ""Trainspotting"" are also great ways to get acclimated to the Scottish accent. The book is written phonetically so when you read it aloud you are forced to speak with an accent.
Both 'Dead Man's Chest' and 'At World's End' from the Pirates Of The Caribbean series feature Bill Nighy as Davy Jones, where he speaks with a heavy Scottish brogue.

Stretch out vowels and lengthen them.,
Speak in a ""singsong"" manner.,
Change ""i"" sounds.,
Slur certain letters.,
Drop ""y"" sounds.,
Roll the ""r"" sound.,
Use common Welsh phrases.,
Change and repeat some words.",How to Speak with a Welsh Accent," For example, in the sentence ""Jane, how's it going?"" you would say ""Ja-ane, how's it go-o-en?""


Do not stretch it out for more than about half a second, but this is a crucial aspect of performing a convincing Welsh accent.;
, The Welsh accent is very notable for its singsong nature. Every few words, exaggerate and draw out the vowels significantly in order to replicate this. Even when exaggerating the words, don't draw out vowels for too long (about one second is too long).

, When pronouncing the ""i"" sound in words such as doing, going, pit and lit, the ""i-"" sound becomes reminiscent of an e, as shown in step one, where ""going"" is pronounced ""go-o-en"", in the sense that the ""o"" is stretched out and the ""ing"" suffix is said ""en"". Or ""Can I have a bit of that?"" it becomes ""Can I 'ave a bet ov that please?""

, Some letters are slurred; for example, ""h"" and ""f"" are often skipped or slurred where ""have"" becomes ""ave"" and ""of"" becomes ""ov"". This is not for all letters though so do this with only ""h"", ""f"" and other ""soft"" letters. Do not do this with vowels.

, ""Y"" sounds are also frequently dropped. So instead of saying ""Tell Jake the news"" you say ""Tell Jake the ooz"". Do this for both ""y"" sounds (yods) and the actual letter, even in the word use. ""Can I use that?"" vs. ""Can I ooz that?"".

, ""R"" sounds have a very slight roll to them, but it's very easy to roll the r too much, so ""It's brrright"" (triple r where you'd roll it) would be too much, as you only roll it for a split second, as in ""brright"" but still enough that you do not pronounce it ""bright"". Very similar to rolling the r once.

, These are anything from ""cwtch"" (pronounced cutch) which means hug ""Gimme a cwtch"" or the other phrases like ""Now in a minute"". A lot of Welsh people say this and it means ""I will do it, just not now, so leave me alone""., Similarly to German, sometimes Welsh people, rather than saying ""I am very tired"" say ""I'm very tired, I am"" or ""I'm thirsty, I am"". This is the same with ""I do"", for example instead of ""I do like that"", many Welsh people say ""I like that, I do"".

Master greetings.,
Learn tourist phrases.,
Learn how to be polite.",How to Speak Thai1," In order to speak Thai, it is important to start with the basics. Easy phrases such as ""hello"" and ""goodbye"" can be used to make any interaction more pleasant, no matter who you are talking to. Knowing these phrases will also assist you in understanding what you hear others say.


""Hello"" in Thai is สวัสดี (sà-wàt-dee)""Goodbye"" in Thai is บ๊ายบาย (báai baai) or ลาก่อนนะ (laa gòn ná)
""How are you?"" in Thai is สบายดีไหม (sà-baai dee măi)
""Have a nice day"" in Thai is มีวันที่ดี! (Mī wạn thī̀ dī);
, If you ever go to Thailand, it will be important for you to know how to get around on your own. It is beneficial not only to know how to say these phrases, but to recognize when they are being said to you.


""Where is the bathroom?"" in Thai is ห้องน้ำอยู่ไหน (hông náam yòo năi) ""How do you say _____ in Thai"" is ภาษาไทย ... พูดว่าอย่างไร (paasăa tai ... pôot wâa yàang-rai)
""Is there a restaurant near here?"" in Thai is ร้านอาหารที่ใกล้ที่สุดอยู่ไหน? (ráan aa-hăan têe glâi sùt yòo năi?)

, Expressing gratitude is important in any culture. An ungrateful guest is an unpleasant experience for anyone. Learn some expressions of gratitude in order to ensure a positive experience in Thailand.


""Thank you"" in Thai is ขอบคุณ (kòp kun)
""Please"" in Thai is ขอ ... (Kor ...)

Learn the Thai alphabet.,
Study tones in Thai words.,
Find a native speaker.,
Study Thai each day.,
Meet with a native speaker frequently.,
Look up words in a dictionary.,
Watch, listen to, and write in Thai.,
Visit Thailand.",How to Speak Thai2," In order to start learning a language, knowing the alphabet is the first building block. Find a Thai language learning book in order to learn the alphabet, or go online and look at any website with the Thai alphabet listed.


For example, at the website called Omniglot, you can find an alphabet and written pronunciations for English speakers.Find an app with phrases and their pronunciations, or look for a website you can visit frequently to help you get the pronunciations right.
One app that may help is called “In 24 Hours Learn to Speak Thai.”Go online and look at your local library website to see if they have lessons on Thai that you can check out. These may be books, manuals, DVDs, or CD-ROM programs that you can watch or play on your computer.
You can also buy Thai learning programs offline from websites like Amazon and Ebay.

, Thai is a tonal language, so learning the alphabet does no good until you have learned to pronounce each word carefully. Make sure that any learning programs you get have a verbal feature so that you can hear the words.


One website that might help is thai-language.com.It shows you both the Thai script and English letter versions of Thai words, as well as what they should sound like.

, Whether you are inside Thailand or not, you can learn to speak Thai by exposing yourself to those who speak this language. This is called immersion. Find a native Thai speaker either by making friend with locals if you are located in Thailand, or finding a Thai community in your city. Make friends with a Thai speaker and integrate them into your life so that you are forced to speak Thai on a regular basis.


The reason you need to practice speaking in a language to learn it, which is what immersion does, is because your brain will process language more like a native speaker.If you aren’t living in Thailand, it will be more difficult to be “immersed,” but finding a native speaker to converse with on a regular basis will help more than silently studying the language.
If you don’t know anyone from Thailand in your city, visit places where you may meet a Thai person, such as at a college, a market, a local restaurant, a church, or classes at a community center.
You can also try to find Thai speakers you can video chat with online. You may find Thai speakers in Facebook groups, or ask people you know on social media if they have any Thai friends who might be willing to Skype with you.

, Although to become a Thai speaker you do need to speak it, studying the basics of the language will help you understand what you are saying, which can help you remember how to speak Thai. This may help you learn to speak Thai faster.


Look at the grammar structure. Ask yourself, where do adjectives and verbs occur in a sentence? For example, in Spanish, the adjective usually comes after the noun, whereas in English, the adjective usually comes before.
In Thai, the verb structure is simpler than European languages, but its tones and sounds are extremely important. How you say a word can change the meaning., While you are studying Thai, you should be speaking it on a regular basis. While it’s important to understand the verb structure, it is more important to learn conversational basics in order to speak Thai. The complete grasp of grammar will come as you speak it.


Make daily, bi-weekly, or weekly appointments with your Thai friend so that you don’t get behind in practice.

, As you learn Thai, look up words that you don’t know. When you hear a person speaking Thai using words you have never heard before, either write them down or remember them so that you can look them up.


Since simple sentences in Thai can be easier than the same sentences in English and Romance languages, start with simple greetings like “hello” (sa-wat-dee) and “how are you” (sa-baai dee mai).Focus on getting your pronunciations of new words correct. Ask your friends who speak Thai to help you.

, In order to help you get the pronunciations right, listen to music in Thai or watch Thai speakers on TV and in internet videos. Hearing others speaking this language every day is important for you to speak Thai, and if you aren’t in a community of Thai speakers all day long, substitute this with TV, internet videos, and music.


If you write in Thai, this may also help you understand the language so that you can speak it with more accuracy.

, Whether not you are an expert Thai speaker, taking a trip to Thailand is an important part of learning to speak Thai. In Thailand, you will be inundated with the Thai language. You will see it on every billboard and poster, on every storefront and newspaper, and Thai is all you will likely hear.


Costs once you are inside Thailand are pretty reasonable. There are 35 Thai baht to 1 US dollar, and a high-end hotel costs 3,000B per night (or about $85 USD).A plane ticket to Bangkok, Thailand, from Los Angeles in the U.S., for example, is about $900 round trip in August. The same ticket from London is about 585GBP ($860 USD). Try to stay with a Thai family so that you can be exposed to Thai all day. See if Thailand has programs like Airbnband Couchsurfingto get space in a Thai home.

Find a class that teaches Thai.,
Learn about Thai’s tonal nature.,
Figure out linguistic signals.,
Practice speaking with classmates and the teacher.,
Take verbal tests.",How to Speak Thai3," Although not all colleges and community centers offer classes in the Thai language, you can find them online if nothing else. Finding a class to attend whether in person or online gives you an instructor to whom you may ask questions, gives you classmates to practice with, and it gives you tests to motivate you to remember what you learn.


For example, the University of Washington in Seattle has a Department of Asian Languages and Literature that offers courses in Thai.There are online schools like Thai Style USA that offer you an online learning environment to master the Thai language., Since you are in a class setting, you are most likely able to practice speaking Thai. It is important to practice speaking Thai so that you can master the different pronunciations of the Thai language. Since Thai is tonal, every syllable has a lot of meanings., It is helpful when learning a new language to focus on a few linguistic signals that indicate different elements of language. For example, learning how Thai speakers express formality, when they are indicating a plural, and which letters denote gender can help you quickly pick up on what others are saying.


For instance, Thai speakers make their statements formal by adding a particle to the end of each sentence. If a male is speaking, he adds a “krahp” to the end of a sentence to sound formal, and a female speaker adds “kha” to the end of a sentence., Practicing what you learn is truly the only way to speak Thai, especially since Thai is a language based in the tones of the words. If you don’t speak what you see on the page, you will never get the pronunciations right. Practice conversations with your classmates and teacher.


If you are in a live class, play games in Thai to practice.

, Test are a part of any class, including language classes. To help you get the tones correct, make sure that your teacher gives verbal tests. You need to have your tones tested so you can make sure you are getting them right. Remember, a word pronounced slightly different can have an entirely different meaning in Thai.

Be Confident.",How to Study a Foreign Language in School," You don’t have to write down everything that your teacher says, instead, bullet down the important things. Omit words such as ""but, if, then, and, or"" if you can. Use slashes , dashes , ampersands , and colons . This will make your notes much shorter, so that you will have more time to both listen to your teacher and copy down more notes to later revise.;
, For the purposes of this article, it’s assumed that your native language is English and the article will refer to it that way; if English is not your native language, please adjust the steps accordingly. Never take your notes in the language you are being taught. This just leads to words being misspelled, cut out, and mistaken.


When you are taking notes, if you want to write a word in the language you are being taught, put it in quotations so that you know the word is not in English, and you can clearly tell that.
Writing in English makes your note taking both faster and much more accurate.

, For example, if your teacher is explaining a verb, and you don't know the conjugations, or if he/she writes a word on the board and defines it for you, write it down. It has being given to you because you need it, so take note. Even if it turns out that it's not needed at that moment, now you have it, and you'd rather be safe than sorry.

, When your teacher puts something on the board, it goes into your notebook, or if she hands you something, paste it in or file it for revision. Obviously, use your judgement on this. But for the most part, any conjugations, and definitions, any synonyms, any pronouns, any vocabulary lists, should all go into your notebook for later.

, It takes twenty seconds to copy it into your notebook, and now you know exactly what's on your test. If your teacher only writes words or questions that will be on the exam, translate or answer them when you get home. It's an effective way of studying and preparing for an upcoming examination and will help you hone your reading and writing skill.

, If for some reason you couldn’t write down something or don’t understand the task at hand, make use of those around you. If they too seem lost, do not be afraid to raise your hand and ask the teacher. Oftentimes, they will immediately stop and explain whatever it was that you are confused about. Teachers like to see that students are paying attention and are actively interested in learning by requesting clarification.

, Doodling, scribbling, tearing out scraps, or writing notes to your friends is not the right way to use paper. If you are a person who must doodle, keep it nondescript and in the margins. Never overlap your words, because even if you can read what you've written at that moment, it’s guaranteed that that you'll have no idea what you wrote two weeks later, when it's time for the test.

, Don't get distracted halfway through your list of words and give up on studying. Put your phone down, close your computer, turn off the television, and shut your door. Look down at your vocabulary and really study for just ten minutes or more. It’s pivotal that you study hard these tasks so that you will be able to put in your best effort come time for the test.

, You won't know everything right away, and you'll only discourage yourself if you believe that you do. Instead, read slowly through your list of words and put check marks next to everything you know. Don't check off words you think you know, or things you only remember sometimes. Only check off the things you are absolutely sure you know. And it's okay if you don't know any of it, these words are new to you; that's why you're studying them!


After putting in the check marks, quiz yourself, but only on the words with the check marks. Aim to run through them quickly and make sure you have noted what each word with a check mark means. Then you can put those aside and focus on the other words.

, It's actually surprising how much this helps. For example, if you are taking Spanish, choose a verb that you are trying to learn and say, very firmly, the word, the definition, and its conjugations. By speaking clearly and firmly, you are helping to ingrain the words in your head and ensuring that you won't just skim over them, which everyone is guilty of doing.


Once done flip the paper over, take out a fresh piece of paper, and write down everything you remember. Whether it be a single word, a word with a translation, a conjugation, a verb, or an adjective, just neatly write down everything you can recall from the lesson. It's amazing how much you'll actually soak up.

, For the words that you’re not sure of, keep working at them. Repeat them out loud until they're firmly in your head. Yell your verbs out the window if you have to. Program them into your iPhone (if you have one) and have Siri repeat them to you. Recite your conjugations over and over like a robot. This will ensure that it’s firmly planted in your brain for you to recite in class or for your next test.

, Write things in the tiniest handwriting that you can read. This makes it so you have to concentrate to read your words. This ensures that your brain has to focus when studying and won’t just glide over the words.

, Talk to your parents, grandparents, uncles, aunts, cousins, siblings, or friends. They'll all be willing to help. It will only take up to ten minutes and you’ll have to ensure that you understand your vocabulary. By having loved ones quiz you, you’ll be able to teach them – and the best way to learn is to teach!

, Have the person who is quizzing you say a word out loud (either in English or in the language you're studying) and reply in the opposite language. For instance, if the person says in Spanish, ""Vivir!"" reply, confidently, ""To live!” go through your entire list, then switch so that you're answering in the opposite language. You’ll impress yourself on how much you actually know!

, Lecture a younger sibling, cousin or just someone in your family who doesn't know the language you're learning. By slowly explaining words and meanings to someone else, you're improving your understanding and practicing knowing things off the top of your head.

, If you have to look something up that you’re not sure of, do it right away; don't wait until the end of your study session. It’s best to get a good understanding of thing’s you’re not sure of so that when the time comes to know the information, you’ll be able to withdraw it without a fuss.

, If you, for instance, use a box when learning conjugations, draw it on the test! Nothing's stopping you, and it will help trigger your memories. Not only will it help with the accuracy of your work, but it will also prove to the teacher that you have been putting effort into studying.

, If you get something on a question right, it's likely that you'll get partial credit. Most teachers are pretty sympathetic, especially in grades ten and lower. If you're a junior or older, you're probably taking an AP Language class, and then you have to pull it together. It’s important to write more than needed because it will show your comprehensive understanding of what is being taught.


If you write the same thing as somebody else in the class but put extra effort and vitality in what you’re writing, it’s likely you will get a higher grade.

, The answer that your brain seems to pull out of thin air is usually right, so trust your insight. By trusting your first instinct you’re avoiding the temptation to go through everything you have learnt to try to find the most rational or likely answer when all along the answer was the first thing that surfaced.

, If you know what three out of four words mean, and you're matching them to their translations, then you clearly know what the fourth one is. Use elimination to navigate towards a most predictable answer, this way even if you don’t know the answer, you’re using strategy to choose one that could get you extra marks.

, If you're confused about the meaning of a word, you might be able to find or deduce the answer from another question hidden in the examination. This will help you define the word and then appropriate it’s use in the question that you appeared to have been struggling with.

, Try to picture your study papers, take a breath, exhale slowly and calmly, and remember what it is that you wrote or spoke out loud. By keeping your cool during the test, you’ll be able to save yourself from slight mistakes or discrepancies that could let you down when your grade is produced. Have confidence in yourself and in your abilities. Your study effort will likely shine in your test and even if you flunk, you’ll always be able to sharpen your skill in speaking the language in other opportunities.

However, there are several good sources online and a few books that can get you started.



Hiwwe wie Driwwe (in Pennsylvania Dutch, “Over here as over there”) is a newspaper published in Pennsylvania Dutch. They have an extensive set of online lessons and a YouTube channel.A good phonetic guide is available online at Omniglot, an online language encyclopedia.The Pennsylvania Dutch Dialect Project has an online grammar and pronunciation guide.;
, There aren’t many books devoted to Pennsylvania Dutch, but there are a few that are highly recommended by language scholars.


J. William Frey’s book A Simple Grammar of Pennsylvania Dutch is considered the standard textbook. J. William Frey was a professor of Pennsylvania German culture and language at Franklin and Marshall College in Pennsylvania, which maintains an archive of his work.Elizabeth Wengerd’s book Introduction to Pennsylvania German is published by Millersville University, one of the few universities in the country to have resources for Amish studies.Steve Troyer’s book The Amish Language for the English includes pronunciation rules, vocabulary, and common phrases. Troyer based his book on learning from his Amish parents. His website also includes a “word of the month.”Lillian Stoltzfus’s book Speaking Amish: A Beginner’s Introduction to Pennsylvania German for Ages 10 to 100 includes lessons on vocabulary, grammar, and phonetics, and includes an audio CD. Stoltzfus was born into an Amish family and grew up speaking the dialect.
If you are already familiar with modern German, you will probably understand a great deal of the Pennsylvania Dutch written language because it shares about 85% of its vocabulary and grammar with German. The pronunciation, however, is quite different.

, Pennsylvania Dutch sentence structure is very similar to modern German, which also shares many similarities with English. It’s common to form sentences with a basic subject-verb-direct object structure, but because of the way words are conjugated, Amish speakers will probably be able to understand you even if you mess up.

, Keeping a set of a few flash cards with vocabulary on hand allows you to learn Pennsylvania Dutch no matter where you are: on the bus, waiting in line at the supermarket, or on your way to Amish country.


Unlike English, Pennsylvania Dutch uses multiple genders for nouns and changes verbs and adjectives according to number and person. In addition to the Pennsylvania Dutch resources listed above, a good German textbook can help you understand these rules.

, You probably won’t be able to dive headfirst into a new language and begin speaking in complete sentences. Learning basic words for everyday objects and concepts is a good way to start. Once you have a solid vocabulary of nouns and verbs, you can begin to build sentences with them.


Since your primary interactions with Amish speakers may be in shops or restaurants, try starting out with some vocabulary related to those locations, such as: es Esse (the meal), der Kuche (the cookie), Gleeder (clothing), and es Hausrot (the furniture). You'll also need es Geld (the money) to pay for it all.Some common verbs include brauche (need), kaaf (buy), denke (think), and wuhne (live). To say ""I need,"" you would say ""Ich brauch.""
If you visit an Amish bakery, you may want to ask for Faasnachtkuche (potato doughnuts) or Melassich Riwwelkuche (shoo-fly pie, a pie made with molasses). If you fancy an alcoholic drink, you could ask for die Kefferbrieh (literally, ""beetle brew"" -- but it doesn't actually contain beetles).If you eat at an Amish restaurant, you may see Lattwaerig offered with es Brot: Lattwaerig is apple butter made from pureed apples, and is delicious spread on brot (bread). The Amish are famous for their bread, especially a type called ""Amish Friendship Bread."" Other menu items might include Grumbiere (""ground-bulbs,"" aka potatoes), Aerbse (peas), and Temaets (tomatoes).

, You don't have to know a lot of grammar to learn how to start asking questions. As with English, the common word order in Pennsylvania Dutch is Subject -- Verb -- Direct Object (or other things). To ask a question, you just reverse the word order: Verb -- Subject -- Direct Object (or other things)?


For example, Ich kaaf en Esse means ""I buy a meal,"" but Kaaf ich en Esse? means ""Can I buy a meal?""
Common question words (Froogewadde) incldue: Wie (how/what), Wu (where), Was (what), Wer (who), and Wie viel (how much)., You may want to learn a few phrases to help you start conversations with Amish speakers. Kannscht du Pennsilfaanisch Deitsch schwetzer? (Can you speak Pennsylvania Dutch?) is a good way to begin, as are Guder daag (Hello) and Mach’s gut (Good-bye).


When introducing yourself, you can say Mei Naame iss ___, and then ask Was iss dei Naame? When introducing others, you can say Sei Naame iss __ (for males) and Ihr Naame iss __ (for females).
You can also ask Vie gehts? (How are you?) or Wie bischt du? (How's it going?) To say you're doing well, you can say Ich bin gut (I'm doing well) or if things aren't going so great, you can say Ich bin zimmlich schlecht (I'm not doing so well).
You’ll definitely want to learn Tzeit for essah (Time to eat) if you visit an Amish restaurant or bakery.When asking people what they like to eat, use the question Gleichscht du ___? (Do you like __?) If you want to offer a short prayer before eating, you can say Ich saag dank am disch (I offer thanks at the table). Most Amish households pray silently before meals, though.Ask someone Wie iss es Wedder? if you want to know what the weather is like. You might hear 'Sis schee (It's nice outside) or 'Sis schlecht (It's nasty outside) in response.

, The Amish have quite a few idioms and sayings, many of which are used in day-to-day conversation. Learning these will help you exchange some words of wisdom with new friends.Guut gewetzt iss halwer gemaeht means ""Well whetted is half mown,"" or ""well begun is half done."" This saying means that a good start to something is only half the project.

Wu Schmook iss, iss aa Feier means ""Where there's smoke, there's fire,"" a very common saying in English too.

Was mer net weess macht eem net heess means ""What you don't know won't make you hot"" -- in other words, what you don't know won't hurt you.

, If you live in Pennsylvania, there are several places that offer Pennsylvania Dutch classes, including Pennsilfaanish Deitsch Friend Groups (the Amish equivalent of churches), some universities, and some public libraries. The Pennsylvania German Society maintains a list of places that offer lessons and classes., There are not many printed sources in Pennsylvania Dutch, because it is primarily a spoken dialect, but there are some that will help you become a fluent reader.


The Pennsylvania Dutch Dialect Project includes a variety of short texts in the language, including jokes!The German-Pennsylvanian Association maintains a website and blog that is mostly written in the language.The Pennsylvania German Society publishes a journal, Der Reggeboge, that includes dialect pieces and columns.The “Pennsylvania Dutch Blog” sometimes features pieces written in the dialect.Pennsylvania native Brad Humble maintains a blog, ""Brad Humble's Amish Country,"" on Amish culture and language that includes a cookbook, dictionary, and list of phrases.

, Because Pennsylvania Dutch is often pronounced quite differently from modern German, it’s important to listen to native speakers and attend to their pronunciation.


The University of Wisconsin at Madison has collected a bunch of audio interviews with Amish speakers, with transcripts provided.Hiwwe wie Driwwe has its own YouTube channel with videos in spoken Pennsylvania Dutch., If you’re really serious about learning more about Amish culture and language, there are some colleges and universities that can help you. Millersville University,Kutztown University, and Elizabethtown College(all located in Pennsylvania) all have centers for the study of Pennsylvania German culture and language.

, The Amish often have a reputation for being reserved toward non-Amish, whom they call “English.”Nevertheless, the Amish Ordnung stresses values such as humility, simplicity, and community, and thus most Amish believe it is important to interact with friendliness to outsiders in order to demonstrate godliness. If you live near an Amish community, there are probably Amish-owned businesses where you can chat with locals in their language.


Bakeries and restaurants are very common businesses owned and operated by Amish. In addition to helping you practice your language skills, you’re sure to find some delicious food at these places, as the Amish are famous for their baked goods.
Shops featuring Amish handcrafts, such as wood carvings, quilts, and furniture, are also very common in Amish areas.Sometimes, Amish farms will have signs inviting visitors to take a tour or buy homemade goods. Feel free to stop by if you see a sign, but if you don’t, respect the farmers’ privacy., Thanks to the internet, it’s easy to set up shared-interest groups. A “conversation group” or meet-up will allow you to meet others interested in the study of the language and practice your conversation skills.


Kutztown University maintains a conversation group that schedules its meetings on Meetup.com., Tourism is a significant part of some Amish areas, particularly in Holmes County, Ohio, and Lancaster, Pennsylvania (the two largest Amish settlements in the world).In these areas there are several Amish cultural or heritage centers whose purpose is informing outsiders about Amish culture and faith.Kutztown University in Pennsylvania maintains a Pennsylvania German Cultural Heritage Center and museum. They offer events and a library in addition to other resources., The Pennsylvania German Society is a nonprofit organization that is dedicated to studying Pennsylvania Dutch culture and language. In addition to sponsoring or running several language classes in the Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, area, they offer a curated library, a journal, a dialect series, and other historical sources and documents."

Reduce the use of stresses in your speech.,

Study an online Singlish dictionary.,
Memorize some of the common phrases used in Singlish.,
Memorize the uniquely Singlish words added to the end of sentences.,
Talk with Singaporeans.,
Use Singlish respectfully.",How to Speak Singlish," English is a language that makes frequent use of stresses, or stressing certain syllables in sentences and words more than others. Singlish is more homogenous with its syllables. So try to speak with more consistent stressing of the syllables in your sentences.For this reason, Singlish often sounds somewhat monotone to foreigners.
For example, instead of saying ""I LIKE this a LOT,"" you'd speak each syllable with more or less the same amount of emphasis, just like ""I like this a lot."";
, Voiced consonants include ""g"", ""p"", ""th,"" ""ch"", and ""v"". Think of Singlish pronunciation as more relaxed and less strong. Words like ""pat"" are pronounced like ""bat,"" because the strength behind the consonant ""p"" is lost. ""Birth"" becomes ""biff"" and ""with"" becomes ""wiff""., A rise and fall intonation is when you go up and then back down in pitch on a single syllable. This can increase the emphasis of approval or disapproval in speech, depending on the word being used. For example, the word ""no"" can be said without any change of intonation, or it can be said with a high rise and fall in pitch to increase the urgency and importance of the exclamation., A common way of asking yes or no questions in Singlish is to phrase the question as a statement and then add the Cantonese-derived word ""meh"". You also must have a rising inflection as you get to the end of the sentence, just like the way questions are inflected in English.For example, ""can you do that?"" in Singlish would be phrased as ""you can do that meh?""

, The Singlish word ""lah"" is the opposite of ""meh"". Whereas ""meh"" turns a statement into a question, ""lah"" makes you sound sure of your statement. Incorporate ""lah"" into the end of your sentences when you want to assure someone of your certainty. It changes the tone of the statement, not its meaning., Singlish takes a lot of its grammar from Malay, so it makes much less use of prepositions, verb conjugations, and plural words.Prepositions are words that describe the relationship between verbs and nouns and nouns and nouns. Prepositions include words like ""before,"" ""after,"" ""in between,"" and ""throughout."" So the English sentence ""he sat in front of her"" might be reduced to ""he sat front her"" in Singlish.
Verb conjugations are the different forms of verbs for different uses, like we go versus he goes.So instead of saying ""he goes there everyday,"" you'd say ""he go there everyday.""
The use of plural words is infrequent in Singlish. If you can get across your meaning without uses the plural form of a noun, use the singular. For example, ""I ate grapes"" would be ""I ate grape.""

, Singlish doesn't make a lot of use of past tense verbs, unlike standard English. So instead of saying ""what happened yesterday?"" you'd say ""what happen yesterday?"" And ""you went where?"" becomes ""you go where?"", In colloquial English, we sometimes drop the subject from our sentences, such as saying ""Finished?"" instead of ""Are you finished?"" This is done much more often in Singlish.For example, ""I don't want that"" would be ""don't want,"" and ""finish already"" could mean ""I finished already"" or ""they finished already"" depending on the context.

, There a number of well-researched Singlish dictionaries online that provide many examples of common Singlish words and phrases and their English translations. Singlish is a combination of English, Malay, several Chinese languages, and Tamil, so there are many words used in Singlish that don't come from English.Do a search for Singlish dictionaries to find resources for building your Singlish vocabulary. Some of the best ones include http://www.singlishdictionary.com/ and http://www.talkingcock.com/html/lexec.php?op=LexPKL&lexicon=lexicon.

, There's too much Singlish vocabulary to list out all the common phrases and words here, but here are some of the more useful ones:Arrow: to order someone to do something. ""My boss arrow me to do this for me!""
Maken liao?: have you eaten already?
Sian ah!: I am very frustrated.
Alamak!: Exclamation of unhappiness.
Oh ya hor!: Oh yes I agree with you.
Why you like that one?: Why do you act like that?
Can meh?: Can this task be done?
Wah lau!: Wow!
Buay Tahan: I can't take it!
Blanjah: to treat someone to a drink or meal.

, As previously stated, ""lah"" and ""meh"" are added to the end of Singlish sentences to change the tone or meaning of the statement. ""Lah"" emphasizes certainty and ""meh"" turns something into a yes or no question. There are other words like this used in Singlish.Some of these are:


""Leh"" is used similarly to ""lah"" but the tone it puts across is more like you're trying to get someone to understand something. It's an exclamation of frustration, as in the statement ""I don't know leh!""
""Liao"" is a frequently used expression that means ""already,"" as in the sentence ""I did that liao leh!""
""Hor"" asks for the listener's agreement, as in the phrase ""This nice hor.""

, The best way to learn an informal patois such as Singlish is to hear it spoken fluently. If you have friends who speak Singlish, see if they'll chat with you. You could also try attending Singaporean cultural events in your area or looking for meetups online.


You could also study abroad in Singapore, or visit for an extended period. Immersion is one of the best ways to learn any language.

, If you're a foreigner visiting Singapore, it's unnecessary to try to adopt the use of Singlish in order to communicate, as Singaporeans as a group understand standard English very well. If you try to speak Singlish with the locals, they'll likely find that amusing. There's always the risk that some will find it condescending, so be careful not to speak Singlish in a mocking manner.Visiting or living in Singapore for an extended period of time is a situation where it would appropriate to try to learn Singlish. Learning it will help you understand those around you without them having to switch to standard English for your benefit.

Do not change verb tense.",How to Speak Jamaican," Jamaican Patois uses an English-based alphabet, but there are several minor differences worth noting.


Unlike the 26-letter English alphabet, the Jamaican alphabet only has 24 letters. Most letter names are pronounced as they would be in English, but there are a few exceptions.
The letters in the Jamaican alphabet are:A, a B, b Ch, ch D, d E, e F, f G, g H, h I, i J, j K, k L, l M, m N, n O, o P, p R, r S, s T, t U, u V, v W, w Y, y Z, z ;
, Certain Jamaican letters sound the same as their English counterparts when you pronounce them within words, but others sound somewhat different. Knowing how to pronounce each one will make it easier to speak the language.


This is how you pronounce each Jamaican letter:

a, a~ə

b, b

ch, tʃ

d, d

e, ɛ

f, f

g, g/ʤ

h, h

i, i

j, ʤ

k, k

l, l/ɬ

m, m

n, n

o, ɔ~o

p, p

r, r~ɹ

s, s

t, t

u, u

v, v

w, w

y, y

z, z



Certain letter combinations have their own pronunciation rules. These are the combinations you must be aware of:

aa, a:

ai, aǐ

er, ɜɹ

ie, iɛ

ier, -iəɹ

ii, i:

oo, o:

sh, ʃ

uo, ȗɔ

uor, -ȗɔɹ




, The most basic way to say ""hello"" in Jamaican would be ""wah gwan.""


Like most languages, however, there are many different ways to greet someone. Each varies depending on the time of day and the overall context.
Some common examples include:""Gud mawnin,"" meaning ""Good morning""
""Gud evening,"" meaning ""Good evening""
""Hail up,"" meaning ""Hi""
""Pssst,"" meaning ""Hey there""
""Wat a guh dung,"" meaning ""What's happening?""
""Weh yuh ah seh,"" meaning ""How are you doing?"" Literally, however, it means ""What are you saying?""
""How yuh stay,"" meaning ""How are you?"" Literally, it means ""What's your status?""
""Howdeedo,"" meaning ""How are you?"" This phrase is usually used by older generations.



, One of the simplest ways to say ""goodbye"" in Jamaican is ""mi gaan,"" which literally translates into ""I'm gone.""


Like greetings, though, there are also multiple ways to part ways with someone.
A few more common options are:

""Likkle more,"" meaning ""goodbye""
""Inna di morrows,"" meaning ""see you tomorrow."" Literally translated, this phrase means ""in the tomorrows.""
""Walk good,"" meaning ""take care.""



, While Jamaican culture isn't overly concerned with etiquette, it's still a good idea to learn several polite phrases. Using them at the appropriate time will create a positive impression.


Common phrases include:""A Beg Yuh,"" meaning ""please"" or ""can you please?""
""Jus a word,"" meaning ""excuse me.""
""Beg yuh pass,"" meaning ""can I pass?""
""Tanks,"" meaning ""thank you.""


Additionally, you should also know how to respond when someone asks how you're feeling or doing. Several phrases that express contentment include:

""Everything criss,"" meaning ""Everything is okay.""
""Everything is everything"" and ""everyting cook an curry"" both mean ""everything is just fine.""
""All fruits ripe"" means ""everything is just great.""



, When you're interacting with native Jamaicans, it's important to know how to ask for things you need.


Questions worth learning include:

""Weh ah de bawtroom,"" meaning ""Where is the bathroom?""
“Weh ah de hospital,” meaning “Where is the hospital?”
“Weh ah de Babylon,” meaning “Where are the police?”
""Do yuh speak english,"" meaning ""Do you speak English?""



, When discussing other people, you'll need to know which terms to use when describing them.


Some important examples include:""Brethren,"" meaning ""relatives.""
""Chile"" or ""pickney,"" both meaning ""child.""
""Fahda,"" meaning ""father.""
""Madda,"" meaning ""mother.""
""Ginnal"" or ""samfy man,"" both meaning ""con artist.""
""Criss ting,"" meaning ""good looking girl.""
""Youthman,"" meaning ""young man"" or ""young woman.""



, Compound words are fairly common in Jamaican Patois, especially when referring to parts of the body. Some common compound words include:


""Hand miggle,"" meaning ""hand middle"" or ""palm.""
""Hiez-ole,"" meaning ""ear hole"" or ""the inner ear.""
""Foot battam,"" meaning ""foot bottom"" or ""sole.""
""Nose-ole,"" meaning ""nose hole"" or ""nostril.""
""Yeye-wata,"" meaning ""eye water"" or ""tears.""
""Yeye-ball,"" meaning ""eyeball"" or ""eye.""

, Aside from the basic words, phrases, and expressions already noted, there are many Jamaican slang expressions you should learn if you want to master the language.


Several common phrases include:""Blouse an skirt"" or ""rawtid,"" both meaning ""wow.""
""Out a Road,"" an expression meant to describe something new or upcoming.
""Cut out,"" meaning ""to leave somewhere.""
""Too nuff,"" meaning ""nosy.""
""Hush yuh mouth,"" meaning ""be quiet.""
""Link mi,"" meaning ""come see me.""
""Back a yard,"" which refers to one's hometown or country.
""Bleach,"" an expression indicating that one goes without sleep, typically because of some fun activity.



, Like English sentences, Jamaican sentences include subjects, verbs, and objects. The verb does not change with the subject, however, like it would in English.Example:

In English, the verb ""speak"" changes based on who speaks: I speak, you speak, he speaks, we speak, you all speak, they speak
In Jamaican, the verb ""speak"" does not change with the subject: Mi speak, yu speak, im speak, wi speak, unu speak, dem speak



, In Jamaican, adding ""s"" or ""es"" to a verb does not make it plural as it does in English. Instead, you'll need to use ""dem, ""nuff,"" or an actual number.


Place ""dem"" at the end of the word: ""baby dem"" in Jamaican would be ""babies"" in English
Place ""nuff"" at the beginning of a word to indicate that there are many of something: ""nuff plate"" in Jamaican would be ""many plates"" in English.
Place a number before a word to specify a specific amount: ""ten book"" in Jamaican would be ""ten books"" in English.

, Pronouns in Jamaican Patois do not change based on gender, nor do they change depending on whether they're positioned as the subject or object.


Additionally, there are no possessive pronouns in Jamaican.
The pronouns are:

""Mi"" means ""I,"" ""me,"" and ""my.""
""Yu"" means ""you"" and ""yours"" (singular).
""Im"" means ""him,"" ""her,"" ""he,"" ""she,"" ""his,"" and ""hers.""
""Wi"" means ""we,"" ""us,"" and ""ours.""
""Unu"" means ""you"" and ""yours"" (plural).
""Dem"" means ""they,"" ""them,"" and ""theirs.""



, The copula or linking verb in Jamaican is the letter ""a."" The same letter is also used as a particle in Jamaican.


As a linking verb: ""Mi a run"" means ""I am running,"" with the ""a"" taking the place of ""am.""
As a particle: ""Yu a teacha"" means ""You are a teacher,"" with the ""a"" taking the place of ""are a.""

, Jamaican Patois frequently uses the repetition of words to emphasize an idea, increase intensity, or express character traits.


For instance, if you were to describe how big a child has grown, you might say something like: ""Im big-big,"" meaning, ""He is very big.""
Similarly, if you want to express how true something is, you could do so by saying: ""A tru-tru,"" meaning, ""It's true true"" or ""It is very true.""
Duplication is often used when describing negative character traits, such as ""greedy"" (nyami-nyami), ""untidy"" (Chakka-chakka), or ""weak"" (fenkeh-fenkeh).

, Double negatives are not allowed when speaking standard English, but many Jamaican sentences use double negatives.


For example, saying ""Mi nuh have nun"" in Jamaican literally means ""I don't have none"" in English. Even though this would be incorrect in English, it's still correct in Jamaican.

, Verbs do not change based on tense. To indicate a change in tense, you would need to add a new word to the front of the verb.


More specifically, to make a word past tense, you would need to place ""en,"" ""ben,"" or ""did"" before the verb.
For instance, the Jamaican word ""guh"" is the present tense version of the English word ""go."" Saying ""a guh"" changes it to ""is going."" Saying ""did guh"" changes it to ""went.""

Learn the different pronunciation of some words.,
Listen to native’s vowel pronunciation.,

Raise your verbal intonation at the end of a sentence.,
Learn some specific New Zealand words.,
Don’t be fooled by false cognates.,
Prepare for abbreviated versions of common words.,
Recognize the roots of the Maori language.,
Learn a few key Maori words.,
Learn the Maori vowels and their pronunciation.",How to Speak New Zealand English," The New Zealand dialects have similar, but not identical, pronunciations to American and British words. Learning common differences in pronunciation will help you to communicate easily and avoid easy misunderstandings.New Zealand English speakers will pronounce the word “data” like it is pronounced in American English, “Dar-tah,” not “day-taa,” as in British English.
Debut is pronounced “de-booo,” almost unrecognizable from the UK and American pronunciation.;
, A significant part of the pronunciation difference between American and British English, and New Zealand English, lies in the vowel.To imitate the New Zealand accent, move the base of your tongue farther back in your mouth and when you’re saying “Uhhh...” say “Ahhh....”


Draw out the vowel “E” into an “EEE” sound. “Ten minutes” should sound like “teen meenuts.”Pronounce the short “A” sound like a long “O.” In the short “A,” such as in “awesome” or “Auckland,” say “oarsome” or “Oarkland.”

, This is one of the most notable pronunciation oddities of New Zealand English; vowels are altered so they nearly all sound the same. For example, although there is a marked difference between the vowel sounds in the words “near” and “square” for British and American English speakers, the vowel sounds are the same in New Zealand English.The short “I” is flattened and pronounced like a “U.” “Fish and chips” should sound like “fush and chups.”

, New Zealand English speakers typically inflect their voices upwards at the end of declarative sentences.To American and British English speakers, it can sound like Kiwis are asking questions, when they are simply making statements. Start out using this effect in moderation, and imitate the speech patterns of New Zealand English speakers around you.


A New Zealand English speaker saying, “I went to the coast. It was very hot,” will sound more like, “I went to the coast? It was very hot?”

, Once you have adjusted your English pronunciation to match the New Zealand inflections, you’ll need to expand (or adjust) your vocabulary by learning some new slang. In some cases, New Zealand English speakers re-purpose common English words; you’ll need to learn those as well. To start with, remember:Av: no one from New Zealand says “Avenue,” they all say “Av” instead.
Dairy: As well as its association with milk production, in NZ the “dairy” also refers to the local shop / corner shop. Your local dairy does not just sell milk! You can get bread, snacks, newspapers, and groceries from the dairy.
Bach: holiday home, often coastal.
Chilli Bin: cooler.
Jandals: flip flops or thong footwear.
Manchester: bed linen.
Lollies: sweets or candies.
Shonky – mild profanity. Not as bad as “munted.”
Munted: not good. Less vulgar than “rooted.”
Rooted: Rooted is a vulgar term used in place of the F-word. For example, “That’s rooted,” means “The item in question is no longer in working order.”
Stoked: very pleased.

, These are words and phrases in New Zealand English that sound similar to phrases in British or American English, but actually have contradictory meanings.Although you will be able to pick up the meaning from speakers’ body language and context clues, some false cognates are more confusing than others, and you’ll need to memorize many.


Quite nice: something that is unpleasant.
To have a mare: to make a fool of yourself.
Sweet As: agreed, or good. This phrase is occasionally confused by non-Kiwis as being a compliment to the bottom. “As” does not mean “Ass” or “Arse” when used in casual conversation.
Yeah-nah: No thank you. Kiwis say “Yeah-nah” when they want to say no without giving offence. A really good example if this is when a kiwi is offered another alcoholic beverage, “Have another beer bro, it’s not late” Answer, “Yeah, nah.” Meaning, “I’d like another drink and have considered accepting but I really shouldn’t.”

, New Zealand English speakers are notorious for abbreviating words. Listen for this, and don’t be surprised if you hear familiar words chopped in half, often with the suffix “-ies” added. For example, you may hear someone say they’ll visit their “rellies” (relatives) after they eat “brekkie” (breakfast).

, Maori is the language of the indigenous people of New Zealand. Although the Maori language was banned for many years after New Zealand was colonized, today it is spoken commonly in certain communities. In fact, as many as 1,000 Maori vocabulary terms are now commonly integrated into English-language speech., As Maori is largely integrated into everyday usage, it is advisable to learn at least a few key words. In addition, many Maori geographical and city names are used by speakers of New Zealand English. For example:


“Whanau” refers to “family.” Note that the “Wh” in whanau is pronounced as “f,” as with all Maori words that begin with “wh.”
“Kia Ora” is a common Maori greeting, and one you’ll likely hear spoken in New Zealand English.

, As you come across unfamiliar Maori words—and especially place names—you’ll need to be able to sound them out on your own. As the vowels are the trickiest part of Maori words, and you’ll just need to memorize their pronunciations. In Maori, most consonants are pronounced the same as in English.


A, “ahh”
E, “eh”
I, “eee”
O, “oh”
U, “ew”
“Ng” followed by a vowel is usually pronounced as a hard “N” sound.

Speak to educated people.,
Listen to tapes.,
Pronounce the endings of words.,
Practice tongue-twisters.",How to Speak Proper English1," Education is not the be-all and end-all for language acquisition, by any means, but people with extensive educations do often have a strong grasp on the rules of grammar and syntax. Speaking to well-educated people, whether teachers, family members or obliging strangers, is a good way to get a sense of what proper English sounds like.


Try to listen to how these people form their words -- the way their lips move, their pronunciation and their rhythm and intonation.
Now try to mimic how these people speak. It may feel strange or awkward at first, but with practice it will become second nature.;
, A good way to improve your pronunciation is to listen to audio tapes or podcasts, where you can hear how a native English speaker forms their words.


If you like, you can even stop the tape and repeat the words after them until you get them right.

, A common mistake many native and non-native English speakers make is not pronouncing the endings of words.


For instance, instead of saying ""going"", they would say ""goin'"" or instead of saying ""making"", they would say ""makin'"".

, Tongue twisters are helpful at improving enunciation and diction. Enunciation is knowing how to project a certain word in a certain context. Diction is knowing the way you deliver, which includes pronouncing certain prefixes, suffixes and where to place stress on certain parts of words. They are also beneficial in learning to write properly, as you can hear certain word patterns within the phrase or sentence, as well as grasping rhythm and syllable.

Make an effort to to emphasize the endings of words and your pronunciation will improve greatly.

Say ""I"" instead of ""me"".,
Don't use the word ""like"" in the wrong context.,
Avoid cursing.,
Take a writing or grammar class.",How to Speak Proper English2," Instead of saying ""Kate and me are going to the cinema"" (or Me and Kate are going to the cinema) say ""Kate and I are going to the cinema"". Often people who are otherwise well-spoken will make this mistake, but using ""I"" is correct. Remember to only use ""I"" when you are the subject. It would be wrong to say ""Jack likes Sally and I."" because here ""I"" is part of the object. Instead here it would be ""Jack likes Sally and me."" There is nothing to it, but to do it.

, For example, an incorrect use of the word ""like"" would be: ""The other day I got on this, like, bus and went to, like, Southampton to meet my, like, boyfriend"".... Even if it sounds natural to you, it sounds annoying to a person who speaks English properly. Whereas the correct use of the word ""like"" would be: ""I like biscuits and I also like American cookies.""


Another context where we use 'like' is when describing a simile, which uses the word 'like' or 'as' as a comparison to another (often unlike) form or non-living object. For example, ""the sea sparkled like the stars at night"". This can be expanded to be more complex, ""the sun shone on the sea, like stars in the night.""

, We were all taught in grade school that swear words are rude, yet most of us swear more often than we need to. Frequently using curse words or bad language does not give a good impression, especially in polite company. Expanding your vocabulary should help you to find alternative words to express yourself. If you can expand your vocabulary, you can eliminate swearing at all costs - and once you accomplish this, you'll often find that in most everyday situations, there is no need to swear at all.

, Taking grammar classes will teach you how to form complete sentences with proper grammar, as well as improving writing ability (in particular, spelling and syntax) and vocabulary. If you can train yourself to write grammatically well (and then say these sentences aloud while pronouncing each word correctly), you will learn to 'pick out' what is correct grammar and what is not. The more you practice writing and reading, the more you will be able to 'hear' the grammar when constructing sentences both in text and in speech, which is how you develop a good 'ear' for using correct language. Once you grasp this skill, bad sentence structure will be more noticeable to you - and therefore it will be more likely good grammar will stay committed in your memory. Say for example we are geologists."
"
Read more.,
Use synonyms.,
Make labels.",How to Speak Proper English3," Reading is a great way to expand your vocabulary while also understanding the correct context of words.


Use a dictionary while reading so you can look up any words you don't understand.
Read material that you find interesting, whether it's fictional novels, the newspaper, a history book or a magazine.

, When writing or speaking, instead of using small describing words such as; ""the building over there is big"", use more eloquent words that mean basically the same thing, but convey more meaning. For example: ""the building over there is gigantic."".


Alternatively, you can make the sentence more complex. For example, ""the building over there is said to be one of the largest in Europe.""

, If you're a non-native English speaker, it can be difficult to remember even basic words. A good way around this is to make labels for everyday household items which contain the English word and its pronunciation.


Stick these labels on the items and you will be reminded of the word every time you see or use each object.
Leave the labels on until you have committed the word to memory.

Learn the Maltese letters.,
Learn how to pronounce the vowels.,
Learn which letters make sounds similar to English.,
Learn which consonant sounds are different from English.,
Learn how to make a “Q” sound.",How to Speak Maltese1," The Maltese alphabet is similar to the English alphabet, but there are a few extra letters. In addition, some letters have markings on them that change their pronunciation. There are a total of 29 letters in the Maltese alphabet:A a
B b

D d
E e

M m
N n
O o
P p
Q q
R r
S s
T t
U u
V v
W w
X x
Ż ż
Z z;
, Each vowel has a long and short sound, similar to English vowels. Pronounce the vowels like this:


A: A long “a” sounds like a in “far.” A short “a” sounds like “u” in “shut.”
E: A long “e” sounds like the e in “shed.” A short “e” sounds like the ai in “hair.”
I: A long “i” sounds like ee in “jeep.” A short “i” sounds like I in “fit.”
O: A long “o” sounds like aw in “law.” A short “o” sounds like o in “got.”
U: A long “u” sounds like oo in “fool.” A short “u” sounds like u in “full.”

, Many of the letters in the Maltese alphabet sound like their English equivalents. These letters include: B, D, F, G, K, L, M, N, P, S, T, V, and W.


Ħ makes a sound like a regular H in English (as in “house”).
Ż makes a sound like a regular Z in English (as in “fuzz”).

, Several consonants in Maltese take on a different sound than its English equivalent. These include:


C sounds like “ch” in “church.”
Ġ sounds like “j” in “join.”
H is silent if it’s in the middle of a word. If it’s at the end of a word, it sounds like the “h” in “hen.”
J sounds like “y” in “yes.”
GH is primarily silent and usually prolongs the sound of the vowel that it follows.
R is trilled, similar to a Scottish or Spanish R sound.
X sounds like “sh” in “sheep.”
Z sounds like “ts” as in “hats.”

, A “q” in Maltese is pronounced with a glottal stop. A glottal stop is a sound that is made by completely closing the glottis (the area at the opening of the vocal cords at the top of the larynx) and then opening it up again. This is done very quickly.To do a glottal stop, speak the part of the word before the Q. Stop your air flow when you get to the Q (don’t pronounce the Q, of course), and then pick up the word again to pronounce the letters after the Q. This sounds similar to when a Scottish or Cockney accent speaks a word like “better” or “fitting.”Search online for audio examples of what a glottal stop sounds like.

Learn how to use the article “the”.,
Learn the gender of nouns.,
Learn how to make feminine adjectives.,
Learn how to respond in the negative.",How to Speak Maltese2," The definite article, “the” is “l-” in Maltese (the letter L with a hyphen). This construction is linked to the noun. For example, “l-orizzont” is “the horizon” in English.


In cases where the noun begins with certain consonants, the article is “il-” instead. Examples are: il-mera (the mirror), il-qamar (the moon), and il-lapis (the pencil).
In certain cases, the definite article matches the sound in words that begin with c, d, n, r, s, t, x, ż and z. Examples include: ic-circku (the circle), ir-rahal (the village), and it-tagen (the frying pan).

, In Maltese, as in many other languages, certain words are masculine and others are feminine. Learn to distinguish between masculine and feminine nouns, which will also affect the formation of adjectives to describe these nouns. You can also tell whether an adjective is masculine or feminine with the same rules.


Masculine words: nouns and adjectives that end with a consonant or with “u.” Examples are glekk (coat), ktieb (book), and seklu (century). There are a few exceptions, including triq (street), dar (house) and galb (heart).
Feminine words: nouns and adjectives that end in “a” or “i.” Examples are mejda (table), helwa (sweet), arti (art) and fidi (faith). Exceptions include ilma (water) and papa (Pope).

, Adjectives in their masculine form need a slight change to make them match feminine nouns. Typically, add “a” to the end of the masculine adjective. If the adjective ends in “i,” add “ja” to make it feminine.


For instance, boy franciz (a French boy) becomes tfajla franciza (a French girl).

, To make a phrase using “not,” add “ma” before the verb and add “x” at the end of the verb. When the verb ends with an “a,” change the “a” to “iex.” For example:


“Kiel” (he ate) becomes “ma kielx” (he didn’t eat).
“Hija” (she is) becomes “mhijiex” (she isn’t).
“Dhalt” (I went in) becomes “ma dhaltx” (I didn’t go in).

Understand Kannada verbs.",How to Speak in Kannada3," Kannada's alphabet is derived from Kadamba and Cālukya scripts that, over centuries, morphed in Kannada and Telugu scripts. These scripts were formalized and translated into English script forms in the 19th century.Here is a chart of Kannada vowels and their pronunciation.

ಎ i KANNADA LETTER e
ಏ ii KANNADA LETTER AE
ಐ ai KANNADA LETTER AI
ಒ o KANNADA LETTER O
ಓ ō KANNADA LETTER OO
ಔ au KANNADA LETTER AUCanarese consonants come in two forms, structured and unstructured. Structured consonants are categorized by where the tongue touches the palate. These come in five categories. They are:
Velars ಕ (ka) ಖ (kha) ಗ (ga) ಘ (gha) ಙ (nga)
Palatals ಚ (cha) ಛ (chha) ಜ (ja) ಝ (jha) ಞ (nya)
Retroflex ಟ (tta) ಠ (ttha) ಡ (dda) ಢ (ddha) ಣ (nna)
Dentals ತ (ta) ಥ (tha) ದ (da) ಧ (dha) ನ (na)
Labials ಪ (pa) ಫ (pha) ಬ (ba) ಭ (bha) ಮ (ma) The unstructured consonants are: ಯ (ya), ರ (ra), ಲ (la), ವ (va), ಶ (sha), ಷ (ssa), ಸ (sa), ಹ (ha), ಳ (lla)Kannada also includes two letters which are part consonant and part vowel, called ""yogavaahaka"". They are the anusvara: ಅಂ (am) and the visarga: ಅಃ (ah), The Kannada language has a numbering system that stretches from 0 to 1 million.Below is a sample of Kannada numbers from 0 to 9.
೦ sonne 0 Zero
೧ ondu 1 One
೨ eraḍu 2 Two
೩ mūru 3 Three
೪ nālku 4 Four
೫ aidu 5 Five
೬ āru 6 Six
೭ ēḷu 7 Seven
೮ enṭu 8 Eight
೯ oṃbattu 9 Nine, The Kannada language is alphasyllabary, which means all the consonants have an inherent vowel sound in them. Just like English, Canarese moves from left to right horizontally. When consonants appear together without a vowel in between, the second consonant is written as a special conjunt symbol, usually below the first.When Kannada is written using English language characters, you will sometimes find that vowels in the middle of words are capitalized to represent the long vowel sound. However, this convention is not uniformly practiced., Understanding basic pronouns is essential to speaking or comprehending languages. Below is a list of Kannada pronouns.


I - naanu
you - neenu
he - avanu
she - avalu
we - naavu
they -avvaru
me - nanna, nannage
you - ninna, nimage
him - avana, avanige
her - avala,avalige
us - namma
them - avarige
my - namma
your - ninna
his - avana
her - avala
our - namma
their - avara
mine - nanna
yours - nimma
his - avana
hers - avala
ours - namma
theirs - avara, The pronunciation of certain Kannada words can be difficult for English speakers, as there are some sounds in Canarese for which English has no equivalent. Nevertheless, the pronunciation guide below should be useful in grasping the basics of pronouncing Kannada words.


Ane (here A is as in Ball). In contrast, in aDike a is short as in ""aristocrat"".
mEle (here E is as in Baby).
prIti (here I is as in Meeting)
hOda (here O is as in roam)
pUjari (here U is as in fool)
The consonants which are capitalized are:
aDike (the D is as in ""Dog""); lower case d is soft).
koTru (here T is as in ""Tom""); lower case is soft.
chELige (here L is a sound with no equivalence in English; lower case is as in ""lamb"")
kaNNu (here N is nasal; lower case is as in ""no"")

, All Kannada nouns have genders. There are three categories of gender applied to nouns in Kannada. They are masculine, feminine, and neuter. This can be tricky for English speakers, as English nouns are not gendered, and elements of Kannada religion and cosmology play a role in the gendering of nouns., Kannada, unlike western languages, does not have infinitive forms for its verbs. Rather, they take the form of ""singular, nonpolite imperatives.""In most cases, unconjugated verbs take the form of verb stems.Because of this, when looking at a Kannada language dictionary, you will find verbs by their verb stem rather than in a constructed, infinitive form. For example, see the conjugation of ""to walk"" in Kanadda below.
to walk - naḍeyalu
I walk - nānu naḍeyuttēne
you walk - nīvu naḍeyalu
he walks - avaru paricayisuttade
she walks - avaḷu naḍedu
it walks - idu paricayisuttade
they walk - avaru naḍedu
we walk - nāvu naḍeyaluNotice that all of the conjugated forms maintain the root ""ade"" somewhere in the word.

Practice pronouncing Finnish vowels.,
Learn the differences between English and Finnish consonants.,
Memorize basic greetings.,
Ask and answer simple questions.,
Count simple numbers.",How to Speak Finnish1," Finnish has a heavy emphasis on vowels, and its alphabet contains some vowels that are not used in English. Before you start studying Finnish, you should learn how to read and pronounce its alphabet. Since Finnish words are spelled exactly how they are pronounced, this will help you learn vocabulary more quickly.


A (IPA: /a/): pronounced like English “father” or “calm”
O (IPA: /o/): pronounced like the 'o' in 'bot' or 'top'.
U (IPA: /u/): pronounced like the English 'a' in 'all'.
I (IPA: /i/): pronounced like the English 'i' in 'fit' or 'tip'
E (IPA: /e/): pronounced like “bed”
ä (IPA: /ae/): pronounced like English 'a' in ""hat”
Ö (IPA: /ø/): pronounced like English 'i' in “girl”Y (IPA: /y/): Like the 'oo' in 'too'. Similar to the German “ü.”A double vowel in a word simply means that you pronounce it for twice as long.;
, Most consonants in Finnish are pronounced the same as in English. This includes the pronunciation for the letters D, L, M, N, NG, P, S, and T. The letters B, C, F, G, Q, X, and Z are only used in loanwords.There are a few differences between English and Finnish consonants. These include:


Always pronounce H. Your H should sound breathy, as though you are puffing air every time you pronounce it.
J is pronounced like “y” is in English.
V is weaker in Finnish than in English. As you pronounce it, try touching your teeth against your bottom lip very lightly.
A double consonant (such as in the word takka) is pronounced with a brief pause or hesitation between the two consonants.
W and X are not used in Finnish., It is good to have a stock of simple phrases you can use to say hello and goodbye to people. Practice repeating these phrases back to yourself. You can also listen to videos or audio clips online to help you get used to hearing the language as well. Some good phrases are: Hei: hi, hello

Moi: hello (informal, used with friends)

Hyvää huomenta: Good morning

Hyvää päivää: Good day

Mitä kuuluu?: How are you?

Nähdään myöhemmin: See you later

Hauska tavata: Nice to meet you

Tervetuloa: Welcome

Kiitos: Thank you

Anteeksi: sorry, excuse me

Näkemiin: goodbye

, To have a conversation in Finnish, you may find it useful to start by asking questions. These conversational questions can let you practice responding in Finnish while helping you get the information you need.



Paljonko tämä maksaa?: How much does this cost?

Anteeksi, missä on _____?: Excuse me, where is ________?

Voitteko auttaa minua?: Can you help me?

Puhutko englantia: Do you speak English?

Mistä sinä olet kotoisin?: Where are you from?


Minä olen kotoisin_____: I am from _____.



Mikä sinun nimesi on?: What is your name?


Minun nimeni on_______: My name is_________.



, Numbers are important to help you find and buy things while you are in a Finnish speaking area. After learning one through ten in Finnish, you can attach endings to make numbers 11-90.one = yksi
two = kaksi
three = kolme
four = neljä
five = viisi
six = kuusi
seven = seitsemän
eight = kahdeksan
nine = yhdeksän
ten = kymmenen
For numbers 11-19, all you have to do is to add the word -toista in the end of the finnish number between 1-9. (eleven= yksitoista; twelve=kaksitoista; thirteen = kolmetoista, etc.)
For the numbers 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90, just take a number between 1-9 and add the word -kymmentä, at the end. Example: Kaksi (two) + -kymmentä = Kaksikymmentä, which means twenty in Finnish.

Practice every day.,
Study vocabulary with note cards.,
Complete grammar exercises.,
Watch Finnish entertainment.",How to Speak Finnish2," Learning a language like Finnish requires you to study frequently. Studying for even ten minutes a day can help speed up your language learning. Set a schedule for yourself to study, and stick with it. Some tricks you can try include:


Study vocabulary before you go to bed and after you wake up. This may help aid with memory.
Listen to Finnish music and radio while you cook, clean, or drive.
Set a time everyday where you go through your grammar exercises.
Set up weekly study sessions with other Finnish learners.

, Vocabulary is important to any language, and you will want to memorize as many words as you can in Finnish. A good way to do this is to write up note cards. Put the Finnish word on one side and the English definition on the other. Flip through these every day to improve your memory.


If you do not want to use physical note cards, you can study using a note card app or through an online website.

, Learning to speak Finnish is about more than just memorization. You will have to constantly test yourself to make sure that you can recall important grammatical forms. You can find grammar exercises in a number of places. Do between three and five exercises a day to help you learn the nuances of the language.


Most Finnish textbooks will contain exercises in them.
Websites such as Oneness,Venla,and Tavataan Taasoffer basic online guides and exercises for learners.
You can also look for mobile apps that will help test your Finnish abilities.

, A great way to naturally pick up Finnish is to watch or listen to Finnish media. Thanks to the internet, Finnish television, radio, music, and podcasts are all available to learners, who want to adjust their ears to the sounds of the language. There are a number of websites where you can stream Finnish entertainment. These include:


KutonenYleMTV KatsomoTune-In Online Radio"

Take a class.,
Hire a tutor.,
Find a skype partner.,
Attend Finnish cultural events.,
Visit Finland.",How to Speak Finnish3," Classes are a great way to learn the grammar and nuances of a language. Find a class with a qualified instructor who can teach you both the spoken aspects of the language and Finnish grammar.


The Finnish Consulate in Washington, D.C. offers a list of Finnish courses available in the US on its website.Some universities in the UK, such as University College London or University of Westminster, offer Finnish courses.If you are in Finland already, you can take a Finnish as a second language course at the University of Helsinki, University of Turku, University of Eastern Finland, and other major universities.If you do not have a course in your area, you can take an online course. These may be either a self-directed course or guided courses with instructors. The City of Helsinki offers a list of these courses through its Infopankki website., An effective method of learning a language is to listen, understand and repeat. You can look online or in your local area for a Finnish tutor. Your tutor should be a native or fluent speaker of Finnish. Contact local universities, language schools, and exchange programs to see if they can recommend you a tutor.


If you do not have any Finnish speakers in your area, you can find an online tutor. They will instruct you over a video chat program, such as Skype or Google Hangouts., If you want to practice speaking but you do not know any Finnish speakers, you can find a penpal who will speak to you over skype. This language partner may not be a formal tutor or instructor, but they can help you practice speaking. You will also get valuable experience hearing the language spoken naturally. You can find speaking partners on a penpal or language exchange website.

, If you live in an area with Finnish heritage or many Finnish immigrants, you might find a local Finnish cultural group or community center that will host events. These events are good places to meet other Finnish learners as well as fluent speakers.


Places in the Finnish diaspora are more likely to hold these types of events. This includes places such as Sweden, Estonia, Norway, Canada, the US, and Russia.
In the US, Finnish cultural groups can be found primarily in Michigan, Minnesota, California, Washington, and Wisconsin., Immersion is one of the most effective ways to learn a language.The best way to immerse yourself in Finnish is to visit Finland. Whether you go for a week or for a month, use Finnish as much as possible during your time there. If people try to speak to you in English, let them know that you are learning their language and want as much practice as possible.

Find out their learning styles.,
Determine their likes and dislikes.,
Start with easy material.,
Read to them.,
Assign written responses.",How to Teach Reading Skills1," You need to figure this out before you can teach reading skills. Most students learn by seeing (visual learners), hearing (auditory learners), or doing (kinesthetic learners).Talk to your principal or school guidance counselor about which tests you can give them.


Teach visual learners with outlines, diagrams, and illustrated handouts.Teach auditory learners through audio books, oral reports, and rhyming games.Teach kinesthetic learners through role-playing activities, games, and field trips.;
, One of the best ways to help kids get excited about reading is to choose material that already interests them. During the first week of school, talk to your students about their likes. You can ask about favorite movies, characters, or songs. Then you can tailor the reading material towards their interests.


For example, maybe several kids say that they love monkeys. Curious George would be a great place to start!
Maybe your kids are into magic. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone is a good choice for young readers.

, For very young readers, try titles along the lines of Dr. Seuss books or first-reader skill level. Literary devices like rhyming or alliteration also appeal to young readers. Look for books that are richly illustrated with engaging pictures so that students can connect words and images.In addition to Dr. Seuss, some good examples include:



The Cat from Hunger Mountain by Ed Young.

Little Red by Bethan Woollvin.

Freedom in Congo Square by Carole Boston Weatherford.

, As you read, angle the book so that your students can see the text and the illustrations. Make connections between the texts and the images. Before you turn the page, ask students engaging questions, such as:


What do you think Little Red Riding Hood will do next?
Why do you think Dr. Seuss made the Lorax speak for the trees?
If you were one of the billy goats, what would you do?

, Writing can build grammar, stamina, and a love for reading. At the beginning of class, have students write a short paragraph that summarizes their homework assignment or what they read in class yesterday. To make the response a bit more enjoyable, ask them to also write about what they liked about the reading and what they disliked. Other ideas for assignments include:


Writing a letter to the main character.
Converting the plot of the book into a news story.
Writing an interview with the main character.

"
"
Assess what they can already read.,
Match their maturity level.,
Preview homework assignments in class.,
Emphasize context.,
Discuss reading strategies.,
Have them teach each other.",How to Teach Reading Skills2," Hand out paragraphs from age-appropriate books. Give each student a different paragraph. Ask them to either read it aloud or explain what it’s about. Whether the students find it too easy or too difficult, you should adjust the readings until you can determine their reading level. Students can demonstrate what they already know by:


Reading aloud
Answering comprehension questions
Taking ungraded pre-tests

, Adolescent and adult learners understandably don’t want to read children’s books. For these students, search for crime fiction or other adult themes tailored to low literacy levels. You could also look for edited versions of the classic authors, such as Shakespeare.Some possible choices are:



Reading Shakespeare with Young Adults by Mary Ellen Dakin

The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin

Before We were Free by Julia Alvarez

, Divide students into small groups. Have them read the title of their assigned reading, as well as the captions to any illustrations in the reading. By reserving time for this activity in class, you’ll emphasize the importance of previewing in their future readings.Some examples of guiding questions for this assignment are:


This book is called How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Based on that title, what do you think this book is about?
What information does this photograph of Civil Rights activists sitting at a “Whites Only” counter give us about the newspaper article?

, Dictionaries are great, but looking up individual words can make readers lose their focus of the subject matter of their assignment. Teach students the importance of figuring out the meanings or significance of words from the context of the sentence or paragraph. You can teach context though:


Fill-in-the-blank questions. Students complete by choosing one of three possible words under or to the side of the question.
Antonym exercises. Students must figure out the meaning of one word by analyzing the use of its antonym (a word they already know) in the same sentence. An example would be:

While Mrs. Smith welcomed all immigrants, her neighbor was xenophobic. What does xenophobic mean?



, Have your students plan which strategies they’ll use for their assigned readings. For the next class, ask them which strategies helped the most. Examples of reading strategies are:


Skimming
Using context
Trying to predict what will happen next in a narrative

, Students absorb material better when they learn from their classmates. They can read aloud to each other and discuss what the reading meant to them. After about ten minutes of group work, have students report their discussions to the class. Some examples are:


Pair share. Ask a question related to the reading. Pair up your students for a quick discussion about their answer. After about 10 minutes, ask each group to share their responses with the entire class.
Catch-up. Break up your lecture into segments. Between each segment, have students work in small groups to compare notes and discuss what might not be clear to them. After about five to ten minutes, have each group share their findings with the class.

Assign some of your favorites.,
Play audio books.,
Make connections to the outside world.,
Hold contests.,
Play solo or group games.",How to Teach Reading Skills3," Pick out books that really grabbed your attention as a child or teenager. Enthusiasm is contagious. If your students see you getting excited about the reading material, they’re more likely to take an interest. Some timeless examples include:


Beverly Cleary’s books about Ramona Quimby
Carolyn Keene’s Nancy Drew series
Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s books about Sherlock Holmes

, Check out the school library or your local public library for books on tape or CD. Look for free downloadable versions of classics at Librivox.org. Audio books can fire up interest in reading. The right narrator can add an element of drama that a student might miss from text alone. Some good examples are:



The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, narrated by Rob de Lorenzo

The Odyssey by Homer, narrated by Ian McKellen
“Sonnet XIX” by William Shakespeare, narrated by Patrick Stewart

, Students will more likely engage with the material if they can see how it relates to the real world. Think of a variety of interesting activities that could make this connection. You could:Have students connect the reading to something in their lives. For example, you could ask them if they know a stubborn person like the narrator in Green Eggs and Ham.
Assign students to act out scenes or from their reading.
Plan a field trip on a related topic or theme to their assigned reading.

, Sometimes the best motivation is competition. Keep a weekly book quota to help students stay on track. Give them small prizes for the books they read.


For example, you could give each student a ticket for each book they read. Set up a list of rewards they could redeem their tickets for, such as extra credit points or 15 minutes on the computer.

, Search websites like PBS Kids or RIF.org to find fun games appropriate for your students’ reading levels. Look for games that you can either print out. If you can only find computer games, try making a paper-based adaptation. Some examples are:


Matching pictures to words or phrases that describe them.
Writing a chain story. Break the class up into groups. Give each group an opening sentence. Each student builds on the previous sentence until they have a complete story.
Playing a modified “Go Fish” game. The rules are the same as the traditional game. However, in this game, students match words, rather than pictures."
"
Introduce a new concept and explain its usefulness.,
Break it down into steps.,
Explain why.,
Give a simple example and go through it step-by-step.,
Give a more difficult example.,
Introduce any exceptions to the rules.,
Practice.,
Assess the student’s progress.",How to Teach Math1," When teaching math, you will be teaching one new concept at a time. For example, you might be teaching students how to do multiplication. Therefore, begin by introducing the topic of multiplication. Give them examples of how they will use multiplication in their daily lives, even when they are out of school.It may be useful, when you are trying to explain the importance of a math concept, to include a demonstration. For example, if you are teaching division, and you want to demonstrate how they will use it in their daily lives, you could bring a batch of cookies (make sure you have a number that is divisible by the number of students. If you have 12 students, bring at least 24 or 36 cookies, so that it will be easy for them to understand). Tell the students you have brought cookies, but you don’t know how many each student should get. Ask them to help you think of ways to figure it out, and then introduce the concept of division.;
, You can begin by explaining a broad mathematical principle to the student, but then break it down into the smallest steps possible. This will help the student understand why you are doing it the way you are doing it, and therefore, will help them learn and remember how to do it on their own.For example, you might begin by showing a student that 2x3=6 but then show them exactly how you came to that conclusion. You can explain that this problem is actually asking you to add up 2+2+2. Ask them to add those numbers up so that they can see that multiplication is just a shorter way of asking you to add one number a certain number of times.

, Often in math, teachers explain how to do something, but not why it is done that way. This may be fine for some students, but for most, it is difficult to grasp concepts if they do not understand why it is being done that way. Many students who can find the right answer to a mathematical problem have simply memorized the steps, but have not actually understood the reasons why a particular concept works the way it does. Unless they understand the theory behind the problem, they are likely to forget it very quickly.You could, for example, explain who came up with this method, and the logic that was used to create the method. With younger children, though, it is unlikely that this will be useful. If you want to explain the theory, try to make it visual and interesting. Try to tell a story about how the math concept came to be.
Be patient when doing this. Inquisitive students may ask many questions about your “why” explanation. Take the time to answer each question as best you can, and if you don’t know, find out together. If it is in a classroom situation where you can’t find the answer immediately, ask them to come see you after class so you can have a look.

, Once you have introduced the concept, and explained the different steps involved in doing the calculation, provide a simple example. Show them how you figure it out step-by-step. If you are teaching to a classroom of students, use the blackboard to write out the problem, then use a different color piece of chalk (or marker) to show them each step involved in the calculation.


Be sure when you are doing this that students have opportunities to ask questions about each step you are performing. If you normally require students to raise their hands to ask questions, now may be a good time to let that rule slide. This will allow them to stop you as soon as you have a question.

, If the students don’t have any more questions once you have shown them the simple example, move on to a more difficult example problem. Instead of just showing them how to do it, ask them to guide you.


If they make a mistake when guiding you say something like, “I can see why you think that’s the next step, but don’t forget about…” and then explain what they’ve forgotten or gotten mixed up.

, In some mathematical concepts, you will come across concepts that typically work in a certain way, but have specific exceptions. These types of concepts, especially, require that the student truly understand how the concept works. They are unlikely to remember or be able to figure out when the exception applies if all they’ve done is memorized the steps.


For example, in division, you can divide any number by another number to get some kind of answer. However, you cannot divide any number by 0. This is because you can’t, for example, split 5 pieces of chocolate among 0 friends., The students will get better at understanding the concepts if they are given several opportunities to practice the material. You can even space the practice material out over weeks or months so that the student returns to the same material at various intervals, which will reinforce what they’ve learned.If possible, mix up the practice exercises with straightforward worksheets (e.g. a page with 25 long-division worksheets where you ask the student to show their work on each problem) as well as real world problem solving exercises. For example, the following problem will ask the student to do long division, but in a real world setting: ""Each week you will need to work 26 hours. The work week is 5 days. How many hours will you need to work each day in order to meet the 26 hour requirement? Assume that you need to work the same number of hours each day."" Ask the student to tell you the answer. If they get it wrong, ask them to do the work on paper so you can see where they went wrong.

, Once you have explained, worked through problems together, and practiced a specific concept, you should test the student’s understanding of the concept. Depending on the setting of your teaching, you may simply provide them with a few problems to complete so you can see which questions they get wrong and which they get right, or you might have to conduct testing that will determine a grade point average for the course.


Regardless of the type of assessment you use, it is important to go through the student’s test and discuss with them the problem areas they have. It can be valuable for the student because it may simply be one small thing that they have misunderstood.

Use visual examples and stories to explain new concepts.,
Have the children act out the math problems.,
Involve imaginative games to make learning math more fun.,
Ask children to use critical thinking skills.,
Use computer based math programs.,
Have them practice often.,
Be patient and encouraging.",How to Teach Math2," When teaching math to young children, it is a good idea to use very visual examples. This will help the children imagine what you are saying in their minds so that math isn’t an abstract concept, but instead is a very clear part of real life.For example, ask the children to help you figure out the following problem: “5 turtles crawled onto a giant rock, but then 1 got too hot, so he decided to go for a swim. How many turtles are left on the giant rock?” You can ask the children to make a drawing of the turtles to make the activity even more fun.

, Like acting the problem out using visual examples, having children use their bodies will make math less abstract, as abstract concepts are usually difficult for children to understand.You can ask them to count the legs of all the children in the room and add it together. You can also ask them to answer questions by showing the correct number using their fingers. For example, if you ask, “Do I have 3 arms or 2 arms?” Then ask the children to show you how many arms you have using their fingers.

, Setting up games and allowing children to play while learning will make math a fun and interesting subject for young children. This will help them to be less afraid of a challenging subject.For example, you can have them set up a shop in the classroom. You can use monopoly money, and have some students be shoppers and other children be cashiers. Use toys or other things you have around the classroom, and assign everything a price. Then allow the shoppers to choose one or two items that they will take to the register. Help them to add the total price of the items (e.g. one item costs $1 and another costs $2. Ask them to help you figure out how much both items cost together). Once they have done this, have them hand the cashier some money, and help the cashier to calculate the change (e.g. if the total cost of the items is $3.00, and the shopper gave him $5, how much change should the shopper receive?)

, You don’t always have to just show them how to do something. You can start out by asking them to think about how they would figure out a problem. This will help them to develop and enhance their own problem solving skills, and show them that math is simply a matter of thinking critically about how to solve a problem.For example, have them all sit down at a table, and say that it’s time for snacks, but that you don’t know how many snacks to bring to the table. Ask the students to tell you how to figure it out. When they tell you, you can make the problem harder by saying that 3 extra guests will be coming. How should you figure it out now?

, Most children love to play computer games, and while this shouldn’t be the main learning mode, allowing children to play math-based computer programs is a fun way to reinforce what they’ve learned.Many of these programs also provide assessments, which will allow you to see what concepts a given student might be struggling with.

, You can incorporate things that the children are learning spontaneously throughout the day. This will help them understand that math is something that is always important, and not just something they spend 1 hour each day trying to understand.For example, if young children are learning to count, you can have them count the number of students present in a morning circle. During clean up, you can ask the children to only clean up 10 of the items on the floor.

, When you are teaching young children, you give them what might be their first experience with math. This is where they will either learn that math is something interesting and useful, or that they are one of those people who aren’t good at math. Try to dispel this myth early on by showing children that math is something that everyone can learn.


Studies show that young girls especially tend to believe that they are not talented enough for math, which offers one explanation for why fewer girls tend to pursue math related careers. This is despite the fact that there have been no significant differences demonstrated in actual ability between girls and boys.While you shouldn’t show favoritism towards girls, you should make sure that it is clear that math isn’t a “boy subject”.

"
"
Refresh your memory.,
Encourage the student.,
Avoid scolding a student for giving the wrong answer.,
Involve the student in the learning process.,
Have a few teaching strategies in mind.",How to Teach Math3," Even if you are a seasoned math teacher, you may not be up to date on new methods and techniques for solving a certain problem. Therefore, before you begin to teach a new concept, take a few hours to refresh your memory on the theory behind the concept. Read about any new methodologies that may be used to solve a particular problem.


This will ensure that you are ready for the many, many questions that students may have. It may also give you new ideas and examples to help students learn.

, For some reason, in the subject of math, students get the idea in their head that they either are good at math or they aren’t. While math may come more quickly to some than to others, with the right tools, anyone can learn the math skills they need to become successful.Therefore, you should encourage your students, and don’t let them believe they are just “bad at math.”


If one of your students say, “I just don’t get it. I can’t do math, and I will never learn this.” You can reply with something like, “I know this is a challenging topic, but it’s not true that you can’t do math because, just like everyone can learn to read, everyone can learn to do math. Let’s try approaching this topic in a different way.”

, If the student is made to feel bad about giving a wrong answer, they are unlikely to want to give any more answers. Therefore, you should avoid scolding them or making them feel stupid for trying.If they get the wrong answer, ask the student to show you how they came to that answer. This way, you will be able to show them exactly where they went wrong.

, When you are teaching them something new, find a real world problem that is related to the concept you are teaching, and ask them to think about and tell you how they might solve it before you explain each step. This will help the student feel a sense of involvement and accomplishment when you both get to the method you are teaching together.For example, if you are teaching students about least common multiples (which refers to the lowest quantity that is a multiple of two or more numbers), give them a real life example, where they are a manager trying to schedule a meeting with 5 colleagues. Give them the availability of the 5 colleagues, and ask them how they would figure out when the best time to hold a meeting would be.
Not only does this allow them to become engaged in the problem, it also demonstrates how math is important in the real world. This is good because many students believe that they won’t use the math they learn in the real world.

, If you are working one-on-one with a student, you can plan to teach the subject with that particular student in mind. For example, if you know the student you are working with needs visual examples, you can incorporate videos or stories to help them. However, if you are teaching to a classroom of students you will have different students with different ways of learning and understanding. Therefore, be prepared to explain a single concept in several different ways.Have visual explanations such as YouTube videos ready to go, have real world problems prepared, and of course, have a more theoretical explanation of the concept for those who tend to learn best simply through direct lecturing.

Keep the children enthusiastic.",How to Teach Reading to Children (for Teachers)," If your students don’t already know the letters of the alphabet then you’ll need to spend time helping them to learn each letter of the alphabet.Spend time helping them memorize the name of each letter.
Test their knowledge by showing them a picture of the letter with no pictures associated with it. Once they are able to easily identify each letter, you can move on to teaching sounds.;
, Children have to be able to identify letters before they can learn about the sounds, but once they know their letters it is even more important that they understand what sounds each letter makes.Start with teaching the sound of each consonant letter.
Teach blended sounds (e.g. “br,” “cr,” “fr,” “gr,” etc.)
Teach vowel sounds. It is important to begin with the short vowel sounds (e.g. the “ah” sound as in “apple,” the “eh” sound as in “elephant,” the “ih” sound as in “igloo,” the short “o” sound as in “octopus,” and the “uh” sound as in “umbrella.” When children begin reading and come across a vowel where there is a long sound (e.g. the “u” sound in “universe”). A good way of explaining this is to say, “In this case, the vowel says it’s own name when it is pronounced.”
You can test their knowledge of each letters sounds by showing them a picture of a letter (without any visual cues on the page) and asking them to tell you what sound the letter makes (not the name, just the sound).

, In the very beginning, it is a good idea to assess how well each student can hear the sounds of each letter. Some children have a more difficult time differentiating between phonemes than other students. Take note of students who seem to be struggling and try to spend a bit of extra time with them.A phoneme is the smallest unit of sound that helps us to differentiate between similar words (e.g. between “bad” and “bag).Take note of students who appear to be struggling with identifying different sounds. For example, they may have a difficult time differentiating between sounds that are similar like the sound of “d” and “t.” These children can improve their phonemic awareness, but will need to practice the sounds more than other students.

, Dyslexia is a not uncommon problem for many people, and it is often identified when children begin to learn to read. The brains of dyslexic people process information differently than those who do not have it, and this can make reading a slow and difficult process. If you believe there is a child in your class suffering from dyslexia, it may be wise to refer them to a learning specialist at your school.There are proven methods for teaching children with dyslexia, and depending on the severity, they may need to attend special courses designed for children with dyslexia.
A child who has dyslexia may consistently struggle with learning to identify and sound out letters, and when may shy away from opportunities to sound out a word in front of others for fear of embarrassment.A dyslexic child may or may not mix up letters in words when speaking. For example, saying “mazagine” instead of “magazine.”

, It can be hard for children to visualize the sounds that letters make without having pictures to help them. Look at books together with the children and when you come across a picture of something, ask the children what it is. Then sound out the word slowly, and write the word out. This will help them associate the sounds with letters and pictures.
Try to stick to picture books that have lots of pictures of things that children come across in their everyday lives.
For example, if you come across a picture of a cherry, ask the children what it is. When they say it’s a cherry, ask them to help you sound out the word. Have them do it again, and this time, as you sound out the word, write the letters on the board.

, Once the children have mastered the different sounds of each letter, start showing them very simple words and sentences. Ask them to sounds out the words based on what they already know. Make sure to start with words that aren’t exceptions. For example, “cat,” “dog,” “ball,” etc.Try to make this fun. In order to help them develop their love of reading it is helpful to avoid turning these learning sessions into drills. Invent games that you can play together. For example, don’t just ask the children to sit in front of you and go through a whole stack of flash cards. Instead, make the game fun. Hide cards printed with different words on them around the room. Pass out a corresponding picture to each child and have them find the matching card.
Also take advantage of the various computer games that are available. Many children enjoy these games so they have fun, and improve their reading skills at the same time.

, One of the best ways to help children identify patterns is through learning how to rhyme. Often, all the words that rhyme are called a “word family.” Teaching children to rhyme will also help them recognize that words don’t necessarily have to look the same in order to sound the same.Have children take several pictures of things (with the word printed on the picture too) and group them into their families. They can do this by carefully sounding out the word. For example, if you give them a picture of a mop, have them sound it out. Ask them to find other pictures that sound like “mop” (e.g. “top,” “pop,” “hop,” “stop,” “cop”).

, You should practice reading with your students as often as possible, but keep the learning sessions short. This will help keep children from becoming frustrated and tired. Use picture books with short, easy sentences, and let the children practice sounding out the words. The most important thing you can do is be patient and encouraging. You should never make a child feel stupid for making a mistake as this will discourage them from wanting to read.Practice reading with your students wherever you go. Have them sound out the names of things you see as you go to recess or on field trips. This will keep learning fun and engaging for your students.
Encourage parents to make reading a big part of the child’s life. Suggest that they take children to the library to check out books, and keep them around the house so that children can talk with their families about these books.

, One of the best things you can do to help your students with reading is to get their parents involved. Ask the children’s parents to spend time reading with them at home. Suggest to the parents that they allow their children to get involved in the processing by letting them choose books to read from the library, having them sound out simple words, and identify letters and simple words while reading.

, You can further encourage this by reading to your students when they are with you. Although it is ideal if the parents read to the children, some parents don’t have the time or don’t enjoy reading. Thus, you can make sure that every one of your children gets at least some time reading with an adult.Be sure to let the children pick books that they want to read too. Get them involved in the reading process by having them help you sound out simple words.

, While you are reading to them, encourage them to get involved in the story by asking them questions about what you’ve read.You can ask questions after you finish reading, but you can also stop to ask questions during the story too. For example, ask them what you think the main character should do about a problem they’re having. Ask them at various points throughout the story how they think a character is feeling. For example, are the probably sad, mad, happy, or tired?

, Many children will be interested in learning what something they see every day says. Hang up some bright colorful posters that have a few simple words on them, and help the children learn to read and write these words.It can also be useful to have alphabet posters hung up in the classroom. These alphabet posters often have every letter of the alphabet with pictures that help them understand how the letters are pronounced (e.g. the letter “A” with a picture of an apple).

, Learning to read is a long process. Your students will go from not knowing the letters of the alphabet, to being able to read simple words, and will eventually learn to read whole sentences. Keep this interesting and challenging by having lots of books that vary in difficulty. As the children progress, rotate out some of the easier books, and introduce some more challenging ones.


Introducing new books will get them excited to try something new.

Make it clear that you're the teacher and you'll be doing the teaching (for the most part).,
Don't make constant reminders of your power to them; this will only serve to make them dislike you and they'll spend more time hating you than listening to you.

,
Once you've established that you're in charge, make them forget that; treat them like your equals as much as you can without losing control.,
Be clear and consistent.,
Positive reinforcement is always more effective than punishment (i.e.,
Make them understand; instead of plowing through everything, start each new topic/idea by having them tell you what you should be teaching them.,
Make it fun.,
Make sure you're confident.,
Make the teaching detailed.",How to Teach Just About Anything," That means that you start with purpose and strength, then relax your ""grip"" on the class/students.;
,, Give them some free rein. So, if a side-conversation breaks out that's relevant, let it go and pay attention to it (this will clue anyone who's waiting for you to talk to listen as well). This shows you care about your students' opinions.

, If you've made a mistake, own up. Say everything that's really important twice: This gives anyone who lapsed the first time around a chance to get back into it. (The exception: If they never listen and you're trying to get them to, tell them you're only explaining it once and that after that they have to figure it out for themselves.)

, rewards for good work over punishment for bad)

, This will get them thinking. Ultimately, you want them to continue to learn and understand when you're gone.

, Be one of the crowd, if possible. You can direct conversation and discussion while it works, then stop it and put your own comments in (try to do it as if you're just participating in the discussion.)

, That means when you're imposing order, you are loud and very clear that you're imposing order. When you're not, make it clear that you're ready to loosen up and joke around if they want.

, Ask your students do they understand. If they don't understand, rephrase or/and repeat your lesson. After all, the job of a teacher is to teach their students.

Teach your students how to comprehend what they are reading.,
Ask your students questions about the reading material.,
Clarify and correct students when they give you an incorrect conclusion or answer.,
Discuss and apply the meaning the class has decided belongs to the story.",How to Teach Reading Comprehension,"


Demonstrate how you copy parts of a book you are reading. Write these down on overhead transparencies.
Instruct your students to keep sticky notes close by so, when they make a mental connection in a story you are reading, they can write it down immediately.
Teach your students how to code their notes as t-t, t-s or t-w (text to text, text to self and text to write).
Encourage your students to have sticky notes handy so that, as you read a story to the class, they can write down each connection they make as they listen to you read.
Gather all sticky notes from your students and write them down on a story chart for class discussion.;
,


Show your students how to activate their prior experiences and knowledge so they can make connections relating their past to what they are reading.
Instruct your students to set the purposes in the story--what is happening and why is it happening.
Use a book you are reading and demonstrate how to predict what will happen next.
Work on word and sentence meanings with your class. To comprehend, they need to learn how to ""decode text.""
Instruct your class on summarization--building on prior information from earlier parts in the book so they are able to create meaning for themselves about characters, plot and setting.
Teach your class how to visualize, mentally seeing each character, situation and setting.

,


Monitor their understanding of what is happening in the story.
Keep track of what students are grasping easily and what they are having trouble understanding or comprehending.

,


Review earlier exercises, such as using prior personal knowledge so they connect their experience to what is happening in the book.

, Use their answers to assess their understanding as you talk about the different meanings, predictions and summarizations.

Allot five minutes at the end of the lesson as ""game time"".,
Choose a very simple game first, that only teaches one concept at a time.,
Try to pick a game that matches a concept that the student needs to work on from their practical work.,
Make it short and sweet - a good game is a short game!,
Another idea is to have a ""game of the week"" that is in your studio for the whole week, and you can play it with students who need it.,
Load up some music theory games.",How to Teach Music Theory With Games," The student will start to really look forward to this part of the lesson, and it can really motivate them to excellence.;
, You don't have to teach all aspects of music theory at once! It is better to help them learn and remember one concept, than trying to teach them lots which will just get forgotten. Even if they already know the knowledge the game will still concrete it in their minds.

, It will really help them if for example they are working on a minor key piece and you do a game where they have to make up a minor scale.

, Particularly with young children if you can get them going and get the game done in a few minutes it will work out much better. Don't try to achieve too much, just a quick activity to help them to remember one theory concept is all that is needed.

, You can adapt the level to suit the abilities of the individual students.

, If you have a computer available in your waiting area, you can load up some music theory games and have them play while they wait for your lessons. This can save time in your lessons, but make sure they are supervised when they are starting this activity!

Teach children as much math as you can.,
Teach history and geography to kindergartners.,
Consider teaching with an interdisciplinary approach.",How to Teach Kindergarten,"


Teach the alphabet to kindergartners. Help them to recognize letters' shapes and sounds. Let them know that some letters have different sounds, depending on the way that the letters are said or written.
Expand kindergartners' vocabulary. Introducing kindergartners to new words can help them learn how to express themselves in different ways. It can also improve communication skills.;
,


Show students the importance of books by pointing out all of their physical components and encouraging the respectful handling of them.
Accustom students to the activity of reading by having them follow along during story time. Show them, through finger movements, that you are reading from left to right and from top to bottom. Point to specific words as you read them aloud. Allow them to suggest when a page turn is appropriate.
Encourage critical reading skills by asking kindergarteners about the stories you have read or are reading.

,


Explain nature to students. Describing natural and recurring phenomenon, like seasons and the transitions between day and night, can prepare them to learn more advanced scientific concepts later.
Try to use as many technical terms as you can when discussing scientific concepts. For example, identify planets and dinosaurs by their actual names.

,


Help children understand the concepts of days, weeks, months, and years. You can even use holidays to help them recognize specific months. For instance, when a certain holiday presents itself, you can adorn your classroom with the holiday's decorations and ask kindergartens what month the holiday occurs in and what months preceded and will follow.

,


Teach kindergartners how to recognize numbers and their values. Help them compare numbers by using objects to illustrate their values.
Helping kindergartners understand spacial concepts can also be an important component to teaching math. Describing the sizes, shapes, distances, and relative positions of objects can provide children with the suitable tools with which to identify other similar objects in the future.
The math that you teach kindergarteners is important because it will serve as building blocks for more advanced mathematics in later grades.

,


Use maps, globes, flags, historical stories, and cultural activities to help children recognize the differences between countries. Let students know about important historical events that have occurred around the world and in their own country.

,


Many teachers may find that kindergartners respond favorably to learning when 2 or more subjects are are taught at the same time. For instance, using art to teach students language can result in higher retention rates.

Identify specific learning needs.,
Test for a learning disability.,
Establish your budget.,
List practical needs.",How to Select a Suitable Tutor for Your Teen1," Ask your teen questions about classes, areas of difficulty, and study habits.Discuss learning goals with your teen in order to get them involved in the process and to establish the primary goal of tutoring: are they struggling in one specific subject, with time management, with preparing for a specific test like the SAT or ACT?


Check with a teacher. Tutoring is not only suited for addressing low grades. Look beyond grades to get a full picture of why tutoring may be appropriate. Classroom and study habits may provide important insight into the issues that your teen faces.
A student struggling to keep up with material has different tutoring needs than a student that needs to be challenged. Talk with the student and with teachers to develop a full understanding of the situation.;
, In some cases, a need for tutoring may be connected to a learning disability. The student’s teacher may be able to identify possible problems that your teen faces, or they may be able to suggest an individual screening if it is appropriate.A student with a learning disability may need a specially trained tutor. With proper notice, non-specialists may be successful in one-on-one settings. Do not hide the student’s needs from potential tutors as this will complicate the learning process., If you are hiring a tutor rather than using a public school resource, cost will be an important factor. Typical rates for tutoring vary by location, subject, and experience. Check local tutoring services for their rates before negotiating with independent tutors. Based on your budget, the value of tutoring may or may not match its cost.You can use a salary information website like payscale.com to determine a range for the appropriate hourly rate in your area.

, Determine whether you will need the tutor to provide a meeting place or whether you want a private tutor to conduct sessions in the student’s home. Estimate how frequently and for how long you will need the tutoring service. Only consider candidates that meet these needs."
"
Check your school’s offerings.,
Check tutoring service listings.,
Ask fellow parents for recommendations.,
Look for a retired teacher.",How to Select a Suitable Tutor for Your Teen2," Your teen’s school likely provides some tutoring services and they may have options suitable for your teen’s needs. For high school students, there may be options for tutoring on campus before or after regular school hours. For college students, the school’s Academic Support Center can provide information about available tutoring options. This can be an appealing option as the tutors will be familiar with the specific curriculum of the student’s school and classes.


The No Child Left Behind Act mandates that all qualified public school students in the U.S. have access to supplemental tutoring services. Ask for information about programs that meet this requirement from your school.If the student is homeschooled, check your state’s regulations before hiring a tutor as laws regarding acceptable teachers can vary.For students that do not qualify for supplemental tutoring services, speak with school representatives about additional options. They may keep a list of recommended tutors. The student’s teachers may also know of tutors that they could recommend for your teen.

, If your school does not have a suitable tutor for the student, look through private listings. You can first ask if the school maintains a list of recommended private tutors, or you can use an internet search engine to find tutoring companies in your area. Alternately, you can check local classified listings. Private tutoring services can connect you with vetted tutors and simplify the selection process for you.


Kaplan (http://kaplan.com) and the Princeton Review (http://www.princetonreview.com) are recognized companies for ACT and SAT test preparation classes.
The National Tutoring Association (http://www.ntatutor.com/find-a-nta-certified-tutor.html) and American Tutoring Association (http://www.americantutoringassociation.org/?action=search) both allow you to search their certified tutors by region.

, A satisfied customer may be willing to connect you with the tutor that they hired. This path can ease the selection process as you can confirm both the quality of the tutor’s work and their familiarity with the material that your teen is studying. Ask about the subjects covered, the student’s needs, and the tutor’s methods to get a sense for whether their tutor may be a match for your teen.


Some people may be sensitive about working with a tutor. Don’t ask about tutoring experiences publically. Accept that some parents or students may not want to talk with you about hiring a tutor.

, A former teacher can be an excellent choice for private tutoring as they will be trained and experienced in reaching a variety of students. They may also have connections at the student’s school and understand the specific challenges that they face. A retired teacher’s experience is valuable, so it likely that they will be expensive.

Determine the right personality for your teen.,
Review candidates’ tutoring styles.,
Check references.,
Match a student’s behavior to a suitable tutor.,
Assess progress.",How to Select a Suitable Tutor for Your Teen3," Ask the student what type of person they would feel comfortable working with. Establish what learning styles they are comfortable using. Likewise, determine if there is a type of person that they might find difficult to work with. There may not be one ideal type of tutor for your teen, but you can still establish important preferences and parameters.


Some teens will respond best to someone who is only one level ahead of them in school. A high school student may be an effective and affordable option to work with a middle-school student. A school employment office may have contacts for these tutors, or you can look for postings on local community listings.

, A good tutor will be able to explain what they do and why. Ask questions that will establish if their approach fits your student’s needs and preferences. This can be an open discussion in which you provide context for the tutor and they adjust their plan for the specific needs of the student.


Establish fundamental points such as whether tutoring is one-on-one or done in groups, how the tutor would deal with the specific student’s needs, and how much experience they have., An established tutor will be able to name satisfied customers. If you found the tutor through the recommendation of other students in your area, mention the good word of mouth and ask if they can provide an additional reference. If the tutor has few references, ask whether they have any relevant certifications.

, If you expect that your teen will be uncooperative, look for a more experienced tutor. A teen who is motivated and disciplined will work well with an enthusiastic tutor, even if they are less experienced. A shy teenager may not work well with an outgoing tutor, but a teenager with a high need for attention may thrive with an outgoing tutor who takes a personal interest in their progress.


A student who challenges ideas and authority needs a confident tutor who can respond without feeling threatened. Ask a potential tutor what strategies they use to respond to difficult students., Positive results of tutoring will not always show immediately, so it is important to check that the working relationship between the student and tutor is good. Discuss reasonable goals with the tutor, check progress regularly, and ask how you can contribute to your teen’s learning.A student that is struggling academically may express frustration with tutoring sessions. If your teen complains, determine whether their frustration stems from the difficulty of the material, or from a conflict with their tutor. A good connection between a tutor and student takes time to develop, but do not ignore interpersonal conflicts.

Reflect.",How to Teach," These include reading and essential math skills used in many other subjects. Prioritize crucial lessons. Think about what skills your students will need to employ in order to make it through elementary and secondary school, be ready for higher education and progress onward throughout their lives. Think about the skills you use as an adult, such as good communication skills, including questioning and courageous speaking skills, and finding/looking up what you need to know. Plan and follow through on ways to build those skills in your students. These should be skills which students will need to function in various areas of life.;
, Encourage not only following learned processes and procedures, but also to find ways to use initiative, self-expression within guidelines -- without being unruly or disruptive. Once the crucial skills have been identified, consider complementary skills for happy, productive lives. Praise and place value on their using creative skills and problem solving, being opportunity makers and help them be providers of interesting questions and giving answers and information in class.

Give them crucial emotional outlets including participating at their age level in arts, music and expression as a creator and a performer, not only being a spectator.







, It’s not just academic skills which make people more functional, self-actualizing human beings. Apply techniques in your classroom to help students develop self-confidence, overcome shyness/""stage fright"" by many steps, building self-esteem one effort at a time, coping with stress and disappointment (not just taking the easy escape), learning to not be overly defensive. They need to learn to accept reality without embarrassment by encouraging their efforts and trying again, and not unfairly blaming others for difficulties. They need ways to interact, being inclusive of other students needs, and productive coordination with others.

, Once you’ve identified the major skills which your students will need to succeed in life, determine some goals based on those skills. If you have a bunch of kindergarteners who will eventually need to read, for example, you want them to know their alphabet, the basic sounds of some special letters, and also be able to recognize simple sight words (eventually you can get around to advanced ideas such as: c in cat sounds like ""k"" -- ""keh"", and an example of k might be ""keep"". But c in ceiling sounds like ""s"" -- ""sss"", an exciting example of s might be ""snake""/pronounce the ""sssnake"" and show them the ""ssss"" of a ""hissing snake"" -- but do not mention it so soon as to confuse the idea of phonics).

, Once you know what your general goals are for the class, think of specific goals which will serve to show you that those overall goals have been met. Have your kindergarteners from the previous step be able to read and write the alphabet forwards and backwards and read basic three letter words, for example.

, Now that you know what you want your students to be able to do, outline the smaller skills which be necessary to get them to those larger goals. These will be mini-goals and will serve as a road map. With the kindergarteners, an example of these mini-goals would be learning each individual letter, learning to identify compound sounds, and then learning how to string sounds together.

, Now that you have your educational roadmap, make a lesson plan which specifically lists how you will get them to each step in that road. Every skill that will need to be mastered in order to get them between those mini-goals will need to be planned and written down.

, When making your lesson plan, keep learning styles in mind. Every student learns differently and if you want your whole class to have equal opportunity for success, you will need to accommodate these. Plan to use sound, visuals, manipulatives, physical activity and the written materials along with your student centered lessons for facilitating, introducing, modeling, giving guided practice and periodic homework all for each subject, whenever possible.

, If you are in an environment where you can interrelate subject matters, such as science and math or English and history, do some of that. This will help students understand how information is applied and is more related to the situations they will encounter in the real world. Life is not broken up into class subjects, after all. Find ways that you can collaborate with other teachers to provide your students with engaging, integrative lessons.

, Introduce as many visual aids as possible into your lessons. This is not only for social studies, math, earth, physical, chemical, biological and social sciences. Social studies and many science related classes can use graphs, charts, maps, the globe, photos, movies and timelines -- such is true for their history and government studies. Certainly, math can involve grouping, recognizing changing patterns in sequences of numbers, contextual clues and shapes, with mathematical modeling often including formulas, graphic representations, diagrams, charts, ""mappings of data"" by various kinds of graphs. Also, collecting, organizing and presenting data can show the student how data is used in all kinds of subjects. Such things will give students more concrete experience, non-linear, multiple forms of applications/uses of data, visualizations, images and examples of the things which you are discussing. Complex concepts are often difficult to imagine and having a chart, an image to work, a choice of techniques, or an understandable formula will help many students stay engaged with the material, rather than tuning out because they can’t follow a dry, linear discussion.

, Generally, it is better to never lecture for more than 15 minutes at a time. Besides reading, writing and written activities. You will want to often be getting your students active in the material and learning process. You can do this by having hands-on learning opportunities like learning activities (don't call them games), peer-to-peer discussions, or question and answer time (where either you ask the questions or they do).

, How? Create a variety of ways to use questions and answer/discussion sessions. One basic is keeping all students ""on-deck"" in the batters circle, so anyone may be the next one ""up to bat"". This will keep students from tuning out while others engage.


One method would be to keep a jar with student’s names written on a popsicle stick. Pull from the jar at random and the student will be required to either ask a pertinent question or answer one.
Wait for the answer. Count to four to remind yourself to wait, when you use open questions where anybody can volunteer to ask or answer them. Avoid giving in to the urge to jump in to answer your question or to finish their answer. Draw out important issues from them. Don't to quickly rescue the student, allow them to answer deliberately, not freaking them out by pressure or showing how smart you are. You defeat their motivation if you have to wow them as a genius/expert.
Class wide actions such as getting quiet when asked, ready to go to lunch or putting away one/getting another kind of book and materials can be time to utilize a classroom scoreboard with positive and negative marks that can lead to a reward or penalty for the whole group.

, Since the point of learning is to gain real-world skills, you will want to constantly relate the skills and information in your class to the student’s lives and things which will affect them in the future.Students should never question why they need to learn the material they are learning and if you can’t come up with a real-world example then maybe you shouldn’t be teaching it.


Math skills should be related back to things like paying bills, getting a good mortgage, and future work tasks, such as: choices of fields such as futures involving more and more technologies, and of course inspire dreams of engineering and architecture, etc. English skills can be used to write stories, books, business reports, personal and business letters, resumes, cover letters or grant proposals. Science skills can be used to understand electrical motors, electronics, the solar system and universe, chemicals, fix clogged sinks or evaluate illnesses. History and social studies skills can be used to understand civilization, community and government, determine political values and voting decisions. Sociology skills can be used to help hypothetical family, future children, friends, or strangers.

, This isn’t just about getting them active or getting them out in the sun (although those are good things!). The point of going to school isn’t only to build skills for passing some test, it’s important to teach people how to adapt, grow and live better in the real world. Get them out of the classroom to put their skills to use such as collecting information, going to the library to do research. Get students to interview someone for information about a profession or skill.


Take a science class to the beach to identify animals and plant life or geological features. Take an English class to an early-stage play rehearsal, so that they can see how dialogue choices and changes affect perception of events and characters. Take a history class to interview nursing home residents or a sociology class to interview prison inmates.

, Allow for creative interpretations of assignments. Allow students to pose questions and follow other routes. Letting them guide their own learning will help them learn better and keep them interested in what they’re doing.


For example, in a lab experiment about putting mice in mazes, if your student suddenly wonders what would happen, if mirrors were introduced into the maze, let them do that. An assignment does not have to be strictly adhered to in order for students to gain valuable knowledge from it.

, Success fosters/breeds success. Let your students make new designs and create things. Give them broad assignments with specific goals and let them come to their own method of reaching that goal. This will let them create a relevant learning design and personal method which is best suited to their style and interests, keeping them invested in the assignment and encouraging daily progress (which is success).


For example, you can have an occasional English assignment where a student must write a certain number of words on a particular, broad topic. However, tell them that how those words are arranged and presented is entirely up to them. They can make a comic, write a song, write and do a stand-up routine, write an essay, make a poster or a presentation... anything that speaks to and engages them in their interests, being relevant.

, While students are working on assignments in class or engaging in other methods of independent study in the classroom, you will want to go around the room and engage them about what they are doing. Ask how things are going. Don’t just ask what’s wrong, ask what they feel they are understanding really well too. Get more out of them than “I’m doing fine” or “Everything’s okay”. You can even ask them to explain what they are doing or what their understanding of the assignment is.

, After an assignment, look at the overall performance of the class. Identify common problems or potentially common problems and discuss these. Talk about why the mistake is easy to make and how to identify the problem. Talk about how it’s fixed or a better approach. Understanding a problem beyond “this is wrong and this is right” will give students much stronger abilities to problem solve later.

, Don’t cover something at the beginning of the year and never talk about it again. Constantly tie new material to the skills established in previous lessons. This will solidify and reinforce the skills that a student has gained, much like learning a language requires study every day.


For example, an English lesson on writing argumentative papers may want to draw on the skills learned earlier regarding narrative works by discussing how one can use stories within argumentative papers to make emotional appeals or how voice can affect a reader’s perception of information.

, Have you ever had a test which was way too easy to fail or a final which was almost exclusively material covered in the last three days of class, rather than material covered over the whole semester? These experiences will help you understand why it’s important to balance your tests. Draw material as is appropriate for the significance of the test and weight it such that it will not make or break a student’s grade. Not everyone tests well.

, Standard tests can be a very inaccurate method of gauging student’s mastery of the material. Very intelligent, successful students can be terrible at taking tests and students who otherwise absorb material very poorly can be excellent test takers. Devise alternative methods which do not put so much pressure on students to succeed in very specific ways.


Consider educative evaluation, rather than auditive. Ask your students to devise a real world scenario in which they would use the skills they’ve learned and ask them to write a paper or prepare a presentation explaining how they would handle the situation. This reinforces their skills and gives them the opportunity to show that they not only understood the material itself but that they also understood the significance.

, Public speaking is an important skill, to be sure. However, not everyone learns this by being put on the spot. Work your students up to full-class presentations in order to not only evaluate the extent to which they’ve learned the material but also give them the ability to learn valuable public speaking skills. Once they’ve mastered these easier presentations, you can have full class presentations and see how they fare.


You can have students give a presentation, individually, to just you, one by one while others are working on a written assignment that they can do without much help other than an introduction and example. This presentation can be conducted like an interview. Prompting will make them less self-conscious, which should allow them to build presentation skills much more efficiently than immersion into a comprehensive report. It will also give you the opportunity to ask key questions to gauge how well they’ve organized their understandings and learned to apply the material.You can also have them give presentations to their peers, later in the course. They can go one-on-one with peers, as they just did with you, or you can have them go in front of a small panel of their peers, in an organized group process. Have the class students come up with a list of questions beforehand, which will also serve as a learning experience and way for them to demonstrate that they understand the material and evaluate fellow students presentations.

, Create a list of acceptable rewards for excellent performance, either for individual students or the class as a whole, and let your students communally decide how they want to be rewarded. This will help make sure that the reward is an actual incentive, rather than just something you’ve pushed on them that doesn't motivate them to work harder., Build individual growth in ""Ah Hah! moments"" made through calm or exciting experience, deliberate organizing and sometimes by interesting experiments. Don’t see failure, see opportunity to advance by increments/steps. Don’t say “wrong!” Say “hey"", ""close” or “hmm, yeah, that's an idea”, ""how about other ideas?"", ""who tried another way?"". When a student has made a mistake, don’t portray it as a tragic comedy or failure. Don’t let them say it was bad but ""a reason see what may work."" Say and show that ""this is a learning experience""; we want to see how ""incorrect or correct results can be achieved"". Gently show them how to do it correctly, and ask ""now, try again."". Remember that a skill learned through trial and error will be much stronger than one which a student may simply get right by accident/guess -- through means they don’t fully understand.

, Promote the success of individual students to benefit the class as a whole and also teams within the class. Traditional learning environments tend to create a system where under-performing students are jealous of those who don’t struggle (the stigmatizing of nerds by envious comparison). You want to create an environment in which students want to work as a united whole and which does not stigmatize or over-blow obvious of success. Quick/sharp students can help others by setting good example, being patient and encouraging of the not so quick students -- . Sometimes more deliberate/slower students are strong as a big truck while others are like sports cars, but powerful trucks draw less biting remarks, not seeming as geeky. Rewarding the group will make your students much more functional adults and prepare them for real world work environments where developing as leaders and ""strong"" workers can help the team meet deadlines and achieve production goals.


For example, create a system in which for each student that scores perfectly on a test, everyone is rewarded. You can give everyone a few points of extra credit or poll the students to find out if they’d prefer a different reward. This encourages them to work together to achieve better results and endears higher performing students to their peers.

, Acknowledge and appreciate each student individually, for the qualities which make them unique and wonderful human beings. Encourage those qualities. You should also make each student feel like they have something to offer and contribute. This will raise their confidence and help them to find their proper path in life.

, Even if students make only occasional, small efforts, those efforts need to be acknowledged and appreciated. Tell them when they’ve done a good job, individually, and mean it. Don’t be patronizing, be appreciative. If they’ve worked particularly hard, reward them. A student who’s managed to raise their grade from a D to a B+, for example, may have earned the right to pump their grade to an A with “extra credit” for the magnificent amount of work that would have been required to accomplish such a feat.

, It is extremely important to respect your students. It doesn’t matter if they’re graduate students working on a doctoral thesis or kindergartners: treat them like intelligent, capable human beings. Respect that they have ideas, emotions, and lives that extend beyond your classroom. Treat them with dignity and they will extend the same to you.

, Ask your students for feedback to get their (often very astute) perception of what’s going right and what’s going wrong in the classroom. You can ask them personally or you can create anonymous questionnaires in order to get their ideas on how things are going.

, You can ask your students parents for feedback as well. Maybe they’ve noticed an improvement in their child’s abilities, confidence level, or social skills. Maybe they’ve noticed a drop. Getting this outside perspective can help you make sure that the improvements you notice inside the classroom continue outside, as well as helping to catch problems that maybe you don’t get to see.

, If you are a teacher at a school, ask the principal or a more experienced teacher to come in and observe you work. Getting their outside perspective will help you, but remember to be open to criticism.

, Read the latest journals and papers from conferences to keep up with the most innovative methods and new ideas regarding technique. This will help keep you from falling behind in your methods.

, Take classes at a local community college or university to keep your skills fresh. These will remind you of techniques you’ve forgotten or strategies that you tend to leave out.

, Watch not only those that are known to be good at their craft but also those that struggle. Look for why the good things are good and the bad things are bad. Take notes and employ what you learn in your own classroom.

, At the end of a day/lesson/teaching cycle reflect on what you've done with your class. What you did best. What you didn't do well enough and can do better. What you should not repeat again.

Check if you're creative.,
Know what they need.,
Study your students.,
Vary and rotate the lesson tools.,
Change the environment.,
Admit mistakes.,
Break your lessons into, your time > their time > lesson time.",How to Teach Creatively," You need to tap your creativity first, only then will it flow into your classroom and finally reach your students. Know your lessons and how far out of the box can the lessons go e.g. Numbers: Games, algorithms, Sudoku Language: History, re-enactment, stories, role-playing.;
, Be aware of the level you are teaching and the absorption of information according to age:


Kindergarten: Attracted to vibrant colors & huge fonts, high absorption of information
Elementary: Learning curve, fill them with more information in a 50 % text/ 50% pictorial method
Secondary: Chances are they know what you’re saying, but there are many things that they could be ignorant on, tap on that. Study the style of each student, cater accordingly. You must always be more knowledgeable than them to awe them.

, Remember names, start with ambitions, their level of understanding and compliment them. Talk on their likes/dislikes. Study their character. e.g. If the student is a quiet one, make him answer some questions moderately (else you may be mistaken to pick on him), joke about, make him feel safe to share his thoughts.


The chatterboxes: Play along with them, divert their conversation to the topic, let them get excited and bring them back to the classroom topic.
The sleepy ones: Ask them why they are sleepy, if reasonable, let them sleep, for 5 minutes and let them be fresh for the rest of the session. (You will be respected and appreciated by some students at the same time. The lesson goes through amazingly well when the student is done with his power nap.)

, Make them become teacher for one day – this helps them get rid of fear of getting attention. Next, use pictures/puzzles/out of the box activities to make them alert. Have competition/quizzes/tests to let them be the winner. Mix & match the lessons, so that it is not too paper–centric/rigid. Connect lessons with their likes and dislikes. Challenge their level, tease their ego a bit to make self-initiate them to improve themselves

, Change the classroom environment: change seats every week, just for one lesson. Have fun making seats face each other or in a circle – focus on you being able to reach out to ALL students, no one sits in a corner where you can't go near them or catch them dozing away. Say please and thank you if they rebel – feed them compliments later on.

, If you wet their books in the rain, admit your fault, and buy them new books. You become a step closer to them – make a connection then. Maintain your integrity and always be humble to your students. Be assertive to those who are stubborn or if they rebel too much, focus on those who require your attention. Ignorance is bliss for that day.

, If it’s language, try explaining in local language, slowly (after a month) mention that they should start converse in that language and finally (the next month) give them small penalty if they do not speak in the language taught. (Fun and interesting way of punishing, it should never embarrass the students). If it’s numbers, try to experiment with the speed level of each students.

Attend school district training to get copies of teaching suggestions and example assignments for the the first unit.,
Use the school district's scope and sequence materials or manual which tells you what to teach and when, and how many days to spend on various topics.,
Read over the publisher's similar kind of scope and sequence, which goes straight through the book and has some ""extra"" materials.

,
Prepare or obtain a syllabus to give to the students that covers the subject.

,
Make a lesson plan.,
Teach students using algebra concepts that are well ordered and clarified.,
Do not ""teach the book""; rather, teach the students the key concepts and expand on them.,
Lecture less, but guide and facilitate more.,
Use math vocabulary all the time with some restating using simpler terms, but not just the simple words, so students will know that you think the vocabulary is important.

,
Teach algebraic thinking, using multiple representations: using patterns of growth or decay, using data, visual sketch, graphing, and expressing either a relation or a function.

,
Explore examples of math in the real world (slope, roof pitch, percent hill grades) and other of such things also in everyday life (area, volume, cubic yards of soil, sand or concrete) and in sports (statistics), math that is used for various jobs, etc.

,
Have answers when some students argue that math is useless and doesn't have anything to do with everyday life.,
Motivate students to do homework, by using it as a small part of the grade.,
Use “hands-on” activities planned for each major unit.,
Test only what is taught.,
Reteach with a review and retest if needed, but do it while trying to keep making some progress on new materials.

,

Post just a few class rules, about 5 or 6, not twenty.,
Teach classroom procedures for daily events such as roll call and tardies that do not take much time.,
Calculators can be a help or a hindrance, and are useful, but some uses of the calculator are too advanced while students are learning the basic principles.

,
Check out and get back calculators which will require a carefully planned and executed system to be accountable.,
Teach from bell to bell, of course that includes guided practice -- but does not mean long lectures.",How to Teach Algebra," Often algebra will receive more assignments from the district math consultants (they're not strictly supervisors, but advisers of sorts) as some kind of academic math coordinators, or services persons.

,


Realize that the district produced scope and sequence usually does not go straight through the book and has extra assignments, that may not need.

,,, Introduce the topic, demonstrate, use student centered guided practice in classroom work sessions; perhaps using groups may work for you.

, Review and reteach a little bit each day, which can be woven into the introduction of each days topic; perhaps, you use a strategy somewhat like the following:


""As we saw yesterday this is _____ and recently this was ____ like ____"". and then:
""Today we are extending those ideas into _____"". ""For example: _______...""
""We'll do some guided practice; now here is that assignment: ____.""
""You will get into groups for this ____."" (sometimes for appropriately complex kinds of work, such as to: produce a pattern, a sketch, a chart, list of x,y data a co-ordinates, a description, an expression, or an equation, a relation, or a function, etc.).

, While the text is an important tool and reference, you'll want to ""unlock the topic"" and teach the students through your own knowledge of the subject, using the book for some materials, lessons and as a guide, source of many problems and exercises for assignments.

, Use some special real world activity for each unit which may gather data, sometimes surveying or doing some kinds of experiments.

,,,, Say that:


""It helps you have options/choices in life, including college. You have to take one or two math courses for almost any degree in college.""
""It is needed in the military to pass tests for technical work.""

""You never know whether you will end up in some kind of technical work where math is needed.""


""You will need math to help your children and grandchildren with their school lessons.""
""Math describes the real world with stunning accuracy using repeatable methods. In the words of Galileo, 'Mathematics is the language with which God has written the universe.'""
""Math is fundamentally the study of patterns, many of which are beautiful in themselves. Sometimes, math is useful much as art is useful.

, Some small extra credit homework system may help.

, Math needs to not only be abstract, but practical. Engage students in learning by providing manipulative activities that get students moving about, or manipulating math objects.


Use a classroom “algebra-football field” to have the students walk through to explain the movements on a number line and for graphing of positive and negative integers (zero at what would usually be the 50 yard line) or make quadrants, with (0,0) at the origin, etc.
Get someone to demo a graph, by shaping the arms, or tilting their arms to show slope. At the front of the room, so that some do not see it backward.

, Make students accountable by testing as needed and as required by the school district and by the state. Also, occasionally use some short quizzes.

,, or the ""I got it!"" Also, praise positive actions saying, ""This is so cool! It's great. Hey, everybody is on task, being productive, practicing!


Keep being enthusiastic and showing joy about the students and math: ""Yeah, you got it"" ""All right!"" ""Yeah!""
Be on! Be kind, and cleverly clap and say ""Wow!"" about the class getting it. Let students see, hear and believe that math is especially cool, exciting and fun -- to you (don't ever act like you're a substitute teacher, going through the motions. Do ""not"" say that you are ""bored, hating school, or dull"").

Represent, sale and promote school and the subject.



, Tell them that you will decide questions about rules, but that you try to be consistent and fair.;
, Restrict hall passes to urgent use, not for going to lockers and such.


Teach management processes as they come up, such as: how group-work is conducted, papers are to show work, papers are to be headed and turned in, and so on -- all these are procedures, not rules.

,,


Use a visual check at a glance that proves that the calculators are all there. Just keeping them in an ordinary box is not effective.

One system is a hanging set of shallow pockets so that the screen shows above the pocket (this can be ordered on the internet) where the calculator covers are removed and put away, or someone may swipe calculators and leave only the covers, and it is not obvious at a glance.
Another system is a box with 30 to 40 numbered slots.



, Involve the students in math. That also means no free time and no free class periods in general.


You can have an in class math project (perhaps in groups) with gathering data and posters for exhibit, for something ""fun"" and engaging.

Reward points for a full complete journal.",How to Make a Flour Sack Baby Project," Choose if the project should concentrate on five pound bags or if you are wanting to include two pound bags.

It's appropriate to include both weights, however, it's suggestible to deduct points if a student chooses the smaller weight for the project.;
, Many students tend to cheat with the weight issue either as soon as they get the bag or throughout the project.

No covering: You run into the risk of students attempting to poke holes in order to lessen the weight, however, you may counteract this by weighing the bags at the start, middle, and end of the project.
Covering: The most popular method to use is double pantyhose. Tie the ends at the top and allow students to create their own baby hair and appearance.

, Develop a plan between you and your students for them to check-in with you in the middle of the night. This is to ensure that, like actual parents, they are ""awake in the middle of the night"".

You may either choose between phone messages or emails for this check-in.
Students must check-in between a specific time during in the middle of the night, for example, between 3 and 4 am. Avoid giving any midnight check-ins due to the easiness of students checking in before they go to bed.
They must leave their name and baby's name in the message.
You can merit points for the calls, as it can count towards the final total or extra points on the side.

, To avoid any circumvention during the project, for example, a student loses, misplaces, or damages the original package and attempts to get a new one at the last minute, either hand initial or stamp the bottom of each bag.

Inform the students that this mark is the only valid mark allowed on the entire bag for this purpose. If the original bag is drawn on (such as mock tattoos, piercings, etc) or tampered with, points could be deducted.

, You may also print out computer created chart templates, make copies, and staple them for each student., Make different sections in the journal regarding each flour baby.

Information: Allow students to create a their own baby's identification. Names must be authentic and proper, birthplaces must be real, and date of birth must be when the project has started.
Timeline: Have the students log what they did per hour, including sleep, verbal check-in times, actual school classes, after school activities, social time with friends, meals for themselves and their babies. If the student had any socializing, they must write details on where their flour baby was at the time.

, Students should be able to produce an up-to-date journal, even during a surprise check., Compose rules that students will need to abide by while in and around school and other classes.

No flour babies are to be in school bags and/or lockers. They must be in the open air at all times, whether a person is carrying it, on their desk, or in their lap.
No student on campus can babysit nor store another student's flour baby for them.
Students caught without their baby will have points deduced.
Other students and/or teachers can report for improper caring.
Points can be deduced for improper caring.

,

Each student can allow one non-student to ""watch"" the baby for a specific time limit once a day.
Each time someone else babysits, they must sign a slip stating that it has happened.
Students must log in their journal when the babysitting has occurred for all time slots.

, Each student can present an essay format paper about the project.

How easy or difficult was the overall project.
How this project would influence them on raising an actual baby.
Any moments while taking care of the flour baby.

, By the end of the week, each flour should be exactly the same weight as they were when they were distributed or assigned., If you have decided to initial or stamp the packages, merit points for the same package being presented., Any damage, including marks, rips, holes, etc should result in point deduction., All time logs should be completed up to the class time of turning the project in."

Determine what you have.,
Collect as many books as possible.,
Install half shelves for small children.,
Install vertical shelving for small areas.,
Use bins for children's books.",How to Organize a Classroom Library1," Before you start labeling shelves and bins, you'll want to figure out exactly what you have. Put all your books together in one area, and sort them into overall categories.Sort your books into 3 main categories: books to use now, books to store for later, and books to give away.;
, Get Books. Visit a few yard sales, and buy boxes of books in bulk.


Cover a wide range of subjects, including fiction and non-fiction titles.
Register with an educational publisher. If you aren't a teacher, try to find a teacher from your school who already has an account.
Ask school librarians if they have any superfluous books that they plan to get rid of.
Contact your local city library. Many branches hold an annual book sale.
Check online for used children's books. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and thriftbooks.com all carry discounted used books. Half-price books is place you can find good bargains.
Purchase duplicate copies of popular books.

, For an elementary school reading library, shelves with only two rows are best. You can use the top of the shelf for display items, and the children will be able to reach al the books.Use half shelves to section off one portion of the classroom for quiet reading time. You'll be able to see over the shelves easily, so you can watch over the kids using the area.

, If you have a limited area to work with, consider tall, slender shelving units. Alternatively, you can use revolving racks that house a large number of books in a small area., Books for small children are often oversized, so they may not fit on regular book shelves. They are also usually slender books, so it can be difficult to read the titles on the spines. A system of storage bins works much better for these, and the kids will find it easier to access them.

"
"
Sort books by reading level.,
Sort non-fiction books by topic.,
Sort fiction books by author.,
Label the shelves.,
Label the bins.,
Label the books.",How to Organize a Classroom Library2," If children of various ages will be using your library, sort books by grade level and shelve all the books in each reading level in its own area of the library. This will make it easier for kids to find books that are appropriate for their age group.


Choose a particular color code for each reading level, and buy labels in that color.
For example, print yellow labels for all books for Grades K-2, blue labels for Grades 3-6, etc.

, Choose a specific color for non-fiction labels, that is different from any you are using in the fiction section. Come up with a system for sorting these books, and file them according to main topic.


A sample breakdown might be: Animals, Biography/People, Science, Languages, Travel/Places, History,
For example, Ancient Egypt by George Hart would have a green label reading “TRAVEL/PLACES.”

, Print labels with “FICTION” on the first line, and the first letter of the author's last name on the second line. Use the label color appropriate to the reading level or age group of the book in question.


For example, the book Oh, the Places You'll Go by Dr. Seuss would have a yellow label (indicating a reading level of K-2) that reads, “FICTION – S”

Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery by James Howe would have a blue label (indicating a reading level of Ages 8-12) that reads, “FICTION – H”

, Print the individual codes onto labels. Label each shelf with a color-coded sticker that matches the labels on the books.


For example, a fiction shelf containing books for ages 8-12 that have authors with names starting with A through F would have a blue label reading, “FICTION, A-F”

, Buy bins in different colors, to match the labels on the books they contain. A yellow bin labeled “A – F” would hold books appropriate for ages K-2 written by authors with last names starting with A-F.
If you are using baskets, stick the labels on small pieces of cardboard and hang them on the basket using metal rings. (You can buy a box of metal book rings at an office or teachers' supply store.)

, Once your books are sorted into categories and assigned to a particular shelf or bin, you'll need to label them.Consider color-coding your labels to match color-coded labels on the bins – each category gets its own color.
Include any relevant information on the label that will help you shelve it more quickly. You could include the author, the category, and the basket or bin number it goes in.

"
"
Train your kids to use the system.,
Display books to generate interest.,
Create a system for checking out books.",How to Organize a Classroom Library3," Teach your students how to read the labels. Show them how to match the book's label to the bin's label and to always return their books to the correct bins. Over time students will warn you when a book is in the wrong bin.


If you are working with young children that still struggle with the order of letters in the alphabet, you might label the bins “FICTION / A – B – C – D – E – F” rather than “FICTION / A-F.” The children will be able to match the letter on the book spine label to one of the letters on the bin label.

, Choose a few books to display on top of the shelves or on a special rack. An entire library of books to choose from can be intimidating for some children. Keeping a few select books out in the open will encourage them to read more.Highlight books on topics you're teaching in class at the moment.
When you add books to the library, display them prominently and identify them as “new.”

, If you allow your students to take books home, be sure to keep track of them. It's easy for a library book to get mixed in with a kid's other books at home. You may need to remind children once a week or so to return any books they have at home.


Keep a pad of paper on a clip board in the library. When a child “checks out” a book, write their name down along with the date, the name of the book, and the information on the book's shelving label.
Cross out the entry when the book is returned, and note the return date. You might also record your initials if more than one teacher or adult will using the library.
If a book has been at a particular child's home for a long period of time, send a note home to the parents asking them to return it.

Buy a scanner.,
Try the Book Retriever app.,
Check out Classroom Organizer.",How to Organize a Classroom Library4," Smart scanners such as the IntelliScanner help you organize your books. These devices scan the bar code on the back cover, and record all the information it contains such as title, author, release date, publisher, number of pages, and genre.Scan the bar code on the book cover.
Add information to your computer files that directly relates to your own library: reading level, purchase date, shelf or bin location.
Print out a complete list, which can be sorted in various ways to display books by reading level, genre, or topic. The list also shows a thumbnail image of the book cover.
Make your list available to students, your kids, or other teachers – anyone who will be using your library.
Use your Intelliscanner to create barcode labels that you can put on your books.

, The Classroom Library Company makes the Book Retriever app, which contains a database of over 135,000 books in various age groups. It has a number of tools to help organize your library.Scans the barcodes on your books, and add titles manually if they aren't in the database.
Features a list of popular titles for each month that you can use to choose display items.

, With this web based program, you can organize your library for free. You can enter information on your books and your students, and design a check-out system to help you track which books are out and who has them."
"
Use a word-processing program on your computer.,
Include all of the relevant details for the activity.,
Create a line for the parent or guardian to give explicit permission.,
Include space for medical details.,
Add an emergency contact option.,
Ask for the parent or guardian's signature.",How to Make a Permission Slip1," You can type up your permission slips using a program like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, or Pages. For most cases, use a clear and standard font such as Times New Roman or Arial in size 11 or 12.;
, Answer all the questions that pertain to the specific activity. These could include: who, what, when, where, why, how much, as well as the means of transportation. This information, which summarizes the trip, should be at the top of the document. Here is an example of how these questions can be answered in the permission slip:Who: Mrs. Tucker’s English class
What: The class will be taking a trip to the Alberta Street Library.
When: 8:30am - 11:30am, Friday, May 10th, 2019
Where: The Alberta Street Library
Why: The class will be going to take a tour of the library.
Cost: No cost
Means of Transportation: We will take a school bus.

, You need to have a statement where the parent or guardian writes that they give permission for their child to take the trip. Here is an example of this line: I, (parent or guardian’s name), give permission for my child, (child’s name), to attend the field trip to (location of field trip) with (organization or adult’s name who is leading the trip).

, If a child has specific allergies or a medical condition, or if the trip is over an extended period of time, include space for the parent or guardian to give information about allergies and medical conditions.


Write this as, “Relevant Allergies/Medical Conditions:_________.”

, Create a line for an emergency contact phone number on the slip. This is the person that can be called if something happens to the child and their parent or guardian can't be reached.You can write ""Emergency Contact Name: _________"" and ""Emergency Contact Phone Number: _________.""

, Perhaps the most important part of the permission slip is the parent or guardian’s signature. At the bottom of all the information about the trip, the parent or guardian needs to sign the paper! Write “Parent or Guardian Signature: _________” at the bottom of the slip."
"
Include information about alternative activities.,
Give instructions for how to pay.,
Leave space for comments.,
Frame the slip as a letter.",How to Make a Permission Slip2," You may want to include information about alternative activities, in case a parent or guardian does not want their child to participate in the activity. For example, if the parent or guardian does not want their child to go on a trip, what will the child do instead? If there is an in-class activity that involves eating cake, what can a child do or eat if they are not permitted to have cake?

, If the activity requires the parent or guardian to give money, include both the cost as well as how the cost can be paid. For example, you can write, “Please send cash or check to school with your child. Checks can be made payable to (institution or teacher’s name).”Also, include the deadline that the cost needs to be paid by, if it is different than the date of the activity or field trip.

, At the bottom of the permission slip, you can write “Special Comments or Instructions: _________.” This gives the parent or guardian space to include anything that you may not have explicitly asked for.

, You can also write permission slips in a letter format. Start the slip with “Dear (parent or guardian)”. Use a friendly tone, include all relevant details in sentence format, and close the letter with a comment that invites further communication. For example, you can write, “If you have any questions or would like further information, don't hesitate to reach out.”

Distinguish between adjectives and adverbs.,
Add the suffix -mente to adjectives.,
Recognize simple adverbs.,
Practice pronunciation of the adverb form.",How to Use Adverbs in Spanish1," Spanish adjectives can be more complicated to use than adverbs. Adjectives must agree with the gender of the noun they describe, and can be either singular or plural. Adverbs always stay the same, regardless of whether they modify an adjective or a verb.For example, if you were talking about ""beautiful girls"" in Spanish, you would say las chicas bellas (lahs CHEE-kas BELL-ahs). Note that the adjective, bellas, is both plural and feminine. However, if you added an adverb, it wouldn't change at all. ""Absolutely beautiful girls"" would be las chicas absolutamente bellas.;
, You probably know that to form an adverb in English, you simply add -ly to the root of the adjective. The Spanish language works the same way, except you use -mente, and you tack it onto the end of the singular, feminine form of the adjective.For example, the feminine form of the adjective that means ""fast"" in Spanish is rapida. So if you wanted to say that someone was running quickly, you could use the adverb rapidamente.
Note that you always use the feminine form of the adjective, even if you are talking about a man or a masculine noun.
You don't subtract any letters from the adjective to form the adverb, as you sometimes do when forming adverbs in English.

, Some words in Spanish have their own adverb form, rather than adding the suffix -mente to the adjective form. The easiest way to learn these words is simply to memorize them.One of the most common adverbs is muy (MOO-ee), which means ""very."" You may find that you use it a lot when speaking Spanish. For example, if someone asked how you were doing, you might say ""Muy bien, gracias"" (Very well, thank you).

Mucho (MOO-choh) is another common simple adverb, which means ""a lot.""
Many of these adverbs also are different words in English, such as aquí (ah-KEE), which means ""here."" This may make it easier for you to know when to seek these adverb forms out.

, Adverbs are relatively easy to pronounce, provided you understand the pronunciation of the original adjective. Just as in English, you merely add the suffix, pronouncing the adjective exactly the same.If an adjective has any written accent marks, it retains those accent marks when changed to an adverb. The same syllables are stressed – the addition of the suffix doesn't change this.
Pronounce the suffix MEN-tay. These two syllables are simply added on to the feminine form of the adjective, which is pronounced the same as it would be without it.

Create an adverbial phrase for adjectives that end in -nte.,
Learn other ways to form adverbial phrases.,
Memorize simple adverbial phrases.",How to Use Adverbs in Spanish2," In Spanish, if the adjective you want to use ends in -nte you typically don't add the suffix -mente to make the adverbial form. Rather, you add another word and use the noun form of the word.You probably are familiar with adverbial phrases in English. For example, if you say someone did something ""with vigor,"" this means the same thing as taking the adjective vigorous and adding -ly to make it an adverb (""vigorously"").
A basic adverbial phrase in Spanish is formed the same way, by combining the word con (meaning ""with"") and a singular noun.
As your Spanish writing or speaking becomes more advanced, you may notice spots in which using the adverb form sounds awkward. Even if there's no difficulty adding the -mente suffix, an adverbial phrase might just sound better., You can combine other words besides con with nouns to form adverbial phrases. Peppering your Spanish with these diverse phrases can make you a more dynamic and interesting writer or speaker.For example, in English, rather than saying ""interestingly,"" you might say that something was done ""in an interesting manner"" or ""in an interesting way."" You can do this in Spanish as well, with the phrase de manera interesante (day mah-NER-ah en-TER-ess-ahnt).

, Some adverbs describe how, when, or where an action occurred. These most often are adverbial phrases rather than an adjective in adverb form.This is done in English as well. For example, if you want to say that you placed a book ""to the right"" of the paper, you wouldn't say you placed the book ""rightly"" – that word means something else.
For example, if you wanted to say in Spanish that something happens often, you would use the phrase a menudo (ah may-NUE-doh).
Some Spanish adverbial phrases, on the other hand, are very different than what you would say in English. For example, if someone was preparing a surprise party, you might say in English that they were making their preparations secretly. However, in Spanish, you would more typically use the phrase a escondidas (ah ess-cohn-DEED-ahs) – although the word secretamente is the more direct translation.

"

Learn the correct placement for adverbs.,
Change form when you combine two adverbs.,
Leave adverbs on their own as interrogatories.",How to Use Adverbs in Spanish3," Generally, Spanish adverbs go immediately after the verb they modify. If they are modifying an adjective or other adverb, however, they go before the word they modify. For example, if you wanted to say ""you play well,"" to a Spanish-speaking teammate, you would say juegas bien (HOO-gahs BEE-ehn). Note that the adverb follows the verb in that sentence, just as it does in English.
However, unlike English, you can't put an adverb between two verbs. In Spanish, the adverb must follow the last verb, as in ""vamos a jugar aquí"" (VAH-mos ah HOO-gahr ah-KEE), which means ""let's play here.""

, Sometimes you'll want to use two or more adverbs to describe an action, rather than just one. When you use two or more Spanish adverbs in a series, only the last one gets the -mente suffix.For the first adverb, the one that doesn't get the suffix, you still use the feminine, singular form of the adjective, regardless of the gender or number of the subject of the sentence.
For example, if you wanted to say ""he speaks slowly and clearly"" in Spanish, you would say ""habla lenta y claramente"" (AH-blah LEN-tah ee CLAIR-ah-MEN-tay). Notice that lenta is the singular, feminine adjective form – it does not take the -mente suffix.

, Just as in English, you can ask questions in Spanish using only one word, such as who or when. These adverbs that stand alone are punctuated as a complete sentence, and don't have to agree with anything.For example, suppose someone was inviting you to a party, but you didn't quite catch the date and time the party was starting. You could simply ask ""when?"" by saying ""¿Cuándo?"" (KWAN-doh).

Modulate your voice.,
Prepare a list of 10 vocabulary words.,
Create your own Multiple Choice questions.,
Know your subject.,
Pronounce it correctly.,
Speak it.,
Listen for it.",How to Tutor Spanish," Tell your student that this will be fun if the student wants to learn. If the student resists or does not pay attention then it will only be them who suffers. Say it once, then drop it.;
, No one wants to learn topics that are boring. If you teach it that way, there is no way someone will want to learn it that way. Put on a Mexican hat, dress up in either a Bull-fighter costume or a special dress. Or just wrap a colorful blanket around you and make it dramatic. Prepare authentic foods and make it a party. Just don't eat too much and take a siesta too soon.

, If you speak in a monotone it becomes very hard to concentrate on the subject. You suddenly become very fixated on the person and why it is they are talking like a robot. Think like an actor. You are playing the part of the very charming professor. Be sweet, play nice, and speak with passion. Remember, Spanish is a Latin-based language, plays a part in the romantic languages, and is spoken by very passionate people all over the world. It is rare to hear a monotonous Spanish speaker.

, Try not to exceed this number and have that list be your go to topic for the day's lesson. Apply each word in a scenario to drive home their meaning. Once the student has got the meaning clear, have them craft their own Spanish sentences with the words.

, Give the student a small and no stress quiz at the end of the lesson. If they get it wrong, ask yourself if you did everything you could to make the lesson clear. If you have more than one student it helps you to get a better gauge because if one fails but the other passes then it may be the habits of the one. If both fail, its probably your techniques.

, You can't very well teach a subject if you can't even explain what a pie means in Spanish. If you can, try to use your command words in Spanish only. ""¡Mira!, look, and ""¡Escucha!"", Listen!; are some of the ones you can use to get your students attention. ""¡Sientate!"", sit down; is usually a last resort because, unless your students are five, they should already know to sit. However, you can use it if you have everyone doing an activity.

, The Spanish language is very pretty and very specific about its phonetics. Once you have the vowel sounds clarified with your students, A (Ah), E (eh), I (EE), O (oh), U (Ooh), then cover the letters that are not part of the English dialects. The Enye (Ñ), the elle (ll) and the erre (rr) are different for the Spanish. In addition, the pronunciation of the letters h, j, and x are all different.


The Enye (Ñ) makes a Nya sound as in the word: jalapeño
The Elle (LL) makes a ya sound as in the word: caballo
The Erre (RR) makes a rolled R sound, as in: Guitarra (Don't worry if this does not happen for you right away or even ever. The Spanish are very forgiving. If you wish to practice this technique, however, the best thing I have found to do is to breathe out hard, and allow an L sound to emanate from your tongue. Leave the tip of your tongue very loose so that when the hard breathe comes out over the tongue tip, it will flip up and down. The L sound converts in our ears as an R sound.)
The H can sometimes be silent, as in Hielo (ice) which can be pronounced Ee-el-o
The J and X can sometimes be pronounced as we would say the h sound. So, once again the word jalapeño would be pronounced: hal-a-penyo. Also the word Texas would be spoken as Tehas. This is not a hard-and-fast rule for the X. The more Westernized a thing becomes the less strength is emphasized for a particular rule. Occasionally, for the J it can be more of a zha sound.

, Try to speak to your students only in Spanish on the words you have already covered.

, Have your students speak the words in Spanish already covered that they know. Familiarity comes from use. Make your ""classroom"" an all-Spanish all the time zone.

"
Stress that there are only five vowels in Spanish and that they will always be pronounced the same way.,
Note that Spanish vowels are much shorter than English vowels.,
Have the student write down the vowel sounds based on English words and say them out loud.,
Define and discuss diphthongs.,
Have the student practice pronouncing diphthongs.,
Demonstrate how your mouth should move for each vowel.,
Use a Taco Bell menu.,
Create a Spanish sing a long.",How to Teach Vowel Sounds in Spanish," This is a very important distinction, as restricting your students to only five vowel sounds, as opposed to the over 14 possible different vowel sounds in English, will ensure they are pronouncing Spanish words properly.You should also point out that unlike English, where the context of the word in the sentence affects the pronunciation of that word (i.e. “I live in that house” vs “I saw the band at a live show”), in Spanish the position of the word does not affect the pronunciation of the vowel in the word.;
, For example, take the letter “O”. When you say the letter “O” in English, it can sound like “Oooohwa”. In Spanish, it is much shorter and staccato and will sound like: “Oh.”While this is not an integral detail of learning pronunciation as a beginner, it is important to understand and apply this spoken rule if your student wants to achieve s native-like speaking ability of Spanish.

, Doing this will give them a guideline to refer back to as they work on getting their vowel sounds right and making them sound more natural.“A” will always sound like the “a” in “father”.
“E” will always sound like the “e” in “elephant”.
“I” will always sound like the “e” in “be”. This letter can be confusing as it sounds the same as the letter “e” in English, so clarify this for your students.
“O” will always sound like the “o” in “oh” or “October”. It will always sound short and without an “ooh” sound.
“U” will always sound like the “u” in “flute” or in the Spanish word “uno”.

, Once the student is aware of the five basic vowel sounds, they can sound out combinations of these vowels.


When two vowels are next to each other, one strong (“a”, “e”, “o”) and one weak (“i”, “u”), or two weak vowels ( “ui”), the student needs to learn to combine the two vowels into a syllable, forming a diphthong., They should make the sound for the first vowel in a word and then make the sound for the second vowel in the word. They should then repeat this faster and faster until it sounds like one syllable. For example:“ai” or “ay” should sound like “eye” in English. Such as in the Spanish word “aire”.
“ei” or “ey” should rhyme with ""hay"" in English. Such as in the Spanish word “rey”.
“oi” or “oy” should sound like “oy” in English. Such as in the Spanish word “voy”.
“ui” or “uy”, such as in the Spanish words “muy” or “Luis”.
“ia” should sound like “piano” in English. Such as in the Spanish word “media”.
“ie” should sound like “eh” in English. Such as in the Spanish word “cielo”.
“io”, such as in the Spanish word “delicioso”.
“iu”, such as in the Spanish word “viuda”.
“au” should sound like “ow” in English. Such as in the Spanish word “auto”.
“eu”, such as in the Spanish word “europa”.
“ua”, such as in the Spanish word “cuadro”.
“ue”, such as in the Spanish word “cuesta”.
“uo”, such as in the Spanish word “cuota”.

, Draw a bowl-shaped line on the board, like a smile. Write the vowels in a row, from left to right, just under the line, in this order: “i, e, a, o,u”.Label or draw the end with “i” so it is the front of the mouth and the end with the “u” so it is the back of the mouth at the entrance to the throat. Don’t worry about drawing this well, as long as it is looks relatively clear and easy to see.
If you are skilled enough to draw a sagittal view, go for it. A sagittal view is a cut-away view that shows the head, mouth, nose, and neck, like the ones you might see in a doctor’s office.
Ask your student to listen as you pronounce the five pure vowels, with no breaks or coming up for air, moving your mouth and lips in a slow, exaggerated way as you speak. The “i” sound should be pronounced with your lips spread wide like a toothy smile but as you move to the “u” sound, your lips should tighten into a smoochy pucker. This may elicit a few giggles or laughs, but that’s fine, as long as it makes them pay attention to the movement of your mouth.
Make sure you stress the movement of your tongue as you model the vowels. The tongue should begin in the forward position at the “i” sound, raise up as you continue through the vowels, go into a relaxed position as you say “a” and then back up towards your throat on the “u” sound.
Once you have shown this to your student a few times, ask them to try it on their own. Have them practice moving their mouth in a slow, exaggerated way as they say each vowel.

, You can use any restaurant you’d like, but choosing a familiar fast food chain like Taco Bell may help your student ease into the activity.Make photocopies of a menu from Taco Bell and give it to your student.
Have the student read the items aloud, pronouncing the words as they normally would in English.
Then, have the student re read the items with the correct Spanish vowels.
Ask your student to circle at least five spots they mispronounced and then discuss these issues with them. Create a list on the board of all the words the student had trouble with.
Focus on helping the student re read the menu with the correct pronunciation of the Spanish vowels they circled and had a hard time with.
As a fun follow-up to this activity, take your student to an authentic Spanish restaurant and have them order foods with Spanish names they may not know (and with the correct pronunciation, of course).

, Use an existing Spanish sing a long onlineor build your own using a blackboard and chalk or a dry erase pen.Write out the lyrics to a Spanish song that uses many vowel words on the blackboard. Make sure there is enough room between each line of the song so the student can read the lyrics clearly.
As you point to each word in the song, have the student try to read the word out loud. Eventually, have the student string together each word to read or sing aloud one line of the song.
Encourage them to continue until they can sing one verse or section of the song. Offer suggestions on their pronunciation and how they can improve their vowel sounds.
If there is a recorded version of the song you chose, play it for the student so they are aware of the proper pronunciation of the vowel sounds.

"
"
Teach pronunciation first.,
Focus on the pronunciation of accents and stress marks in words.,
Handle verb conjugations.,
Go over irregular verbs like “ir.” Much like English, Spanish has a substantially irregular verb form for “to go,” translated “ir.” Include the word changes from “ir” to “va” (you go) and “fue” (he went), etc.,
Teach informal and formal pronouns as necessary.,
Provide vocabulary for common situations.,
Focus the classroom on speaking Spanish.,
Teach full sentences and common expressions.,
Vary classroom activities.,
Bring Spanish or Mexican culture into the classroom.,
Tailor teaching to the skill level of a student group.,
Encourage students to speak Spanish in the classroom.",How to Teach Spanish," One foundation that teachers won’t want to forget is pronunciation. Students often have significant problems with pronunciation that can interfere with the rest of their learning. Take time to tackle the sounds of the various Spanish vowels and consonants before going onto more involved lessons.Students having English as their first language shouldn’t be afraid of Spanish phonetics because they’re going from a very complex system into a much simpler one.
Vowels in Spanish do not vary in length or pitch, and when a variation occurs it is not meaningful.
Much of Spanish pronunciation is phonetic (things are pronounced the way they look), although students may struggle to become familiar with the Spanish “r” sound (rolled on the top of the mouth) and the fact that “ll” is pronounced as a “y” sound.;
, Stress, however is of paramount importance since a differing stress can change a word entirely. Connected with stress are weak forms, (word level) and rhythm (sentence level). Again, English speaking students are in luck again, as the Spanish system is easier than the English system.


For example, “piso” (pronounced “PEA-so”) means “I tread,” “floor,” and “apartment.” “Pisó” (pronounced “pea-SO”): “s/he/it treaded,” leading to misunderstandings in both languages if not mastered properly.
Compare the English words “command” & “transfer” when you shift the stress, to show students the difference between stressing the second syllable or the first syllable.
Spanish is a relatively easy language to learn (especially when compared to the thorny English language with its incongruous spellings and word meanings).

, One of the most significant concepts in teaching Spanish is conjugating verbs and helping students to understand how these words change with tenses and use. Most of the Spanish verbs are regular, having either an -er, -ar or -ir verb form. Make sure students master the common verb forms, and they will be on their way to a better understanding of the language as a whole.


Show students online resource and websites that show conjugation charts. Make it clear to the students that these are foundational, and they need to memorize regular verb conjugations, as well as the irregular verbs., in beginning verb conjugation. This is a crucial verb that students simply need to memorize.

, Another large portion of basic Spanish language teaching is the pronouns. Students may want to know only the informal, or only the formal pronouns. Use discretion in how the pronouns are approached, but make sure students know how to use them in any case.


Spanish, unlike English, has both an informal “you” (tu) used when speaking to peers, and a form “you” (usted), used when speaking to elders. Clarify to students when they should use each form, but encourage use of “tu” in the classroom.
You will also need to teach students gender, as nouns in Spanish have either masculine or feminine gender.

, It’s important to bulk up your students’ vocabulary memorization through their classroom years. Rather than teach them esoteric vocabulary, focus on easily-applicable words that are relevant to their lives.Think about the specific needs of a student group.


Spanish has many cognates (words that have similar sound and meaning) with English. For example, you students can easily tell what “hamburgesa” means.This is where many experienced Spanish language teachers talk about Spanish for tourism, Spanish for work, or discipline-specific vocabulary.Since you are teaching students, it can be useful to teach vocabulary related to school supplies and academic studies.
Also teach vocabulary related to common interests for teens: food, technology, music popular media (TV and film), etc.

, While students to need to be able to read written Spanish and write in Spanish, the learning will feel more engaging for them if they regularly speak in the classroom.Encourage your students to make mistakes and try for more complex phrases and ideas. Correct your students if they make serious or frequent errors, but in general, your role should be to encourage students and push them forwards, not to criticize them.

, Teachers should aim at teaching full sentences, as students will be unable to communicate (at any level) if they are only familiar with unconnected vocabulary words and verb-conjugation charts. Give your students common expressions like:


¿Quién va repartir los cuadernos de trabajo hoy? (“Who is going to distribute the workbooks today?”)
¿Alguien ha visto un texto en Español de camino al Colegio? (“Has anyone read a text in Spanish on their walk to school?”)
¡Venga, que tenemos mucho trabajo! (“Come, we have a lot of work!”)
¡Vaya trabajo chapucero, lo siento pero vas a tener que repetirlo! (“You’ve done sloppy work, I’m sorry but you’re going to have to repeat it!”)
¡Muy bien, cada día trabajas mejor! (“Very good, each day you’re doing better work!”)

, For the most effective Spanish teaching, professionals recommend going from “closed” to “open” activities, where teachers first teach the vocabulary (“closed”), then break the students up into groups and allow them to use it in practice (“open”).Books on “Teaching Games” and “Role Playing” are helpful.


For instance, “Who’s Who” is a game that provides plenty of activity. This kind of approach often promises to deliver plenty of Spanish language/culture skills to students.
Divide students up into pairs or small groups, and ask them to have a short conversation.More experienced students may be able to act out a short, funny skit in Spanish.

, Especially if you are teaching students who may one day travel to a Spanish-speaking country, it’s valuable to familiarize students with Mexican, Latin American, and Spanish culture. (This also provides a great opportunity to present new vocabulary.) You can also bring in Spanish-language media, such as popular films or music.Inform your students about:


Common national foods of Mexico and Spain.
Mexican holidays, like Day of the Dead.
Pronunciation differences between Mexican/Latin American and European Spanish (including the Castilian “lisp”).

, Basic students will want to know the very basic items like verbs, pronouns, and introductory vocabulary. More advanced students will want to be taught how to use Spanish in different situations, and even some Spanish vernacular (as their level allows).


Put items like numbers, days of the week and colors up front. These helpful single words are used in a vast variety of situations, and when students get these lists in their head, they are more able to form Spanish sentences. Rhymes and songs are powerful tools to convey them.

, Especially with earlier levels of Spanish, you will need to introduce new concepts, vocabulary, tenses, and conjugations in English. However, having your students speak Spanish as often as possible will improve both their familiarity with the language and their pronunciation.


Once students can speak enough Spanish to be conversant—usually around their third year of high-school Spanish—you can mandate that students speak only Spanish in your classroom. At this point, your students will understand the language well enough that you will not need to speak English to them at all.

Understand how to use the verb ""ser"" when telling time.,
Tell the time using whole hours.,
Learn how to indicate if it's midnight or noon.,
Tell the time using hours and minutes.",How to Tell Time in Spanish1," Ser is a verb that means ""to be"" and it's the only verb you'll need to tell the time. The two forms of ser are the plural form, son las (""they are"") and the singular form, es la (""it is""). Only use es la when the hour is one o' clock. Use son las for all other times of day. For example:



Son las dos. It's two o'clock.

Es la una. It's one o'clock.;
, Before telling the time fully, you should learn how to tell the time just using hours. Simply say es la una to indicate that it's one o'clock, and use son las followed the number associated with any hour other than one to say the time. Here are some examples:



Son las cuatro. It's four o'clock.

Son las cinco. It's five o'clock.

Son las seis. It's six o'clock.

Son las siete. It's seven o'clock.

Son las once. It's eleven o'clock.

, Midnight and noon are whole hours, but you should say that it's midnight or noon using a slightly different method. Here's how to do it:



Es mediodía. It's noon.

Es medianoche. It's midnight.

, Telling the time in Spanish using minutes and hours is a bit trickier than in English. To tell the time in Spanish, you'll never need to use a number higher than 29. Here are the two methods you need to know:


To tell the time in the first half hour, simply state the correct form of ser followed by the hour, followed by y (""and"") and the number of minutes. Here are some examples:


Son las siete y seis. It's 7:06.

Son las diez y veinte. It's 10:20.

Son las once y diez. It's 11:10.
Just remember one exception: if you're indicating that it's the half hour, then don't say treinta (""thirty"") but say media (""half"") instead. For example: Son las dos y media. It's 2:30.


To tell the time in the second half hour, you'll have to first state the correct form of ser followed by the next hour, followed by menos (minus) and the amount of minutes remaining until the following hour. Here are some examples:


Son las nueve menos cinco. It's 8:55.

Son las once menos veinte. It's 10:40.

Es la una menos veinticinco. It's 12:35.

Son las tres menos cuarto. It's 2:45. Note that you should say cuarto (""a quarter"") instead of quince (""fifteen"").

Hang from a hook or nail.",How to Make a Bulletin Board," Corkboard is the traditional material for bulletin boards, but can get pretty expensive. Bristol board, foam board, or sound dampening board are all cheaper alternatives. You can even use thick cardboard, as long as it's sturdy enough not to tear.


Test it before you start building. Pin a few sheets of paper onto the board and see how well it holds.;
, The frame will not be visible after this project is done. However, a frame makes it easier to attach the batting and fabric we'll be adding. It also provides a little protection, which may be worth it if children will use the board.

, Thin batting (padding) adds a softer touch and allows for three-dimensional designs. Attach as follows:Lay the board face down over the batting. Cut a rectangle of batting about 2–3 inches (5–7.5cm) larger than the board.
Pull one corner over the back of the board. Attach with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or (if a frame is present) a staple gun.
Repeat with batting around the whole board, pulling taut before attaching. Trim off excess batting.

, Select a decorative fabric larger than the bulletin board. Cut out a piece about 4–6 inches (10–15cm) larger on each side than your board. Iron this until it is completely flat.You could use an old piece of clothing or a plastic tablecloth instead.Wrapping paper is another cheap option, but tends to tear pretty quickly.

, Lay the board face-down on the backside of the fabric. Pull the fabric around and attach to the back of the board, just as you did with the batting. Pull taut as you go and check the front frequently to avoid wrinkles.

, A criss-cross ribbon design is a popular look, especially over batting. Wrap ribbons in rows at a 45º angle to the board, gluing or stapling to the back. Repeat with ribbons slanted the opposite direction to make a diamond pattern. Pin the ribbons in place at every point where two ribbons cross.Sewing buttons over each intersection makes an extra cute look.Of course, you can arrange the ribbons however you like. For instance, vertical ribbons could divide the bulletin board into areas used for different purposes.

, If you attached batting to your bulletin board, you can mimic a soft, tufted comforter. Here's how:Nail a piece of plywood to the back of the board. (See Tips for alternatives.)

Nail small, short nails through the fabric and onto the plywood. Place them in a diamond pattern. Make sure they don't penetrate the plywood.
Cover the nails with upholstery tacks, or glue decorative beads over them.

, Laminate a piece of fabric or construction paper. Cut out letters or shapes and pin them along the top of the board.

, Add index cards or blank paper for writing notes. For aesthetic variety, cut the paper into circles or use paper in several colors.

, If you own the house or have permission from the owners, screw in the board for a secure fit. Fit each screw through a washer before screwing it in, to prevent it crushing the soft board., If you don't want to damage the wall, stick on a wall mounting square, or several if your board is large. Wait for the adhesive to cure, for however long the label suggests. Stick on the board and press firmly.


Bulletin boards are usually too heavy to hang from adhesive putty.

, You can purchase strong adhesive hooks if you don't want to puncture the wall. Punch two holes in the bulletin board and thread strong wire, twine, or ribbon through both. Double knot on either side and hang over the hook or nail.

Learn to indicate whether the time is AM or PM.,
Learn a few additional useful phrases.",How to Tell Time in Spanish2," Spanish speakers usually don't say AM or PM, but rather use the words for morning (manana), afternoon (tarde), and night or evening (noche). Here's how to tell the time while indicating whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening:



Es la una de la mañana. It's one o'clock in the morning.

Son las seis de la noche. It's six o'clock in the evening.

Son las cuatro de la tarde. It's four o'clock in the afternoon.

, Even after you know exactly how to tell the time in Spanish, you can always improve your skills by learning a few basic phrases. Here are a few:



Son las cinco más o menos. It's about five o'clock.

Es la una en punto. It's exactly one o'clock.

¿Qué hora es? What time is it?

, Create a budget and post or search online on job forums or college websites for an adequate tutor. You may also physically visit schools to check bulletin boards. Inquire about Spanish departments as most of the tutors would post in that area of the college. You may also find a tutor by offering to tutor English in exchange for Spanish lessons. This can keep your costs down.

, Depending on the institution, classes can be expensive. Set a budget and a goal and make sure that the classes you take meet your standards. Read reviews and the course syllabus before fully committing to anything. You may also find classes online if you live far from any suitable institutions.

, Choose from a multitude of free or purchased apps for download onto your home or mobile device. Make sure to research and read reviews to ensure that the apps has the functions that you are looking for such as creating flashcards or visual aids. Flashcards are a great way to memorize vocabulary and apps can be searched for Windows, Apple, or Android devices., Stream Spanish radio, search for language tutorial podcasts, or borrow audiobooks from the library.

Whether you are learning the language for a trip or your career, you want to have fun and motivation to fuel your drive.Learning Spanish may be difficult and frustrating so find any motivation you can to get you through any mental blocks. Don’t limit yourself to just one thing. Find as many reasons to feel impassioned as you can.

, Based on your motivations, think about what the most important phrases you will need to start than work out from there. Think about expressions and words that you need to immediately master to best describe yourself and connect with others. Start with phrases about your personal history, family, friends, hometown, education, or career.Continue to add to your list as you begin to speak spanish and encounter situations that will help you in the future.
The first 100 words of your list will be words that you will always use like yes, no, where, when, etc. Fill out the rest of your list with words specific to you and your experience., Conversational Spanish is different from the written language. Conversational connectors add space and let your bridge ideas with phrases. Only use one or two connectors to begin with as it is extremely difficult to memorize all of them at once. Simply use enough to get you through a conversation and, as you begin to gain more confidence with the language, incorporate more into your everyday vocabulary. They can range in a variety of categories but focus on:Filler ex “well, as a matter of fact…”
Quoting ex “recently, I heard that…”
Apologising ex “Don’t be upset, but...”
Agreeing/Disagreeing ex “most certainly”
Passing ex “and what do you think?”
Closing ex “to sum up...”
Elaborating ex “to be more precise…”
Opening ex “that is a good question…”
Qualifying ex ”to tell the truth…”
Switching ex “by the way..”

, Chat with people who speak Spanish as their first language. You need to speak as much as you can so try to limit how often you use English when speaking to native Spanish speakers. Even if you don’t have access to native speakers, you can simply speak to yourself. Whenever you find yourself drifting in your head, try to do so in Spanish. Whether you’re waiting for a coffee or thinking about tv, try to perform your inner dialogue in Spanish., Whether you’re speaking to a native Spanish speaker or using an online resource, list to the sounds and try to mimic them. Not only should you be trying to comprehend what is being said but you should also be focusing on how it is being said., Determine what makes the language easy to learn and don’t get overwhelmed by any of its complexities. There are a lot of things that make learning Spanish easy including:


Spanish is phonetic so learning the pronunciation of a word you read should be easier than learning English.
While other language have exceptions to their language rules, Spanish has none. For example, Czech has 14 ways of saying a lot of their words whereas Spanish will not have an exception. The word “casa” in Spanish will always be “casa”. When you learn a word you will never have to learn another variation of it.
Spanish does not utilize tones. For example, Punjab can change the meaning of the same consonant depending on your inflection when you say it or whether your tone is high or low. Spanish has similar intonations as English so it may seem familiar.
There are thousands of Spanish words that you already know because Spanish is similar to French and many English words originated from French. The ends of a lot of English words can give you their Spanish equivalent. These are known as cognate rules. For example, change “-tion” to “cion” for words like assocation. This will give you “asociación” which sounds virtually the same but is Spanish.

, Have an optimistic and inquisitive mindset. You should have a positive approach when learning how to speak Spanish fluently. Be patient and immerse yourself in the language as much as possible.

Watch Spanish television.,
Follow the Pareto principle.,
Find a skype partner.,
Visit local cultural centers or plan a trip to a Spanish speaking country.,
Limit your English.",How to Speak Spanish Fluently3," If you don’t get Spanish television you can ask your cable provider or simply check what is trending on Youtube for a Spanish speaking country. You may also purchase or download a popular Spanish television series online. More popular series may have English manuscripts or subtitles to help you follow along. You may also have content in alternate languages. Check the site of your local channels and inquire whether they provide a Spanish alternative.

, This principle states that you need to learn the right words, which means that you don’t have to learn the entire language but simply learn the most important words. It’s easy to find the most important words because they will be the ones used most frequently.For example, rather than learning the formal forms of words and phrases, learn colloquialisms., Post on forums, colleges, or even the library. You don’t have to find someone overseas or living in a Spanish speaking country as Skype is great for generally working within your schedule at the comfort of your own home. Watching someone speak the language or using visual aids will help speed up the learning process so don’t be afraid to ask your partner to keep that in mind.Use multiple windows when using Skype so you can simultaneously use another language app or check your notes to help you follow the conversation. Use translation tools to help you keep pace in the conversation but don’t use it as a crutch. You shouldn’t hesitate to ask your partner for a break if you are lost in the conversation.You may also find a partner on Skype by offering to exchange English lessons. Practicing a second language together allows you to take a breath and regain your momentum when you switch over to your native language.

, There’s no better way to learn a language than immersing yourself fully in the culture. However, traveling can be very expensive so seek out local cultural centers for countries like Mexico, Spain, or most South and Central American countries. If you do not have a local cultural center, establish a language club so that you can share resources with others around your community.

, Practice makes perfect and there’s no substitute for simply forcing yourself to only speak Spanish. While this may be difficult because of your location or career, develop blocks in your schedule where you only speak Spanish. As your confidence grows, continue to expand these blocks.

Completing exercises and answering questions earns you points. As you accumulate points, you'll eventually gain ""levels"" that correspond to your proficiency in the language you're learning.

, The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) may not be the first organization most people associate with Spanish education, but its Spanish lesson program is no slouch. With lessons for Spanish-learners at every level and options to learn Spanish through Facebook and play Spanish games like crosswords, there is a wealth of resources available via this route. A downside of the BBC's Spanish program, however, is that it is no longer being updated.One great feature of the BBC's lesson program is called Mi Vida Loca (""My Crazy Life."") This interactive story allows you to participate in an interactive story over 12 weeks, learning Spanish vocabulary and grammar as you go., Unlike the other options in this section, Veintemundos allows users to learn Spanish skills while simultaneously learning about the actual Spanish-speaking world.

Read an easy Spanish book.,
Listen to Spanish music.,
Listen to Spanish Radio.,
Watch Spanish TV and movies.,
Frequent Spanish-speaking businesses.",How to Study Spanish for Free2," Reading is a great way of advancing your Spanish language skills (though not necessarily your pronunciation.) For beginners, simple children's books can offer an easy, entertaining way to get accustomed to basic grammar and sentence structure. For intermediate speakers, on the other hand, books for middle-schoolers and teens offer greater challenges.


As you read, try to avoid looking up every new word you come across it in the dictionary. This will slow you down and also make it impossible for you to discover the words' meaning on your own through contextual clues. Consider looking up words that appear repeatedly and are crucial to understanding the context.
A good way to find Spanish books easy enough for non-speakers to read is to use reading list sites like Goodreads.com. Here, a quick search can find you dense lists of Spanish books for children and young adults., Singing along with Spanish songs is a great way to have fun while learning new Spanish words and phrases at the same time. There's no single song or genre that's best for this, but if you're unsure where to start, try checking out the ""Latin"" category on the Billboard charts to see which Spanish songs are popular today.Below are just a few popular Spanish-language musical artists who are popular today or have been popular in the past — there are many, many more:


Shakira
Pitbull
Juanes
Ricky Martin
Los Lobos
Buena Vista Social Club
Selena Quintanilla

, If you're looking to brush up on your ability to understand spoken Spanish, try tuning your home or car radio to a Spanish language radio station. Listening in to a Spanish talk show is a great way to train your ear to pick up common words and phrases at the rapid pace that most Spanish speakers actually use in conversation (plus, you can do it during your daily commute.) Most major metropolitan areas in the United States now have at least one or two Spanish stations on the air. In areas with a large Latino population, like California and the Southwest, there can be lots to choose from.


If you're listening online, try tuning into the Radio Nacional de España (Spanish National Radio) at rtve.es/radio. This online station is easy to connect to (though not all programs may be available globally) and can give you valuable practice listening to the Castillian form of Spanish spoken in Spain.

, If you spend hours in front of the TV each day, why not use some of this time for Spanish practice? Check your local cable TV provider for a guide of Spanish-speaking television stations, or search online for sites that offer Spanish programs like sitcoms, news, and soap operas. Note that popular streaming services like Netflix usually have at least a small selection of Spanish shows and movies available.


One fantastic way of learning Spanish is to watch Spanish-language soap operas (or telanovelas.) These shows are great for beginners because it's usually possible to follow the plot from visuals and the melodramatic acting even if you don't understand every word of the script. Just a few well-regarded telanovelas you may want to check out are:Marimar: Features a young Thalia, who would go on to become one of the most successful Mexican singers of all time.

La Usurpadora: Telanovela based around a now-classic ""good and evil twins separated at birth"" plotline.

Amigas y Rivales: Early-aughts telanovela aimed at a younger crowd which featured an abundance of teenage drama.

, If you're aiming to build your Spanish skills, working interactions with actual Spanish speakers into your routine is practically a must. One easy way to do this is to start going to Spanish-speaking businesses for your weekly needs and attempting to make your transactions in Spanish. For instance, tasks like ordering at a restaurant, making a withdrawal at the bank, buying groceries, and taking your car in for regular maintenance can all be great practice if you speak to the employees in Spanish. Best of all, if you're lucky, this can even help you make new friends and connections in places you never otherwise would have.


Even better than spending time at a Spanish-speaking business is working at one. Working with employees who don't know English well forces you to use your limited Spanish skills to solve problems — though it can be stressful at first, this is fantastic, effective practice in the long run.

Move or travel to a Spanish-speaking country.,
Make Spanish-speaking friends.,
Find a foreign Spanish speaker who wants to learn English.,
Get your hands on an old Spanish textbook.",How to Study Spanish for Free3," Most language editors agree that the quickest, most effective way to learn a new language is through immersion (in other words, putting yourself in a situation where you have to use the language near-constantly in your daily life.) There's no better way to do this than to go somewhere where Spanish is spoken and stay there as long as possible. Spanish is the official language of 20 countries (plus Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory) — spending time in any of these countries is an invaluable experience for anyone attempting to learn Spanish.The problem here, of course, is that it's very difficult to travel or move to a different country for free. If you're young, the best way to do this may be to enroll in a study abroad program through your school and apply for financial aid to cover the cost. If you're out of school and work for an international company or organization, you might also try transferring to a branch in a Spanish-speaking country.

, You don't need to go to a Spanish-speaking country to meet Spanish speakers — try looking for new Spanish-speaking friends in your local community. Making connections with Spanish speakers at work, school, or elsewhere allows you to practice the sort of casual, everyday Spanish that the vast majority of Spanish speakers use in their daily lives (plus, it's always great to make new friends.) Once you know each other fairly well, many Spanish speakers will be more than happy to allow you to practice your Spanish, so don't be shy!

, Don't know any Spanish speakers in your local community? No se preocupe — don't worry! It's still possible to communicate with Spanish speakers from other countries and sharpen your language skills while learning about a different way of life. Though you won't be having in-person interactions, the practice you get from the experience can be quite valuable. See below for just two great ideas.


One of the best ways to practice your Spanish with actual Spanish speakers from around the world is to participate in educational video chats. For instance, on the official community forums for Skype video chat, users can arrange language exchange sessions where two Skype users who speak different languages teach each other their languages from across the globe.In this case, if you want to learn Spanish, all you need to do is find a user from Spain or Latin America who wants to learn English and you're ready to start learning one-on-one!
If you can't (or don't want to) use a video chat service, you can still use the old-fashioned method — getting a pen pal — for a somewhat slower-paced experience (but one that's still worthwhile.) Try using a pen pal site like Mylanguageexchange.com to connect with a Spanish-speaker from abroad via email or snail mail., While communicating with actual Spanish speakers is generally the best way to learn the language, for some skills (like verb agreement and conjugation), it can be useful to take a more formalized approach to studying so that you can get the foundational knowledge necessary to carry on an actual conversation. In this case, Spanish textbooks can be a major help. Below are just a few places you may be able to find Spanish textbooks for cheap or free (as a general rule, the older the book is, the cheaper it is.) Don't be too worried about your textbook being out of date — while Spanish is continually evolving just like any other language, the fundamentals aren't likely to have changed.

Do an internet search to find some classic, popular Spanish films to watch with subtitles in either your native language or in Spanish.Whether to use Spanish subtitles or your native language’s subtitles depends on your skill level. If you are an absolute beginner, watch the movie in your native language with Spanish subtitles, or in Spanish with subtitles in your native language.If you know how to read Spanish but are struggling with your listening skills, try watching the movie with Spanish subtitles.
Learning through watching movies in Spanish can be more effective when you have learned some basic Spanish vocabulary already.;
, If you have a smartphone or a computer, you can find some great apps, such as Duolingo or Memrise, to help you learn Spanish. Many of them feel like games, which can help you with your motivation!


You can try downloading a few to see which app fits best with the type of learning you enjoy—some apps offer rewards as motivation, some have competitions with yourself or others, and some have a more standard structure of learning.
You can practice listening, speaking, reading, and writing on various apps.

, Since you’re probably going to be washing dishes, opening the refrigerator, and looking in the mirror every day, use those opportunities to practice your Spanish. Write the name of the item in Spanish on a sticky note, place it on the item, and practice saying the words when you see them.


To take this a step further, write a full sentence in Spanish on the note. For example, on your bathroom mirror, you could write, “Estoy cepillando los dientes.” This means “I’m brushing my teeth.”
On your refrigerator, you could write, “Tengo hambre” for “I’m hungry,” or “Estoy abriendo el refrigerador” for “I’m opening the refrigerator.”

, For better or worse, many of us spend a large amount of time on our computers and phones. Since you’re using them anyway, integrate your language learning into that screen time. You can change the language on your android, iPhone, or other smartphone, as well as the language on your computer, to Spanish. You can also change the language on your browser and other websites that you frequent., Going to school doesn’t fall into everyone’s interest category, but if you are someone who loves to learn in a formal capacity and get feedback, try taking a class at a local college or language institute. A quick search on the internet will provide you with an abundance of options for classes to take, either online or in person.


Choose a class that has “immersion” or “conversation” in the title. An immersion class means that the teacher speaks in the language that you’re learning. Conversation classes will focus on practicing conversation skills with others in Spanish.Hiring a tutor is another option to consider for more one-on-one practice.
Websites such as Verbling offer online conversational classes and lessons.
Your local library may offer free or low-cost classes, if price is an issue.

, Using various audio methods to learn Spanish can help improve your ability to listen and comprehend the language. Listen to Spanish-learning audio on your daily commute, on your morning walk, or while you do other tedious tasks, such as cleaning. Do a search in your podcast app to see which Spanish language apps are the most highly rated., Listening to Spanish music, looking up the lyrics, and singing along is a fun way to practice your speaking and pronunciation. The themes and emotions conveyed in music are universal, so bringing Spanish music into your life will help you feel connected to the culture and motivate you to keep learning.Listening to Spanish songs can also introduce you to idioms and more colloquial language that is used in different Spanish-speaking countries.

, Reading Spanish literature will help you become immersed in the language, and seeing the words on the page reinforces word acquisition. Choose things to read that match your current skill level as well as your interests! Be patient with yourself as you incrementally move from simpler works to more complicated ones.If you are a beginner, start with reading Spanish children’s books. The illustrations can help you retain the words’ meanings. Keep a Spanish-to-English dictionary or translator app handy while reading, so you can look up words and phrases that are unfamiliar.
Memorizing poems is another great way to internalize the language and appreciate its beauty.
Prioritize works that were originally written in Spanish over those that have been translated from your native language to Spanish—they are likely to have richer language.

, Practicing having conversations in Spanish is the most important component of learning to speak comfortably. No matter how much you read, write, and study, the only way to learn to have conversations is through practice with real people. Fortunately, there are many ways to practice your skills with others:


Search for opportunities to meet people in your area, such as a Spanish conversation group—websites like Meetup and Couchsurfing can be great for this.
Find native Spanish speakers to chat with online via sites like Italki.
Try a language exchange, where you will be paired with a native Spanish speaker who wants to learn your language. This is a wonderful way to make new friends and expand your understanding of other cultures.

, Arguably the most effective way to learn a language is to be immersed in it. If you can take a trip to a Spanish-speaking country, it will be a wonderful way to surround yourself with the language, practice your existing skills, improve your pronunciation, and make friends from a new culture., Setting small, incremental goals will help you to celebrate your accomplishments and keep yourself motivated. Take some time to think about different goals for yourself, and how you’ll know when you’ve reached them. Write down how you’ll know when you’ve reached your goals, and when you reach them, celebrate!


Remember that any amount that you learn is progress, and much of the joy of language learning is about the journey. So, regardless of your long-term goals, remember to praise yourself for every little step you take.
Some examples of progress markers could be: “I can order a drink at a restaurant in Spanish,” “I understood a whole Spanish movie with Spanish subtitles,” or “I can read 100 Years of Solitude in Spanish.”

, To avoid getting frustrated and giving up, it is important to be patient and gentle with yourself as you learn. Remind yourself that learning a new language takes time, and allow yourself to have fun with it! Be open to making mistakes, sounding silly, trying out new phrases, and not getting your pronunciation right immediately. You will enjoy learning much more if perfection is not your goal.

, Find something that you care about to help you get motivated to keep learning. Join a volunteer group for helping Spanish speakers get accustomed to life in your country. Make a Spanish friend to practice with, or plan a visit to a rural town in a Spanish-speaking country where you will be obligated to use your language skills."

Introduce yourself.,
Find borrowed Spanish words in English.,
Understand gendered nouns.,
Memorize Spanish pronouns.,
Understand the basic sentence structure in Spanish.,
Pick up situational words and phrases.",How to Speak Spanish (Basics)1," One of the easiest things to learn is how to greet others, and it can be a good introduction to the language as well as giving you an essential tool that will open the door to communication with others in Spanish.Hola (OH-la) means ""hello"" in Spanish. Even if you know very little Spanish, it's likely you already know and understand this word. There are other initial greetings in Spanish, such as buenos días (booEHN-os DEE-as), which means ""good morning,"" or buenos noches (booEHN-os NO-chehs), which means ""good evening.""
Following the hello, you might next learn ""¿Cómo estás?"" (KOH-moh ess-TAHS), which means ""How are you?"" This might be answered by saying estoy bien (ESS-toy bee-EHN), which means ""I'm fine.""
You also might say mucho gusto (MOO-choh GOOS-toh), which means ""nice to meet you."" Then learn how to say ""my name is"": me llamo (meh YAH-moh). Put them together, and you might greet someone in Spanish by saying ""Mucho gusto, me llamo Juan,"" which means ""Nice to meet you, my name is John."";
, Although you probably don't pronounce them exactly the way a Spanish-speaking person would, there are a number of Spanish words that you probably already know if you are fluent in English.Making a list of Spanish words that you already know can be a good way to build your Spanish vocabulary, because it gives you a foundation on which to build.
For example, there probably are a number of Spanish foods that you already know, such as taco and burrito.
There also are a number of words that are the same in Spanish and in English (although they may be spelled or pronounced differently), such as animal and chocolate.

, One of the things that makes Spanish very different from English is the fact that all objects are gendered. Generally, if a noun ends in an o it is masculine, while if it ends in a it is feminine (although there are some exceptions).In Spanish, unlike in English, there is no pronoun ""it."" All nouns have a gender, and even inanimate objects are referred to the same as people, using the same pronouns.
Keep in mind that the gender you use matches the gender of the word, not the gender of the thing. This can be an issue when the thing you're talking about is an animal. For example, if you're talking about a dog, you would say ""el perro"" (ehl PEH-rroh), which is masculine, even if the dog was female.

, Just as in English, verbs are conjugated according to the pronoun you need to use. However, in Spanish, it isn't strictly necessary to say the pronoun or even include it in the sentence. Your reader or listener will understand which pronoun you used by the conjugation of the verb.For example, if you want to say you want something, you could say ""yo quiero"" (YO kee-EHR-OH), which means ""I want,"" but you could also simply say ""quiero"" and the pronoun would be understood.
Spanish pronouns include yo meaning I, nosotros meaning we, él meaning he, ella meaning she, and ellos and ellas meaning they. Use ellas if you are referring to a group that is entirely feminine and ellos for a group that is either entirely masculine, or is a mixed-gender group.
Spanish has two different forms of the pronoun ""you"" – a formal and an informal form. Use tú if you are speaking to someone with whom you're familiar, or someone close to you in age or younger. For older people, people in positions of authority, or people you don't know, use the polite, formal form usted. The plural of you (meaning ""you all"") is ustedes. In Spain, there is another familiar form of the plural you: vosotros or vosotras. In other Spanish-speaking countries, only ustedes is used.

, While the basic sentence structure in Spanish is quite similar to English sentence structure, there are some differences. Getting in the right structural mindset will help you become more comfortable thinking and speaking in Spanish.Like English, Spanish sentences are formed with a subject, followed by a verb, followed by the object of that verb. For example, suppose you said ""yo quiero un burrito."" This means I (subject) want (verb) a burrito (object).
However, unlike in English, in Spanish the adjectives go after the thing they describe. For example, if you were talking about a red book, in English you would put the adjective (red) first. In Spanish, you would be talking about a libro rojo (LEE-bro ROH-ho).

, Depending upon your reasons for learning Spanish, there may be particular words that will be most useful to you as you're starting to learn how to speak Spanish. Starting in a familiar area will help you build the foundation you need.Think about words or phrases that you say frequently throughout your day. For example, you probably say ""please"" and ""thank you"" several times a day. If you're not already familiar with por favor (pohr fah-VOR) and gracías (gra-SEE-ahs), they are easy Spanish words to learn (and also polite things to say).
If someone says gracías to you, you can respond by saying de nada (deh NA-da), which means ""you're welcome"" (or more literally ""it was nothing"").
You also want to learn the Spanish words for ""yes"" and ""no"" early on, if you don't already know them. They are sí (see) and no (no).

Visit a Spanish-speaking country.,
Watch Spanish-language television.,
Talk to Spanish-speaking people.,
Listen to Spanish-language music.,
Change the language on your devices.,
Label household items.",How to Speak Spanish (Basics)2," If you have some basic conversational phrases down, taking a trip to a place in which the primary language spoken is Spanish can help you learn and understand the language more rapidly.The process of immersion may be the quickest way to learn any language. If you think about it, that's the way you learned your first language. You probably knew how to speak long before you went to school and learned the rules of grammar. You were speaking (more or less) correctly long before you learned how to read and write.
Immersion works if you want to be conversational in a language. However, it will not teach you how to read and write. You still will have to learn spelling and grammar, but this might be easier if you already know how to speak.
There are a number of schools and programs in Spanish-speaking countries that enable you to learn Spanish through immersion while also experiencing Spanish or Latin American culture. If you can't afford to make a trip abroad, though, there are ways you can effectively immerse yourself at home.

, You may have trouble picking out the individual words when you listen to Spanish, making it difficult for you to understand the person speaking. Watching Spanish language television can help train your ear to distinguish the sounds.To start with, look for television shows or movies with which you're already familiar that are over-dubbed in Spanish. Since you already have a general idea of what the characters are saying, you'll start to pick up words and understand intuitively what they mean.
Adding Spanish subtitles as well as listening in Spanish can help you follow along better, and also train your brain to associate particular letters with particular sounds.
As you start getting the hang of it, move on to television shows or movies that you've never seen and test your familiarity.

, As many people as there are in the world who speak Spanish, you don't have to travel to Spain or to a Latin American country to find native speakers who are willing to converse with you.Talking and listening to Spanish speakers can help you better understand the flow of conversation. Native speakers also can correct errors you're making before you embarrass yourself or end up with problems because you are misunderstood.
Keep in mind that there are pronunciation differences in different countries. Someone from Spain is going to sound very different from someone who learned to speak in Mexico, and someone from Mexico will have a different accent than someone from Colombia – just as people from Great Britain speak English differently than Americans.
When you're just starting, you may want to seek out people from Mexico or Ecuador, since they tend to speak more slowly.

, Because song lyrics are slower, and more repetitive, than regular speech, music is a good way to start identifying individual words and connecting them in your mind with their written form.If you have satellite radio, you can find numerous Spanish music stations, as well as talk-radio stations. Depending on where you live, you may even be able to find a Spanish-language radio station on the AM or FM dial.
Apart from radio, you can easily find a wealth of Spanish music online. You might start by doing an internet search for the Top 40 in a particular Spanish-speaking country, such as Mexico or Colombia.
Find some songs you like, then do an internet search for the lyrics. That way you can read along as the song plays to better connect the written and spoken word in your mind.

, Using the settings on your smart phone, computer, or tablet, you can change the default language from English to Spanish. Since you already know where menu items are, this change will help you learn those words in Spanish.Many websites and social media platforms also allow you to change your default language. You could even change the language for your web browser, or use a translate plug-in to translate English-language web pages into Spanish. Be careful with these, though, as they're not always accurate and may not be the best translation.
You also can look for Spanish-language websites and try to read those. Many news sites will have a video along with a transcript of the video, so you can read and listen at the same time.

, Giving yourself a visual reminder of the Spanish word for something you encounter on a daily basis will eventually set that word firmly in your mind, giving you a larger Spanish vocabulary.All you need for this project is a pen or marker, paper, and tape. Make sure you're using an adhesive that won't peel paint or damage the item you're labeling, because you'll probably want to take it off later.
Don't try to label everything at once – it may be overwhelming. Choose 5 to 10 items, look up the Spanish word for those things, and label them. Once you know those things, take the labels off and move on to a different set of items. If you find you forgot something, simply go back and do it again.

Schedule time each day to practice.,
Set measurable language goals.",How to Speak Spanish (Basics)3," If you have the resources to do so, taking a formal class or hiring a private coach or tutor may help you learn Spanish more quickly.#*The benefit of having a coach or tutor is that you have someone else who is holding you accountable.


If you can't afford to hire someone yourself, or don't have the opportunity to take a class, consider learning the language with a friend so the two of you can hold each other accountable.

, There are numerous websites and mobile apps that will teach you the basics of Spanish, and many of them are free. Don't expect these resources to bring you to fluency, but they can help your skills in limited areas.There also are programs out there that may require a pretty substantial initial investment. If you have the money and think the program would be a good investment, go for it – but keep in mind you don't have to spend any money to learn Spanish.
Websites and mobile apps are good for drilling vocabulary and basic phrases, but typically you'll end up with a pretty scattered understanding of Spanish. Be prepared to do some immersion (either at home or abroad) if you want to become truly fluent.
These programs typically will be better if your goal is to be able to read and write Spanish. If your primary goal is to be conversational, you're better off actually having conversations.

, You aren't going to learn to speak Spanish overnight – it will take time. Decide how long your sessions are going to be, and try to have them at the same time each day so your language practice becomes habitual.Using a schedule on your computer or smart phone is a good option because you can set up notifications to alert you when it's time to start working on your Spanish.
Don't practice for so long that you're going to get bored or bogged down, but make sure your sessions are long enough that you can get something out of them. For example, if you're practicing for 15 minutes each evening, spend about five minutes reviewing what you learned the previous day, five minutes learning something new, and then the final five minutes reviewing what you just learned.

, The idea of learning an entire language can be overwhelming – especially when you think about how long it took you to learn your first language. Breaking that down into smaller, reachable goals enables you to monitor your progress.Your goals may relate to the language itself, or they may relate to your methods. For example, if you're watching a Spanish-language television show to learn Spanish through immersion, you might set the goal of watching one episode each evening. A language-related goal might be to learn 5 new verbs each week.
Write your goals down and evaluate your progress each week. If you fail to meet a goal, try not to get too down about it. Simply reassess and figure out what went wrong. If it's something you can correct by making an adjustment, make that adjustment and try again next week.

Use ""de nada."",
Switch to ""por nada.,
Say ""no hay de qué."",
Say ""a la orden"" o ""a su/tu orden"".",How to Say You're Welcome in Spanish1," This is the standard, textbook way of answering “you're welcome” when someone thanks you.A slightly more accurate English equivalent would be the response, “it's nothing,” rather than “you're welcome.”

De is a preposition that can be translated to ""of,"" ""from,"" ""about,"" ""as,"" or ""with,"" depending on the phrase it modifies. The most common translation is ""of,"" however.Nada is a noun meaning ""nothing.""
The strictest, most literal translation of the phrase would be ""of nothing"" or ""about nothing.""
Note that there is no verb in this phrase, so the way it is said or written does not change based on who you speak to.;
,""While much less common, por nada is another way of saying “you're welcome” that roughly translates to “it's nothing.”

More literally, por nada means something along the lines of for nothing. In Spanish, por is a preposition usually used to mean “for” or “on account of.”Note that this phrase is not used in every Spanish-speaking country. It is used in various Latin American countries, like Costa Rica and Puerto Rico, but it is not used in all Latin American countries or in Spain.

, The literal translation of this phrase does not make much sense in English, but the general meaning is ""nothing to thank for."" It's pretty common and more polite than ""de nada"".



Hay translates to ""there,"" so no hay is close to saying ""not there"" or ""there is not.""

Qué translates to ""what.""

, This translates to ""at your command/at the command"" meaning that if there's anything else you can assist with, you will be very much willing to do it at the person's command. It is very polite and very common. Some countries use ""tu"" more prominently than ""usted"" (and vice versa) and this depends if you use 'a su orden' or 'a tu orden'. ""A la orden"" is neutral."
"
Understand that the Spanish language does have two words for ""wife"" and ""husband"".,Pronounce the ""J"" as a ""h"", you would pronounce it as ""moo-haer""

,
There's also the word ""esposa"" which is considered more formal in Spain, but it is regularly used as first option in Lationamerican countries.,
""Husband and wife"" in Spain is normally said "" Marido y mujer "" and in LatinoAmerica the most used expression would be ""Esposo y esposa"".",How to Say Wife in Spanish," The first one is ""MUJER"" and is normally more used in Spain, meaning ""wife"" as well as ""woman"". The person listening will know the difference of meaning by context.;
,, ""Esposa"" is like the English ""spouse"". Its masculine form is ""esposo"".

, ""They lived like husband and wife without being married "" would be "" Vivían como marido y mujer sin estar casados"" o ""vivían como esposo y esposa sin estar casados"".

"
"
Say ""con gusto."",
State ""con mucho gusto."",
Use ""es mi placer” only if you're feeling especially polite.",How to Say You're Welcome in Spanish2," This phrase is literally translated to “with pleasure” in English.



Con translates to with in Spanish.
As a noun, gusto can be translated to “pleasure.”, This phrase literally means “with much pleasure.” You can also say ""con gusto"".

Don't just say ""mucho gusto"" as this phrase (short for ""mucho gusto en conocerte"" or ""I am pleased to meet you"") is more often used as a response to an introduction rather than a way of saying “you're welcome.”

, This saying means “it is my pleasure.” This one is fancy and sparingly said. Use it if you're trying to get someone's interest in you, or if you're trying to impress, or if you simply woke up in a really good mood that day and felt like sprinkling love and kindness everywhere.



Es is a form of the verb ser, meaning “to be.” This is the third person singular conjugation, so it is essentially the same as saying “it is.”

Mi is a way of showing ownership and means “my.”

Placer means “pleasure.”Similarly, you could also simply state “un placer,” or “a pleasure,” to imply that the favor you are being thanked for was a pleasure to perform.
Don't use ""el placer es mío."" Translated literally, this means, “The pleasure is mine.” This is used in response to an introduction. For example, you would say it in response to ""Es un placer conocerte Pedro"" (it's a pleasure to meet you Pedro).

Remember that the word for ""wonderful"" in Spanish is: maravilloso.,
Pronounce it correctly: MAH-ruh-vee-YOH-soh


If you are saying this to a woman, you say maravillosa (an ""ah"" sound at the end to signify you're speaking to a woman).

,
The word for ""you"" is ""tú"".,The verb ""are"" in this context is ""es""

,
Add these three together and you get:


Tú eres maravilloso or
Usted es maravillosa.

,
Pronounce the ""ll"" like a soft ""j"" instead of a ""y"" (i.e.",How to Say You Are Wonderful in Spanish," It looks a lot like our English word: marvelous.

,, But, if you want to be more formal and polite, you say ""usted"".

,,, joh instead of yoh). But it's not a big deal as many Spaniards mispronounce them, prevailing the ""y"" sound, a very short ""e"" like the second ""i"", in ""idiot"".;
"
"
Learn the word ""año."",
Memorize common phrases with the word año.,
Use ""años"" to talk about longer periods of time.,
Use siglo to talk about an age or period of time.,
Say specific years correctly.",How to Say Year in Spanish1," The basic word for ""year"" in Spanish is ""año."" In most contexts, you can use this word in Spanish just as you would in English and you'll be fine. Even if there's a different phrase, people will still understand what you mean.Año is a masculine noun, so make sure to use the masculine form for any related verbs, prepositions, and adjectives in your sentence. For example, if you want to say ""the year 2013,"" you would say ""el año 2013,"" using the masculine article.;
, Just as in English, Spanish has a number of phrases that are popularly used when talking about things that happen periodically. Many of these phrases use the word año.For example, if you want to say something happens every year, you would use the phrase ""cada año."" Note that while in English you might say ""each year"" or ""every year,"" in Spanish there's only one phrase used interchangeably.
Similarly, the Spanish phrase ""este año"" can mean ""this year"" or ""all year"" (although you can also say ""todo el año"" for ""all year"").
There are common phrases for holidays and other special occasions as well. For example, you can say ""feliz año nuevo"" for ""happy new year,"" or ""cumpleaños feliz"" for ""happy birthday.""

, In English, you can talk generally about ""years"" meaning a relatively undetermined period of time. You probably know other words that refer to long periods of time as well. Similar words exist in Spanish.For example, if you wanted to say that something takes years, you might say ""tarda años,"" which literally means ""it takes years."" But you could also get more creative and say ""tarda eternidad,"" or ""it takes forever.""

, In English, you may talk about a period of several years using the actual word years or a word such as age. You can do the same thing in Spanish with the word siglo (SEE-glow), which technically means ""century"" but is also used for indefinitely long periods of time.You also can use this word when you want to say you haven't seen someone in years. While you could say ""hace años que no te veo,"" literally ""I haven't seen you for years,"" using siglos instead of años is also appropriate.

, When you're talking about a specific date, the words you use in Spanish are a little different than the words you would use in English. If you don't use the right words for a specific year, people won't understand you.For example, think about the year 1986. In English, you would say ""nineteen eighty-six."" In Spanish you need to include the thousands and hundreds, though, so you would say ""mil novecientos ochenta y seis."" This literally translates to ""one thousand nine hundreds eighty and six.""
If you are saying ""the year 1986"" in Spanish, you would say ""el año mil novecientos ochenta y seis.""

"
"
Use the verb tener with año when talking about your age.,
Ask someone how old they are by saying ""¿Cuántos años tienes?"",
Learn specific words for age ranges.",How to Say Year in Spanish2," The Spanish verb tener means ""to have,"" which can be confusing for English speakers. If you want to tell someone how old you are in Spanish, you say you have a certain number of years.For example, you might say ""tengo diez años,"" which means ""I am ten years old."" The literal translation is ""I have ten years,"" but when you hear it or see it in writing, remember that in this context the verb tener means ""to be"" rather than ""to have.""

Tener is a regular verb and is conjugated using the normal rules for conjugation of Spanish verbs ending in -er.

, Just as you use the verb tener (to have) to say how old you are, use the same verb to ask someone how old they are.The phrase is pronounced ""coo-AHN-tohs AHN-yos tee-EHN-ehs."" You should think of it as meaning ""How old are you?"" even though a literal translation would be ""How many years do you have?""

, Just as in English, Spanish has specific words for particular times in your life. You could use a phrase with the word ""year,"" or you could use one of these other words.For example, if you wanted to talk about your early years, or your childhood, you could use the phrase ""primeros años"" (literally ""early years""). You also could say ""en mi infancia"" or ""en mi juventud,"" phrases which mean more specifically ""in my childhood"" or ""in my youth.""

Talk about an academic year with the word curso (COOR-soh).,
Describe an age group using the word generación.,
Use cosecha or vendimia when talking about wine.",How to Say Year in Spanish3," In English, you use the same word to talk about a school year or a 12-month period of time. Spanish has a different word, although in practice the two are used interchangeably.Curso is a masculine noun. It is primarily used to refer to an academic year, but it also can be used as a translation of the English word ""course.""
For example, you might say ""El curso acaba en junio,"" or ""The school year ends in June.""

, The Spanish word generación (hen-er-rahs-ee-OHN) is similar to the English word generation, but sometimes can be used in contexts where you would use the word year in English.Typically generación is used to mean year in an academic setting. It refers to a specific year of students, such as the class of 2017. This group is a ""generation"" in the sense that you're talking about everyone in that graduating class.
For example, you might say ""El príncipe William y yo estuvimos en la misma generación en el Colegio Eton"" if you wanted to tell someone ""Prince William and I were in the same year at Eton College.""

, If you're a wine enthusiast, you probably hear people talking in English about good years and bad years. In Spanish, rather than using año, you'll more frequently hear these words.Cosecha (coh-SAY-chuh) refers to a harvest generally, but can be used when talking about wine. Vendimia (vin-dim-EE-uh) refers more specifically to a harvest of grapes, so it's a more specific term.
For example, you might say ""1994 fue una buena vendimia"" or ""1994 fue una buena cosecha"" to mean ""1994 was a good year .""

Use ""a"" for movement and destinations.,
Stick with ""a"" when expressing indirect objects.,
Express a proportion or ratio with “a.” When ""to"" is used in a numerical proportion, translate it to ""a."",
Define relationships and comparisons with ""a."",
Explain intention with ""a.""",How to Say To in Spanish1," When the English ""to"" is synonymous for ""toward,"" the Spanish ""a"" is the most suitable translation.It is also the most suitable when someone is going to a certain destination.


Example: to go to Spain
Translation: ir a"" España

Example: to go to the library
Translation: ir a la biblioteca;
, When an action is done to another person or something is given to another person, the ""to"" used in reference to the other person or indirect object of the sentence is usually translated to ""a.""


Example: Maria gave the book to her brother.
Translation: Maria dio el libro a su hermano.

,


Example: He won with a vote of three to one.
Translation: Ganó con un voto de tres a uno.

, When one object is described in relation or comparison to another object, translate the ""to"" to ""a.""


Example: the book to the left of the lamp
Translation: el libro a la izquierda de la lámpara

, In expressions using ""to"" to describe someone's intentions, translate the word to ""a.""


Example: He went to study.
Translation: Se fue a estudiar.

"
"
Use ""hasta"" when meaning “until.” In expressions for which ""to"" actually means ""until,"" ""hasta"" is the most accurate translation.Example: to the end of the week
Translation hasta el final de la semana

,
Translate ""up to"" as ""hasta.""",How to Say To in Spanish2,", If a condition is true up to a certain point, use hasta.


Example: to study up to the next exam
Translation: estudiar hasta el siguiente examen

"
"
Use ""hacia"" to express movement.,
Define a recipient of action with ""hacia.""",How to Say To in Spanish3," Hacia can also be used in expressions when ""to"" stands for ""towards.""Example: to the left
Translation: hacia la izquierda

, If an attitude or action is performed to someone or something, ""hacia"" can be used.


Example: She is hostile to her sister.
Translation: Es hostil hacia su hermana.

"
"
Opt for ""sobre"" for ""to"" conditions meaning ""upon."",
Use “de” when “to” stands for “of” or “from.” This is true when to indicates possession or defines relationships.,
Define ratios with ""contra.""",How to Say To in Spanish4," If something is put to or upon something, ""sobre"" is an appropriate translation.Example: to put ink to paper
Translation: poner tinta sobre papel

,


Example: the secret to success
Translation: el secreto del éxito
Example: husband to the queen
Translation: esposo de la reina

, Numerical ratios can be expressed with contra instead of a.


Example: He won with a vote of three to one.
Translation: Ganó con un voto de tres contra uno.

Be polite and considerate.",How to Speak American English," American English is, for the most part, just the same as any other English. Apart from some phrases, colloquialisms, dialects, and spellings, most of the language is the same as the English spoken in Britain, Australia, Canada, and elsewhere around the globe. There are a few significant local differences, which leads some people to say that these groups are ""separated by a common language."" But in reality, most of the words and phrases are the same. If you know English and understand non-American English speakers, too, for the most part, you will do fine in America.;
, American English is spoken differently in each region of the U.S. Listen closely to pick up local phrases and colloquialisms, especially in social settings. You will begin to notice the difference when you travel from one region to another.


For some articles on regional accents and expressions, check out How to Imitate a Texan Accent, How to Speak With a Bostonian Accent, How to Speak With a Convincing New Jersey Accent, How to Talk Like a New Yorker, How to Fake a Chicago Accent, and How to Talk Like a Southern Gentleman.

, You'll learn as you go, but here is a short list of American English, just to get you acquainted.


""Awesome"" and ""cool"" are used to describe something great or positive or popular, more so than in other countries, and both words can be used as a positive reaction to something someone tells you, too.
""What's up?"" or ""Sup"" for short. This phrase is used to ask someone what they're doing, how they are, and as a general greeting. It is not socially acceptable in formal occasions, but it's fine to use casually with friends. It's most often used by young men.
""Hanging out"" is spending time somewhere or with someone. It can be used in describing or arranging one particular event (""Do you want to hang out?"") or more generally to describe a habit (""I hang out at the mall a lot""). It's a phrase often used by teenagers to describe how they pass time and socialize, often without one particular activity or aim. It can also be used to describe time spent around the house or doing nothing in particular (""What are you up to?"" / ""Not much; just hanging out"").
""Y'all"" is a contraction of ""You all"", the second person plural mode of directly addressing a group of people. It is used primarily in the Southern States but is acceptable in other regions.
Soda, Pop, Cola, Sodapop, Coke, etc. Fizzy sweetened beverages like Fanta, Coca-Cola, Sierra Mist, and Dr. Pepper, may be referred to using these different names in different areas of the states.

, If you've studied British English in the past, realize that not all of the words and phrases will be identical in the US. If you use British English words, phrases, or spellings in these situations, you might not be understood. Learn the American versions instead:


Restroom/bathroom instead of Toilet/Lavatory
Elevator instead of Lift
Trunk instead of Boot
Freeway instead of motorway
Sweater instead of jumper
Pants for trousers, not underwear
Vest for waistcoat (the underwear version is often just called an undershirt instead)
Sneakers instead of Trainers
Diaper instead of nappy
Bathing suit instead of swimming costume
Vacation instead of holiday (holidays tend to mean national bank holidays only)
French fries instead of chips
Chips instead of crisps
Gasoline instead of Petrol
Truck instead of Lorry
Flashlight instead of Torch
Color instead of colour
Favorite instead of Favourite
Popsicle instead of Ice Lolly
Tire instead of Tyre
Napkins should only be used to wipe your face at dinnertime

, Don't expect everyone to know or understand your unique dialect. The US is an immigrant nation and has always welcomed newcomers to their country. However, they seldom learn to speak other languages. 95% of Americans will never travel to all 50 of the United States much less travel abroad, so if they don't understand you well or speak your language... don't think they are ignorant, they are just practical.

, If you do not speak good English, don't be offended if an American jokes or laughs when you say something that doesn't make sense to them. For some Americans, laughter can be a way of trying to reduce the frustration with language barriers; it isn't intended disrespectfully. Just laugh too, as it is common and natural for misunderstandings in the beginning.

, You might meet someone friendly, or someone rude, but that doesn't mean they represent all Americans. Additionally, attitudes can vary depending on where you are and who you're talking to; the attitude of people in large cities may be somewhat different than the attitude of those living in rural or farming communities. People in major cities tend to do things more briskly and may seem rude to you. Please don't generalize this as a representation of how the USA acts. If three New Yorkers are rude to you, don't go home and tell all your friends, ""Americans are rude.""

, It's perfectly acceptable over in the States, and it creates an atmosphere of congeniality.

, Don't always speak what’s on your mind, if it might sound offensive. That doesn't mean mute all of your thoughts but try to construct them in a way that won't offend your host. Manners matter, and it's important to be gracious, considerate, and kind, especially to an American who's hosting you in their home.

Say “cảm ơn.” The nearest equivalent to the English phrase “thanks,” in Vietnamese uses the words “cảm” and “ơn.” These two words together translate literally to the directive to “feel favor.” Use “cảm ơn” when thanking someone informally.In English, the phrase “thank you” has the person you are addressing built in – “you.” In Vietnamese, however, you’ll also need to add a word to indicate the person you are addressing.,
Pronounce “cảm ơn” correctly.,
Include a personal pronoun.,
Emphasize your gratitude.,
Say thank you as formally as possible.",How to Say Thank You in Vietnamese1,";
, Since Vietnamese is a tonal language, pronunciation is extremely important to the meaning of both words and phrases. When you’re hoping to say “thank you,” say “cảm” in a broken falling tone, and “ơn” in a flat tone.Since it is hard to imagine these sounds from simply reading about them, listen to recordings of the phrase online.When pronounced correctly, “cảm ơn” will sound like “gauhm uhhn”.
The “auh” portion of the first word is sounded out in a rising, then falling voice.

, Increase the politeness of your expression by including a personal pronoun corresponding with the person you are addressing. In other words, say, “cám ơn,” in addition to an appropriate word for “you” in Vietnamese. Use “bà,” pronounced “baa,” when addressing an older woman, and “cô,” pronounced “coh,” to address a young girl.Use “ông”, pronounced “ohng,” to address a man who is older than you, and “anh,” pronounced “ang,” when thanking a young man.
For instance; “cám ơn cô” means “thank you,” as you would say it to a young woman.

, Add “nhiều lắm,” pronounced “nyee-oh luhm,” after saying “cảm ơn” to express especially strong gratitude. This addition indicates the English equivalent of ""a lot"" or ""so much.”Accordingly, say, “cảm ơn nhiều lắm,” pronounced “gauhm uhhn nyee-oh luhm,” if you’re hoping to more strongly convey your gratitude., The Vietnamese language includes another word to help express appreciation in contexts that requires extreme formality and politeness. In particular, the word “xin,” which translates to “to ask” or even “to beg” is placed before “cảm ơn.” Altogether, say “xin cảm ơn,” pronounced like “sin gauhm uhhn.” "
"
Smile when you receive a compliment.,
Accept a smile instead of many common phrases.,
Use other nonverbal expressions.,
Avoid holding eye contact.,
Say “you’re welcome.” In Vietnamese, the equivalent of the English phrase “you’re welcome” is synonymous with “there isn’t any problem.” Accordingly, say, “không có gì” to say “it’s nothing” or “không có chi” to say “you’re welcome” when someone thanks you.",How to Say Thank You in Vietnamese2," Vietnamese culture dictates that smiles are often used to convey appreciation instead of a verbal expression of thanks. Think of a smile as a silent “thank you.” Modesty is highly respected in Vietnamese culture, and deflecting a compliment with a smile is the best way to express appreciation for a compliment modestly.Similarly, if you pay someone a compliment, do not expect them to express their gratitude verbally.

, In English, people are often quick to say “hello,” as well as “thank you” and “sorry” in many different contexts. In Vietnamese culture, a smile often take the place of these phrases. In fact, anyone who is older or in a position of authority will usually not thank younger or subordinate people verbally. Accordingly, do not be offended if you do not receive a verbal thank you for a favor.In particular, do not expect someone who is your parents age or a teacher to say thank you. Instead, you will likely receive a nod.

, Other expressions are also used to emphasize statements or replace verbal communication. Some common physical gestures, however, have different connotations in Vietnamese culture. For instance, avoid patting someone’s back or pointing while talking, as these actions will be perceived as disrespectful. Similarly, avoid placing your hands in your pocket or on your hips, especially while expressing gratitude.Cross your arms when expressing gratitude. This is considered a sign of respect.

, Eye contact with someone of a greater age or social status may be taken as a challenge. Meanwhile, eye contact with someone of the opposite gender indicates affection or desire. Accordingly, take care not to maintain eye contact with a anyone who may misread your expression. In fact, avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect.Since people maintain eye contact when speaking in many other cultures, averting your eyes may be hard to get used to.
Practice looking away from a conversation partner's eyes before you go to Vietnam.

,""Không"" is spoken in a flat tone, while ""có"" is spoken in a rising tone. ""Không có chi"" is pronounced ""khong koh tsee.""

",How to Speak Basic Croatian,":


A, a: Stressed /a/ sounds like the ""a"" of Spanish or Italian ""mano"". English-speakers should aim for a sound that is between the ""a"" of ""fat"" and the ""a"" of ""father"", but somewhat closer to the latter. Unstressed /a/ generally approaches the sound of ""u"" in English ""cup"" or, especially when final, the ""a"" of ""sofa"".
E, e: Stressed /e/ generally comes close to the ""e"" of English ""bed""; in the vicinity of /j/, however, Croatian /e/ sounds more like the ""a"" of English ""make"". The unstressed variety sounds like a cross between the ""e"" of ""bed"" and the ""u"" of ""bud"".
I, i: Stressed /i/ is pronounced like the ""i"" of Spanish or Italian ""si"". It is similar to the ""i"" of English ""police"", but shorter than the diphthong of English ""green"" or ""seed"". Unstressed /i/ is more like the ""i"" of English ""sit"", or, better, German ""mit"".
O, o: Stressed /o/ is quite close to the ""o"" of Spanish ""bola"" or English ""port"". Unstressed /o/ tends to sound a little more like the ""u"" of American English ""putt"".
U, u: Stressed /u/ is similar to the ""u"" of Spanish or Italian ""tu"" or the ""oo"" of English ""boot"". When unstressed, /u/ sounds more like the ""u"" of English ""put"".
R, r (which isn't always counted as a vowel, depending on its function in the context): Stressed or unstressed syllabic /r/ consists of a short schwa , as in Spanish ""rojo"" or ""perro"" (see also the ""consonantal /r/"" below). The initial syllable of ""Hrvat"", for example, sounds roughly like English ""her"" pronounced with a trilled /r/.

, This phoneme can occur word-initially in Croatian, a position it does not occupy in standard English. In vernacular English, however, the sound does occur initially in ""'tsup?"", an abbreviation of the phrase ""What's up?""
Č ,č: as the ""ch"" in ""check""
Ć ,ć: no English equivalent. Place the tip of the tongue behind the lower front teeth and try to produce a ""mixed sound"" between the ""ch"" of ""check"" and the ""t"" (actually ""ty"") of British English ""tune""
D, d: as the ""d"" in ""dog"", except that the tip of the tongue touches the backs of the upper teeth, rather than the gum, as in English
Dž, dž as ""j"" in ""jeep"" or ""jungle"", but pronounced harder than in English
Đ ,đ: no English equivalent. Place the tip of the tongue behind the lower front teeth and try to produce a ""mixed sound"" between the ""j"" of ""jar"" and the ""d"" (actually ""dy"") of British English ""duke""
F, f: as the ""f"" in English ""fun""
G, g: as the ""g"" in English ""get""
H, h: as the ""j"" of Spanish ""mujer"" or the ""ch"" of German ""ach"", but generally softer, less ""harsh""-sounding than these. In unstressed syllables, /h/ may approach the of English ""hot"". Some speakers use in all positions.
J, j: as the ""y"" of English ""yes"" or the ""y"" of English ""boy"", depending on whether it occurs at the beginning or the end of a syllable
K, k: as the ""c"" of Spanish or Italian ""caro"" or the ""unaspirated 'k'"" of English ""ski""
L, l: as the ""clear 'l'"" of British English ""like"" or ""let""(or that of Spanish or Italian ""la""). In American English, these words may be pronounced with a ""clear 'l'"" or with a much ""darker"" variety similar to that which occurs at the ends of English words such as ""dull"" and ""call"". Croatian /l/ is always ""clear"". In addition, the tip of the tongue touches the backs of the upper teeth, rather than the gum, as in English.
LJ, lj: as the British English pronunciation of the ""lli"" in ""million"", i.e., with a ""clear 'l'"" followed by a short ""y""-sound
M, m: as the ""m"" in ""meet""
N, n: as the ""n"" in ""note"", but with the tip of the tongue touching the backs of the upper teeth, rather than the gum, as in English
NJ, nj: as the ""ni"" in ""onion"", i.e., an ""n"" followed by a short ""y""-sound
P, p: as the ""p"" in Spanish or Italian ""palma"" or the ""unaspirated 'p'"" of English ""spy""
R, r: as the ""r"" of Spanish or Italian ""caro"", i.e., a single flap of the tongue against the upper gum. This sound occurs in some Britons' pronunciation of the ""r"" of ""very"", which Americans hear as ""veddy"", as well as in most Americans' pronunciation of the ""dd"" in ""ladder"" and the ""tt"" of ""latter"", when these words are made to rhyme. Note: Croatian ""r"" may also function as a vowel (see above).
S, s: as the ""s"" in English ""six""
Š ,š : [] as the ""sh"" in English ""ship""
T, t: as the ""t"" in Spanish or Italian ""tu"" or the ""unaspirated 't'"" of English ""stop"", except that the tip of the tongue touches the backs of the upper teeth, rather than the gum
V, v: as the ""w"" in Dutch ""wat"". When preceeding /e/ and /i/ in stressed syllables, the Croatian /v/ sounds similar to the English ""v"" in ""vat"", but with a ""looser"", more lax, contact between the lower lip and the upper teeth. When unstressed or preceeding /a/, /o/ and /u/, Croatian /v/ is weaker still, sounding to English-speakers much like the ""w"" of ""war""
Z ,z: as the ""z"" in English ""zero""
Ž ,ž: [] as the ""s"" in ""measure"" or the ""zh"" in ""Zhivago""

The letter R is pronounced much stronger than in English, as you must roll your tongue to say it.Some letters are pronounced only slightly differently than they would be in American or British English.

In Finnish, ""U"" is pronounced as it would be in the word ""fall"" in English.A few letters have a completely different pronunciation in Finnish. J is pronounced like a hard Y in English. Y in Finnish can be difficult to pronounce for English speakers. To pronounce ""Y,"" pronounce the 'u' in 'full'. You can listen to pronunciations of the Finnish Y online to see how close you are to approximating the sound.Sometimes, A's and O's have two dots above them to indicate a different pronunciation. Ä is pronounced like the ""A"" in ""hat."" Ö would be pronounced like the ""u"" in ""fur.""If a word has two of the same letter next to each other, they make the same pronouncing ion but extended, such as 'hiss' having two 's' letters rather than 'his' which has one.;
, There are a variety of basic phrases you might need to use for day-to-day interaction that you should learn. You should practice writing these phrases down and pronouncing them a few times a day.


The phrase ""Do you speak English"" can be pronounced in one of two ways in Finnish. Formally, you would say ""Puhutteko englantia?"" Informally, you would say, ""Puhutko englantia?""For shopping and going out, there are some phrases that are useful to know. ""How much is this?"" would be ""Paljonko tämä maksaa?"" ""Where is the toilet/bathroom?"" would be, ""Missä on vessa?"" You should know basic manners as well. ""Sorry"" is ""Anteeksi."" ""Thank you"" is ""Kiitos.""In the event you don't know how to say something, ""I don't know"" would be ""En tiedä"" and ""I don't understand"" would be ""En ymmärrä."", You should be able to have a basic conversation with someone if your goal is to learn basic Finnish. Strive to practice how to ask for someone's name, where they're from, and other conversational topics.


There are a variety of ways to say ""Hello"" in Finnish. You can say terve, hyvää päivää or päivää, to be polite. Moi is the most commonly used word for hello. Hei is like Hi. Speaking on the phone, it's appropriate to say, ""Haloo?""""How are you?"" can be said in different ways. Formerly, you would say ""Kuinka voitte?"" and informally you'd say, ""Kuinka voit?"". ""Miten menee?"" Is ""how is it going?""The phrase ""What's your name?"" also has formal and informal variations. Formerly, it would be ""Mikä teidän nimenne on?"" and informally ""Mikä sinun nimesi on?""To say ""My name is..."" you would say ""Nimeni on..."" To say ""I'm from..."" you would say ""Olen kotoisin ...sta."" To ask where someone else is from, you would say ""Mistä olet kotoisin?""You should also know basic greetings. ""Good morning"" is ""Hyvää huomenta."" ""Good afternoon"" is ""Hyvää päivää."" ""Good evening"" is ""Hyvää iltaa."" ""Good night"" is ""Hyvää yötä."", In the event of an emergency, you should know basic language to ask for help and contact authorities if necessary.


To say ""Help!"" you would say ""Apua!"" To say ""Stop!"" you would say ""Seis!""To alert someone of a fire, the word for fire is ""tulipalo."" To tell someone to call the police, you would say ""Soittakaa poliisille!"", It can be helpful to consult secondary sources when trying to learn another language, even if you're just trying to master the basics. Consider purchasing software or a book or two on Finnish language to help with the process.


Many software packages can be purchased online that help you learn Finnish through online lessons, tests, quizzes, and activities. Make sure you read reviews of any software you see before making a final purchase as not some packages may be better than others. See how useful other users found the programs before making any purchases. Also, there are some language learning tutorials offered for free download but make sure you do research on such packages to make sure they're not scams containing viruses or malware.
If you're struggling with pronunciation, many sites allow you to listen to basic words and phrases, including many of the phrases listed above, and might even provide tips and tricks to improve pronunciation.
Books on Finnish language can be purchased online through sites like Amazon or even at some college book stores.
Rosetta Stone, one of the most well known software tutorials for learning a second language, unfortunately does not currently sell a package on Finnish. However, they do take requests for adding new languages. Keep your eyes out as they may eventually add Finnish., An introductory language course can be really helpful when it comes to learning Finnish. Colleges and universities often allow non students to enroll in courses in their programs online for a fee.


Finlandia University, a private liberal arts school found in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, is one of the only institutions in the US that still teaches Finnish as a second language. They do offer some introductory language courses online. You can browse their website to find out how to registration and what fees to expect.
The University of Minnesota offers beginning Finnish online. You can check their websites for advice on how to enroll and what fees you'll need to pay., If possible, find a tutor to help you with the Finnish language. Finnish can be quite difficult to pronounce and one-on-one tutoring with a fluent speaker can be helpful.


As Finnish is not widely spoken as a second language, you may have to seek out tutors from other states, regions, or even countries if you cannot find someone in your own community.
You can do sessions via video chat features, such as Skype and Google Hangout, on your laptop. You can post ads looking for tutors in the forums of websites about Finnish language and culture. You could also contact one of the above listed universities to see if a student would be willing to tutor you. Make sure you can put some money towards sessions, however, as most tutors make between $20 and $60 per session.
Regionally, there are many Finnish Americans living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Some may speak the language, or at least know the basics. You might post an ad on Craig's List in this area stating you are looking for a long distance tutor. Finlandia University is located in Hancock, Michigan so post in the Houghton/Hancock section of Craig's List.

Understand the roots of Yiddish.",How to Say Thank You in Yiddish," Pronounce it ""ah donk"". This phrase directly translates to ""thank you."" Say it in any situation that calls for thanks., Say ""A sheynem dank"" (אַ שיינעם דאַנק) – pronounced ""ah shay-nem donk"". Bring out this phrase in situations where you are feeling especially grateful., If you're going to try speaking Yiddish, it's important that you take the time to say it right. Search for online videos or audio recordingsof people saying ""a dank"".If you know anyone that speaks Yiddish, try asking him or her to say it aloud for you.

, It is no coincidence that ""a dank"" and ""a sheynem dank"" sound like the German ""danke"" and ""danke schoen."" Yiddish is the traditional tongue of the Ashkenazi Jews. The language came about in 9th century Central Europe, drawing its influences from a rich cultural context of languages and peoples. Yiddish took elements from German, Hebrew, and Aramic, as well as certain Slavic and Romance languages.


Many Yiddish words (including אַ דאַנק, or ""a dank"") are written in the original Hebrew or Aramic. Words of European origin are written out using the phonetic pronunciation."

You can easily add ""am"" to the end of the word and say ""mam'noonam"", which sounds a little bit ladylike, but the usage is same.;
, This term may seem like it's French, and it is, but it's actually quite commonly used in Persian as well! Merci is written as مرسی in the Persian alphabet. While it's not originally Persian and you may be confused on why you'd use French, the word is quite useful, especially in Iran.

, This phrase, written as سپاسگزارم in Persian, is an original Persian term that translates to ""I am thankful"", and is often seen in books with a Persian alphabet as a formal word.


You can also say ""sepas"", which is the short form, but still formal.

, A formal way of saying ""thank you"", it's written as متشکرم in Persian. Most people think that this phrase sounds like Arabic, the reason being that ""moteshakeram"" is the latest version of ""mochakeram"" and as it's clear, the letter ""چ"" (ch) is replaced because it doesn't exist in Arabic alphabet.


You can easily remove ""am"" (which means ""I am"") and say ""moteshaker"".

, This is a Persian derivative of ""moteshakeram"". Written as مچکرم in Persian, it's considered informal slang, and isn't commonly used.


You can also remove ""am"" (meaning ""I am"") and say ""mochaker"", but this is a very friendly word. ""Mochaker dadash"" is the equivalent of ""thanks bro"".

, This phrase is a very formal way of saying ""thank you"" and isn't commonly used. ""Tashakkor mikonam"", written as تشکر می کنم in Persian, may look really Arabic, so Persian people usually don't use it.

, This may look a little bit different with the common way of saying ""thank you"", but still can be used. This phrase, written as لطف دارید in Persian, is usually used when responding to a compliment. The complete English translate is ""It's your kindness"", but it can be used as ""Thank you"".


You can easily remove ""d"" د from the end of the phrase to make it more friendly. (lotf dari لطف داری)

, This is considered extremely formal in Persian and usually used at the end of formal letters. Although the phrase ""ba tashakor"", written as با تشکر in Persian alphabet, can be seen as the ""sincerely"" of formal English letters, it literally translates to ""with thankfulness"" in English.


You may want to express deep thankfulness by adding ""faravan"" (færavan) at the end of the phrase. The full pronunciation is ""ba tashakor-e(ə) faravan"", written as با تشکر فراوان in the Persian alphabet.

Learn basic pronunciation.,
Familiarize yourself with the complexity of saying ""I love you"" in Vietnamese.,
Figure out how to address yourself.",How to Say I Love You in Vietnamese1," Before you attempt to say ""I love you"" in Vietnamese, take some time to familiarize yourself with basic pronunciation. This can aid you in the ability to correctly say the phrase.


Vowels are key in learning to pronounce Vietnamese, particularly for the phrase ""I love you."" There are roughly 11 vowel sounds in the Vietnamese language.One group of vowels is broken down under the letter ""a."" The vowel ""a"" without any pronunciation marks is pronounced like ""far"" in English. With the pronunciation mark ""ă,"" the vowel is pronounced like ""father."" With the pronunciation mark ""â"", it's pronounced like ""but.""A second group of vowel is broken down under ""e."" The vowel ""e"" without a pronunciation mark is pronounced as it is in ""red."" With the pronunciation mark ""ê,"" it's pronounced like the letter ""a"" in ""may.""The vowel group ""o"" has three different pronunciations. ""O"" without a pronunciation mark is pronounced like the ""a"" in ""law."" With the pronunciation mark ""ô,"" it's pronounced like the ""o"" in ""spoke."" With the pronunciation mark ""ơ"" it's pronounced like the ""i"" in ""sir.""The ""u"" vowel group is broken down into two pronunciations. ""U"" without a pronunciation mark is pronounced like the double o in ""boo."" With the pronunciation mark ""ư"" it's pronounced like the first half of ""uh-uh.""The letters ""i"" and ""y"" are pronounced like the ""e"" in ""me."";
, Saying ""I love you"" in Vietnamese is very different than saying it in English. There are many different ways to say ""I love you"" in Vietnamese depending on age, gender, and your relationship with that person. Before attempting to say ""I love you"" in Vietnamese, make sure you understand you cannot use one phrase for saying ""I love you"" to different people., Another factor that affects how to say ""I love you"" is how you address yourself. Vietnamese does not have a single version of the word ""I"" or ""me."" How you address yourself depends on the context of the situation.


How you address yourself in Vietnamese depends on how the person you're speaking to would address you. Family members address one another in accordance to region, level of formality, and whether or not you are of the same age. For others, you address people based on region and age.

"
"
Begin with 'Rwy'n'.,
Say 'Dy'.,
Say 'Caru', the verb form of 'love' in Welsh.,
End with 'Ti', the last word of the phrase, which mean 'you'.,
Put them all together and you can say 'Rwy'n dy garu di' to whoever you want to formally proclaim your love to them!

",How to Say I Love You in Welsh1," This is the Welsh word which is used for 'I'. It is an abbreviated version of 'Rwyf yn', which is directly translated as 'I am'. Welsh grammar is different to English grammar, but for this phrase, the first word is the same.


It is pronounced like 'ruin'.
Some Welsh pronounce the last part of the word differently due to regional dialects, but it is easier for beginners to stick with the Southern pronunciation (ruin).
When pronouncing this word, remember to pronounce it as one syllable rather than two.;
, This is the next word of the phrase. Directly translated, it means 'your' or 'thy'.


It is pronounced like 'duh'.

, But when it comes after 'Dy' in a phrase, it mutates into 'garu'.


It is pronounced like the name 'Gary' or 'Garry'.

, But it mutates into 'di' after the verb 'caru'.


It is pronounced like 'dee'.

Consider gender and age.,
Practice pronunciation.,
Learn the appropriate phrase.",How to Say I Love You in Vietnamese2," In English, the phrase “I love you” is the same regardless of the gender and age of the person saying it. In Vietnamese, there are three different gendered forms of the phrase I love you that are altered slightly based on a person's age.


""Anh yêu em"": man to woman
""Em yêu anh"": woman to man
""Tôi yêu bạn"": friend to friend (general)
Age plays a role in how you say “I love you” to a friend in Vietnamese as well. There are two different forms this phrase can take among friends of the same gender. They are ""Anh yêu em (If you are older)""and ""Em yêu anh (If you are younger).However, you should be aware that women prefer to be called “em” rather than “anh,” regardless of their age., Review the Vietnamese pronunciation guide. Then, take some time practicing how to say ""I love you.""


To say ""Anh yêu em"" correctly, pronounce it ""ah-n eew am.""
To say, ""Em yêu anh"" correctly, pronounce as ""am eew ah-n.""
To pronounce, ""Tôi yêu bạn"" correctly, pronounce it as ""th-oi eew ban.""
You can find pronunciation guides online and listen to how the words are pronounced. This can help you get a sense if you're saying the phrase correctly.

, If you don't want to say ""I love you"" there are other less intense phrases. Try ""I like you"" instead.


To say ""I like you,"" you would say ""Em thích anh"" if you're a girl talking to a boy. If you're a boy talking to a girl, you would say "" Anh thích em.""

"
"
Use 'Dw i'n'.,
Use 'Caru' as the verb for 'love'.,
Use 'Ti' for 'you'.,
Put them all together and you can say 'Dwi'n caru ti' informally to someone you love, or as an exclamation of exaggerated affection.

",How to Say I Love You in Welsh2," This is the Welsh way of saying 'I am' but in this phrase, means 'I'.


It is pronounced like 'doo-een'.

,


It is pronounced like 'carry' or the name 'Carrie'.

,


It is pronounced like 'tea'.

"
Say 'Ti', which is the Welsh word which directly translated to 'you'.,
Say 'Yw', the Welsh translation for 'are'.,
Say 'fy'.,
Say 'nghariad'.",How to Say I Love You in Welsh3,"


It is pronounced like 'tea'.

,


It is pronounced like 'ewe'.

, This is the Welsh translation of 'my'.


It is pronounced roughly like 'vuh'.

, Different to the verb form 'caru', the noun form of 'love' is 'cariad'. But because the word follows 'fy', it mutates into 'nghariad'.


The 'ng' at the beginning of the word is pronounced like the end of 'hang'.
The 'hari' in the middle of the word is pronounced like the name 'Harry'.
'ad' is pronounced like the 'add'.

"
Say ""xin chào"" as a general greeting.,
Use ""chào bạn"" when you're close.,
Opt for ""chào anh"" or ""chào chị"" when speaking to elders.,
Switch to ""chào em"" for younger people.,
Address someone by name when appropriate.,
Answer the phone with ""Á-lô."",
Learn the various time-of-day greetings.,
Ask ""khỏe không?"",
Respond to inquiries about your health.,
Welcome someone with ""chào mừng.""",How to Say Hello in Vietnamese," If you only learn one Vietnamese greeting, ""xin chào"" would likely be the best greeting to choose.Pronounce ""xin chào"" as: sin jow

The word ""chào"" means ""hello"" in English, but you would rarely use it alone. Typically, you would need to follow the term with another word based on the age, gender, and familiarity of the other person.
Adding ""xin"" to the front of ""chào"" makes the phrase more polite. Native Vietnamese speakers would typically reserve this for someone who is older or admired, but non-native speakers can use this phrasing as a polite way to say ""hello"" to anyone when the correct ending phrase is unknown.;
, If you're close in age to someone, the most accurate way to say ""hello"" would be ""chào bạn.""Pronounce ""chào bạn"" as: jow bahn

The word ""chào"" means ""hello"" in English, and ""bạn"" is an informal way to say ""you."" Since it's an informal version of the word ""you,"" however, avoid using it when addressing elders or others you need to show respect to.
This phrase would be appropriate for both males and females. You can also use this phrase to say ""hello"" to someone you're on familiar terms with, regardless of age or gender.

, If the other person is an older male, use ""chào anh."" If the other person is an older female, use ""chào chị.""


Pronounce ""chào anh"" as: jow ahn

Pronounce ""chào chị"" as: jow jee

The term ""ahn"" is a polite way to say ""you"" when the listener is male. Similarly, the term ""chị"" is a polite way to say ""you"" when the listener is female.
Note that you would rarely use these greetings for someone who is younger or approximately the same age as you.

, If you're speaking to someone notably younger than you, the most appropriate greeting would be ""chào em.""


Pronounce ""chào em"" as: jow ehm

Use this greeting regardless of whether the other person is male or female.
Do not use this greeting is someone is older or approximately the same age as you.

, If you're on familiar terms with someone, you can follow the ""chào"" greeting with that person's name.


If the other person is close in age or very familiar to you, you can omit the ""you"" portion of the greeting and use only the name. On the other hand, if you are not very familiar with the other person or if the other person is older or younger, you may still need to you the appropriate ""you"" pronoun.
For example, if you're speaking to a close friend named Hien, you could simply greet that individual with ""chào Hien."" If Hien is is an older female, you would need to say, ""chào chị Hien."" If she were a younger female, you would need to say, ""chào em Hien.""
Also note that you should always use the other person's given name, not his or her family surname. This is true regardless of age, gender, or familiarity.

, When you answer the phone, the most normal way to greet the person on the other end is with ""Á-lô!""Pronounce ""Á-lô"" as: ah-loh

This greeting developed before caller identification services were available, so there was no way of knowing who the speaker might be when you answered the phone. As a result, the ""you"" pronouns are not often used in conjunction with this phrase.
While this greeting is very appropriate for the phone, you should not use it when greeting someone face-to-face.

, While it's fairly uncommon to vary the greeting based on the time of day, you may encounter such greetings on occasion.


These greetings are:

Good morning: ""chào buổi sáng"" (jow booh-ee shang)
Good afternoon: ""chào buổi chiều"" (jow booh-ee jeeh-oo)
Good evening: ""chào buổi tối"" (jow booh-ee doy



In most situations, you won't need to use any of these greetings. A simple ""chào"" followed by the appropriate pronoun will suffice.
If someone speaks one of these greetings to you first, however, it would be appropriate to return it.

, Immediately following the initial ""hello,"" you can ask ""how are you"" by saying ""khỏe không?""


Pronounce ""khỏe không"" as: kweah kohng

Translated literally, you're asking the other person ""healthy or not?"" You can use this phrase on its own, but it would be more appropriate to add the most fitting ""you"" pronoun to the front of the phrase based on age and gender: ""bạn"" for someone close in age, ""anh"" for an older male, ""chị"" for an older female, and ""em"" for someone younger.

For example, you would ask an older male ""anh khỏe không?""



, When someone asks you ""khỏe không?,"" there are several ways to reply. A good general response would be ""Khoẻ, cảm ơn.""


Pronounce ""Khoẻ, cảm ơn"" as: kweah, gam uhhn

When translated into English, this response means ""I'm healthy, thanks.""
Following your response, you can return the same question word for word (""khỏe không?"") or say ""Ban thi sao?,"" which means, ""And you?""

Pronounce ""ban thi sao"" as: ban ty sao




, If you're greeting someone who has come to your home, workplace, dwelling, or event, you could greet that individual by saying ""chào mừng,"" which is the Vietnamese equivalent of ""welcome.""Pronounce ""chào mừng"" as: jow munn

The ""mừng"" portion of this phrase means ""welcome,"" so in essence, you're saying ""good welcome.""
You should also follow this greeting with the appropriate ""you"" pronoun: ""bạn"" for someone close in age, ""anh"" for an older male, ""chị"" for an older female, and ""em"" for someone younger.

For example, you would say to someone you're age, ""chào mừng bạn.""

Make eye contact.,
Look at their facial expressions.,
Evaluate their posture.,
Look at the legs.,
Look around.",How to Understand a Student's Body Language1," Look at your student’s eyes. Are they dull and unfocused? Are they focused at a point on the floor, ceiling, or wall? If so, the student is likely not paying attention. Similarly, if a student appears alert and keeps their eyes on you as you move around the room, you can be assured that they are paying attention., Your students’ facial expressions will reveal a variety of emotions and thoughts, from anger to interest to happiness. As you make eye contact with each student, pay attention to what their facial expressions are telling you.If a student’s mouth is turned down and their eyes are dull, they are likely unhappy to be in class just then.
If a student appears alert and is smiling or half smiling, they are most likely responding well to the class discussion and feel engaged.
If a student has an indifferent expression on their face, they may be bored and simply biding time until you let the class leave for the day.

, Are they slouched over the desk? They may be trying not to fall asleep. A student who is paying attention will usually be sitting up, whereas a student who is bored or disengaged may very well be slouching.You can help perk up your student by moving around the classroom. They will have to sit up to keep their eyes on you, which should be enough movement to re-engage them.

, If a student is tapping their foot against the floor or bouncing their legs up and down, he or she may be impatient with the lecture, conversation, or presentation. They may also have a physical or psychological reason for these movements. Leg position varies from student to student - some prefer to cross their legs, or to place them firmly on the floor., In addition to looking at students individually to assess and interpret their body language, try looking at the class in quadrants or even as a whole. You will likely find several students engaging in similar body language, which should give you an idea of the overall class atmosphere that day.


If a majority of the class appears disengaged or bored, consider stopping your lecture and moving to a group project or open class discussion.

"
"
Assess a potential threat.,
Find their hands.,
Watch for a student who is removing outerwear that impedes movement.,
Look where they look.",How to Understand a Student's Body Language2," Body language can reveal a student’s intention or thoughts of being aggressive or using force. Some of this body language is more subtle, requiring keen observation, whereas other body language is fairly overt and obvious, and clearly shows an intention to cause harm., The angrier someone is, the more likely they are to touch their head or rest their hands on their head. It’s as if the brain is full of discomfort that must be touched. The student may rub their scalp or clench their fists and remove them from the head area.These are all non-verbal cues that the student is becoming increasingly angry and potentially violent.
Also, if you see a student’s hands linger or hover near their waistband or inside their clothing, you should assume that they may have a weapon and take appropriate precautions., If a student removes outer layers of clothing, like a jacket or sweater, it could indicate that they are too warm. However, if you are looking at the student’s body language and can tell they are angry or frustrated and also see them removing clothes, you are seeing a non-verbal expression of escalating frustration and potential aggression.Students are especially prone to removing clothes and jewelry just prior to physically fighting.

, There are two types of stares that may reveal aggressive behavior or ideas: the thousand-yard stare and the target stare. Both of these indicate that the student is mentally elsewhere, and, when combined with other non-verbal cues, could indicate potential danger for you and your students.


The thousand-yard stare is one in which the person is unfocused, not seeing anything directly in front of them. It’s as if they’re looking through everything and everyone.The target stare is one in which the student narrows their eyes and stares directly at you or another student, often in the chin area."
"
Spot the fake smile.,
Pay attention to blinking.,
Encourage stretching.,
Watch the arms.",How to Understand a Student's Body Language3," A student may feel obligated to smile at you when you look in their direction; however, that smile may be obviously fake and conspicuously dishonest. A fake smile indicates that the student is not feeling well emotionally or physically, but that they do not want to share those feelings with you., Almost everyone blinks their eyes. It’s an involuntary process that keeps the eye organs healthy and lubricated. If you notice a student blinking too much or hardly at all, they may be telling you that they are tired, bored, or distressed., A student may yawn or stretch several times, and this indicates that they are bored, tired, or disinterested. Encourage stretching – even if a student has to stand up to do so – as this promotes blood circulation and increases oxygen levels to the brain, providing a natural burst of energy., Your students’ arms will tell you quite a bit about how the class is receiving your instruction, how they’re feeling about being in the class, and their individual moods. Look at each student’s arms, and then look at the class as a whole for any like behavior.Folded arms indicate the student is closed off and not receptive to the discussion.
Open arms indicate interest, openness, and that student is feeling connected and included.

"
"
Notice a student who avoids eye contact.,
Decipher a student's folded arms.,
Figure out why a student might scratch their head.,
Notice a student holding their crotch.",How to Understand a Student's Body Language4," Eye contact doesn’t always indicate that someone is trying to hide something from you or that they’re being sneaky, especially in young children. If a child student avoids eye contact, it may indicate (as with some older children or adults) that they are shy.Avoiding eye contact may also indicate that the child did something that they feel badly about, such as knocking something over or wetting their pants.
If your child student won’t make eye contact, stay positive and reassure them. You might say, “I know that you are feeling badly, and I want you to know that everything is okay. I care about you and want to talk about what’s bothering you.”

, Children learn how to communicate from the adults around them, especially body language. Just like with adults or older kids, children that stands with their arms folded are comforting themselves. They may or may not know that they’re feeling apprehensive, or that folding their arms is a reassuring and comforting maneuver.Don’t force a child to uncross their arms or approach something that makes them apprehensive. Instead, tell them “Take your time. You’re safe and I’m here with you,” to encourage them to warm up to a person or object.

, Children may scratch their heads because they itch, just like anyone does. When children in the classroom scratch or touch their heads it might also be their way of expressing confusion. If you see a child scratch or touch their head, pause and ask if they understand the lesson.“Bobby, can you please ask me a question about this? It would be very helpful if you did so that we can make sure that everyone understands what we’re talking about. Maria, I’d like you to think of another question about this lesson that we can answer after Bobby’s question.”

, If you have a child student that grabs their crotch or sits on one leg and rocks back and forth in their chair, ask them if they’d like to use the restroom. They are likely aware that they have the urge to use the bathroom, but might not be comfortable asking to go.Other signs include pointing to the crotch, crouching, standing in a corner, or even squatting.
“Ravi, I think that you’re telling me that you need to go potty. Great job communicating what you need! Let’s try and go now and then we can come back and join the class.”

Respect the Earth.",How to Teach Respect in School," Be conscious that you are a role model to your students. Treat them and others with respect. If necessary, discuss your behavior with your students so they understand why they should act that way.


Think about how you address your students. If you only use ""Mr."" and ""Ms."" in sarcastic or punitive contexts, you are teaching the wrong lesson.;
, Have your students practice a respectful conversation with a partner. Before they begin, discuss the particular behaviors involved, and demonstrate them yourself. For example:


Listen attentively when your partner speaks.
Express a disagreement politely without disrespecting the other person's opinion.
Don't dismiss another person's opinion or preferences even if you disagree.

, This doesn't just mean correcting poor behavior. When you notice students acting respectful in everyday classroom life, point it out and praise it.

, If students need a visual reminder of classroom rules, make a wall decoration to remind them. Consider a chart that awards each student points for good behavior, and removes them for bad.


Show the students that respect is a two-way street by including your own name on the chart. Allow students to discuss or vote on whether a particular behavior was good or bad.

, It may not be a good idea to give out titles or formal roles, as this can seem like favoritism. Nevertheless, let students contribute to running the classroom and leading discussions. Even before they fully appreciate or understand what's going on, encourage them to analyze information and give feedback on the lesson structure. Treating them as collaborative scholars will demonstrate respect and show them that you value their role in the classroom.

, School counselors are trained to address problematic social behaviors and teach students to cope with conflict. If a serious concern comes up, have a school counselor address it. This can be in one-on-one sessions with a student, or in a presentation on topics such as bullying.


The school counselor may be willing to arrange a presentation for parents as well.

, Talk about issues of respect with other school employees. Think about what messages the school sends through its policies, and its treatment of students at recess, lunchtime, and detention. Any adult who disrespects the students is undermining your lessons.


Some teachers arrange to let disruptive students into each other's classrooms for some down time. This gives the student another chance to model respectful behavior before you initiate punishment.

, In especially difficult cases, discuss classroom rules with your students, and type them up into a ""contract"" for everyone to sign. Hang the signed copy on the wall and pass out copies for everyone to take home and show their parents. This can be a wake up call to parents to start enforcing good behavior at home as well.

, Ask your students to write down an answer to ""what is respect?"", ""What is a nice way to treat people?"", and ""Who should you treat with respect?"" Have the students read them aloud, then hang them up on the wall. Return to these answers every few weeks and ask if the students want to add anything to their answers. You'll often see surprising answers, and watch how your class's understanding grows over time.

, Compile a bibliography of appropriate books to read aloud or assign as reading for students. Create projects and conduct discussions based upon the books selected. Assemble bulletin boards around the topic, and put together a library corner featuring appropriate books.


If you're not sure which books to choose, talk to other teachers or search online for ideas.

, Starting in preschool, children learn the basic rules of interaction in the classroom. Make sure you cover these topics in lessons and everyday behavior:


Saying Please and Thank You, and asking for something respectfully.
Showing kindness, and noticing when someone could use help. This includes holding open doors, helping younger kids, and cleaning up messes.
Waiting in line, taking turns, and sharing.
Resolving conflict.
Setting and respecting boundaries.

, If your students are not learning respectful behavior, make it the focus of a lesson. Here are a few fun ideas that younger kids may enjoy more than a normal lesson:


Have a ""Thank You week"" or a ""Please week"" where the students try to use the word as often as possible.
Host a tea party where your students must say ""Please pass the..."".
Hold a talent show and teach everyone to show respect to the performer.

, For students aged about six through nine, discuss basic morality problems. Try the game ""Good Idea / Bad Idea,"" where you draw a picture of a behavior on the board and ask them to tell you why it would be a good or bad idea.


Some children may find the idea of right and wrong judgmental, especially if they have a parent in jail or a treatment program. Don't reduce these lessons to good and bad people, only good and bad behaviors.

, By age nine or so, children can begin to understand historical references in greater depth. The last few years of primary school are a good time to relate historical events to morality and rights, and conflict resolution.


For example, in the United States, teach lessons on the civil rights movement, the 60's war effort, Harlem in the 30's, and the Great Migration. International lessons are important as well, for example on the Dayton Peace Accords on Bosnia.

, Students at this age can make their own classroom rules, set consequences, and keep the classroom in order. They should learn that one or two students misbehaving can affect the whole class, so they have a responsibility to hold each other to good behavior.

, Students are often negative about another person's intelligence, physical appearance, clothing, and home life. Call out this behavior when it happens, and make it clear that this is not acceptable.


Also watch for students that envy people who have more money, popularity, or family stability.

, Unfortunately, the kids themselves can identify ""good kids"" and ""bad kids"" without understanding the root causes. Often the children who misbehave in class are the ones who have learning challenges, don’t know how to read, or have problems unaddressed at home. Poor diet, lack of sleep, poverty, and having to be “the adults” too soon can tax a child's emotional intelligence and self control. Don't let a student's frequent misbehavior make him a scapegoat or punching bag. Continue to treat him with respect and don't assume he's at fault before you understand a situation.

, Prepare your students for real world situations involving cooperation. For example, have the whole class decide how they would run a pizza parlor. Who would greet the customers, wait tables, cook, design a menu, handle the money, take phone orders, pay the staff, clean up? Discuss how the students can respect others' preferences for what they do, while still completing all the tasks. Show them that it's necessary to do something for the team, even if it's not enjoyable.

, Students of all ages can learn to appreciate the natural environment, and take care of it so everyone can enjoy it. The older your students are, the more you can discuss how this relates to real-world issues, such as energy conservation, recycling, and global warming. Here are a few projects to consider:


Make craft projects from gathered items.
Make a birdhouse or other animal habitats.
Paint flower pots and plant flowers.
Conserve water use.

"
Start by making a list of unacceptable behaviors.,
Focus on goals.,
Keep it positive.,
Make the expectations simple.,
Separate different kinds of rules and expectations.,
Establish the basic vision.,
Consider asking for feedback on problems.,
Encourage the use of ""I"" statements.,
Have students sign the rules or contract.,
Display the rules prominently.,
Be open to change.,
Consider the school's policies.,
Clearly outline the consequences.,
Make sure the consequences are appropriate.,
Treat all students equally.,
Reward students for making good choices.",How to Set Up a Class Contract or Classroom Rules," If you're not sure where to start with your classroom rules, you can begin by simply writing down all of the specific behaviors that you want to discourage your students from engaging in. Then use this list to craft your rules.Use the specific actions you came up with to develop more general rules. For example, if you don't want your students to talk out of turn or use cellphones during class, your rule could be ""be respectful of the teacher."";
, Instead of centering your classroom contract around rules, which typically state actions that are prohibited, give your students something to work towards by establishing goals. The goals can be broad statements such as ""treat everyone with respect."" This goal inherently prohibits behavior like hitting and name calling without having to spell out each undesired behavior., If you do need to establish specific rules beyond your broader goals, try to use positive language. This will help motivate students to meet the expectations, rather than bombarding them with prohibited activities.For example, ""Keep your work stations neat"" is a better rule than ""Don't make a mess.""

, It's extremely important that your students understand what is expected of them, or else they will never be able to follow the rules. When crafting your rules, do your best to make them clear and concise, while leaving no room for misinterpretation.Avoid using confusing words that your students may not know.
If your rule seems vague, be sure to give examples so your students understand what it means.

, It's important to recognize that the expectations you have of students fall into multiple categories. You may choose to include rules from multiple categories in your contract, but be sure that students understand the different categories. This will make it much easier for them to understand what is expected of them.Behavior rules include things like ""be respectful"" and ""be safe.""
Academic expectations include things like ""turn your homework in on time"" and ""cite your sources.""
Learning expectations focus more on helping students think deeply and take responsibility for their own learning. Examples include ""ask questions when you don't understand"" and ""challenge yourself."", While you may want to allow your students to contribute to the classroom rules, it's important to provide the framework for their ideas. Start by telling your students about the goals you have for them or your vision for the classroom. Then ask them to contribute by suggesting specific behaviors that can help support these goals.Providing this framework will help ensure that your students do not come up with rules that you do not agree with or that are not conducive to a positive learning environment.
For example, if your goal is that everyone will be respected, your students may suggest that everyone wait their turn to speak or that everyone consider other people's feelings before saying something.
Remind students to focus on positive rules, rather than negative rules.

, In addition to encouraging students to brainstorm ideas for meeting the classroom goals, you can also ask them to share some of the challenges they face in school. They may identify problems, such as bullying or distractions in the classroom, which are interfering with their ability to learn.Once they identify problems, try having students brainstorm potential solutions to those problems.
If you have students do this, be sure to show them that you value their input by incorporating at least some of the ideas they came up with into the classroom contract.
You may want to consider having students vote on the rules that everyone comes up with an/or giving everyone the opportunity to suggest that a rule be eliminated., Help your students take ownership of the rules that they create by having them use first person pronouns. This will make it more clear to them that they are each individually responsible for upholding the rules.For example, instruct them to write ""I will consider other people's feelings"" instead of just ""consider other people's feelings"" or ""everyone should consider each other's feelings.""
You can also have them make a list of their rights. This may include things like ""I have the right to express my opinion"" or ""I have the right to feel safe at school."" This can help them identify problems that need solutions.

, Once you have finished your discussion and put your contract in writing, have each student sign it. This will symbolize that each student is agreeing to abide by the rules.You may want to give each student a separate copy or have everyone sign the classroom copy.
You may also wish to send a copy of the classroom contract home with each student to be signed by a parent or guardian. This will help promote parental involvement in your classroom.

, Make a poster or write the classroom rules on the board. No matter how you choose to display them, make sure they are always visible to students.If you are having problems with behavior in your classroom, you can try asking the students to re-read the classroom contract. Having it displayed prominently will make this much easier.

, Your classroom rules and expectations should never be set in stone. You may find that the rules need to be adjusted as the year progresses, so always be willing to make necessary changes.Discuss any changes you make with your students so that they understand what the changes are and why they were made.
Listen to your students' feedback on the rules. They may recognize before you do that a rule needs to be reworked because it isn't supporting the classroom goals.

, Some schools have very structured policies regarding the consequences that a student should face for breaking the rules. Others have general guidelines, but give teachers more freedom to decide on the appropriate consequences. As you are establishing your classroom rules or contract, be sure to consider the policies that are already in place at your school, and make sure your classroom rules complement them. Do not make exceptions to school-wide policies. For example, if your school prohibits all cell phone use, do not state in your contract that cell phone are allowed at certain times.

, In addition to outlining the expectations you have of your students, it is important to let them know what the consequences will be if they do not meet those expectations. There should never be any surprises when it comes to punishment.Make it clear if there will be a warning for the first offence. Keep in mind that this may be appropriate for some behaviors (like talking out of turn), but not for others (like hitting another student).

, Think carefully about how you will punish students for breaking the rules, and make sure that the punishment fits the offence. You should not punish minor offences too seriously, nor should you fail to respond adequately to major infractions.Especially for younger children, the consequences should be immediate and directly related to the offence. They may have a more difficult time understanding the relationship between an action and a punishment if the punishment is delayed.
Consequences are not only meant to punish the student who is breaking the rules, but also to prevent that student from disrupting the class. For example, if two students are talking to each other during a lesson, separating them will both punish them and prevent them from further distracting their classmates. Giving them after school detention will punish them, but it will not remedy the immediate problem.

, When establishing rules and consequences in your classroom, it's important to be mindful about implementing them consistently. All undesirable behavior should be dealt with in the same way, whether it comes from the worst student in class or the best.Singling out ""bad kids"" will only make their behavior worse, so try to make them feel like they are the same as every other student in the class.

, Try not to focus so much on punishing students for bad behavior that you forget to reward them for meeting your expectations. Be sure to praise students for good behavior as well.Don't rely too heavily on external rewards, like stickers or pizza parties, as the students' interest in these rewards will eventually fade. The most motivating incentive for students to follow the classroom rules is the opportunity to be a part of a great classroom community."

Recognize the subject in the line ""minä rakastan sinua"".,
Learn the verb of the sentence, to love, ""rakastan"".,
Learn the object of the phrase.,
Put it all together.",How to Say I Love You in Finnish," Minä is subject of the sentence, the pronoun I. You may also stumble upon different variations, such as ""mä"" or ""mie"". They're very commonly used in spoken language and different dialects, and that is why using ""mä"" instead of ""minä"" might actually be a more casual way of telling one you love them (and a more believable one, too). 'Minä' is pronounced mi-næh and 'mä' is mæ (the ä being like the a in 'cat'). If you want to try the 'mie' one - commonly used in the Southern Karjala dialect, try saying mi-e.
, As in Spanish, there's a different verb for every pronoun, so dropping the subject ""minä"" and just saying ""rakastan sinua"" works just fine. Since it is the most important word of the sentence, you may want to get the pronunciation correct though. It's pronounced rʌ-kʌs-tʌn. So not like tan, the thing that happens to your skin in the summer, but tʌn. Like the o in 'love'. The initial letter r is rolled with the front of your mouth., The last word is the object of the sentence, you, ""sinua"". Just like the subject I, minä, this one has various versions. The most commonly used one is ""sua"", which is pronounced su-ʌ. The u is like the double o in 'foot'. 'Sinua' is pronounced si-nu-ʌ. The 'nu' syllable is pronounced much like 'to' but with an n., So if you want to declare love in a formal situation, use ""mi-næh rʌ-kʌs-tʌn si-nu-ʌ"". Otherwise ""mæ rʌ-kʌs-tʌn sua"" is the way to go."

Bring energy to the classroom.,
Incorporate games.,
Get more students involved.,
Use new technology.,
Go on field trips.",How to Inspire Students1," A classroom that feels tired probably won't be very inspiring. Take action to make sure that your classroom pulses with energy. Start by pumping up your own enthusiasm. Try not to come to class tired. Get up early in the morning so that you are fully awake by class time.
If your students seem lethargic, try having them get up and move around. Even a quick stretch can wake people up.;
, Students might feel more inspiration if they are having fun. Try organizing your lesson around a game. You can adapt this strategy for any age level.For elementary school kids, you could adapt the common game Simon Says. Students only get to move a step forward if they can correctly answer the math question, for instance.
Try a version of Jeopardy for high school or college students. This quiz game is a great way to review for exams.
Don't feel like everything has to be a game. They can be used every once in a while to insert some energy into your classroom.

, Each class is bound to have a few students who are reluctant to participate. However, it is important to make each student feel actively involved in the lesson. Try to get most (if not all) students to participate in activities.Some students may not like participating in group discussions. You might need to get creative to make it more appealing.
Try a lightening round. Set a time limit (maybe 30 seconds) on each question. Make it seem fun and exciting to shout out the correct answer.

, Technology can be a great way to bring inspiration into your classroom. There are a number of tools you can use to get your students excited about whatever subject you're teaching. Have fun trying new items together! Many schools provide iPads or tablets for student use. Download some fun math games for your students to play.
If you teach a college course, have your history students create entries for educational apps such as Clio., Try to energize your students by taking them out and about. Field trips are an excellent way to inspire and wow your class. Just make sure to tailor the trip to fit the needs of your students.Try a children's museum for young kids. For example, the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago offers an entire wing of exhibits geared towards children.
If you teach high school or college students, try a walking tour. The Freedom Trail in Boston is a great option if you teach in that area.

Consider intrinsic motivations.,
Understand extrinsic motivations.,
Appeal to different learning styles.,
Get to know your students.,
Use effective examples.,
Help struggling students.",How to Inspire Students2," Motivating is a big part of inspiring students. If they aren't motivated to learn, there's probably not a lot you can do to inspire them. Take some time to consider student motivations. First, think about intrinsic motivations.Intrinsic motivations are basically internal. They are personal to each student.
For example, intrinsic motivations might include a passion for the subject, or a desire to challenge themselves by mastering a skill.
In an English class, you might have students intrinsically motivated by a love of books.

, Extrinsic motivations are also important to consider. These motivations come from outside sources. For example, parental expectations are an external motivator.Another example is meeting the required GPA to keep a scholarship.
It is important to learn what motivates each of your students. You can then use those personal goals to help encourage and inspire them.

, Each individual learns in different ways. Some students are visual learners, while others do best hearing information. Try mixing up your lessons so that you incorporate different styles each class.Maybe you are teaching about World War II. You could play a popular song from the era, show a video clip of an important battle, and provide a letter from a soldier for students to read.
Some students are collaborative learners. Others work best on their own. Try to provide a balance of group projects and individual learning.

, A great way to inspire students is by treating them as individuals. Once they see that you are interested in them, they are more likely to respond positively to learning. Take some time to learn something interesting about each student.With very young students, Show and Tell can be a great way to get to know kids. Make sure to follow up on what you've learned. For example, you could say, ""Teddy, you told us last week you have a new baby sister. How's that going?""
With high school or college students, take an interest in their academic or career goals. You could say, ""Tom, you're doing really well in my class. Have you considered majoring in Psychology?""
Make sure to maintain boundaries. It's never a good idea to get too personal with your students.

, Sometimes it can be hard to connect learning to real life applications. For example, students might not understand how studying history can help them in their ""real life"". Inspire and motivate by giving them effective examples of how each lesson applies to them.Show your history students that your class can help them achieve future career goals. For example, you can say, ""In this class, we'll learn to analyze primary source documents. This will help you no matter what career you choose. If you're a lawyer, you'll have to analyze testimony, for instance. If you're in finance, you'll need to perhaps analyze stock reports.""

, Students can feel unmotivated and uninspired if they are having trouble in the class. A student who is struggling to understand certain concepts might need some extra help. Take time to give some extra time to students who need it.You could say, ""Tina, I noticed you're having trouble with fractions. Maybe during free time, we could sit together and I'll give you some pointers.""
Ask questions. For example, ""Mark, you seem to be having some issues coming up with a thesis statement. Is there something about the assignment that is confusing to you? How can I help?""

"
"
Set a good example.,
Introduce new role models.,
Involve peer models.",How to Inspire Students3," One of the best ways to inspire students is by giving them good role models. You can start by being a role model yourself. Take care to lead and teach by example.Demonstrate good habits. Show up on time and prepared.
Show enthusiasm. Get excited about the subject you teach, whatever it is. You might say, ""Today we're going to perform an amazing chemistry experiment. I can't wait for you to see the results!""

, You can use other people to inspire your class and help them connect with the course material. Try to bring potential role models into your classroom for your students to meet.For example, if you are teaching the history of the Civil Rights movement, try to find someone local with an interesting story to tell. Maybe you could find someone who participated in the Freedom Rides to visit your class.
Invite guest speakers. Consider having a local reporter from the local tv station come talk to your class. Give the students a chance to ask questions.

, Students can also be good role models for one another. Give students a chance to interact with each other. They might be able to inspire each other.Have your class give presentations. Each student could tell the class about their science project. The students will likely be exposed to some interesting new ideas.

Learn the difference between major and minor errors.,

Address three main issues of improvement in your note.,
Encourage revision.,
Use a rubric and let the students see it.,
Know or assign a description of each letter grade.,
Make the grade the last thing the student sees.",How to Grade a Paper," Sometimes called ""higher"" and ""lower"" concerns, it's important to prioritize major issues like content, creative thinking, and organization over more minor issues like grammar, usage, and spelling.


These designations obviously depend upon many things, like the assignment, the grade-level of your students, and their individual concerns. If you're in the middle of a unit on comma usage, it's perfectly fine to call that a ""higher"" concern. But in general, a basic writing assignment should prioritize the higher concerns listed above.;
, When you've got a stack of 50 or 100 papers to go through and another stack of quizzes to finish and lessons to plan it can be tempting to jump right in and start slapping Bs on everything.Resist that temptation. Read through each essay individually before marking anything. Look for the highest order of concerns first:


Does the student address the prompt and fulfill the assignment effectively?
Does the student think creatively?
Does the student clearly state their argument, or thesis?
Is the thesis developed over the course of the assignment?
Does the writer provide evidence?
Does the paper show evidence of organization and revision, or does it seem like a first draft?

, Getting an assignment back that looks like someone bled all over it can be a source of great anxiety in the life of a student. Some teachers argue that red asserts authority. While that may be true, there are other ways to assert your authority than pen color.


Marking essays in pencil can suggest that the issues are easily fixable, keeping the student looking forward, rather than dwelling on their success or failure. Pencil, blue, or black pen is perfectly appropriate.

, Write comments, criticisms, and questions in the margins as neatly as possible. Find moments that the writer needs to clarify and circle them or underline them.


Be as specific as possible when asking questions. ""What?"" is not a particularly helpful question to scrawl in the margin, compared to ""What do you mean by 'some societies'?""

, When you've addressed the most important issues of the essay, its content, feel free to mark some lower-order concerns, like usage, grammar, and punctuation. Depending on the grade-level of the essays and the skill-level of your students, these may be more or less important. Typical proofreading marks include the following:


¶ = to start a new paragraph
three underscores under a letter = to lowercase or uppercase the letter
""sp"" = word is spelled incorrectly
word crossed out with a small ""pigtail"" above = word needs to be deleted
Some teachers use the first page as a rule of thumb for marking later concerns. If there are sentence-level issues, mark them on the first page and then stop marking them throughout the essay, especially if the assignment needs more revision.

, The goal of comments is to point out the strengths and weaknesses in a student's writing and to offer them concrete strategies toward improving their work. Completely shredding apart a failed paragraph with your red pen does not accomplish any of these aims.


Use marginal comments to point out specific points or areas in the essay the student could improve.
Use a paragraph note at the end to summarize your comments and direct them toward improvement.
Comments should not justify a letter grade. Never start a note, ""You got a C because..."". It's not your job to defend the grade given. Instead, use the comments to look toward revision and the next assignment, rather than staring backward at the successes or failures of the given assignment.

, Try to start your comments by finding something the student has done well and encouraging them. Seeing exclamation points or ""Good job"" on an essay tends to be more memorable for the student, and will ensure that they'll repeat the behavior.If you struggle to find anything, you can always praise their topic selection: ""This is an important topic! Good choice!""

, Even if your student has written a disaster of a paper, don't overwhelm them with every single thing that needs to be fixed. Try to focus on no more than three main areas of improvement in your comments. This will give the student concrete strategies toward improvement, and avoid overwhelming them with ""failures.""


When you give your first read-through, Try to determine what these three points might be to make it easier when you're going through the paper and writing comments.

, Instead of focusing your comments on everything the student did wrong in an essay, direct your comments toward the next essay, or toward a re-write of the current essay, if that fits in with the conventions of the assignment.


""In your next assignment, make sure to organize your paragraphs according to the argument you're making"" is a better comment than ""Your paragraphs are disorganized.""

, A rubric is used to assign numerical values to various criteria used to make up the letter grade, usually based on a scale of 100. To get a letter grade, you assign numerical values to each section and tally the score. Making the students aware of the rubric used will keep the process transparent and eliminate the idea that you pull arbitrary grades out of nowhere. A rubric, for example, might look like this:


Thesis and argument: _/40
Organization and paragraphs: _/30
Introduction and conclusion: _/10
Grammar, usage, and spelling: _/10
Sources and Citations: _/10

, Let the students see a description of what an A means, what a B means, etc. Write your own according to your own specific criteria and emphasis for the class. Share it with the students so they can interpret the grade they receive. These are fairly standard designations, often worded like this:


A (100-90): Work completes all of the requirements of the assignment in an original and creative manner. Work at this level goes beyond the basic guidelines of the assignment, showing the student took extra initiative in originally and creatively forming content, organization, and style.
B (89-80): Work completes all of the requirements of the assignment. Work at this level is successful in terms of content, but might need some improvement in organization and style, perhaps requiring a little revision. A B reveals less of the author’s original thought and creativity than A-level work.
C (79-70): Work completes most of the requirements of the assignment. Though the content, organization, and style are logical and coherent, they may require some revision and may not reflect a high level of originality and creativity on the part of the author.
D (69-60): Work either does not complete the requirements of the assignment, or meets them quite inadequately. Work at this level requires a good deal of revision, and is largely unsuccessful in content, organization, and style.
F (Below 60): Work does not complete the requirements of the assignment. In general, students who put forth genuine effort will not receive an F. If you receive an F on any assignment (particularly if you feel you have given adequate effort), you should speak with me personally.

, Put the grade at the very end of the paper, after they've seen the rubric and your comments. Slapping a big letter grade at the top near the title will ensure that the student probably won't go through and read all the smart and helpful comments you've included.


Some teachers like to hand out papers at the end of the day because they fear discouraging or distracting students during class time. Consider giving the students time to go through the papers in class and be available to talk about their grades afterwards. This will ensure that they read and understand your comments.

Praise students for hard work.,
Organize the classroom.,
Allow self-monitoring.,
Show enthusiasm for your subject matter.,
Accommodate different learning styles.",How to Improve Students' Values1," If you see them improving, or doing well, privately congratulate them on putting so much effort into the class. This will help them think of themselves as resilient, and encourage more hard work in the future..;
, You can be a role model by keeping things in order and making the important information accessible.


Consider color-coding different materials for your convenience.
Make deadlines and homework assignments clear. Write them down on the blackboard so students have time to see it and copy it down.

, Find a way for students to be able to check their grades, and know if they have any missing assignments. This allows them to take initiative and responsibility regarding their performance.


Consider a class website (e.g. Blackboard) where grade breakdowns are posted.
If you can't use a website, print out grades sorted by ID number periodically so students can check where they're at.

, If you care about the material, and if you can make it relevant, the students will care too. Your attitude is infectious.

, Some students learn by seeing, hearing, doing, et cetera. Incorporate a variety of activities to address these different styles, and the mixed approaches will help them feel engaged and prepared.

,, Depending on where you are, tutors might become really expensive. If so you can consider local tuition centers, tuition pooling (get 2-3 kids together to have the lesson at the same time) or online tuition.

, You can find tutors on craigslist.org (just click on your city, and then under Services/Lessons, or through a variety of online tutor listing websites. Since the popularity of these sites can vary from location to location, your best bet is to search for such a site through a local search engine, along with your city/country name and specific subject needs.

Keep an eye out for disabilities.",How to Improve Students' Values2," Recognize that many of them are struggling with problems you cannot see—broken homes, grumpy parents, undiagnosed disabilities, sick family members, friendship troubles, et cetera. Everyone (including you) is fighting some sort of hidden battle. Treat them with

, particularly if you think there's something more going on. Compassion matters., Some days it might be tempting to yell at your class, but this is not good for the classroom atmosphere. Instead, manage your own anger (if your students see you using techniques, they'll try those techniques), take a few deep breaths, and speak calmly but firmly.


Write it down or talk into a recording device.
Breathe deeply for several seconds.
Squeeze a stress ball.
Count to ten.

, Bullying, sexual harassment, and cheating are very serious issues. Do not allow students to interfere with others' learning or sense of safety.


Talk with bullying victims one-on-one about what happened (because the bully's presence may intimidate them). Get the principal and parents/guardians involved.
Take harassment seriously. Enforce the concept of personal space, and do not allow lewd comments. Punish the perpetrator and let the victim move away from him/her.
Ask cheaters why they cheated, and talk with them about more constructive ways to handle their trouble with school. This (along with punishment) can help prevent future incidents.

, You will have students of different races, gender identities, sizes, and sexual orientations. Some students will have disabilities like autism, Tourette Syndrome, or dyslexia. Be a role model by respecting all students, and making accommodations without batting an eyelash. This teaches others that all needs are valid and worthwhile.


Ignore disability symptoms (e.g. tics and stimming), and students will learn that these are normal and not a big deal.
Don't let the boys interrupt or talk over the girls.
Respect the pronouns of transgender students. They know their own identity best, and can tell you how you should handle it.

, Disabled children (and even teens) may not be diagnosed yet, and you can help by mentioning if you see something unusual. Consider not only your struggling students, but your overachieving students, and the students in the middle. Tell the school and the parents/guardians so they can get the child tested for various conditions.


Anxiety, lethargy, isolation, and irrational thoughts may mean a mental illness is at play. (These do happen to good people.)
Struggles at school may mean a learning disability.
Difficulty in gym class may mean asthma, chronic pain, or another physical disability.
Social struggles, need for routine, sensory issues, and passionate favorite subjects may indicate autism. (Average and bright students can also be autistic.)

Never criticize students' bodies, or allow others to criticize them.",How to Improve Students' Values3," This is one of the hardest values to install in anyone, let alone a pupil. However, exercise is useful in getting the blood pumping and helping the pupil to learn, so firstly consider what type of exercise is best (e.g. cardio, stamina, strength) and then times and agreements with parents and pupils should be made. Also think about interesting types of activities, such as fencing.

, It may sound old fashioned but posture helps to stop back pain (which can interfere with learning and make a pupil grumpy), aid breathing and improve a host of other things. A simple technique is to but a medium weight book on the pupils head and tape a straight line on the floor. Another technique is to imagine a piece of string tied to your head and pulling your head up.

, Encourage students to speak loudly and clearly. For soft-spoken students, be encouraging and positive, so they don't feel shy. ""I'd love to hear what you have to say. Please speak up to make it easier for me."" Encourage students to take their time while writing, and write large enough to read. A positive atmosphere will help them bloom.


If a student has a speech impediment, or seems to have trouble turning thoughts into words, this may mean a disability. Public schools can offer speech therapy services for this.
Poor handwriting may also indicate a disability.

, Don't shame them for being too fat, too curvy, too dark-skinned, or too disabled. Teach all students that their body is strong and deserving of love. When students love their bodies, they will respect them and treat them well.

The topic should be appropriate for the age of the students and the environment in which the curriculum will be taught.If you are asked to design a course, ask yourself questions about the general purpose of the course. Why am I teaching this material? What do students need to know? What will the students learn?
For example, in developing a summer writing course for high school students, you’ll have to think specifically about what you want the students to get out of the class. A possible purpose could be to teach students how to write a one-act play.
School teachers usually have a subject assigned and may not need to do any work for this step.;
, Depending on the learning objective, titling the curriculum may be a straightforward process or one that requires greater thought. A curriculum for GED students can be called ""GED Preparation Curriculum."" A program designed to assist adolescents with eating disorders might require a carefully thought-out title that is attractive to teenagers and sensitive to their needs.

, Talk to your supervisor about how much time you will have to teach the course. Some courses last a full year and others last only one semester. If you are not teaching in a school, find out how much time is allotted to your classes. Once you have a timeline, you can begin to organize your curriculum into smaller sections.

, Use your knowledge of your students (age, ability, etc.) and your knowledge of the content to get a sense of how much information you will be able to cover in the time you were given. You do not need to plan activities just yet, but you can start to think about what is possible.Consider how often you will see the students. Classes that meet once or twice per week may have a different outcome than classes that meet every day.
For example, imagine that you are writing a theater curriculum. The difference between a two-hour class that meets once a week for three weeks, and a two-hour class that meets every day for three months is significant. In those three weeks, you might be able to put on a 10-minute play. Three months, on the other hand, may be enough time for a full production.
This step may not apply to all teachers. Grade schools often follow state standards that outline the topics that need to be covered over the course of the year. Students often take tests at the end of the year, so there is much more pressure to cover all the standards.

, Make a list of the content you want your students to learn and what they should be able to do by the end of the course. It will later be important to have clear objectives that outline the skills and knowledge your students will acquire. Without these objectives, you will not be able to evaluate students or the efficacy of the curriculum.For example, in your summer playwriting course, you might want students to learn how to write a scene, develop well-rounded characters, and create a storyline.
Teachers working in public schools in the United States are expected to follow government standards. Most states have adopted the Common Core State Standards, which explain exactly what students should be able to do by the end of the school year from grades K-12., Check online for curricula that have been developed in your subject area. If you are working in a school, check with other teachers and supervisors about curricula from previous years. Having a sample to work from makes developing your own curriculum much easier.

, Some institutions ask educators to use a standardized template, so find out what is expected of you. If no template is provided, find one online or create your own template. This will help you keep your curriculum organized and presentable.

, Organize your brainstorm or state standards into unified sections that follow a logical sequence. Units usually cover big ideas like love, planets, or equations.The number of units varies by curriculum and they can last anywhere between one week and eight weeks.


A unit title can be one word or a short sentence. A unit about character development, for example, could be called, “Creating deep characters.”

, Once you have an organized set of units, you can begin to think about what kinds of materials, content, and experiences students will need in order to gain an understanding of each theme. This can be covered by the textbook you will use, texts you plan to read, projects, discussions, and trips.Keep your audience in mind. Remember that there are many ways for students to acquire skills and knowledge. Try to choose books, multimedia, and activities that will engage the population you are working with.

, Every unit needs two to four general questions that should be explored once it is over. Essential questions guide students to understand the more important parts of the theme. Essential questions are often larger questions that can’t always be answered in one lesson.For example, an essential question for a middle school unit about fractions might be, “Why doesn’t using division always make things smaller?” An essential question for a unit on character development might be, “How does a person’s decisions and actions reveal aspects of their personality?”

, Learning goals are the specific things that students will know and be able to do by the end of the unit. You already gave this some thought when you first brainstormed ideas for the class, now you have to be more specific. As you write your learning goals, keep important questions in mind. What does the state require students to know? How do I want my students to think about this topic? What will my students be able to do?Often, you can pull learning goals right from common core standards.Use SWBAT (Students will be able to). If you get stuck, try starting each learning goal with “Students will be able to…” This works for both skills and content knowledge. For example, “Students will be able to provide a two-page written analysis of the reasons behind the Civil War.” This requires students to both know information (causes of the Civil War) and do something with the information (written analysis).

, Students need to be evaluated on their performance. This helps the student know if they were successful in understanding the content, and it helps the teacher know if they were successful in delivering the content. Additionally, assessments help the teacher determine if any changes need to be made to the curriculum in the future. There are many ways to assess student performance, and assessments should be present in each unit.


Use formative assessments. Formative assessments are usually smaller, more informal assessments that provide feedback on the learning process. Although formative assessments are usually a part of the daily lesson plan, they can also be included in the unit descriptions. Examples include journal entries, quizzes, collages, or short written responses. Include summative assessments. Summative assessments occur once a full topic has been covered. These assessments are appropriate for the end of a unit or at the end of the course. Examples of summative assessments are tests, presentations, performances, papers, or portfolios.These assessments range from touching on specific details to answering essential questions or discussing larger themes.

, Lesson planning is usually separate from the curriculum development process. Although many teachers do write their own curricula, this is not always the case. Sometimes the person who wrote the curriculum is not the same person who will teach it. Either way, make sure you that what is outlined in the curriculum is used to guide lesson planning.Transfer the necessary information from your curriculum to your lesson plan. Include the name of the unit, the essential questions, and the unit goal that you are working on during the lesson.
Ensure that lesson objectives lead students to reach the unit goals. Lesson objectives (also called aims, goals, or “SWBAT”) are similar to unit goals, but must be more specific. Remember that students should be able to complete the objective by the end of the lesson. For example, “Students will be able to explain four causes of the Civil War” is a specific enough that it can be tackled in one lesson.

, Once you’ve developed the curriculum, put it into action. You won’t know if it is working until you try it out with real teachers and real students. Be aware of how students respond to the topics, teaching methods, assessments, and lessons., Reflect on how the students respond to the material. This can happen in the middle of the course, or once it has already finished. Some schools wait years to revise curricula, but revisions are important, especially since standards, technology, and students are always changing.Ask key questions when you revise the curriculum. Are the students reaching the learning goals? Are they able to answer the essential questions? Are students meeting state standards? Are students prepared for the learning beyond your class? If not, consider making revisions the content, teaching styles, and sequence.
You can revise any aspect of the curriculum, but everything must be aligned. Remember that any revisions you make to general topics need to be reflected in the other areas. For example, if you change a unit topic, remember to write new essential questions, objectives, and assessments."

Provide reading time in class.,
Enlist parents to help.,
Set up an incentive system.,
Arrange reading time outside of class.,
Talk to students who don't complete the reading.,
Hold pop quizzes.,
Assign a study guide.,
Assign extra make up work.,
Discuss the reading every class.,
Provide other ways to participate.",How to Get Your Students to Read Their Assignments," You can still assign most of the reading as homework, but let your students start it in class. If they get hooked on the story, they're much more likely to finish it. In primary school, having students read aloud can help the less skilled readers understand the assignment.;
, If you're teaching primary school, ask the parents to encourage the children to finish their reading at home. If the parents have to sign off on each stage of the reading assignment, they'll have an easier time tracking their child's progress.

, A visual tracker and reward systems may motivate some students. This works best if you know what motivates your students, and provide rewards to match.

, If feasible, invite your students to come to your classroom and read before or after school, or during lunch. If any your students have free periods, consider letting them sit at the side and read while you're teaching another class.


Consider making this mandatory if a student falls behind too far. Arrange a system with other teachers and staff so only one or two adults have to supervise this reading session each day.

, Have one-on-one conversations with the students who are falling behind. Find out what's causing the problem, and work from there.


If the whole class is behind, have a class discussion about it. They may need extra help with a type of writing they're not used to.

, It's very difficult to pass on the reading bug to a student who doesn't have it already. The possibility of pop quizzes is a more universal motivator. It's up to you how often to actually give one, but it's usually a good idea when participation starts to flag.


If the class is really falling behind, hint that there's a good chance at a pop quiz tomorrow.

, If the students are tackling more advanced reading than they're used to, help them along with a study guide. Include vocabulary words to learn, and discussion questions to think about before class.


Including worksheets or a short journal assignment lets you find out immediately who did the reading.

, Come up with a short in-class assignment for students who don't do the reading. For example, have them write two paragraphs on what they think will happen next in the story. Most students will prefer to finish the reading instead of doing the extra work again next time.

, Breaking the assignment into smaller chunks can reduce the amount of procrastination in your students. Discuss each section of the reading the very next day so students are aware that they need to keep up.

, Not all students learn well from lecture or class discussion. Try to get all your students involved in the reading with some of the following ideas:


Divide students into pairs or small groups to discuss the reading.
Draw sketches on the board for younger kids, or give older kids a handout or slideshow with visual elements.
Have students who like attention read passages aloud in a dramatic voice, or even act it out in short skits.

Set the highest grade as ""100%"".,
Implement a flat-scale curve.,
Set a bottom limit for F's.,
Use a bell curve.,
Apply a linear scale grading curve.",How to Curve Grades1," This is one of the most common (if not the most common) methods teachers and professors use for curving grades. This curving method requires the teacher to find the highest score in the class and set this as the ""new"" 100% for the assignment. This means that you subtract the highest score in the class from the hypothetical ""perfect"" score, then add the difference to every assignment, including the highest-scoring one. If done correctly, the highest-scoring assignment will now have a perfect score and every other assignment will have a higher score than it previously did.


For example, let's say the highest grade on a test was a 95%. In this case, because 100-95 = 5, we would add 5 percentage points to all of the student grades. This makes the 95% score an adjusted 100%, and every other score 5 percentage points higher than it was.
This method also works using absolute scores, rather than percentages. If the highest grade was a 28/30, for instance, you would add 2 points to the score of every assignment.;
, This technique is among the simplest of the methods used to curve grades. It is especially useful for when there was one especially difficult item on an assignment that a large majority of the class missed. To curve grades according to a flat-scale curve, simply add the same number of points to each student's grade. This can be the number of points that an item most of the class missed was worth, or it can be some other (arbitrary) number of points that you think is fair.


For instance, let's say that the entire class missed one problem which was worth 10 points. In this case, you might choose to add 10 points to every student's score. If you think the class doesn't deserve full credit for the missed problem, you might also choose to only give out 5 points.
This method is closely related to previous method, but it isn't exactly the same. Because this method doesn't specifically set the highest score in the class as a 100% maximum score, it allows for the possibility that none of the assignments receive a perfect score. It even allows for scores over 100%!

, This curving method mitigates the effect that a few very low scores can have on a student's grade. Therefore, it's especially useful in situations where a student (or an entire class) bombed a certain assignment but have since shown serious improvement and, in your opinion, deserve not to fail. In this case, instead of the normal percentage designations for letter grades (90% for A, 80% for B, etc. down to 50-0% being an F), you define a lower limit for failing grades - a minimum score that is higher than zero. This makes it so that particularly low-scoring assignments have a less drastic effect when averaged with a student's good scores. In other words, a few bad scores are less likely to drag a student's overall grade down.


For example, let's say that a student completely bombs his first test, scoring a 0. However, since then, he's studied hard, receiving 70% and 80% on his next two tests. Un-curved, he has a 50% grade right now - a failing score. If we set a lower limit on failing scores of 40%, his new average is 63.3% - a D. It's not a great score, but it's probably more fair than failing a student who's shown real promise.
You may choose to set separate lower limits for assignments that are turned in vs. assignments that are not. For example, you may decide that, for failing assignments, the lowest possible grade is a 40%, unless it's not turned in at all, in which case 30% is the lowest possible score.

, Often, the range of grades on a given assignment are distributed in a way that resembles a bell curve - a few students get high scores, most of the students score mid-range scores, and a few students get low scores. What if, for instance, on a particularly difficult assignment, the few high scores are in the 80% range, the mid-range scores are in the 60% range, and the low scores are in the 40% range? Do the very best students in your class deserve low B's and the average students deserve low D's? Probably not. By using a bell curve grading method, you set the class's mean grade as a middle C, which means that your best students should get A's and your worst students should get F's, regardless of their absolute scores.


Begin by determining the class's mean (average) score. Add up all the scores in the class, then divide by the number of students to find the mean. Let's say that, after doing this, we find an average score of 66%.
Set this as a mid-range grade. The precise grade you use is at your discretion - you may want to set the mean as a C, C+, or even B-, for instance. Let's say that we want to set our 66% as a nice, round C.
Next, decide how many points separate the letter grades in your new bell curve. Generally, bigger point intervals mean that your bell curve is more forgiving to low-scoring students. Let's say that in our bell curve, we want to separate our grades by 12 points. This means that 66 + 12 = 78 becomes our new B, while 66 - 12 = 54 becomes our new D, etc.
Assign grades according to the new bell curve system.

, When you have a very specific idea of the grade distribution you want, but the actual grades in your class don't fit, you may want to use a linear scale curve. This curve allows you to adjust the distribution of grades so to get the mean score exactly where you want it. However, it's also somewhat math intensive and it technically uses a different grading curve for each student, which some may perceive to be unfair.


First, choose 2 raw scores (actual student scores) and determine what you want them to be after the curve. For instance, let's say the actual mean score on an assignment is 70% and you want it to be 75%, while the actual lowest score is 40% and you want it to be 50%.

Next, create 2 x/y points: (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). Each x value will be one of the raw scores you chose, while each y value will be the corresponding score that you want the raw score to be. In our case, our points are (70, 75) and (40, 50).

Plug your values into the following equation: f(x) = y1 + ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)) (x-x1). Note the lone ""x"" without any subscripts - for this, plug in the score of each individual assignment. The final value you get for f(x) is the assignment's new grade. To clarify - you have to do the equation once for each student's score.
In our case, let's say we're curving an assignment that got an 80%. We would solve the equation as follows:

f(x) = 75 + (((50 - 75)/(40-70))(80-70))
f(x) = 75 + (((-25)/(-30))(10))
f(x) = 75 + .83 (10)
f(x) = 83.3 . The 80% score on this assignment is now 83.3%.

Designate five minutes a day for chatting with students.,
Express interest in their well-being.,
Have classroom discussions.",How to Get to Know Your Students1," To get to know your students, designate five minutes at the start of every class to engage in casual conversation with them. Ask about their extracurricular activities, favorite movies and music, or other topics that do not involve schoolwork. Getting to know your students’ interests will give you insight into their personalities and provide the opportunity for future conversations.For instance, once you know a student’s favorite sports teams, you can easily engage them in conversations about games, trades, and other sports news.;
, Forge a connection with your students by regularly asking them how they are doing and showing an interest in their well-being. If one of your students is upset, speak to them one-on-one and ask questions to figure out what is going on. Regardless of how the students answer, continue asking them about their lives to demonstrate that you care.For instance, if a normally outgoing student is quiet and withdrawn, ask something like, “How are you doing today? I noticed that you didn’t say anything during our class discussion. Is anything bothering you?”

, Discussion and debate are excellent teaching tools, and good ways to get to know your students. Start a class discussion on a key topic being covered in your course (e.g. global warming) by posing specific questions asking for your students’ opinions.For example, start a conversation by proposing questions like, “How do you feel about the issue of global warming? Are we doing enough to address it?”
Fuel ongoing discussions by posing follow up questions or by acknowledging the opposition of different opinions within the classroom (e.g. “Many of you seem to agree that global warming is an imminent threat to our planet, but some of you are shaking your heads as if you disagree. Do you mind sharing your opinion on the issue with the class?”)

"
"
Offer re-do opportunities.,
Remove an item from the assignment and regrade.,
Assign extra credit problems.",How to Curve Grades2," If you're not interested in applying a complicated formula to your students' grades, but you still want to offer them a chance to improve their score on a certain assignment, consider offering students an opportunity to re-do sections of an assignment they did poorly on. Give the assignment back to students and allow them to re-do problems they missed. Then, grade the problems they re-did. Offer the students some percentage of the points they earned on their re-do attempt, and add these to their first score to get their final grades.


Let's say that a student scored 60 points out of 100 on a test. We give the test back to the student, offering half-credit for any problems she re-does. She re-works the problems she missed, scoring 30 more points. We then give her 30/2 = 15 more points, making her final score 60 + 15 = 75 points.

Don't allow students to merely correct the work they've done. Instead, to ensure they fully understand how to do the problems from start to finish, have them completely rewrite the items they missed.


, Even the best teachers occasionally put unfair or misleading questions on their tests. If, after grading, you find that there are one or two particular items that most of the students seemed to struggle on, you may want to disregard these questions and grade the assignment as if they weren't included. This is an especially good idea if a certain question used concepts that you haven't taught your students yet or if it falls outside the reasonable expectations for student performance. In these cases, re-grade assignments as if the problematic sections don't exist.


Note, however, that this method gives extra weight to the questions you do choose to include. It may also anger students who did well on the questions you chose to eliminate - you may want to offer them some form of extra credit.

, This is one of the oldest tricks in the book. After an assignment that went poorly for some (or all) of your students, offer your students a special problem, project or task that, if completed, will raise their scores. This may be an extra problem that requires creative thinking, an extra assignment, or even a presentation - be creative!


However, use caution with this method - the students who probably need the most help are also the least-likely to be able to answer super-hard extra credit questions. You may find that your extra credit assignments are more effective if they allow students to incorporate classroom concepts into outside-the-box projects and assignments. For instance, if you're teaching a class on poetry, you may want to offer an extra-credit assignment that requires students to analyze the rhyme scheme of their favorite pop song.

Pass around a “getting to know you” questionnaire at the beginning of the year.,
Assign unique projects.,
Keep track of student progress.",How to Get to Know Your Students2," To get an initial sense of each student’s background and interests, pass around a questionnaire for them to fill out at the start of the year. At the top of the form, have students write their full name and classroom number. Include questions that require more detail than a simple yes or no, such as:”What is your favorite subject at school?”
”What is your favorite hobby?”
”How many siblings do you have?”
”Who do you most admire?”
”What career do you hope to have?”

, Use course work to get to know students better by assigning projects that reveal more about each student’s unique persona. If you are teaching an English class, for example, assign a project where students write about their favorite book of all time, and what it means to them. Having students present these projects to the class is also a way to help students get to know one another beyond their basic interactions., Keep detailed accounts of students’ progress to get a better sense of what they are like individually. Note the students who are falling behind (e.g. not turning in assignments or participating in classroom activities) and approach them about their work habits to find out if any particular obstacles are standing in their way. Take note of students who may be struggling with course material, as well as those who are excelling and may need extra challenges."
"
Attend extra-curricular activities.,
Hold office hours.,
Set up an online component to your courses.",How to Get to Know Your Students3," If your students participate in extra-curricular activities within the school, make a point of attending games or events from time to time. Making the effort to show support on your own time will show students that you care, and let you observe them in an environment outside of the classroom. It may also provide the opportunity to interact with your students’ families in a casual, friendly atmosphere and learn more about them.To really get to know your students, consider signing up to coach a sports team or organize an after-school activity at school (e.g. the debate club).

, Give students the opportunity to reach out to you outside of the classroom by holding office hours during the week. Tell students that they are free to drop by during this time to discuss classwork or personal issues they might wish to talk about. Write your office hours somewhere for reference (e.g. on the chalk board of your classroom).Provide a way for your more introverted students to reach you by giving students your email address.

, To keep communication open with your students outside of class time, set up a website or other online component for your students. For example, set up a free wikispace classroom where you can add lesson plans, track student progress, have students write collaboratively, or engage in online discussions. This kind of web presence is a good way to monitor student activity and to get to know their work habits."
"
Hand out a syllabus or course outline.,
Use your students' names in the classroom.,
Dress professionally.",How to Get to Know Your Students4," While being friendly with students is beneficial in getting to know them, maintaining authority in your class is important. Hand out a syllabus or course outline at the beginning of the school year that details the rules and expectations for the year, as well as the consequences students will face if they do not meet the requirements. Having these details in writing will allow you to enforce rules in your classroom without seeming reactionary or unfair., Using your students' names in class is a good way to remain authoritative while maintaining a positive association with them. Calling on students often will show that you are paying attention to them, but it will also to hold them accountable for their participation and behavior. To help learn the names of new students quickly:Have each student introduce themselves to the class on the first day.
Annotate your class roster.
Use a seating chart for the first week of class.

, Distinguish yourself from your students by dressing professionally for work. Opt for dress pants and a dress shirt or blouse instead of jeans and a t-shirt, which is close to student attire. Maintain this level of attire from the first day, as first impressions are important in establishing a dynamic with your students."

Envision the way you want your classroom to look like.,
Establish what your school will allow you to do.,
Figure out what materials are available.,
Consider your budget.",How to Decorate a Classroom1," Identify the grade level, subjects taught, and cultural context of the students. The classroom décor needs to be visually stimulating and age appropriate.


A cartoon alphabet might be perfect for 5-6 year olds, but won't impress a class full of teenagers.
What are your student's interests? What are they studying? The classroom décor shouldn't just look nice, it should be functional too. Maps, posters of division tables or examples of letter-writing formats can be visually appealing while also reinforcing what the students are learning.;
, Take a blank sheet of paper and do a rough sketch of what your classroom would ideally look like. Think about the layout, the furniture, the color scheme and the theme.


Be realistic. Take into account the amount of space available, the existing furniture and how much artistic freedom your school is willing to give you.
Get the kid's ideas too. Ask them to draw what they'd like their classroom to look like - you don't know what ideas they might come up with!
If you're really stuck, ask local artists to come in and brainstorm with you!

, Sometimes your redecorating plans might be restricted by what the principal or school board will allow you to do. You might have complete freedom or you may be limited by a number of rules. If in doubt, it's always wiser to ask for permission first.


Will your school allow you and your students to paint a mural on the wall?
Are certain areas of the classroom reserved for things like announcements and school notices?
Can you use the outside walls of the classroom?(Some teachers use the hallways outside their classrooms for large art projects.)

, See what materials are at your disposal before you go shopping for supplies. If you already have paint, colored paper, glue or any other art supplies you can save yourself time and money.


Things like vases, floor cushions and file folders can also go a long way in making your classroom feel comfortable and organized.
Ask other teachers if they have art supplies or room furnishings that they are not using or planning on getting rid of.

, There is a huge variation in how much money teachers spend on decorating their classrooms. You don't need to spend a fortune to make your classroom look good, but if you're completely overhauling your classroom, you'll probably need to drop some cash - how much is up to you.


Figure out if your school provides an allowance for teachers to decorate their classroom or if you'll have to fund the decorating project out of your own pocket.
Art materials can usually be found pretty cheaply but if you need to get rugs, lamps and wall hangings everything can start to add up.
If money isn't an object and you're not creatively inclined, there are plenty of classroom supply websites where you'll find beautiful, pre-made classroom decorations.

Pick a theme.,
Pick a color scheme.,
Focus on useful displays.,
Personalize it.,
Google ""classroom decoration ideas"" for further inspiration.",How to Decorate a Classroom2," Planning your classroom décor around a certain theme can help simplify the decision process and is a fun way to make your classroom more visually appealing. The sky is the limit when it comes to picking a theme, but here are some of the most popular ones:


Space: Cover your walls in shiny CDs to represent planets and have kids cut stars, comets, rocket ships and satellites out of gold and silver metallic paper. Turn your teacher's desk into a space station control center by adding rabbit-ear TV antennas and big Lego ""buttons"". Create mobiles of the solar system to hang from the ceiling and make a picture board with a photo of each student in the center of a star - if you're good with special effects, use the computer to make it look like they're in an astronaut suit!Hollywood: Buy a red carpet runner to turn your classroom doorway into a red carpet, turn student lockers into star-dressing rooms by sticking a gold star with the child's name on the outside and display student's work on a ""Wall of Fame.""
Western: Make a bulletin board of ""Third Grade's Most Wanted"" and add a photo of each child wearing a mustache and cowboy hat. Put a campfire in your reading center using rolled-up brown paper for logs and some gray stones circling around to hold it all together. Cover reading cushions with denim or bandana print fabric.

, Choose a color scheme for your classroom. Try to stick to 2-3 colors, this will help give a clean and consistent to your classroom décor.


If you're painting the walls, stick with one block color - multiple colors or patterns can look too busy and be distracting.
Remember - you'll have to live with your chosen color scheme all year, so choose wisely.

, Classroom posters shouldn't just look pretty, they should also display helpful learning materials which students can easily refer to at all times. If you can connect classroom assignments with visual projects, done with lots of color and strong graphic design elements (titles, borders, matting, and composition), then your room will be the envy of all the teachers.


Hang up posters featuring all kinds of helpful information - from multiplication tables, to French verb conjugations, to lists of capital cities. Use these posters as teaching materials during your lessons and your students will appreciate their value.

, Personalizing your classroom with photographs and student artwork will create a unique and meaningful environment for your class.


Showcase student artwork, creative writing and photos from field trips and class activities.
Try to use student-produced material to decorate your classroom, rather than posters or decorations you bought in a store. Have the kids work in groups to make their own posters, containing the information they think would be most helpful - whether this is an explanation of tricky math problems or guidelines for doing cursive writing.

, The possibilities are endless when it comes to decorating your classroom, and the internet is your best resource for ideas. Whether you're decorating on a budget or trying to make your classroom stand out from the rest, you're sure to find inspiration online.

Organizing the troops.,
Making paper whirligigs.,
Making papier mâché.,
Making woven paper baskets.,
Drawing creatively.,
Taking care of plants and animals.",How to Decorate a Classroom3," The best, most enthusiastic decorating team you'll ever find is sitting right in front of you - your class! Getting your students involved in the decorating process will save you both money and time, while also bolstering the kids' sense of class pride.


Split the kids up into teams and assign each team a different project to work on.
Try to rope in a few parent volunteers to oversee each team and help with some of the more complicated stuff.

, Whirligigs are a fun and easy classroom decoration that kids can make themselves. Once the kids have decorated their whirligigs with bright colors and patterns, they'll look fantastic hanging from the ceiling!


Decorate a paper plate any way you like. Try using lots of color, glitter, feathers and plastic jewels. Make sure to decorate both sides.
Cut the paper plate in a spiral pattern, starting from the outside and working your way to the center.
Punch a hole in the center of the plate, then tie with colored string or ribbon.
Hang the paper whirligig from the ceiling and watch it twirl in the breeze!

, Papier mâché is messy and time consuming...but kids just love making it. Plus the finished product looks fantastic. Use paper mâché to make baskets for putting things in, masks to hang on the wall, sculptures of animals. Anything you can think of really.


First you will need to tear newspaper into lots of long, one inch thick strips.
Then you will need to make a glue mixture. You can do this using either two parts white glue and one part water, or one part flour and one part water. Blend your chosen mixture together until smooth.
Dip the newspaper strips into your mixture, remove any excess, then smooth onto whatever surface you're covering.
Repeat until the entire surface is covered, then leave to dry thoroughly.

, Teach your students how to make pretty, woven paper baskets out of different colored card. Use the baskets to hold toys, pencils or art supplies, or alternatively, hang the baskets on a piece of string and drape across the ceiling for a creative and eye-catching display.


Take a piece of 12 inch (30.5 cm) by 12 inch (30.5 cm) colored card and draw two lines - one at the 4 inch (10.2 cm) mark and the other at the 8 inch (20.3 cm) mark - all the way across the card. This will help to mark out the placement of the bottom of the basket.
Then turn the piece of card 90 degrees and cut it into 14 strips - each 1/2 an inch wide.
Weave these pieces together - seven going in one direction and seven going in the other.
Take a wooden box with sides measuring four square inches. Place your woven strips of card over one side and adjust it so that the score marks on the card line up with the edges of the box.
Take another piece of card (in a contrasting color) and cut out another twelve strips, each 12 inches (30.5 cm) long and 1/2 an inch wide. Glue each strip to a second strip to make 6 extra long pieces.
Turn the box on its side and weave the long strips of card horizontally though the card folded vertically over the sides of the box. Turn the box to complete each side. Tuck in or trim the ends of each horizontal row before moving on to the next.
You can add the finishing touch by creating a border around the top of the basket. Glue two 12 inch (30.5 cm) by 1 inch (2.5 cm) strips to the outside edge and two more to trim the inside, once you have removed the box.
Use some ribbon or wire to make a pretty handle for the basket, if you like.

, Everyone knows that kids have the most fantastic imaginations. Why not let your students loose on a blank piece of paper and see what wonderful ideas they come up with? Hang the pictures on the wall for an imaginative display, inspired by every child's unique personality.


Try using different materials. Give the kids access to crayons, pencils, markers, chalk and paint. Each will produce a completely different result.
Give your kids a prompt. Ask your students to draw their families, their favorite animal or their best memory. You'll be amazed and amused at what they come up with.
Try making scratch art or melted crayon stained glass windows.
Try using stencils or let kids trace their favorite picture.

, Plants and small animals can add color and life to any classroom. Teach your students about responsibility by assigning a student every week to water the plants or feed the class pet.


Fish and hamsters are popular classroom pets that require relatively little attention. However, if you're feeling more adventurous, a turtle or rabbit can be a great choice.
Make sure to ask the principal's permission before introducing a pet to the class!

To guide the classroom evaluation process, here is a list of background noise sources.,
Ceiling level; the higher the ceiling level the more the room tends to a 'live' acoustic response, which can be detrimental to speech intelligibility and to attention spans in the learning environment.,
Air handling systems; heaters, air-conditioners, etc.,
Lighting; lighting can reflect noise if installed improperly.,
Flooring; flooring should have material that improves acoustics.",How to Evaluate a Class Room for Acoustical Renovation," Background noise can emanate from: noise traveling through walls from adjacent classrooms, over the ceiling from adjacent classrooms, through doors, around the door frame and under the door, through ventilators or louvers above door units, through HVAC ductwork from adjacent rooms, HVAC noise from ceiling diffusers, through the light fixtures, from outside, through exterior walls and windows, and from the floor above.;
, The ceilings (and the floor) are usually the largest single areas in a classroom, and so provide convenient surfaces to accommodate cost-effective areas of acoustic absorbing materials and products. However, if the ceiling is less than 6m high (and even for higher ceilings up to 10m or so), it also provides a useful reflection of the teacher's voice that arrives early enough at the students' ears so as to reinforce the direct sound and enhance speech intelligibility. It is important to be able to control reverberation using acoustic tiles or some kind of sound absorbing material like glass fibre, while also retaining the useful reflective quality of at least the central 50% area of the ceiling. Upgrading strategically located areas of ceiling tiles, combined with additional areas on the walls as required, to acoustically absorbing tiles and finishes will dramatically reduce the reverberation and improve speech intelligibility, and hence attention span.

, produce a lot of noise especially if ill maintained. Noise can be reduced by lowering the air-flow velocity, installing absorptive fiberglass duct liners or creating noise diffusers or sound traps in the equipment/machinery space. Regular maintenance of the equipment is also helpful.

, For instance, luminary lights are very bright and reflect as much light as they do noise. This can be improved by installing lights that don't shine directly onto the students. Another thing to note with lighting is that fluorescent lights continuously give off a noticeable buzzing noise which increases reverberation time.

, For example, carpeting absorbs air-borne sound, helps block sound transmission to rooms below and reduces surface noise better compared to tile or wood flooring.

Teach different kinds of classes.,
Utilize continuing education.,
Use creative thinking while evolving your approach as a language instructor.,
Develop your curriculum.,
Include motivational components and challenges.",How to Develop As a Language Teacher," One way to develop your approach as a language teacher is to diversify the kinds of classes that you provide.


Teach different ages and class sizes. Teaching a single student is different from instructing a large class, and teaching children is different from teaching adults. Try a variety of classes to diversify your approach and become more flexible as a language instructor.
Teach different levels. You may be great at helping beginners get their first few words down, or fantastic at fine-tuning an individual's existing knowledge of a language. By learning how to do both, you will become a more valuable part of the language teaching community.;
, It's always possible to take more courses in classroom instruction to fine-tune your teaching skills.


Classroom management or similar workshops can help you with the administrative side of an instructional program, where more specialized classes from experienced trainers will address the ""building blocks of language"" to help you build technique.

,


Think from the student's perspective. Approach your classes as if you are involved in them from the other side and brainstorm appropriately to enhance or improve classes and programs.
Add interactive activities and elements to your classes. This will help to provide a very important aspect of instruction for language classes: engagement of students in real-time, hands-on experience with language.

, Use a number of common strategies to build a curriculum that you can use in the classroom to make your language classes better.


Accumulate handouts. Build a supply of handouts you have used in a class. Keep them in an accessible location for future classes.
Evaluate textbooks through use. Find the best (and worst) aspects of textbooks available from language education companies and renovate your use of these resources to provide classes that address specific student needs.

, Make sure your classes promote the kinds of skills that help students master a language. Include relevant challenges for improving the use of a language.

Determine the format for the quiz bee.,
Outline the rules for the quiz bee.,
Compile the content for the school quiz bee.,
Look for a host at your school.,
Bring in a guest announcer.,
Make sure the host is confident in front of a crowd.,
Use an existing online quiz.,
Design your own school quiz bee.,
Test the school quiz bee on a school computer.,
Enlist participants.,
Provide sample questions to the participants.,
Do a practice round.",How to Conduct a School Quiz Bee," You should determine the format of the quiz bee, including the subject matter of the quiz bee, the number of students competing in the quiz bee, and how the quiz bee will unfold. Having a set format for the quiz bee will ensure it runs smoothly.Decide if the participants in the quiz bee are going to be in teams or competing as individuals. If your school is fairly large, you may break up students into teams based on classroom so there is enough time for each team to compete in the quiz bee. If your school is fairly small, you may be able to allow the students to compete individually.
If there are going to be many teams or students competing in the quiz bee, you may have each team or student compete in heats against each other in their classrooms. The winners of each heat may then go on to the final round of the school quiz bee and compete in front of the entire school.;
, It may be best to keep the rules simple for a school quiz bee, as you want the quiz to appeal to a wide range of students and age groups. You should determine the rules for the quiz bee and write them down so you can reference them and share them with the participants of the quiz bee.For example, you may institute a time limit for each response to a quiz question by a team or individual student. You may allow the host to read out the quiz question to the team and then start the timer. If you are timing the responses, have a timekeeper on hand or use a stopwatch that is large and easy for all participants to see.
You may also make a rule about what to do in the event of a tie, such as a rapid fire deciding round where whichever team or participant responds to a quiz question first wins.

, Consider if the quiz bee will test students on a particular subject, such as a spelling quiz bee, or on a variety of subjects, such as mathematics, science, and social studies questions. You may pull test questions from existing quizzes from previous classes or create new test questions for the quiz bee.You may also use sample quiz questions from standardized tests in the school quiz bee. You may go for a variety of quiz questions, ranging from very easy to very difficult to ensure the participants have a fair chance at winning the quiz bee.

, You can conduct the school quiz bee by first finding a host at your school, such as a teacher, a teacher’s aide, or a member of the school’s administration. If you are a teacher, you may host the school quiz bee yourself. The host should be able to be present for the entirety of the school quiz bee., You may also opt to bring in a host or announcer that is not from your school. This could be a parent, a former student, or a member of the community. You may choose a guest announcer who has participated in school events before or someone you believe will make a good host., You should check that the host is comfortable speaking clearly and slowly to students, as they will need to read out the questions in the school quiz bee. The host should also be able to project their voice so they can be heard in a room and have a friendly, encouraging demeanor so the participants in the school quiz bee feel supported while they compete.


You may look for a host who has experience with conducting school quiz bees or who is comfortable speaking in front of a crowd.

, You may also consider using a quiz creation program on your computer to conduct the school quiz bee. You can find quiz creation programs online. Some quiz creation programs are free to use or may require a small fee.You can use existing quizzes in the program in your school quiz bee and adjust them to fit your needs.
Some programs have an option where you allow the program to conduct the school quiz bee for you, with animations and automated cues that play when a student or team clicks on a question.

, If you are familiar with how to use animation programs, you may try designing your own school quiz bee program. You may need to use a quiz design program to create a custom quiz for your school’s quiz bee or use animation programs like Adobe Flash.


You should include interactive elements into your school quiz bee, such as buttons that trigger audio prompts or a running total of the player’s score on the bottom of the screen. You may also allow the participants to enter in text into the quiz to answer a question or have a results screen at the end of the quiz.You may also include interesting background images in the school quiz bee and make the quiz appear visually appealing so the participants are more engaged in the content.

, Before you launch the school quiz bee in front of students, you should do a test run of the quiz on a school computer. You may put yourself in the role of a participant and run through the quiz on your own. Using a school computer to test the quiz can help to ensure it will run smoothly for students at school.


You should make sure any interactive elements of the quiz are functioning properly. You should also check to make sure the questions and answers that appear in the quiz are correct, as you do not want a participant to notice an error during the quiz bee.

, Get the word out about the event so students can sign up to compete. Ask teachers to announce it in their classes. Make posters about the event to put up around school. You want as many students as possible to be involved so everyone at school has an opportunity to compete.You may also work with other teachers to put together a list of students to enlist as participants in the school quiz bee. This may be a list of start students or students who show potential and might make good competitors.

, You may provide contestants with sample question packets so that they can practice ahead of time. These can be especially helpful if the competing teams plan to practice together beforehand, or if students are unfamiliar with what a quiz bee is like and want to get a sense of the question levels beforehand.You may create your own sample question packets with questions that are similar to the questions in the school quiz bee. You may hand out the sample question packets one week before the competition so the students have time to prepare.

, To get the participants warmed up, you might want to conduct a practice round before the school quiz bee begins. These can be easy questions just so people get the hang of how it works with the reading, the timing, and their answers.Doing this can also allow the participants to get used to the format of the school quiz bee and be better prepared to compete once the event begins.

Lay a very dark colored cutting board (or tile or other sinkable, waterproof flat surface) into a shallow baking tray.,
Put enough cool (ocean temperature) water so that 1/8th of an inch or so is above the cutting board, and there are no dry spots on the surface.

,
Set up a 'drop-light' in so that it shines onto the water surface, but absolutely not in or above it.,
This is your ocean.,
Get 2 plastic baggies: one tinted (usually freezer) bag and one clear (usually sandwich) bag.,
Fit the baggie corners into the glass, open, as if to make a liner for the glass.,
Teaching point number two here: the air in each glass and the baggie lining is our atmosphere.,
Now we get to see what happens.,
Watch!,
If a glass moves, give it a little silverware corral , pull them out, make sure the water is still equally deep in the pan and start over.,
As the experiment goes on, teaching points abound: The light and heat in the glasses immediately started piling up, trapping more and more pressure in the glass until it starts streaming out from under the rims.,
The bubbling slows through 3-5 minutes, during which you can ask pointed questions: What do you see?,
Now you can turn off the lamp, and let the whole thing cool.,
Look at the water in the glasses, now that they are cooled off.,
This should have sparked a good conversation about climate science.",How to Demonstrate the Greenhouse Effect," Both should be able to lie flat, so that if you fill it with water, that water would be the same depth at any spot.;
,, This light plugs into the wall and should not get wet, and should not be placed anywhere above the water, only beside the pan (A drop-light is a powerful lamp used by handymen/women and such, someone surely has among their belongings, try folks who can fix things. if not they cost about $15-$25 at Home Depot, Kmart, Big Lots etc.)

, Turn on the drop-light to its highest setting. Wait a minute; at this point you can see wisps of water vapor start rising from the 'ocean' surface, as the 'sunlight' hits it. Teaching point number one there: water comes up off of the ocean, and moves around with the wind, so it can't help but find itself going all over land as well. When the water in the air (clouds) drops over land, it falls as snow, rain, sleet, hail, what have you.

, cut one corner from each, sized just so that you can fit them, opened, into a glass.

, use some wooden spoon help to gently make it fit.

, The clear plastic lining represents the atmosphere from long ago, with a 'regular' amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases, before humanity started putting a lot of extra stuff into it. The tinted plastic represents an atmosphere with a lot of extra pollution, CO2, and other greenhouse gases in it (more like it is today) with a lot of stuff put in by humans (cars, cattle farts, factories, gases set free from polar ice melting, etc.)

, as the experiment goes on, watch carefully to see if there's a difference in these two from just the color and possibly the thickness of our added 'greenhouse gas layer'. Ready? Have your helpers place the glasses upside down in the water; they should be in position equally in front of the lamp, about two to three inches away from the lamp, in the water, upside down.

, The air inside the glass was just like the air you are breathing- same temperature, pressure, humidity, etc., but now it's in a closed space, with light and heat shooting into it. What happens?

, You want to be careful to place the glasses down straight, without any side movement; side movement creates a dry spot underneath, and that changes how fast the the dry spot will appear under one or both glasses. You want the things to be as equal as possible, with the only difference being the cut baggie corner materials.

, Does one seem to bubble more than the other?


As an alternate, you might want to try this with the light turned off and see how the glasses do with just ordinary room light coming in. The drop-light just lets you do this much more efficiently.

, Why is that happening? If this is the ocean being influenced by the sun, Where does the water vapor go? if it got hotter, would it happen faster? What would the water vapor (clouds) do then? Would it snow and rain more over land then?

, Let it sit for 5-6 minutes, during which you can have teams take up positions on whether one glass was more this or more that, letting them set their own parameters for measurement. it starts with, ""what did you see?"", and who agrees or disagrees based upon evidence.

, Was there a dry spot there before? now are the water levels the same? What made one cooling glass pull up more water than the other glass? Was that the only difference?

, The dozens of other factors at work can be brought in later, but the mechanism of the greenhouse effect on the ocean and how it spurs evaporation and puts more moisture into the air, which then comes to land in the form of precipitation, should be a little bit clearer.

Create packets with additional work ahead of time.,
Provide challenging mathematical reasoning problems.,
Offer activities that encourage scientific investigation.,
Assign a current events analysis project.,
Have your gifted student keep a journal.,
Keep subject-relevant books and magazines handy.",How to Challenge Gifted Students Who Finish Work Early1," Teachers will inevitably identify gifted students who finish work early and should thus plan ahead before the start of the school year or specific learning unit. Compile supplemental learning packets that are self-explanatory and either subject-specific or filled with general educational activities when you’re designing your lesson plan. That way, you’ll be prepared with rich, engaging content that won't require you to spend too much time away from other students.You can find subject-specific lesson plans and resources on websites like MENSA for Kids (http://www.mensaforkids.org/teach/lesson-plans/) and the National Research Center on the Gifted and Talented (http://nrcgt.uconn.edu/research-based_resources/).;
, Assign your mathematically gifted student content that helps them apply reasoning skills to everyday problems. Use word problems that apply that unit’s math skills to specific contexts instead of, for example, simply assigning additional exercises with the same content as the work they’ve just finished.Pre-scripted word problems that apply the unit's skills to real world scenarios won't require you to offer further instruction, keeping gifted students challenged while optimizing your time.
If other students are busy with their work and you have a moment for further explanation, you can also preview the next unit’s content with your gifted student. Have them begin to work on problems with the next unit’s reasoning skills. For example, if your middle or late elementary schooler has mastered multiplication and division, introduce them to pre-algebra exercises., Incorporate independent and age-appropriate activities, such as a classroom corner with materials of various buoyancies and densities. Keep microscopes in the classroom if possible, with sample slides of different geological and biological specimens.You can show the entire class how to operate age-appropriate microscopes and other equipment, then early finishers can engage in self-directed activities until the rest of the class has completed the assignment.
To reduce the amount of time spent offering instructions, prepare worksheets with prompts appropriate for their grade level that follow the scientific method. For example, ask students on their worksheets, “Which material do you hypothesize will float in water, and which will sink? Describe the procedure you used to test your hypothesis. How did your experiment prove or disprove your hypothesis?” That way, you can briefly tell your gifted students what to do when they're finished, then they can follow the worksheets' written prompts.

, If you’re a social studies specialist, have early finishers research a current news story. Assign an analysis project with specific and self-explanatory prompts and criteria.For example, select articles ahead of time and create worksheets that ask students to summarize an article, discuss its point of view or biases, and support their analysis with citations.
Have them compare two or more articles on the same current event and discuss the similarities and differences between the articles’ points of view.
You can also assign students to compare current and historical events. Either assign specific past and present events or have students select their own and explain their bases for making the comparison.

, For additional literature or creative writing coursework, assign journal prompts to students who finish early. For example, if you’re working on a specific genre, like short stories, have your early finishers compose their own story. Provide a worksheet that directs them to define their story’s components, such as climax and resolution.If you’re working on poetry, try having students compose poems with more rigid structures. For example, if they’ve already written poems in free verse, have them use their extra time to write works with particular rhyme schemes and forms, such as sonnets.
Free-writing exercises with more open-ended guidelines can also help you keep gifted students engaged and allow you to keep your attention on the rest of the class.

, Go for subject-specific silent reading that deepens students’ understanding of the learning unit’s skills or genre. Consider including worksheets with prompts that reinforce the unit’s reasoning or analytical skills.For example, have early finishers learning about the solar system read articles that detail new findings about dwarf planetoids or planets beyond our own solar system. Have them compose a summary about how these new findings allow us to learn more about our own solar system’s formation.
Silent reading, with or without supplemental worksheets, is a self-directed and self-explanatory exercise that will allow you to balance your time between kids at varying learning levels.

Talk to people you know.",How to Become a Tutor2," Becoming a private tutor can be very rewarding, especially if you're an expert in an in-demand field. In-person tutoring is much more rewarding and effective than online tutoring, but online tutoring (through email or a chat room) can earn you a little extra money.

, If you go into business for yourself, open a PayPal account to make it easy for your clients to pay you in whatever way is most convenient. Being able to offer credit card acceptance could make the difference between getting a client or not.

, Ask them if they can tell students who need help currently about your services.

, Be careful when advertising on craigslist, however- you don't want to get caught up in a scam.

, Speak with your friends, parents, or siblings about your tutoring services, and offer them a discount if they tell their friends, or volunteer to tutor for a little while so that they can test you out and you can build a reputation.

Most schools require you to request a purchase order before shopping, especially if your school requires you to buy from specific stores. Ask your school's bookkeeper if a purchase order is required before you start buying supplies. You'll need to write down each purchase on the order and return it to your school when you're finished buying your supplies.;
, Schools are tax exempt, so if you have your school's tax number, you won't have to pay sales tax on your supplies.You'll need to provide the number when you buy your supplies, so make sure you ask your school for it before you start shopping., American teachers can claim a $250 tax deduction on teaching supplies, so make sure you save your receipts for your tax return. If you don't live in America, check with your tax professional to see what deductions teachers are eligible for in your country., The setup of your classroom might mean you can’t use certain supplies, so look at your room before making a list. This is especially important if you have a new classroom this year!.


Do you have a chalkboard, a whiteboard, or a smartboard? Each requires different supplies!
How much wall space is available? You may need to adjust your decor purchases for each classroom. For example, if your classroom doesn't have much wall space, you won't need to buy posters, but you can buy mobiles to hang from the ceiling instead!
What kind of storage does the classroom have? You may need to buy fewer supplies if you can’t store them in the room.

, Keeping all the items you need on a list will help you stay organized and prevent you from forgetting anything. A basic list will usually include paper, pencils, pens, folders, and art supplies for younger students., How you teach will determine what kind of supplies you need. If you plan to use art to teach students, add paints, markers, and blank paper to your list. If you prefer to show films, make sure you have copies of the movies you need. If you have any long-term lesson plans, like hatching baby chicks or putting on a classroom play, you might want to make a special list just for that.

, Some subjects, such as chemistry or art, require specific supplies that you’ll need to plan ahead for. If you teach multiple subjects, make separate lists for each one., This is especially important if you are changing grade levels. First graders won’t need wide-ruled notebooks, but fourth graders will., Many important classroom supplies are not used by students at all! You’ll need teaching books, lesson plan books, grade books, and office supplies, and you may need more items if you teach a specialized subject like art or biology., Many teachers are expected to supply items like wet wipes, paper towels, and tissues for their classrooms. If your school does not provide these for you, make sure you add them to your list!, Class decor is an important part of your supply list. Educational decor can help reinforce students’ learning and make your classroom a positive, welcoming place. Informative posters, letter cutouts for students’ names and lesson titles, and pictures of classroom subjects are useful supplies. You can even choose a fun theme for your classroom decor, like outer space or local history!, Some schools will buy office supplies for you to use, others will buy anything needed for any lesson plan, and some schools won’t purchase anything at all. This varies from district to district and from year to year, so check with your school’s administration before purchasing anything yourself. Anything the school buys for you can be removed from your personal budget., You can save a lot of money in your own budget by asking parents to send their children to school with their own classroom supplies, like colored pencils and binders. However, you should be aware of your students' income levels. Parents may not be able to afford all the supplies on your list., Once you have determined what the school will pay for and what your students can buy, look at the remaining items on your list. Do you have enough money to buy all the supplies on your list? If not, remove less important items, or add them to your students’ school supply purchase list. Move the most important items to the top of the list., Use things you already own whenever possible! You can use bottle caps for math lessons, egg cartons to store paint, and cardboard boxes to make dioramas., Local businesses and communities are often willing to donate items to teachers. Before you purchase anything, see if you can get donated supplies!Ask local businesses for donations of used, damaged, or clearance items.
If you belong to a house of worship or a community center, ask them for school supplies.
Ask friends or relatives with older children to donate any unused supplies from previous years.

, Many communities have a local Freecycle or similar group that allows members to post free items to give away. Join your local group and check daily for items you can use in your classroom, like furniture, art supplies, and movies. You can even request specific items!

, Don’t just go to the nearest teacher supply store and buy your entire list in one day! Find out which local stores offer regular sales and coupons before you buy anything. Check your newspaper’s weekly sales flyers and sign up for email updates from your favorite suppliers., Knowing what stores carry which supplies will help you plan your shopping much more easily. You’ll probably want to buy from a variety of stores to get the best prices., You can find school supplies, arts and crafts products, books, and other items for much lower prices, and many allow bulk purchases.

, Teacher stores carry merchandise designed specifically for teachers, like classroom management products, educational materials and classroom decorations.


Alternatively, buy from online or mail-order classroom supply stores. These stores provide bulk school supplies and often work directly with schools to streamline the purchasing process. Ask your administration if your school already has an account with a certain vendor.

, Office supply stores are a good source for copy paper, pencils, plain notebooks, and other basic supplies. Many of them offer bulk discounts and simplified tax forms! And arts and crafts stores are great for things like construction paper, paints, crayons, and glitter, and many larger chains offer weekly coupons.

, It’s cheaper to buy things in bulk, so if you see an item on sale and you know you’ll be using it frequently, buy as many as you can. Items like crayons or spiral notebooks can be bought years ahead of time., Many retailers offer discounts to teachers, so be prepared to show your school ID when you buy supplies!"

Assign extended independent research projects.,
Team up with other teachers.,
Encourage work that will benefit the school and community.",How to Challenge Gifted Students Who Finish Work Early2," Instead of isolated, unit- or lesson-specific assignments, consider having gifted students work on an integrated project throughout an entire term. It can be crafted based on your subject of specialization or tailored to the student’s specific interests. Having a go-to independent project will also reduce a gifted student's need for further instruction or direction, allowing you to keep them engaged while concentrating efforts on the rest of the class.For example, your gifted history student can work on an in-depth analysis of an empire or particular historical figure. If your term’s content deals with a specific historical period, like Medieval history, they can choose a relevant figure or geographical area and complete assignments that require more detailed study to supplement the course’s survey approach.
Giving them clear, written guidelines ahead of time will help them stay organized without verbal instruction. For example, week one can direct them to find out a historical figure's date and place of birth, information about their families and upbringing, and other early information. Week two can focus on researching information about an early formative event. Successive weeks could direct them in a similar chronological or categorical manner.

, Try reaching out to teachers in other grade levels and subject areas to create a school-wide collaborative program. Early finishers can work on ongoing projects, like a school newspaper or literary magazine, alongside students from other grades. Provided the task is age-appropriate, they can independently manage work like editing submissions for the school newspaper or composing their short story for the magazine.You can also work with other teachers to create additional competitive challenges, like spelling or geography bees, science fairs, and debate contests. Students can independently prepare for an upcoming bee or debate during their extra time.

, Rather than assigning additional subject-specific educational content, you could try a service or community-oriented project. For example, consider having early finishers work on independently organizing a school-wide food or clothing drive.Ambitious projects might require more time away from helping the rest of your class, so be sure to stay focused on the core curriculum when planning special projects.
Try thinking about a project that might have a connection to your specialty subject and the school’s particular needs. For instance, if you’re teaching an earth science class and your school doesn’t recycle, have your students contact your city’s local government to acquire recycling bins. They can draft a letter to the school principal and do research about how to acquire bins independently while you assist other students. Then you can continue to work with them on the project outside of class.

Be sensitive about encouraging clustered learning.,
Try not to assign more work with the same content.,
Avoid assigning classroom chores to occupy students.,
Avoid using gifted students as teacher’s assistants.",How to Challenge Gifted Students Who Finish Work Early3," Differentiating your classroom’s learning structure can be an effective and necessary tool, but you should use clustered learning groups with care. Try not to designate groups that your students will easily identify as advanced, intermediate, and basic, or you might risk discouraging students who need a little more help.Allow the groups to be flexible based on a particular unit, week, or even school day. That way, the possibility of mobility and advancement will encourage students to do their best work.

, The goal should be to assign additional content that’s rich, challenging, and allows students to deeply engage subject matter. If your student finishes their math problems, assigning 20 additional problems as busywork will bore them, and potentially lead to behavioral issues.Instead of assigning, for example, more division problems, have them think of ways they can apply division to real-world situations. Instead of assigning more vocabulary words to look up, have them write a short story that incorporates the words they’ve already defined.

, Assigning rotating classroom maintenance tasks based on alphabetical order or a lottery system is fine. However, you shouldn’t have early finishers clean chalkboards, take out trash, or do other shores. This sort of busywork will just discourage students from doing their best., Try not to be tempted to have your early finishers correct tests and homework or explain the lesson to students having difficulty. Having a student teach a struggling student puts both students in a difficult situation, and potentially harms the self-esteem of the struggling student.Further, instructing a student who’s mastered material to teach others might reinforce their knowledge, but does not adequately challenge them or encourage them to learn more.

, Map out the course topics and the type of content associated with each topic (video, text, power point presentation, etc.).

, Every course will have a set of learning objectives. These objectives are used to track students' actual progress against expected progress. Set the learning objectives for each course and have them validated from SMEs (Subject Matter Experts). Learning objectives may be shared between courses.

, For each topic, prepare the initial set of assessment questions. Sometimes, more than one assessment may be attached to a course. Formative assessments can be embedded within course materials at any point; summative assessments generally appear toward the end of the course.

Say rojo, pronounced roh-hoh.,
Use naranja or anaranjado to say ""orange"" in Spanish.,
Pronounce amarillo ah-mah-REE-yo to describe something yellow.,
Use ""verde"" to talk about something that is green.,
Say azul, pronounced AH-sool, to describe something blue.,
Use the words morado or violeta to describe something purple.,
Choose marrón or café to describe something brown.,
Describe something as having a black color by saying it is negro.,
Use the word ""blanco"" to talk about something that is white.",How to Say the Colors in Spanish1," The word rojo is Spanish for the color red. To pronounce this word correctly, you must roll the ""r."" Learning how to roll the ""r"" can be difficult, especially if your first language is English.One way to get better with the rolled ""r"" is to say the word ""butter"" over and over again very quickly. Your tongue is in the same position when making the ""tt"" sound as it is when you make a rolled ""r"" sound correctly.
You also can start with an ""l"" sound, which puts your tongue in the right position. Try to gradually morph it into a rolled ""r."";
, There are two different words in Spanish for ""orange"" – naranja, pronounced nah-RAHN-hah, and anaranjado, pronounced ah-NAH-rahn-HAH-doh.Typically, the word naranja is used to refer to the fruit, while anaranjado is used to refer to the color. While Spanish speakers may talk about the color orange using the word naranja, the word anaranjado would never be used to refer to the fruit – although perhaps you could speak of having an ""una naranja anaranjada,"" or an orange-colored orange.

, You may be familiar with the city of Amarillo in Texas, but the city's name is given the English pronunciation. You may have to practice this one more to train your brain to produce the correct pronunciation.Other shades of yellow have different words in Spanish. For example, you might use the word limón (lee-MOHN), Spanish for ""lemon,"" to describe a lemony-colored object, or dorado (doh-RAH-doh) for something that is gold-colored., The Spanish word for the color green is pronounced BIR-day. Remember that in Spanish, the letter ""v"" always makes a ""b"" sound, similar to the English words ""bike"" or ""belt,"" although you don't close your lips completely as you would for an English ""b.""There are several shades of green that have a compound word to describe them. For example, lime green in Spanish is verde lima (BIR-day LEE-mah) and apple green is verde manzana (BIR-day man-ZAHN-ah)., You may be familiar with the English word ""azure,"" which is typically used to describe a particular shade of blue in the sky. The Spanish word ""azul"" is related.Once you've learned azul, you may find it useful to learn words for different shades of blue. For example, in Spanish the word celeste (say-LAYSS-tay) is used to describe something that is sky blue, or baby blue.

, Purple in Spanish typically is translated as ""morado,"" which is pronounced moh-RAH-doh. The ""r"" is not rolled in this word. Violeta is pronounced vee-oh-LAY-tah.The Spanish language also has another word for purple, púrpura (POOR-poor-ah).
These words may be used specifically to refer to different shades, depending on personal preference, or they may be used interchangeably by some Spanish speakers.

, The Spanish language has two words that are typically used to say that something is brown, although they typically refer to different shades of brown.Marrón, pronounced mah-RROHN, is typically used to describe something of a lighter brown, chestnut color. Remember to roll the ""r"" on this word. Café, pronounced the same as the word in English, is used to describe darker brown shades.
You also can use words for types of wood to describe something as brown.

, The Spanish word for ""black"" is pronounced ""NAY-grow."" Be careful not to pronounce this word the same as the English word with the same spelling.Gray is considered a shade of black, although you wouldn't say something was ""light black,"" so you need to learn the word for ""gray"" in Spanish. Say gris, which is pronounced ""GREESS.""

, While white isn't necessarily a color, it still is considered a color description since it describes the absence of color. The Spanish word for ""white"" is pronounced BLAHN-koh.There technically are shades of white, such as cream, which in Spanish is crema, pronounced CRAY-mah, or beige, which is spelled and pronounced the same in Spanish as it is in English.

Write the day of the month.,
Write ""de"".,
Write the month.,
Write ""del."",
Write the year.",How to Say the Date in Spanish3," Let's say the date is April 2, 2013. Just write ""2.""



Ex: ""2...""

, This means ""of"" and it should always go after the day of the month, since it will be connecting that day to the month.



Ex: ""2 de...""

, Before you can write the month, you should know how to write and say all twelve months in Spanish. Note that unlike in English, you don't have to capitalize the names of the months in Spanish. Here are the names of the months:


January = enero

February = febrero

March = marzo

April = abril

May = mayo

June = junio

July = julio

August = agosto

September = septiembre

October = octubre

November = noviembre

December = diciembre


Ex: Still using the sample date, April 2, 2013, write, ""2 de abril...""



, This should follow the month to eventually connect the month with the year.


If the date will follow a year in the 2000s, use ""del,""; if it will follow a year in the 1900s, use ""de.""

Ex: ""2 de abril del...""

, The last step is to write down the full year of the date you're writing. This will connect the day, month, and year together and will complete the date.



Ex: ""2 de abril del 2013.""
Just remember one exception to this rule. If the date is the 1st, you should write the number 1 with a superscripted 0 above it (1^0) to stand for ""primero,"" or the way to say ""the first"" when you're talking about dates in Spanish.

"
"
Start by saying ""Hoy es..."" That means, ""Today is...""

,
Say ""el"" before the date.,
Say the day of the month.,
Say the year.,
Put it all together.",How to Say the Date in Spanish4,", This means ""the.""

, Unlike in English, where you say ""the second,"" or ""the third,"" to switch the forms of ""two"" and ""three,"" you don't have to change the forms of the numbers in Spanish, so you can just say the numbers from 1 to 31. The only exception is the number 1, which becomes ""primero"" when you say it aloud. Here's how to say the numbers:


1 = uno (primero), 2 = dos, 3 = tres, 4 = cuatro, 5 = cinco, 6 = seis, 7 = siete.
8 = ocho, 9 = nueve, 10 = diez, 11 = once, 12 = doce, 13 = trece, 14 = catorce.
15 = quince, 16 = dieciséis, 17 = diecisiete, 18 = dieciocho, 19 = diecinueve.
20 = veinte, 21 = veintiuno, 22 = veintidós, 23 = veintitrés, 24 = veinticuatro.
25 = veinticinco, 26 = veintiséis, 27 = veintisiete, 28 = veintiocho, 29 = veintinueve.
30 = treinta, 31 = treinta y uno.

, First, say ""del año,"" which means ""of the year,"" to show that you'll be talking about a year. Next, to say the year in Spanish, you have to first say the thousandth, hundredth, tenth, and first place of that year. Here's how you do it:


To say a year in the 1000s, say ""mil,"" or ""one thousand."" To say a year in the 2000s, say ""dos mil,"" or ""two thousand.""
Next, say the hundredths place. 100 = ciento, 200 = dosciento, 300 = tresciento, and so on. Add an ""s"" at the end of these numbers to make them plural.
Say ""y"" or and, before you add the last step.
Say the tenths and ones place. Learn to say the numbers from 1-99.


Ex: 1: The year 1943, for example, is ""mil novecientos cuarenta y tres.""

Ex: 2: The year 1991 is ""mil novecientos noventa y uno.""

Ex: 3: If the year is 2013, just say, ""dos mil trece,"" or ""two thousand and thirteen."" Note that you don't have to say ""y"" or ""and"" because the hundredths place is empty.



, Combine all of these elements to create a sentence that states the date.



Ex. 1: If the date is June 10, 2013, just say, ""Hoy es el diez de junio del año dos mil trece.""

Ex. 2: If the date is February 18, 1995, say, ""Hoy es el dieciocho de febrero del año mil novecientos noventa y cinco.""

Follow the color word with the word oscuro.,
Add the word claro to talk about light colors.,
Talk about various patterns.,
Learn additional words for colors named after minerals, flowers, or foods.",How to Say the Colors in Spanish2," If you want to say in Spanish that something is a darker, richer shade of a basic color, you can do this by saying oscuro immediately afterward. Keep in mind that this word should be after the color, not before, as it would be in English.For example, if you wanted to say something was dark green, you could say verde oscuro, pronounced BIR-day oh-SCOO-roh.
Some darker shades have their own words. For example, navy blue in Spanish is azul marino. However, until you've learned these various words you can just refer to the color you want to describe as azul oscuro if you want.

, When you say or write the word claro (CLAH-roh) after another color word, you are talking about a lighter shade of the same color. For example, ""verde claro"" means ""light green.""As with dark shades, many lighter shades have their own unique word, you'll still get the point across to Spanish speakers if you simply add claro.

, When talking about colors, you may want to say that an object is striped or polka-dotted, rather than being a solid color. You also may use the word estampado (ess-tahm-PAH-doh) to simply say something has a pattern generally.To say something is striped, use the word rayado (ray-YAH-doh). If something, such as an article of clothing, is polka-dotted, use the phrase de lunares (DAY loo-NAH-rays), which also means ""spotted"" or ""speckled"" generally.

, You probably know words in English, such as ""lilac"" or ""jade,"" that refer to both a color and a plant or mineral. In Spanish, you can use ""jade"" (pronounced HAH-day in Spanish) to refer to something green, or ""lila"" (LEE-lah) to refer to something purple.For example, Spanish speakers say ""rosa"" (pronounced ROH-sah) to refer either to a rose flower, or to a rosy color.
Ámbar is a Spanish word that describes the deep, golden-orange color of the mineral amber. Another good orange word is ""albaricoque"" (ahl-bah-ree-COH-kay), the Spanish word for ""apricot.""

"
"
Change the gender of color words to match the noun they describe.,
Add an ""s"" to color words if you are describing more than one thing.,
Recognize colors that are invariable.,
Keep color words the same when they are part of a phrase.,
Don't modify color words in adjective phrases.,
Place color words correctly in your sentence.",How to Say the Colors in Spanish3," Since color words typically are used as adjectives, when you say the colors in Spanish they must match the gender of the thing you're describing.Generally, you would change the last ""o"" on a color word to an ""a"" if the noun is feminine. For example, if you wanted to say ""the shirt is black,"" you would say ""La camisa es negra.""
If the color word ends in an ""e"" or a consonant, it does not change form to reflect the gender of the noun it describes. So, for example, the word azul does not change gender.

, In most cases, you must reflect the plurality of the objects you're describing by pluralizing the color word as well.For most colors, you only need to add an ""s"" to the end of the word to pluralize it. For example, if you wanted to say ""there are two black cats,"" you would say ""hay dos gatos negros.""
For three colors, you must add an ""es"" to pluralize them, rather than simply an ""s."" These colors are azul (azules), marrón (marrónes), and gris (grises).

, Color words that naturally end in ""a"" do not change gender and don't have plural forms either. In other words, if you were describing a masculine noun in Spanish as being violet, you would not change ""violeta"" to ""violeto."", If you are describing something as ""the color of"" the form of the color does not change at all to agree with either gender or plurality.In Spanish you would say ""de color"" or simply ""color,"" as in ""color negro."" This phrase can be helpful if you are a beginner and are uncertain whether a particular color should change gender or be pluralized or not. Simply use this phrase in front of the color and you won't have to worry about it for the time being.

, If a color word is modified with another word, such as verde lima (lime green), it does not have to be changed to match the gender or number of the noun the phrase describes.

, In English, the color word typically comes before the word it describes in the sentence. However, in Spanish, you want to put the color word immediately after the word it describes.You may have noted this with the ""orange orange"" example. To say something about an orange-colored orange in Spanish, you would say ""una naranja anaranjada."" The word anaranjado comes last because it refers to the color, while the word naranja refers to the fruit.

Say ""shut up"" more forcefully.",How to Say Shut Up in Spanish," ""Cállate"" is the literal translation of ""shut up"" in Spanish, and there are a few ways to say it. The word is pronounced ""ka-ya-tay."" Here's what you can say:""¡Cállate!"" (""Shut up!"")
""¡Cállense!"" (""Shut up!"" to a group of people.)
""Cállate, por favor."" (""Please shut up."")
""Necesito que te calles."" (""I need you to shut up."");
, Instead of telling people to shut up, you could take a more polite approach and ask for silence instead. This will get your point across but won't be quite as offensive. Here's what you can say:


""Silencio."" (""Silence."")
""Guarde silencio."" (""Keep silent."")
""Haga silencio."" (""Be quiet."")

Use ""dinero"" for ""money."",
Use ""moneda"" for ""coin."",
For ""paper money,"" use ""papel moneda."",
For ""cash,"" say ""efectivo."",
Use ""dólar"" for ""dollar."",
Know the name of your country's currency.",How to Say Money in Spanish1," If you only learn one Spanish word for money, make sure it's this one. ""Dinero"" is a very general term for the concept of money that is recognized in virtually all Spanish-speaking cultures.


""Dinero"" is pronounced ""dee-NEH-doe."" Note that the r makes a sound that's very near to the English d sound in ""ladder."" Do this by flicking the tip of your tongue towards the roof of your mouth as you pronounce the r.To be clear, the last syllable should not sound like the English word ""row."";
, This sounds like the English word ""money,"" but it's only used for metal coins. Don't use it for paper money.


Use the plural form (""monedas"") for ""coins.""
""Moneda"" is pronounced ""moe-NEH-thah."" Note that the d at the end of the word is very delicate. It should sound similar to the English soft th sound (as in ""the"")., This is a little confusing because ""moneda"" by itself means ""coin,"" not ""money."" However, in this case, the meaning of the phrase is for paper bills — not metal coins.


This phrase is pronounced ""pah-PEHL moe-NEH-thah."" ""Pah"" has a short a sound (as in ""raw""), while ""pehl"" uses a sound that's a little like a cross between e (as in ""red"") and a (as in ""pay""). If you can't get it, just say ""pale."" ""Moneda"" is exactly the same as above.

, You'd use this similarly to how you'd use ""cash"" in English. In other words, use it to describe when you're using physical money and not a debit card or check.


This is pronounced ""eh-FEHK-tee-voe."" The first two syllables use the a/e sound from ""papel"" above.
If you want to talk about someone paying for something in cash, use the phrase ""pagar en efectivo."" For example ""She pays in cash"" is ""Ella paga en efectivo."", This is a handy word to know when you're trying to exchange your money for the local currency.


""Dólar"" is pronounced ""DOE-ladr."" The r at the end of the word has a pronunciation that's a little tricky for English speakers. It's a little like a very short, delicate d sound followed by an English r. To get an example, try pronouncing ""ladder"" by using a quick flick of the tongue for the ""dd.""
If you want to clarify which country's dollars you're using, use the word for people from that country after ""dólar."" For example, ""U.S. dollar"" is ""dólar estadounidense.""

, Spanish-speaking countries have a wide range of different currencies. Knowing the local currency in the country you're visiting will make many conversations a lot easier. Below is a partial list — for a complete one, click here.Spain: El euro (ay-OO-doe)

Use ""plata"" for money.,
Use ""pasta"" for money.,
Use ""harina"" for money.,
Use ""mosca"" for money.,
Use ""divisa"" for international money.,
Use ""feria"" for ""coins"" or ""change.""",How to Say Money in Spanish2," This is a very common slang term throughout the Spanish-speaking world. The literal meaning is ""silver,"" but you can use it almost exactly like you'd use ""dinero.""


""Plata"" is pronounced ""PLAH-tah."" Both syllables use a short a sound, but ""plah"" rhymes more with the English word ""raw"" and ""tah"" with ""the.""

, This is another common slang word. ""Pasta"" is the Spanish word for ""dough,"" ""paste,"" or ""pulp"" (plus the Italian noodles). You can use it basically like you'd use ""dough"" in English.


""Pasta"" is pronounced almost exactly like the English word ""pasta"" — ""PAHS-tah.""

""¡Suelta la pasta!"" (""SWELL-tah lah PAHS-tah"") means essentially ""Gimme the dough!"" This is a somewhat rude way to ask for money — it's what a bank robber might say to the teller.

, ""Harina"" is literally ""flour"" (like you'd use for baking), but you can use it as a slang term for money like ""pasta."" This term is popular in Costa Rica and elsewhere.""Harina"" is pronounced ""ah-DEE-nah."" Note that the h at the beginning of the word is silent.

, This literally means ""fly"" (the insect). It's another term that's popular in Costa Rica.


""Mosca"" is pronounced ""MOE-scah.""


, This term is popular in Cuba.It specifically refers to foreign money — not the money used in Cuba itself. The meaning is roughly ""badge"" or ""emblem.""


""Divisa"" is pronounced ""dee-VEE-sah.""


, This is a term used in Mexico.It literally means ""fair"" (as in a festival or carnival). You'd use it to describe loose metal coins — not paper money.

Say ""secundaria"" when you are referring to school grades 7-10, in Mexico.,
Say ""preparatoria"" or ""bachillerato"" when talking about school grades 10-12, in Mexico.,
Call school grades 7-11 ""instituto"", when referring to Spain.,
Call school grades 11 to college, ""bachillerato"" or ""ciclos formativos"", for Spain.",How to Say High School in Spanish1," Determine the age level(s) of schooling to which you are referring. In the United States, high school refers to a compulsory education for students ages fourteen through eighteen. However, this is not the case in many Spanish speaking countries. Schooling is broken up differently in other countries. In Mexico, if you are referring to students age twelve to fifteen, students attend what is comparable to junior high school. This school is called ""secundaria"", and it is an extension of ""educación básica"" (elementary school).
If you want more information about high school in Mexico, there are some government websites which provide information about ""secundaria"" in Mexico. These websites can be written in language that is difficult to read. However, if you read slowly and skim for graphs and visual representations, you can find some useful information. ;
, Students ages fifteen to eighteen attend what is called ""preparatoria"", ""bachillerato"", or ""educación media superior"". In Mexico, ""el bachillerato"" is the main track to university. ""Prepartoria"", on the other hand, is more geared toward vocational training so that when a student graduates they are ready to work in a specific vocation. For example, students who graduate from ""prepartoria"" might be ready to work as a laboratory technician.

, In Spain, students twelve to sixteen years of age attend either an ""instituto de educación secundaria"" (instituto for short), ""colegio concertado"", or ""colegio privado"". Schooling at this point is still compulsory.


Some high schools are public, others are private, and some are both. In Chile, for example, there has been a major shift toward the privatization schools. Most parents will pay more for their students to attend the private or semi-private schools. , At this point, schooling is not compulsory for all students. However, many students sixteen to eighteen years of age attend ""bachillerato"" or go to ""ciclos formativos"" for more school training.


Often the different high schools in Spanish speaking countries entail different kinds of training. Different kinds of schools determine the career path their students take.
For example, in Spain ""el bachillerato"" is the school that is on track to university. In ""el bachillerato"" studies students earn a certificate that is mandatory to attend university. Students also prepare for their ""Prueba de Acceso a la Universidad"", or university admittance exam, which they must take for university admittance. The other track students take in high school is Ciclos Formativos. This program is through Spain's ""institutos"", and it consists of vocational training. When most students leave these programs they are ready to work as a hairdressers, technicians etc.. "

Say ""mah"" with no accent.,
Say ""MAH"" with an accent.,
Put it together.,
Don't say ""la mama"" (no accents).",How to Say Mom in Spanish1," The closest equivalent in Spanish to ""mom"" is probably ""mamá"". Follow the steps in this section to pronounce this word. You'll want to start with a ""mah"" sound. This nearly rhymes with the English word ""raw."";
, Now, say a slightly different ""mah"" sound (still rhymes with ""raw""). This time, put an accent on the syllable. This means basically to say it a little more forcefully, a little longer, and at a little higher pitch.If the first syllable was a ""mah,"" this one is a ""MAH.""


Having trouble with the idea of putting accent on a certain syllable? Use an English example. For instance, if you get angry and say ""enough!"", the second syllable (""nuff"") is accented. You would say ""ee-NUFF"", but never ""EE-nuff."" ""Mamá"" is similar.

, The whole word ""mamá"" is pronounced ""mah-MAH."" Again, be sure to stress the second syllable. This will naturally make the first syllable a little quicker and inconsequential — many Spanish speakers use a pronunciation that's closer to ""muh-MAH"" or ""m-MAH.""


If you use this word in a sentence, use the article ""la"" for ""la mamá."" For instance: ""La otra mamá es mejor."" (""The other mom is better."")
""Mamá"" is somewhat informal, but it's not crude or derogatory in any way. It's the sort of thing you'd hear a child saying to his or her mother (even if the child is an adult).

, This word is pronounced very similarly to ""mamá."" The only difference is in the accent: here, the first syllable is stressed (""MAH-mah""). Unfortunately, ""mama"" means ""breast."" Most people will know what you mean if you make this mistake, but it's still nice to be able to avoid the embarrassment.

Use Spring around Springtime.,
Begin saying the word in Spanish.,
Practice to your family, friends, or anyone one else you know.,
If Step 2 was unclear to you about how to say it, find a local Spanish translator or translating site,(many have pronunciation: look for the icon of a loudspeaker)

, Spring in Spanish is "" primavera "". As the first syllable (pri) is short. The second syllable is just plain short a : (ma). The third syllable is the one that carries the stress ( VEH )with a long e like in English ""bed"" No problem whether you say it with a ""b"" or a ""v"".The ""b"" is by far the most used sound.The last syllable ( ra ) is pronounced with a soft ""r"" like in "" rat "" only without the ""t"".

,How to Say I Miss You in Spanish1,
"
Say ""Quiero besarte."",
Try asking ""Puedo besarte?"",
Say ""Bésame."",
Use the phrase, ""Me gustaría sellar tus labios con los míos.""",How to Say I Want to Kiss You in Spanish," This literally means ""I want to kiss you."" Pronounce it ""kee-arrow bay-sar-tay.""While it is technically an exact translation, ""Quiero besarte"" may not be so common as other, more lyrical phrases. If you are traveling, consider the way that people commonly ask for kisses in this culture, and try asking someone from your specific location for advice.


""Quiero"" is the ""I"" conjugation of the verb ""querer,"" ""to want.""
""Besarte"" is the you-directed unconjugated form of the verb ""besar,"" or ""to kiss."" ""Te"" refers to ""you."" Thus, ""besarte"" literally means ""to kiss you."";
, This literally means, ""Can I kiss you?"" Pronounce it ""pway-doh bay-sar-tay?""Think about the implication of asking to kiss someone versus saying that you want to kiss someone. Asking gives your date an explicit choice in the matter, and it also puts him/her on the spot to say ""si"" or ""no."" This option might be best if you are less confident that the person wants to kiss you back.

, This means ""Kiss me."" Pronounce it ""bay-sa-may.""It is a phrase that's much-used in songs and relationships throughout the Spanish-speaking world.It is also a more outwardly confident way of saying that you want to kiss someone. It's not a question, it's an imperative: ""Kiss me!"" Consider how well you know the person, and whether this is appropriate., This literally means, ""I would like to stamp your lips with mine."" Pronounce it, ""May goo-star-ee-a say-yar toos la-bee-os cohn los mee-os."" If you are trying to kiss a non-native Spanish speaker, then he or she may not pick up the nuance of this phrase. However, a native Spanish speaker may find these words more lyrical and romantic than a plain ""Besame"" or ""Quiero besarte.""


""Me gustaría"" is the conditional conjugation of ""gustar,"" meaning ""to like"" or ""to please."" Think of the phrase like, ""It would please me to kiss you.""
""Sellar"" is the verb ""to stamp.""""Labios"" are lips. ""Con los míos,"" means ""with mine."" or, in context, ""with my lips.""

Talk to your Spanish teacher about how to say high school in Spanish.,
Talk to students from Spanish speaking countries about high school.,
Use proper grammar.,
Know the noun’s gender.,
Decide on a Spanish speaking country.",How to Say High School in Spanish2," If you are doing a presentation on high school for your class, you may want to consult your teacher about which country you should talk about. Ask your teacher if you can practice using the correct language for high school with him or her.

, Use other students as resources. They will be able to give you the most authentic information and tips on how to talk about high school because they lived there.

, When you are talking about high school in Spanish, the grammar can take several different forms. Find out what you want to say, and check to make sure you are using the correct grammar.


If you are talking about a building or institution, high school is a noun and should be preceded by ""la"" or ""el"".
If you are referring to a high school student, use the adjective form. In the adjective form, high school is preceded by ""de"". For example, you say, ""un estudiante de escuela secundaria."" As you can see, when you translate high school student from English to Spanish, the words ""high school"" and ""student"" are switched.

, Words in Spanish have male and female genders. If a word ends in 'o' or 'e', it is most likely masculine and is preceded by ""el"". If a word ends in a, d, z or ión, it is most likely feminine and is preceded by ""la"".


For example, if you are saying ""the high school (in Ecuador) needs more students"", you would say, ""se necesitan más estudiantes para el colegio."" ""Colegio’ is preceded by ""el"", because the word colegio is masculine.
For example, if you say ""I am studying English in high school (in Chile)"", you would say, ""estoy estudiando inglés en la enseñanza media"". The term enseñanza media is feminine, so it is preceded by ""la"".

, Some countries have multiple different terms for high school; however, below is a short list of the most common terms for high school. :


For Mexico: ""la escuela preparatoria"", also called “la prepa”
For Spain, El Salvador, Venezuela: ""el bachillerato"", or in Spain, ""el instituto""
For Uruguay or Venezuela: ""el liceo"" (referring to the school building)
For Chile: ""la enseñanza media"" or ""el colegio""
For Ecuador: ""el colegio""
For Cuba: ""el instituto preuniversitario""
Most universal form, regardless of the country: ""la escuela secundaria""

Have him or her say ""escuela secondaria"", or whichever term for high school that you are learning, slowly, several times.


If you do not have access to a native Spanish speaker, go online to Google translate. Type in the words ""high school"". ""Escuela secondaria"" or ""el liceo"" will appear on the right hand side. Under the words, there is a black speaker. Hover your mouse over the speaker, and it will say “listen”. Click on the speaker to listen to the correct pronunciation of the words.

Say ""MAH."",
Say ""dray"" with a d-like r sound.,
Put it together.",How to Say Mom in Spanish2," In Spanish, the word ""madre"" means ""mother."" Start with the same ""mah"" sound as before (rhymes with ""raw"").


Here, the accent is on the first syllable even though there's no mark over the a. In general, for Spanish words without accent marks that end in a vowel, the second-to-last syllable gets the accent., This syllable should rhyme with ""pay."" The r sound in Spanish is something that's often a little tricky for English speakers to pronounce properly. The sound you want to use is very light and resembles the English d sound. Thus, the actual pronunciation is a little like ""duh-day,"" with the ""duh"" being very quick and light.


Having trouble with the Spanish r? Try using your tongue differently than you would in English. Normally, you'd say your rs at the back of your throat, but this time try to pronounce them by touching your tongue to the front of the roof of your mouth. Flick it towards the middle part of the roof of your mouth as you say ""duh-day.""

, The word ""madre"" all together should sound like ""MAH-duh-day."" Again, the middle ""duh"" should be as short and delicate as possible.


This is a more formal way to say ""mom,"" but it's still sometimes used similarly to ""mamá."" ""Madre"" is used almost exactly like ""mother"" is in English. The rare exception is in some Mexican dialects where the word is used as a slang term for ""uncool"" or ""failed.""Again, if you're using this word as a noun in a sentence, you should use the article ""la."" For instance: ""La madre dijo, 'limpia tu habitación.'"" (""The mother said, 'clean your room.'"")

"
Use ""mamí"" as a flirtatious way to say ""momma."",
Use ""vieja"" for ""old lady."",
Try ""jefa"" or for something like ""governess"" or ""boss woman."",
Use ""-ita"" as a diminutive.",How to Say Mom in Spanish3," You may already be familiar with this term from Latin music and pop culture. This comes from informal terms for ""mom,"" but it's not something you'll want to say to your actual mother. This term is used a lot like you'd use ""baby,"" ""honey,"" or ""sexy"" in English. It's an affectionate term for your lover or significant other — again, not your mom.The pronunciation here is roughly ""mah-mee"" (very similar to the English ""mommy"").

, In English, ""old lady"" is sometimes used as a slang term for someone's wife or girlfriend. You can do the same thing in Spanish with ""vieja"" (literally ""old woman"").However, like in English, this isn't always the most polite way to refer to someone, so you may only want to use it when you're with your friends.


The pronunciation here is ""vee-AY-ha."" The first syllable rhymes with ""bee,"" the second with ""play,"" and the third with ""raw."" Put the accent on the second syllable (""AY"").

, This term is derived from the word for ""boss"" (""jefe""), but it's also sometimes used as an informal slang term for ""mom."" This is used both by children for their mothers and by spouses for their wives.


The pronunciation here is ""HAY-fah."" The first syllable rhymes with ""play"" and the second with ""raw."" Remember that, in Spanish, js are pronounced like English hs.

, Adding ""-ita"" to the end of a word (or ""-ito"" if you're talking about a man) makes the word have a ""cute,"" ""little"" quality. It's very similar to putting a ""-y"" at the end of a word in English (e.g., ""mom"" vs. ""mommy""). This isn't very formal, so you'll want to use it mostly with people you're already comfortable around. If the word ends with a vowel, you will sometimes need to put a c before ""-ita"" or get rid of the vowel. Here is a good article on Spanish diminutives.This is pronounced ""EE-tah"" (almost like ""Rita"" without the r). Below are a few examples of words from this article turned diminutive:
Mamacita (""Mah-mah-SEE-tah"")
Viejita (""vee-ay-HEE-tah"")
Jefacita (""hay-fah-SEE-tah"")

Say ""te echo de menos."",
Use the phrase ""te extraño"" in Latin America.,
State ""me haces falta."",
Choose the correct object pronoun.",How to Say I Miss You in Spanish2," This phrase is a common way to say ""I miss you"" in Spanish. However, it is not a direct translation of the English words. The literal translation of the phrase is ""I throw you less.""While the direct or literal translation of the phrase into English doesn't make much sense, the meaning of the phrase is to express the feeling of having something missing in your life as a result of the person's absence.
Pronounce the phrase as ""tay EH-choh day MAY-nohs.""
This phrase is used more in Spain than in other Spanish-speaking parts of the world.
If you are speaking in past tense (""I missed you""), you would say ""te echo de menos."" , This phrase is a more direct translation of the sentiment ""I miss you."" The verb extraño means ""I miss"" and te is the object pronoun for ""you."" Literally, this phrase is saying ""you I miss.""Pronounce this phrase ""tay ehks-TRAHN-yo.""
To use this phrase in past tense to say ""I missed you,"" you would say ""te extrañé.""This verb is more versatile, and can be used to say you miss other creatures or things. For example, you might use it to say ""I miss my dog"" – ""Extraño a mi perro."", This is another phrase used to mean ""I miss you"" in Spanish. While there is no good direct translation, the general connection is that the person to whom you're speaking is responsible for an absence or need in your life.This phrase is made up of ""me,"" the direct object pronoun for ""yo,"" the first-person singular pronoun meaning ""I,"" the verb ""haces,"" which means ""you make"" or ""you cause,"" and the noun ""falta,"" which means ""lack or absence.""
Pronounce the phrase ""may AH-says FAHL-tah.""
In past tense, this phrase becomes ""me hiciste falta"" (""I missed you"")., To say ""I miss you"" in Spanish, you must use an object pronoun to identify the person you miss. If you're speaking directly to the person, you would use the object pronoun for ""you.""The phrase ""me haces falta"" is an exception, because you use the object pronoun for yourself, me, instead of the object pronoun for the person to whom you're speaking.
The Spanish language has formal and informal variations of you. If you are speaking to someone with whom you are not on familiar terms, you would use the formal variation.
Generally, you wouldn't be saying ""I miss you"" to someone with whom you're not close. For this reason, the word te is most commonly used in Spanish phrases meaning ""I miss you."" This word is the direct object pronoun for the second person familiar tú, meaning ""you."" Since this is the familiar form of the word ""you,"" it should only be used with friends and family.
If for some reason you need to express this sentiment to someone with whom you're not on familiar terms, replace te with lo (masculine) or la (feminine). These are the formal object pronouns for usted, the polite, formal variation of ""you.""
If you are speaking about missing several people (for example, if you are telling a couple that you miss them both), you would use the plural direct object pronoun for ""you,"" which is os.

Learn the verb echar.,
Use the verb extrañar.,
Try the verb hacer.",How to Say I Miss You in Spanish3," The word echo in te echo de menos is the first-person conjugation of the verb echar, which has a variety of meanings. Some translations of echar include ""to send forth,"" ""to send away,"" ""to throw out,"" or ""to place.""To say ""I miss you"" in Spanish using the verb echar, you'll use the first-person present form of the verb.
If you wanted to say ""she misses you,"" you would use the third-person present form of the verb, echa. The full expression of this phrase would be ""te echa de menos."" The third-person plural would be ""te echan de menos"" (""They miss you"").
To say ""we miss you,"" use the first-person plural form: ""te echamos de menos.""

, If you're going to say ""te extraño,"" you're using the verb extrañar, which means ""to miss."" The way you conjugate this verb depends on who is speaking, and the tense in which they're speaking.If you want to say that another person misses the person to whom you are speaking, you would say ""te extraña,"" which would mean ""he (or she) misses you."" Note that the direct object pronoun, te, does not change. The person to whom you're speaking still is the object of the verb, but the conjugation of the verb indicates that another person is doing the missing.
Perhaps you want to say that you and another person are both missing the person to whom you're speaking. You would say te extrañamos,"" which means ""we miss you.""

To say ""they miss you"" in Spanish, use the third-person plural conjugation of the verb: ""te extrañan.""

, When you use the phrase ""me haces falta"" to say ""I miss you"" in Spanish, you need to conjugate the verb hacer, which means ""to do, make, or cause."" When conjugated as haces, it means ""you make"" or ""you cause.""The verb conjugation should agree with the pronoun for the person being missed, not the person doing the missing. For this reason, if you want to say ""we miss you"" using this phrase, the verb conjugation stays the same (""haces""), but the object pronoun would change: ""nos faces falta.""Note that this phrase is constructed differently than the direct English translation, and you're using the second-person present tense conjugation of the verb. If you said ""te hago falta,"" which seems like a direct translation (hago is the first-person present tense conjugation of the verb hacer), you would actually be saying ""You miss me."" This construction is similar to the French phrase for ""I miss you,"" ""tu me manques,"" which more literally means ""you are being missed by me."""

Ask ""¿cuándo vuelves?"",
Demand ""¡Regresa ya!"",
Exclaim ""¡no puedo estar sin ti!"",
Tell the person you wish they were with you.",How to Say I Miss You in Spanish4," to find out when the person will return. This is a question that might frequently follow the statement that you miss someone. After saying that you miss them, it's only natural to inquire when they will be back.Cuándo is a Spanish adverb meaning ""when.""

Vuelves is a conjugated form of the Spanish verb volver, which means ""to return"" or ""to come back."" It is the ""you"" familiar conjugation, so only use it when speaking to someone with whom you're on familiar terms.If you are speaking to someone with whom you're less familiar, you might want to use the more formal conjugation vuelve.
Pronounce cuándo vuelves as ""KWAN-doh voo-EHL-vays.""

, If you've told someone you miss them, you probably want them to come back. Rather than ask when they're returning, you may want to simply tell them to come back. ""¡Regresa ya!"" means ""come back already!""Regresa comes from the Spanish verb ""regresar,"" meaning ""to return"" or ""come back."" In this phrase, you must use the imperative conjugation for ""tú,"" the familiar ""you."" The imperative is used for commands like this.Ya is an adverb meaning ""already.""
Pronounce the entire command as ""ray-GRE-sah jah.""

, Particularly in a romantic context, when you miss someone you may feel as though you cannot live without them. This exclamatory Spanish phrase means ""I cannot be without you.""Puedo is the ""I"" or ""yo"" conjugation for the Spanish verb ""poder,"" meaning ""can"" or ""to be able to."" When no is placed before it, the meaning becomes negative, turning the phrase into ""I cannot.""

Estar is a Spanish verb meaning ""to be."" Since it follows a conjugated verb, do not conjugate estar.

Sin means ""without.""

Ti is another object pronoun used for the familiar form of ""you.""
Pronounce the entire declaration as ""no poo-AY-doh EHS-tar seen tee.""

, When you miss someone, you want them to be with you rather than for the two of you to be apart. This is especially true in a romantic relationship, where you can use the phrase ""desearia que estuvieras aqui conmigo"" to mean ""I wish you were here with me.""Deseria is a conjugation of the Spanish verb desear, which means ""to want.""Que is a Spanish conjunction or pronoun meaning ""that,"" ""who,"" or ""which.""

Estuvieras is a conjugation of the Spanish verb estar, which means ""to be.""Aquí is a Spanish adverb meaning ""here."" The word has both a place and time component, so it can be interpreted as meaning ""here and now.""Conmigo is a Spanish pronoun that means ""with me.""
Pronounce this phrase as ""DAY-say-uh-REE-uh kuh ess-too-bee-AIR-us ah-KEY cone-MEE-go.""

Say vida.,
Use the correct possessive pronoun.,
Recognize other Spanish words that also mean life.",How to Say Life in Spanish1," In Spanish, the word vida means the same thing as the English word life. It is a feminine word, so you would say la vida in most instances. Vida is pronounced VEE-dah.For example, if you said ""eso es la vida,"" (pronounced ESS-oh ess lah VEE-dah) you would be saying ""this is the life.""
You may remember the song ""Livin' La Vida Loca,"" by Ricky Martin. The title of the song, fully translated into English, would be ""Livin' the crazy life.""
If you need to pluralize vida, you would say las vidas, which means ""the lives."";
, Sometimes you may want to refer to your life, or to someone else's life. In those situations, instead of using la or las before the word vida, you would use the word that corresponds to the person whose life you're talking about.For example, if you wanted to say ""my life is crazy,"" you would say ""mi vida es loca."" Mi is the Spanish possessive pronoun that means ""my.""
If you wanted to say ""her life is beautiful,"" you might say ""su vida es bella."" Note that since the word vida is feminine, the adjective is feminine as well (""bella"" instead of ""bello""). This is the case whether you're talking about a man or a woman with a beautiful life – the adjective describes the life, so the gender of the adjective matches that of the noun, not the person whose life you're describing.
The familiar possessive pronoun for ""you"" is ""tu."" If you're talking to a group of people, or if you're addressing someone with whom you're not on familiar terms, you would use ""vuestra."" This is the feminine form, since the word vida is feminine.
To speak about ""our"" life, you would use the possessive pronoun ""nuestra"" (nuestra vida).
Note that you use plurals if you are discussing multiple things. In this context, a single life would take a singular possessive pronoun. If you were talking about several lives, you would use the plural ""tus"" for the familiar you (tus vidas), ""mis"" for ""my"" multiple lives (mis vidas), ""nuestras"" for ""our"" multiple lives (nuestras vidas), or ""vuestras"" for ""y'all's multiple lives (vuestras vidas).

, In English, the word life is used in many phrases and contexts for which there is a different word in Spanish. In those situations, the word vida would be incorrect.In Spanish, the word vital (pronounced VEE-tal) is used in many places where you would use the word life in English. For example, ""life cycle"" is ""ciclo vital,"" and ""life force"" is ""fuerza vital."" However, ""life form"" is ""forma de vida.""
The word vida typically only refers to living things. So, for example, if you're speaking about battery life, you would use the phrase la duración, as in ""Las pilas tienan una duration de dos meses"" (""The batteries have a life of two months"").
If someone is sentenced to life in prison for committing a crime, the phrase you would use would be cadena perpetua.

Learn the Spanish verb vivir and its meaning.,
Use vivir in the present tense.,
Understand how to conjugate vivir in past tense.,
Say vivir using the future tense.",How to Say Life in Spanish2," In Spanish, if you want to talk about where you live, or if you want to say that someone is living, you would use vivir, pronounced like BIB-ear.If you look at the verb and the noun for life, vida, you can see that the two words are related in that they both start the same way.
The verb often is used along with the noun. For example, if you wanted to say ""I live a good life,"" you could say ""vivo una buena vida"" or ""vivo una vida buena"" (the order of nouns and adjectives in Spanish doesn't matter the way it does in English)., In present tense, you're talking about something that is happening at the same moment as you are speaking. Since you must be alive if you are speaking (or writing), you'll typically use present tense when talking about your own life.For example, if you want to say ""I live in Mexico"" in Spanish, you would say ""vivo en México.""
To say ""you live in Mexico,"" you would say ""vives en México"" (familiar) or ""vivís en México"" (plural or formal).
To say ""we live in Mexico"" in Spanish, say ""vivimos en México."" For ""they live in Mexico,"" you would say ""vivían en México.""

, Sometimes you need to talk about life and living in the past tense. This could be the case if you used to live in one place, but then moved to another place. You also might speak about living in the past tense if you're referring to someone who has died.If you wanted to speak about your own living in the past tense, for example to say ""I lived in Mexico,"" you would say ""vivía en México."" The third-person past is the same as the first person past, and for the second-person form you simply add an s: ""vivías en México,"" or ""You lived in Mexico.""
To say ""they lived"" you would use the form vivían, as in ""vivían en México"" or ""they lived in Mexico."" The plural (or formal) second-person form is vivíais, as in ""vivíais en México"" or ""you all lived in Mexico.""
If you wanted to say ""we lived,"" you would use the form vivíamos, as in ""vivíamos en México"" or ""we lived in Mexico.""
Pay attention to the accent marks when conjugating the verb vivir in past tense. The accent indicates that a different syllable should be emphasized than the traditional rule in Spanish of emphasizing the second-to-last syllable. In the past tense forms of vivir, there is an accent mark over the second i.

, If you plan to move to a new location, or are talking about someone else moving, you might want to use the future tense form of vivir, which is formed in a similar way to the past tense.Whereas you form the past tense of the verb vivir by taking off the r and adding the appropriate ending, to form the future tense you're going to leave the entire infinitive form as it is, and then add the appropriate ending. The endings are the same as they are in the present tense.
For example, to say ""I will live in Mexico,"" you would say ""viviré en México."" For all future forms except we/nosotros, the last syllable is emphasized. Don't forget the appropriate accent mark.
To say ""we will live in Mexico"" in Spanish, you would say ""viviremos en México.""

Speak about matters of life and death.,
Learn how to greet people in Costa Rica.,
Talk about liveliness.,
Make comments about your life.,
Add common exclamations and interjections to your vocabulary.",How to Say Life in Spanish3," There are many common phrases in Spanish that incorporate the word vida to indicate the importance or gravity of a situation. In Spanish as in English, you may fight for your life (debatía entra la vida y la muerte), lay down your life (dar la vida) or lose your life (perder la vida).If something awful or difficult has happened, but you want to communicate that the troubled times will pass and you will move on, you might say ""la vida sigue"" (""life goes on""). If the awful thing has never happened to you before, you might say ""en mi vida"" (""never in my life"").
If something is a matter of life and death, it is ""cosa de vida o muerte."" If a desperate situation requires you to risk life and limb then it requires you jugarse la vida.
Not all phrases about life use the word vida. For example, if you wanted to tell someone in Spanish that they gave you the fright of your life, you would say ""¡Qué gusto me diste!""

, You may already know that ""¿Como estas?"" means ""how are you?"" in Spanish, and you may know to respond ""Bien, gracias"" to mean ""I'm well, thank you."" But Costa Ricans use a different phrase as a greeting that incorporates the word vida.If you are in Costa Rica, you'll hear people use the phrase ""pura vida."" While the direct translation of this phrase is ""pure life,"" the use of the phrase goes far beyond the direct translation. More accurately, it describes a relaxed lifestyle that values happiness and joy.
You might hear the phrase in other Central American countries as well, but it's most common in Costa Rica. There, the phrase is used as a general greeting, as well as the response to that greeting.
It also is used as a general expression of gratitude or satisfaction. For example, if you say ""¡Muchas gracias!"" someone might respond ""Pura vida!"" by which they mean something more like ""you're welcome.""
In English, you might ask someone ""how's life?"" instead of saying ""how are you?"" or a similar greeting – especially if you haven't seen the person in awhile. In Spanish, you would say ""¿Qué talk te va?"" or ""¿Cómo va eso?"" Not these phrases do not include the word vida., In English, there are many phrases incorporating the word life to talk about how something seems real, or how a person brought life to a place or event that was dead or dull before they arrived. Spanish has similar phrases, though not all of them use the word vida.Many of these phrases use the verb animarse, which means ""to come to life."" For example, if you want to say that a particular guest brought the party to life, you would say ""animó la fiesta."" If that person was the life and soul of the party, you would say ""el alma de la fiesta.""
Perhaps you're having trouble with the office printer, and you want to say in Spanish that the machine seems to have a life of its own. You would use the phrase ""tener vida propia"" (which means ""to have a life of its own"").

, Particularly when you're speaking to someone you haven't seen in awhile, they may ask after your life in general. You can respond in equally generic terms by using common phrases in Spanish.For example, if you want to tell someone that you have a good life, you might say ""es una vida agradable"" (""it's a good life"") or ""la vida me ha tratado bien"" (""I've had a good life"").
In contrast, if you wanted to say that you've been having difficulties, you might say ""la vida es muy dura"" (""it's a hard life"").
If you want to tell your significant other that they are the love of your life, you would say ""eres el amor de mi vida"" (""you are the love of my life"").

, There are many phrases using the word ""life"" in English, such as ""that's life,"" that can be used to express how you feel about something happening. In Spanish, there are similar phrases that mean the same thing, even though the translation isn't always literal.To say something similar to ""that's life!"" or ""such is life!"" in Spanish, you would say ""¡así es la vida!""
If you want to tell someone to get a life, you would say ¡espabílate y haz algo!""

Interject ""¡Dios mío!"" if something has happened that you find shocking or upsetting. A literal translation would be ""My God!"" but as used, the phrase means something like ""my life!""
If someone asks you to do something that you have no intention of doing, you might say ""¡ni hablar!"" which means ""not on your life!""

Exclaim ""¡Feliz cumpleaños!""",How to Say Happy Birthday in Spanish2," This is the standard, most basic way to say “happy birthday” in Spanish.



Feliz is a Spanish adjective meaning ""happy.""

Cumpleaños is a Spanish noun meaning ""birthday."" It is a compound word. The ""cumple"" comes from the Spanish verb ""cumplir,"" meaning ""to complete"" or ""to accomplish."" The word ""años"" means ""years."" Note the tilde over the ""n"" in ""años"" is essential to maintain the meaning of the word.Pronounce this birthday greeting as fay-lees koom-play-ahn-yohs.

"
Say ""¡Felicidades!,
Specify ""¡Felicidades en tu día!"",
Offer ""¡Felicidades en el aniversario del día en que tu has nacido!,
Wish ""¡Que cumplas muchos más!” Saying this birthday wish is essentially the same thing as telling someone in English, “and many more,” after wishing that person a happy birthday.,
State ""¡Que tengas un feliz día!"",
Ask “¿Cuántos años tienes?” This question is used to ask the birthday girl or birthday boy how old she or he is.",How to Say Happy Birthday in Spanish3,"""This is a congratulatory sentiment often used on birthdays, among other occasions.



Felicidades is translated most closely as ""congratulations"" or ""all the best."" It is strictly used as an interjection, but it is related to the Spanish noun felicitaciones, which also means ""congratulations.""
While it may seem odd within U.S. culture to tell someone ""congratulations"" on his or her birthday, it is an acceptable greeting to use in most Spanish-speaking countries. You are essentially congratulating the individual on the end of one year and start of another.
Pronounce this sentiment as fay-lees-ee-dah-days.


, This is another congratulatory sentiment, but it is a little more birthday-specific than the basic felicidades.



Felicidades still means “congratulations” in this birthday greeting.

En means “on,” tu is the familiar form of the word “your,” and día means “day.”
Note that when speaking to someone you are not on familiar terms with, you should say “su”—pronounced soo”—instead of “tu.” The term “su” is a more formal way of saying “your” when used in this context.

The entire phrase translates into English as “Congratulations on your day!”
Pronounce the sentiment as fay-lees-ee-dah-days ehn too dee-ah.


,""This expression is far less common than other congratulatory sentiments, but it is the most birthday-specific one you can use.



El aniversario is the Spanish way of saying “the anniversary.”

Del is actually a combination of “de,” meaning “of,” and “el,” meaning “the.” The “el” is connected to the word “día,” meaning “day.”
The phrase “que tu has nacido” translates into “that you were born.” Nacido is a conjugated form of the Spanish verb “nacer,” meaning “to be born.”
When put all together, the phrase says, “Congratulations on the anniversary of the day on which you were born.”
You can pronounce this sentence as fay-lees-ee-dah-days ehn ehl ah-nee-vers-ahr-ee-oh dehl dee-ah ehn kay too ahs nah-cee-doh.


,



Que translates into the English ""that.""

Cumplas is derived from the Spanish verb ""cumplir,"" meaning ""to complete,"" ""to accomplish,"" or ""to fulfill.""

Muchos is a plural form of the Spanish word ""mucho,"" meaning ""many.""

Más means ""more"" in English.
When translated directly, this wish states, ""that you complete many more."" In essence, you are telling the birthday boy or birthday girl that you hope he or she has many more birthdays after this one.
Pronounce the entire sentiment as kay koom-plahs mooch-ohs mahs.


, While this greeting may seem a little less birthday-specific, it is another common sentiment used to wish someone happiness on his or her birthday.


The phrase translates directly into “that you have a happy day.” By using this phrase, you are wishing someone happiness on his or her birthday even though you are not specifying that it is his or her birthday in the phrase itself.

Que means “that,” “feliz” means “happy,” and “día” means “day.”

Tengas is a conjugated form of the verb “tener,” meaning “to have.”
Pronounce the sentiment as kay tehn-gahs oon fay-lees dee-ah.


,


Translated more directly, the question asks, “how many years do you have?”

Cuántos asks ""how many.""

Años means ""years"" in English. Note the tilde over the ""n"" is essential to maintain the meaning of the word.

Tienes is a conjugated form of the Spanish verb ""tener,"" meaning ""to have.""
Pronounce the question as kwahn-tohs ahn-yohs tee-en-ays.

Use the correct masculine or feminine form of contento(a).,
Use the correct verb of to be, ser or estar.,

Say feliz to express contentment.,
Try using alegre to talk about being cheerful or glad.,

Change the stress on your words.,
Practice with a written and recorded Spanish.",How to Say Happy in Spanish," In Spanish, the endings of some words are changed to o or a depending on whether you are speaking about a male or female. When referring to a female, you say está contenta, “she is happy,” with the a ending. When referring to a male, you say está contento, or “he is happy,” with the o ending.None of the other words for happy have endings that change to a masculine or feminine form.;
, If you are saying something or someone is happy as a temporary state of being/feeling, you should use the estar form of happy. Estar is more common for talking about happiness in Spanish. If you are saying someone is a happy person as a permanent way of being; however, you will use ser.


An example of estar would be if you said, Estoy contento de que vinieras, or “I (male) am happy you came.” Being happy about an action is an impermanent state, and so you would use estar.
An example of ser would be if you said, Siempre ha sido una niña muy alegre, or “she has always been a happy (cheerful) little girl.” You are saying this is her permanent way of being, and so you use ser in the present perfect, ha sido, or “she has been.”

, Decide on how you need to conjugate the verb you are using in order to convey the correct meaning. Conjugating verbs can be complex in Spanish, and there are many different conjugations depending on the subject and tense you are using. Follow the in-line citations to see all of the ways to conjugate estar, which is the most common verb that you will use with happy. If you are speaking in the present form of estar to say you or someone else is happy, use the following conjugations:


I am happy- Estoy feliz
You are happy- Estás feliz
She/he or you formal is/are happy- Está feliz
We are happy- Estamos feliz
They are happy formal- Estáis feliz
They are happy- Están feliz

, For example, if you would like to say Me siento feliz, or “I feel happy,” remember that the verb sentirse is reflexive. Reflexive verbs are shown in the example, Me llamo Juan. Me llamo Juan translates directly to “I call myself Juan.” In English, we don’t have reflexive verbs. However, in Spanish you add the me in front of the present I form of the verb for llamar, or to call to make the reflexive form Me llamo.


Me (myself) siento feliz
Te (yourself) sientes feliz
Se (himself, herself, yourself) siente feliz
Nos (ourselves) sentimos feliz
Os (yourselves) sentís feliz
Se (themselves, yourselves) sienten feliz

, If you are saying we, you all, or they are happy, for example, use the plural forms felices and contentos.


For example, if you say, Estamos felices de estar aquí, or “we are happy to be here,” you say estamos felices because “we are happy” is plural.
For another example, El grupo de las niñas están contentos con sus venta de las galletas, or “the group of girls are happy with their cookie sales.” Here there is more than one girl selling cookies, and so because it’s plural, contenta becomes contentos.


, In Spanish feliz and contento can be used pretty much interchangeably. But contento, like its cognate in English, content, is more closely translated to saying someone or something is pleased. For example, you might ask, ¿Tú estás contento con tus calificaciones?, or “are you happy (pleased) with your grades?” To be happy (pleased) with something, you would say, Estoy contento(a) con mi nuevo vestido, or “I am happy with my new dress.”

Contentar is also a verb that means to please or satisfy. , Feliz is typically used to express a state of being that is not permanent. For example, you might say, Aquí hemos sido muy felices, or “we have been very happy here.” You could also tell someone that they have made you happy. For example, you might say, Me haces feliz, or “you make me happy.”

, You could talk about someone’s disposition being cheerful. For example, you could say, Creo que soy una persona bastante alegre, por lo general, or “I think that I am a pretty happy (cheerful) person, in general.” Because you are saying that you are a cheerful person as a permanent state of being, you use the ser form of I am, soy.


You can also say that something someone has done has made you happy. For example, you could say, Me alegro que llegaste temprano, or “I’m glad that you came early.” In this case, alegrar is a reflexive verb that means to cheer up or rejoice. Directly translated it would mean, “it makes me glad that you came early.” But in English we do not use reflexive verbs in the same way, so it makes more sense as “I’m glad.”, The word for happiness is felicidad, a feminine noun. The plural of this word is used to say congratulations: ¡felicidades!


To wish someone a Happy Birthday, say ¡feliz cumpleaños!

To wish someone a Merry Christmas, say ¡feliz Navidad!

To wish someone a Happy New Year, say ¡feliz Año Nuevo!


, Here happy means that you are willing to help. For example, if you want to show your willingness to do something, you might say to someone, Con mucho gusto se lo comprobaré, or “I would be happy to check it for you.”



Se is used here to refer to used.


, Placer is also a verb that means “to be pleased.” For example, you could say nos place que te quedas aqui which means “it pleases us to have you stay here.” If you have had a good experience, something was to your liking, or you want to say that you enjoyed something, you can use either word. For example:


Me da mucho gusto que... (It gives me much pleasure that...)
Es un placer. (It is a pleasure.)
Fue un placer. (It was a pleasure.)
El gusto es mío. (The pleasure is mine.)

, For a correct pronunciation, say Es-toy con-ten-ta. With an emphasis on “toy” and “tenta.” Remember that depending on whether you are speaking to a guy or a girl, you will say contento or contenta. , Spanish is a great language for learning correct pronunciation because unlike English, there are no silent letters. You pronounce every letter in a word.


The one exception to this rule is that you do not pronounce the h at the beginning of words.

, Saying shorter vowel sounds will help you sound more native. Vowels in Spanish are easier to learn to pronounce than in English because there are only 5 sounds as opposed to 12.Notice that i and e in Spanish have different sounds than in English. The Spanish i vowel sound is more similar to the ee sound in English. The e vowel sound is more similar to the eh sound. a - ah

e- eh

i- ee

o- oh

u- oo


, In English, typically the stress goes on the first syllable in the word. This is the opposite in Spanish. If you have a word with 2-3 syllables, you will most likely put the stress on the second or third syllable. Look at the following words that are the same in English and Spanish, and you can see how the stress is changed. The stress in the English words are on the left, and the emphasis for the Spanish words are on the right.


LEgal = leGAL
ANimal = aniMAL
HOSpital = hospiTAL
POSsible = posIBle

, Look for dialogue in Spanish that has a recording that goes along with it. First practice saying the dialogue aloud and then listening and speaking along with the recording to hear how your pronunciation should be. Repeat this process several times. You can watch a movie in Spanish with subtitles. First mute the movie and read the subtitles aloud, then replay the same part and read the subtitles aloud with the audio to hear the difference.

Never pronounce the, ""H"", in Spanish if you see it. ""Hola"", or, ""Hasta luego"", are actually pronounced, ""Ola, asta luego."" The only reason you would use the ""h"" sound in Spanish is when you see a g or j. ""Jorge"" is said ""Horhe"". But be careful with the letter G: when you find ""gu"", ""ga"", ""go"", you should use the guttural sound as in the verb ""Go""; when you read ""ge"" or ""gi"", you use the sound of english ""H"" as in ""He"".






Try to roll your tongue when saying your r's in Spanish: Initial ""r"", doble ""r"" and ""r"" after ""l"",""n"" and ""s"": Ramón, roca, irritado. All the other ""r's"" are soft like the English ""r"" in right,rose...etc.






Y is pronounced like ee and also like the second ""i"" of English ""idiot, but both ways of pronouncing it don't cause misunderstandings. The letter ""i"" is pronounced like a long ""e"" as in ""eat"" but shorter; in diphthongs pronounce it like a Spanish ""y"" : miedo, siete, aluminio, caries. Pronounce the letter ""u"" as ""oo"" (like when something looks ugly, you say ""oo"" or ""oo"" in the word ""good"").

You can think of adiós as approximately equivalent to ""farewell"" in English. In practice, this word isn't used as much as you might think.Typically Spanish speakers use it if they won't be seeing the other person for a longer period of time, if ever again. For example, if you were ending a relationship with a significant other, you might say ""adiós."";

Rephrase your thesis statement.,
Revise your thesis statement.,
Place the thesis statement at the beginning of the conclusion.,
Use the language and tone in your introduction.,
Repeat themes and images from the rest of the essay.,
Put in a relevant quote from the literary text.,
Answer the question, “so what?” Think about why someone would care about what you are talking about in your essay and why the focus of your essay is important.,
Summarize your essay.,
Do not include new information.,
Finish with a powerful image or detail from the text.,
End with a simple, straightforward sentence.,
Set your essay within a larger context.,
Edit the conclusion before submitting the essay.",How to Write a Conclusion to a Literary Essay," Avoid repeating your thesis statement as it appears in your introduction. This will seem redundant and show a lack of creativity on your part. Instead, rephrase the thesis statement so it appears differently in your conclusion. This will show that you have considered your thesis statement based on the rest of your essay and feel confident enough to rephrase it. Change the language and word choice in the original thesis statement.For example, maybe your original thesis statement was, “Though there are elements of tragedy in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the structure, themes, and staging of the play fall into the genre of comedy.”
You may then rephrase your thesis statement by shifting around some of the language in the original and by using a more precise word choice. For example, the rephrased thesis statement may be, “While there are tragic moments in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the structure, themes, and staging of the play fit within the genre of comedy.”;
, Another option is to revise your thesis statement to be more clear, making deeper edits to it. Go back to your introduction and read your thesis statement again. Then, keep your thesis statement in mind as you read over your body paragraphs. Consider whether your thesis statement still feels relevant to your essay, or if it could be revised. Then, make adjustments to it so it better reflects your essay as a whole.For example, maybe your original thesis statement was, “Though there are elements of tragedy in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the structure, themes, and staging of the play fall into the genre of comedy.”
You may then revise it to better reflect your essay as a whole, “While tragic events do occur in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, the three act structure, the themes of magic and dreams, as well as the farcical staging of the play indicate that it fits in the genre of comedy.”
Keep in mind if you make major revisions to your thesis statement, it should only be done to reflect the rest of your essay as a whole. Make sure the original thesis statement in your introduction still compliments or reflects the revised thesis statement in your conclusion.

, Start the conclusion with your rephrased or revised thesis statement. This will set the tone for your conclusion and show that you are connecting your conclusion back to the rest of your essay. You can then use the revised thesis statement to build the rest of your conclusion.You do not need to put “In conclusion,” “In summary,” or “To conclude” before your thesis statement to start the conclusion. This can feel too formal and stilted. Instead, start a new paragraph and launch right into your rephrased thesis statement at the beginning of the conclusion.

, The middle section of your conclusion should be three to five sentences long. It should broaden the scope of your essay, borrowing the language and tone you have established in your introduction. Read over your introduction to get a sense of the tone and word choice. Pull certain phrases or terms you like from your introduction and rephrase them in your conclusion. This will make the conclusion feel like part of the essay as a whole.For example, you may have a sentence about how the staging of the play affects the genre of the play in your introduction. You could then rephrase this sentence and include it in your conclusion.
If you read over your introduction and realize some of your ideas have shifted in your body paragraphs, you may need to revise your introduction and use the revisions to then write the middle section of the conclusion.

, You can also draw on themes and images that appear in the introduction or body of your essay and include them in your conclusion. Perhaps there is a particular image or scenario from the literary text that you responded to in the body section of the essay and want to include in your conclusion. Maybe there is a specific theme that comes up in the body section that you want to reiterate in your conclusion.For example, maybe you focus on the theme of magic in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream in the body section of your essay. You can then reiterate the theme of magic by using an image from the play that illustrates the magical element of the text.

, Including a relevant quote from the literary text in your conclusion can also make it stronger and more effective. Perhaps there is a quote that you like but could not find space for in your body paragraphs. Or maybe there is a quote that feels like a summation of the focus of your essay as a whole. Use the quote to support your thesis statement and your claims in the essay.For example, if your essay focuses on how the theme of love in Shakespeare’s A Midsummer Night’s Dream, you may include a quote from the text that illustrates this theme.

, Answering the question “so what?” can help you generate interesting things to finish your essay with in the conclusion.For example, if you are writing an essay about Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird, you may answer the question “so what?” by thinking about how and why Harper Lee's novel discusses issues of race and identity in the South. You could then use your response in the conclusion of the essay.

, As part of your conclusion, you can also summarize your essay in one concise sentence. Avoid rehashing the details of your essay or simply listing the things you discussed in your essay. This can come across as redundant. Instead, focus on the key highlights in your essay and connect them back to your thesis statement. This way, you can show that the points discussed in your essay are relevant to your topic.


For example, you may summarize your essay by noting, ""An analysis of scenes between white characters and African-American characters in the novel, as done in this essay, make it clear that Lee is addressing questions of race and identity in the South head on.""

, Do not include new information or brand new insight in your conclusion. This will only confuse your reader and make your essay feel imbalanced. The conclusion should explore ideas already present in your essay, not introduce brand new ones., Coming up with a good last sentence for your literary essay can be a challenge. One option is to use a powerful image or detail from the literary text that will be compelling for the reader. The image or detail should relate back to the focus of your essay and reiterate your thesis statement.For example, if the focus of your essay is the theme of magic in the text, you may end with an image for the text that includes a magical element that is important to the main character.

, Write the last sentence that is composed mostly of one-syllable words, making it simple and straightforward for your reader. Having a simple, to the point last sentence will ensure it has impact and stays with the reader.Read over your last sentence and remove any words that seem unnecessary or confusing. Simplify the last sentence of your conclusion so it is concise and to the point.

, Another way you can wrap up your conclusion is to refer your essay to a larger issue or a contemporary context. Think about how themes or ideas in your essay might relate to a larger issue in literature or to a contemporary issue in the media. This can be a good way to make your essay feel relevant to now.For example, you may connect an essay about Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird to modern issues around African-American rights in America.
Avoid making overblown statements in the conclusion in an attempt to sum up your thoughts. Connecting your essay to a larger context is fine. Trying to connect your essay to vague ideas like “world suffering” or “the wage gap” will only confuse your reader and weaken your conclusion.

, Once you are done with the conclusion, read it over to check for any spelling, grammar, or punctuation errors. Read the conclusion out loud to ensure it is well organized and flows well, with the thesis statement up front and a strong final line. Make sure the tone and language of the conclusion match the tone and language in the rest of the essay.

Midas and the Golden Touch – King of Phrygia, Midas found favor with the god Dionysus who offered to grant him whatever he wished. He asked for the power to turn whatever he touched to gold, and then quickly realized his mistake, when everything he tried to eat or drink turned to gold.

Prometheus the Fire Thief – He stole the fire of the Zeus and taught mankind how to use it. As a punishment, he was chained to a rock and each day an eagle came and ate out his liver, which was magically restored overnight.

Europa – A woman so beautiful that Zeus fell in love with her. He came to her in the guise of a beautiful white bull, and bowed before her. When she climbed on his back, he carried her to a cave where he revealed his true nature. Europe is named after her.

Daedalus and Icarus – Daedalus designed the labyrinth on Crete, where king Minos later had him and his son Icarus imprisoned. Daedalus built wings of wax and feathers for himself and his son so they could fly to freedom, but Icarus flew too high and his wax wings melted. He fell and drowned in the Icarian Seas, which was named after him.

Orpheus and Eurydice – Orpheus was a great musician. When his love Eurydice died, he went down to the underworld and played his lyre so beautifully that Hades agreed to let Eurydice go, so long as Orpheus agreed not to look on her until they reached the surface. But Orpheus worried that he had been tricked. He looked back only a few feet from the surface, only to see Eurydice be whisked away back to the underworld because he had looked too soon.

Start early.,
Examine what you already know.,
Consider whether there are literary terms you’re unfamiliar with.,
Look at sample questions, if you can.",How to Study English Literature1," Don’t wait to study until the night before a big exam! Particularly with a subject such as English literature, where you will probably be asked analytical questions as well as content questions, you must have time to familiarize yourself with some of the complexities of your material. Being able to summarize the plot or name some characters is unlikely to be all you’ll need to do.;
, Write out all the details you can remember from your first reading of the text, as well as anything you remember from your course lectures. Don’t “cheat” by looking at your notes or your text -- just write down what you are confident you remember. This will be your starting base and will reveal any gaps in your knowledge.

, Many tests and exams in English literature want you to be familiar with some key terms, such as stanza, irony, alliteration, speaker, and figurative language. While you’re not likely to be expected to have comprehensive knowledge of literary terminology, understanding some of these key concepts will be important to your success. There are many guides available that can help you find definitions for important literary concepts, but here are a few crucial terms:


A stanza is a poetic division of lines and is equivalent to the paragraph in prose writing. Usually, stanzas are at least three lines long; groups of two lines are usually called “couplets.”Irony at its basic level says one thing but means another, which is almost always the opposite of what is actually said. For example, a character who meets someone in a raging blizzard might say “Lovely weather we’re having, isn’t it?” This is ironic because the reader can see that it is clearly not lovely weather. William Shakespeare, Jane Austen, and Charles Dickens are famous for their use of irony.Do not confuse irony with misfortune, which Alanis Morissette’s song “Ironic” is culpable of: “a black fly in your chardonnay” is definitely unfortunate, but it’s not ironic.

Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience knows important information that a character does not, such as the fact that Oedipus killed his father and will marry his mother.Alliteration is a technique used most often in poetry and plays; it is the repetition of the same initial consonants in multiple words within a short space. “Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers” is an example of alliteration.
A speaker usually refers to the person from whose point of view a poem is given, although it may also be used to refer to a novel’s narrator. Keeping the speaker separate from the author is important, especially in poetic dramatic monologues such as Robert Browning’s ""My Last Duchess,"" in which a maniacal duke admits to having murdered his first wife. Obviously, it is the speaker, not Browning, who is saying these things.

Figurative language is discussed in more length in Part 2 of this article, but it is the opposite of “literal” language. Figurative language uses techniques such as metaphor, simile, personification, and hyperbole to make a point more vividly. For example, in Shakespeare’s play Antony and Cleopatra, Cleopatra describes Mark Antony this way: “His legs bestride the ocean. His reared arm / Crested the world.” This is hyperbolic language: obviously Antony’s legs didn’t literally straddle the ocean, but it powerfully conveys Cleopatra’s high opinion of him and his power.

, If you were given a study guide or sample questions, see how much of this material you are already familiar with. This will help you zone in on what needs more work and make a study plan.

Consult the work of the poet Hesiod for more on the origins of the gods.,
Check out the epic poems of Homer.,
Learn more about Jason and the Argonauts by reading Apollonius Rhodius.,
Read the three great tragic playwrights.,
Lighten up with the comic playwright Aristophanes.",How to Study Greek Mythology3," There are several authors who have synthesized multiple ancient Greek authors in order to create compendiums of mythology. Some books to consider include:



Jenny March's The Penguin Book of Classical Myths (2009) – Professor March's work provides a clear, easy to read retelling of the major myths, alongside the latest scholarship on their origins, development, and meanings.

Richard Buxton's The Complete World of Greek Mythology (2004) – Buxton offers an overview of mythology, placing the myths in their social and cultural context. His book is also packed with extras such as genealogical tables and beautiful illustrations.

Edith Hamilton’s Mythology: Timeless Tales of Gods and Heroes (1942) – Hamilton draws on all the great Greek writers, and some Roman ones, too, in compiling her introductory text that covers all the key gods and myths.

Timothy Gantz’s Early Greek Myth: A Guide to Literary and Artistic Sources (1993) – Gant’s book is the most scholarly, and also the densest introduction to Greek mythology. He draws on both early Greek writers and art in order to recreate the myths as they were in the days of Homer and Aeschylus.Robert Graves’s The Greek Myths (1956) – Graves is a sort of anti-Gantz. He is a wonderful writer, and his myths make for an easy and enjoyable introduction to Greek mythology. His scholarship, on the other hand, is decidedly sub-par, and his theories of the origins of Greek mythology and the relations between its cast of characters have been more or less all disproven.

, If you are truly interested in Greek mythology, you should go beyond modern re-tellings to the original sources. Though still called Apollodorus’s library, it has more recently been concluded that this 2nd century AD compilation of myths was not in fact written by Apollodorus of Athens. Regardless of its authorship, this compendium brings together most of the major Greek myths and orders them in a way that is still used by the writers of compendiums today.You can find an indexed translation online at http://www.theoi.com/Text/Apollodorus1.html.

, A Greek poet from the 8th century BC, his Theogony details the origins and genealogy of the gods, while his poem Works and Days give insight into daily life in ancient Greece. For an award-winning recent translation, check out poet Daryl Hine's Works of Hesiod and the Homeric Myths. Hesiod's works can also be found online at http://www.theoi.com/Text/HesiodTheogony.html.

, The two greatest epics of Greek mythology – The Iliad and The Odyssey – were written in the 8th or 7th century BC and are both ascribed to the poet Homer. While they focus on the Trojan War and the journeys of Odysseus, respectively, they also include asides that touch on many other classical myths.


Robert Fagles has produced the authoritative translation of both The Iliad and The Odyssey.

, An Alexandrian born in 295BC, Apollonius’s Argonautica is the best-known version of Jason’s adventures.It is available online at http://www.theoi.com/Text/ApolloniusRhodius1.html.

, Aeschylus, Euripides, and Sophocles were contemporaries who produced tragic plays of profound psychological insight that have influenced writers to this day and which continue to be performed.Aeschylus – Born around 525BC, the most famous of his seven surviving plays are Prometheus Bound and the Oresteia Trilogy: Agamemnon, The Libation Bearers, and The Eumenides. Find his works at http://www.theoi.com/Text/AeschylusPrometheus.html.

Euripides – Born around 486BC and of humble origins, his plays are unique in that his characters often question the gods and fight against their fates.Nineteen of his plays survive. Some of the most famous include The Bacchae, The Trojan Women, Medea, Electra, and Orestes. Find his works online at http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/collection?collection=Perseus%3Acollection%3AGreco-Roman.

Re-read your text.,
Look for figurative language.,
Consider the structure of your text.,
Think about character archetypes.,
Think about situational archetypes.,
Consider how action develops from conflict.",How to Study English Literature2," You should have already read the text for class, but if you’re studying for an exam, make sure you go back and re-read it to catch things you missed out on the first time.

, Many authors use techniques such as metaphors, similes, and personification to emphasize their points. These may be crucial to understanding the literary work you’re reading: for example, knowing that the white whale in Moby-Dick represents (among other things) Captain Ahab’s hubris is essential to being able to understand Melville’s novel.



Metaphors make direct comparisons between two seemingly dissimilar things. They are stronger than similes. For example, the last line of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s novel The Great Gatsby is a famous metaphor comparing human lives to boats trying to make progress against a strong current: “So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.”Similes also make comparisons, but they don’t directly state that “x” is “y”. For example, Margaret Mitchell uses a simile to describe Scarlett O’Hara’s interest in Ashley Wilkes with a simile in her novel Gone With the Wind: “The very mystery of him excited her curiosity like a door that had neither lock nor key.”Personification occurs when a non-human animal or object is given human characteristics in order to express an idea more powerfully. For example, Emily Dickinson frequently uses personification in her poems, as in this poem about a snake: “A narrow fellow in the grass / occasionally rides; / You may have met him, -- did you not, / His notice sudden is.”Here, the snake is a “narrow fellow” who “rides” in the grass, which makes it seem almost like a dashing Victorian gentleman, rather than a reptile.

, The way that an author expresses her or his ideas is often as important as the ideas themselves. In many cases, the form and structure of the text will have some kind of influence on its subject matter.


If you’re reading fiction, think about the order in which the events are recounted. Are there flashbacks or places in the narrative that cycle back in time? Sandra Cisneros’s novel Caramelo begins close to the end of the actual “story” and switches between various times and places in order to emphasize how complicated family histories are.
If you’re reading poetry, think about the form of the poetry. What type of poem is it? Is it something formally structured, like a sonnet or sestina? Is it free verse, which makes use of elements such as rhythm and alliteration but doesn’t have a set rhyme scheme? The way the poem is written will often offer clues as to the mood the poet wanted to convey.

, An archetype is usually a character -- although it may also be an action or situation -- that is believed to represent something universally recognized as part of human nature. The influential psychologist Carl Jung argued that archetypes tap into the “collective unconscious” of humanity, and thus we recognize experiences we’ve shared with others in archetypes. Several types of of literature analysis have been influenced by Jung, so being familiar with some archetypes that may appear in your text will probably be useful.The Hero is a character who embodies good and often fights against evil in a struggle to bring justice or restore order. Beowulf and Captain America are perfect examples of the Hero archetype.
The Innocent Youth is a character who is usually inexperienced, but whom others like because of the faith s/he has in other people. For example, Pip in Charles Dickens’s novel Great Expectations is an Innocent Youth, as is Luke Skywalker from Star Wars. Often, these archetypes will experience some sort of “coming of age” in later parts of the story.
The Mentor is tasked with caring for or protecting the main character through wise advice and assistance. Gandalf in J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit is an excellent example of a Mentor archetype, as is Obi-Wan Kenobi from the Star Wars movies.
The Doppelganger is a character who doubles for the main character in order to represent the “dark side” of the hero or heroine. Common examples of doppelgangers include Frankenstein and his Creature in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in Robert Louis Stevenson's' novel of the same name.
The Villain is a character with evil plans whom the hero must oppose. The villain will usually do anything to defeat the hero and is often, though not always, clever. Good examples include Shere Khan from Rudyard Kipling’s The Jungle Book, Smaug the Dragon from The Hobbit, and the Joker from the Batman comics and films.

, The other main type of archetype you’ll probably encounter is situational, i.e., a very familiar and expected type of plot and progression. Some common situational archetypes include:The Journey. This is an incredibly common archetype and is referenced in everything from stories of King Arthur to Jonathan Swift's Gulliver’s Travels to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. In this archetype, the main character undertakes a journey -- physical or emotional, literal or figurative -- to understand something about herself/himself or the world around her/him, or to achieve an important goal. Often, the journey is very important to the plot, as with the Fellowship’s quest to destroy Sauron’s One Ring in the Lord of the Rings.

The Initiation. This archetype has similarities with the Journey, but the focus is more on the hero/heroine’s developing maturity through their experiences. This type of story may also be called a ‘’bildungsroman.’’ Henry Fielding's Tom Jones is an excellent example of this, as are the origins of most comic book heroes (for example, Peter Parkers lessons about how to handle “great power and great responsibility” as he becomes Spiderman).
The Fall. This is another very common archetype. In this archetype, the main character experiences a fall from grace as the consequence of her/his own action. Examples of this archetype are all over classic literature, including King Lear from Shakespeare’s play King Lear, Ahab from Melville's novel Moby-Dick, and Satan from John Milton’s epic poem Paradise Lost.


, For many texts, particularly plays and fiction, there is an “inciting incident” that sets the main action of the story in motion. This moment disturbs the equilibrium of the situation, poses a problem, and sets off a series of events that will form the rest of the story.For example, in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, Macbeth hears a prophecy from a trio of witches that says he will become King of Scotland. While he has never wanted to be king until this moment, the prophecy sets him on a path of ambition and murder that eventually leads in his downfall.
As another example, in Arthur Miller’s play The Crucible, a group of young girls face a conflict: they’ve been caught doing naughty things in the woods and face punishment. To try to cover up their actions, they accuse their fellow villagers of witchcraft. This action incites the rest of the play’s story, which follows these accusations as they spin out of control.

"
"
Summarize each chapter or act in bullet points after you read through the text for the second time.,
Make out character profiles for each main character.,
Outline any problems the characters face.,
Determine whether these problems are solved.,
Remember some important statements made.,
Make more detailed notes, including main themes in the text and how each character is important in the text.,
Write down any symbols in the text and where they appear.,
Look up contemporary connections.",How to Study English Literature3," This will make future review easier, as you will have a rough summary to work from.


Don’t get too bogged down in summary. You don’t have to summarize every little thing that happens in a chapter or act. Aim to note the main action of each one, as well as any important character or thematic moments.

, Include anything important that the character says or does, along with links to other characters in the text.


For plays, you may want to note any speeches that seem particularly important, such as Hamlet’s “To be or not to be” speech or the “attention must be paid” speech from Arthur Miller’s Death of a Salesman.


, This can often be even more helpful than chapter summaries. What challenges and conflicts do the main characters face? What are their goals?


For example, Shakespeare’s Hamlet has several problems he needs to solve: 1) Is the ghost of his father urging him to seek revenge trustworthy? 2) How can he take revenge on his uncle in a court full of people who are watching his every move? 3) How can he overcome his natural tendency to overthink things to work up the courage to take the revenge he wants?

, Sometimes, problems are solved fairly neatly at the end of a story: the Death Star is destroyed in Star Wars, the One Ring is destroyed and Aragorn restored as King in Lord of the Rings. Sometimes, problems are solved but not in ideal ways: for example, Hamlet does achieve his revenge and fulfill the ghost’s request, but he also kills several innocent people along the way and ends up dead himself. Understanding whether characters achieved their goals, or why they didn’t, will be useful in discussing the works in your exam.

, While you don’t necessarily need to memorize important statements or speeches, remembering what they’re generally about can be very helpful when you go to make an argument about a text.


For example, if you’re studying Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice, remembering that Mr. Darcy admits to meddling in Elizabeth’s family affairs will be useful in explaining why they are so angry with each other early in the book (i.e., he is too proud to admit that meddling really was wrong, and she is too prejudiced to admit he might have had motivations that made sense).

, Don’t skimp on detail here! Noting that “the tone of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein is very sinister” won’t be much use in the exam if you don’t have a way to describe what’s making it feel sinister.


Write down particularly vivid moments from the text. Not only can these help you remember what happened in a chapter, they will give you evidence to use when you make claims about the text in your exam.
For example, consider this quotation from Chapter 41 of Herman Melville’s Moby-Dick, when Ahab has finally caught up with the White Whale: “He piled upon the whale’s white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from Adam down; and then, as if his chest had been a mortar, he burst his hot heart’s shell upon it.”This is far more evocative than simply saying “Ahab attacked the whale.” This passage emphasizes that Ahab is after the whale not just for taking his leg, but because he’s come to embody every single horrible thing that has happened to humans since time began in this whale, and he is willing to destroy himself -- it’s as if his chest is a cannon, remember, with a cannonball exploding from it -- to take the whale down.

, Symbolism is a favorite tool of authors. If some element, such as a color or specific item, shows up more than once or twice, it’s likely to be a symbol that represents something important.


For example, in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel The Scarlet Letter, the “A” that Hester Prynne must wear in punishment of her adultery is an obvious symbol, but her daughter Pearl also serves as a symbol. Like the “A,” Pearl is a reminder of her adultery, a “token of her shame.” Hester often dresses Pearl in beautiful gold and red dresses, physically linking her to the letter and to Hester’s crime.

, It is often very helpful to be able to reference in your exam or essay some important cultural or social issues that were relevant at the time a text was first written. Use any course material you have, along with introductions to critical editions of the text and reliable resources such as those found through a library database to do a bit of research. Do not rely on websites such as wikipedia or your own knowledge of a period, as both of these may be incomplete or inaccurate.For example, if you are studying Charlotte Perkins Gilman’s short story ""The Yellow Wallpaper,"" it’s important to be able to speak about the condition of women in the late 19th century. Gilman was a very important feminist writer who wrote against the traditional social structure of her time, which insisted that a woman’s only place was as a wife and mother. Importantly, her arguments usually insisted that this structure harmed men as well as women -- something that is very useful to bring up in a discussion of her fiction, and something you might not know if you were only acting on “common knowledge” of the era.

"
"
Get into the right mindset.,
Read the play, or at least a summary.,
Get used to the old-fashioned language.,
Examples: ""For in my sight, she uses thee kindly, but thou liest in thy throat."",
Familiarize yourself with stylistic means used in poetry, like similes, oxymorons, metaphors etc.,
If you're performing Shakespeare, be sure to enunciate (speak out entire words rather than a slur of words).,
When performing, remember that your character is an actual person with actual feelings, not a fancy-talking English person.",How to Understand and Perform Shakespeare," Feel the mood of the play. Never assume that this is too difficult for you anyway. Going through the text step by step will enable you to understand it.;
, It helps to know what's going on. Look at other performances of Shakespeare; they're plays, they were written to be performed, and you can get ideas on how to say that one line you can't figure out. Also, it helps if you read up on the context and setting of the play so you can understand what some of the laws or common practices (etc.) of the place.

, Whenever you hear the word ""thou,"" thy"" or ""thee"", that means ""you,"" ""your,"" or ""you""--singular. When you hear ""art"", that means ""are"". When you hear anything that ends in ""-st"", don't freak out. Shakespeare adds ""-st"" to any word that goes with ""thou"", thus ""mayst not"" = ""may not"". Shakespeare also likes to take out syllables to make the line flow smoother--example: ""o' th' "" would translate to ""on the"".

, translates to: ""From what I see, she is kind to you, but you lie."" and ""No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer!"" translates to ""No, I will not stay here a second longer! or ""What light through yonder window breaks, it is the east and Juliet is the sun."" translates to ""Juliet is as radiant with beauty as the sun is radiant with light"". Remember, people were people 500 years ago, and even though they talked differently, they still had emotions like we do.

, These are usually discussed in literature classes at school, and knowing what they mean will make the whole process of reading Shakespeare's work less intimidating. Look them up on the internet and try to find examples of them in your text.

, The way Shakespeare puts sentences together are very unorthodox in terms of modern English, so it will be very easy for the audience to lose track of what you're actually saying. By enunciating clearly and fully, the audience can piece together the words much more easily.

, Your character has feelings just like you. It helps if you understand your character's personality and how he or she behaves throughout the entire play and not just in one scene or act.

Re-read.",How to Read a Thomas Pynchon Novel," Thomas Pynchon has written V., The Crying of Lot 49, Gravity's Rainbow, Vineland, Mason & Dixon, and Against the Day, with a collection of short stories called Slow Learner and a book coming out August 2009 called Inherent Vice.


Start with V. or The Crying of Lot 49.
Then proceed to Gravity's Rainbow and Mason & Dixon.

Bleeding Edge is his most recent book and reflects many of the themes that he's developed over a decades-long career, plus it is pretty accessible. Against the Day is also fairly recent, but much longer.

The Crying of Lot 49 is considered by some to be his finest work, but Pynchon himself has been highly critical of it; still, it reads easy and is his shortest book, so it's a good stepping stone for beginners.

V. is the first novel he published, so it makes sense to read if you want to start from the beginning.

Vineland and Slow Learner should only be read by die-hard fans.

Inherent Vice has a relatively fresh and new approach, but ultimately will lead you down the same path. It is probably a good choice because it's widely accessible now, just having come out, and much shorter and easier to read, while still engaging with much of his wit and themes.;
, If you're reading a Thomas Pynchon novel, chances are you enjoy reading. Pynchon's fame can make the idea of reading a Pynchon novel stressful. Nothing is going to be enjoyable if you go into it assuming it's going to be stressful. Start reading it like you would read any other book, and then adjust to his form.

, Be comfortable, because if you're not comfortable you're not going to enjoy it. Don't read it on the fly because then you won't be able to follow it, but don't read it obsessively because then you won't be able to enjoy it.

, Many people plan ahead for a large chunk of time to read Pynchon, and many people while reading Pynchon try to take it really slowly to make sure they understand everything. Most of the former never get that time allotted (life takes over), and many of the latter lose track of what's going on after a while. A book by Thomas Pynchon is still a book, and should be enjoyed as such. Read it fast enough that the story continues and you can keep track and remember what's going on, but not so fast that you're skipping passages.

, Keep reading, even if you feel you don't get it. Thomas Pynchon is a post-modern author, which means his stories can tend to stray towards self-reflexive, fragmented, and shifting forms and identity. If you're not understanding what's going on now, something completely different will happen later that will get you back on track. If he's going on what seems to be a long tangent, the tangent may have taken over the narrative. No matter what, however, whether it's a sex scene, a musical number, a play on scientific ideas, or something else, it will not be that long of a wait before something else happens that will re-awaken your interest (if your interest is lost in the first place)

, Thomas Pynchon is famous for juggling settings, historical events, ideas, and people in both analogous and anachronistic ways. Some people try to take notes and diagrams and try to delineate every single thread Pynchon weaves into the greater narrative. Such an attempt is useful only for the truly obsessive. For purposes of discovery, however, it is much better to read Pynchon and concentrate more on the stuff you already understand, and enjoy hearing what he has to say about the rest. One woman who tried diagramming all of the characters and their relationships in Gravity's Rainbow to understand what was going on still hasn't finished the book.

, Pynchon is a writer of possibilities, and possibilities are not always actualities. Things in a Pynchon novel can be striking, logical, and even meaningful to a mystery you recognize in the real world, and still not refer to anything that actually exists in the real world. A lot of the joy in Pynchon's writing comes from what can be summed up in his statement for the inside flap of Against the Day: ""Maybe it's not the world, but with a minor adjustment or two it's what the world might be."" Besides, the guy was on the Simpsons a couple of times. Obviously, Thomas Pynchon does not take Thomas Pynchon too seriously.

, It's fiction, but it's fiction that delights in drawing parallels and tangents to both related and unrelated concepts through passion, humor, and a stunning array of creativity. If you discover something that rings a bell in your head, congratulations: you've just experienced the Spark of Recognition, and Thomas Pynchon is great at igniting it. If he brings up a topic you're interested in, by all means, explore it. That is why one can't understand all of the topics presented, because they are all references to the specific interests of Thomas Pynchon himself, who is of course not interested in explaining it all to his readers. Reading Pynchon can be an intensely personal experience, which is actually why it's really hard to get any two Thomas Pynchon fans to talk about the same things.

, I've read a couple of those reviews that called ""Gravity's Rainbow"" ""unreadable"". They were written by people who operate under a certain theory of how literature inherently should be. Let the book go where it's going to go, because it's going to go there anyway. Resistance is futile.

, If there's anything that needs to be stressed, it's that Pynchon actually is as entertaining as well as anything else. For some reason, almost all of the critical analysis, fan reviews, Wikipedia articles, and other accessible writings about Pynchon tend to mention that fact rather infrequently. The people who most seem to ""get"" Pynchon are the ones who also seem to enjoy Pynchon, while the people who try to ""get"" Pynchon get nowhere. If you can remember that it's your free time you're spending, then remember that free time is best spent enjoying overexerting. If you're actually reading a Pynchon novel because it was assigned or recommended, be especially subversive and enjoy it. No reaction is better for appreciating the full bulk of something like enjoying it, even if it's for a minor aspect. Even though that statement seems obvious, for some reason people forget about it a lot.

, You'll probably want to, anyway, but now that you have a general sense of the idea of the novel, you can go back and appreciate those details everyone's raving about.

Read a Shakespearean play in the original if you can.,
Replace questions of the form ""Can I?"",
Work on greetings.,
Work on your farewells.,
Add in more-or-less superfluous adverbs such as ""humbly"" - they make your speech more flowery, which is the main effect.

,
Shorten ""it"" to just ""'t"".,
Master forms of ""thou"" - use ""thy"" for possessive (""thine"" before vowels or the letter H), and ""thee"" for an object.

,
Clearly mark off opinions with ""methinks"" and ""forsooth"".

,
Refine your cursing.,
Freely use the following words: ""Anon"", ""As you will"", ""By your leave"", ""Carouse"", ""Chide"", ""Cutpurse"", ""E""en"", ""E""er"", ""Fie"", ""Grammercy"", ""Maid or Maiden"", ""Marry!,
Fix your verbs: Add ""-st"" to singular second-person verbs and ""-th""/""-eth"" to singular third-person verbs.,
Use ""shall"".,
If you need to break up with someone, take a few hints from Hamlet (Act 3, scene 1, 114–121).

",How to Speak Like Shakespeare," Hamlet, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Othello, and Romeo and Juliet are good candidates. This will give you an idea of how the language is used and also increase your vocabulary with older forms and uses of words.;
, with phrases such as ""I do beseech you"" or ""I prithee"". This archaic form sounds particularly Elizabethan, and has the benefit of being more polite.

, In modern times, we are satisfied with ""Hello"" or ""How are you"". To make this sound more Shakespearean, a simple form may be ""Good greetings, my lord/lady"" or, if you truly wish to know how the other is doing, try ""How now, ?"". Feel free to add clauses along the form of ""and may you be well"". You can respond with ""Likewise to you"", remembering to refer to ""my lord"" or ""my lady"" A more medieval and flowery response could be ""All of God's greetings upon you"".

, Farewells can be much improved from modern ""Bye!"". A very simple, no-thinking-required approach might be ""Fare thee well"", but this can be improved further by considering how your conversation ended. Did you say goodbye to someone for a long time? ""Fare thee well in thy travels, and may by fate we meet again."" Similarly modify your goodbyes to fit the situation.

,, For example, ""it was"" becomes ""'twas"", ""do it"" becomes ""do't""

,,, Replace ""damned"" with ""accursed"". Other adjectives can be replaced with ""traitorous"", ""lecherous"", or ""thieving"". You can also refer to those of humble origin or anyone acting servant-like as ""knavish""

, For example, ""How dost thou"" and ""How doth he""

, It can be used to express obligation, and also in the first person. Remember that when used with ""thee"" or ""thou"", ""will"" becomes ""wilt"" and ""shall"" ""shalt""

As you read, think about the characters and scenes.",How to Read and Understand Romeo and Juliet," Normally these books are called ""Shakespeare Made Easy"", and cost around $6.99.;
, You'll notice that one side is written in Shakespearean language and the other side is English translated. Read the Shakespearean and when you come along a difficult spot, look to the other side for help.

, They have excellent pages on each act, descriptions of the characters, analyses and quizzes.

, Sometimes if you read alone you might miss a deeper meaning. If you read in a group or with a friend you have more thought and insights than your own.

, This way you can see what is going on, and get the main idea. However, remember that each director and actor has their own interpretation about the roles and the story.

, This way you will understand his time and the whole work. (Look up Shakespeare, the Globe Theater, the Renaissance, etc.)

, William Shakespeare was a genius in the art of writing. With almost every sentence he used some form of structure. If you know what a sonnet is or a couplet, then the book will seem a lot more meaningful. Here is an example of a sonnet, that he used in the beginning to start of this story:""Two households, both alike in dignity,
In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life;
Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
The fearful passage of their death-marked love,
And the continuance of their parents' rage,
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
The which if you with patient ears attend,
What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.""'

, What are characters' traits? What is going on in the story (what's the relationship between the Montagues and the Capulets? How come Shakespeare never states where the hatred came from?)? How do they function? What might they mean? Try to catch as many details that occur to be meaningful to you as possible. If you can, write them down and think as you read, and find more information about them later.

Set a schedule.,
Read the novel.,
Consult the footnotes.,
Create a list of words you do not know.,
Write in the margins.,
Summarize each chapter.",How to Read the Classics1," If you are reading the book for school or college, you can look ahead on your syllabus to see when you will need to have finished the book. Divide the page count with the number of days that you have left. That is the minimum number of pages you should read each day.


Alternatively, you could choose to read a certain number of chapters a day. Divide the number of chapters by the number of days, keeping in mind that some chapters are longer than others.;
, Every day read at least your minimum page count for the novel. You should try to read uninterrupted in a single session. Do not end in the middle of a page or chapter. Try to end your session at a conclusive point so that it will be easier for you to pick up the novel the next day.

, You may have an annotated text that has footnotes or endnotes. These will appear as small numbers above the text. These numbers refer to an explanatory note on the bottom of the page or in the back of the book. Reading these notes as you work your way through the text can help you understand the historical, social, and linguistic meaning of the book. They can also point out literary allusions, symbolism, metaphors, and double-meanings in the text. Often, they will translate difficult or old words into simple modern English.

, You do not want to interrupt your reading by constantly checking the dictionary. Keep a list of words you do not recognize, and after you have finished reading for the day, look them up and write down their definitions. You may encounter these words again while reading the book.


If the word prevents you from understanding what is going on, then you should probably look it up right away.

, Use a pencil to circle, underline, and box any key phrases, quotes, or symbols. Record your reactions to certain parts of the text by using smiley faces. If you have an opinion or you notice something interesting, jot a quick note in the margins. This kind of active reading helps you process and remember the novel with greater ease. It can help you recall important moments in class or on a quiz, and it prepares you for discussing the book at a critical level.


Be sure to erase your notes if you are giving or selling your book to someone else.

, After you finish for the day, write a brief summary of what happened. This will help you recall at a later date what the novel was about. It can also help you process what you read for that day. Keep these summaries in a notebook together. When you are finished with the novel, you can look back over your notes."

Note what type of poem you’re dealing with.,
Identify the speaker and the audience of the poem, when possible.,
Write down any symbols in the poem and where they appear.,
Remember that you don’t have to memorize poems you’re studying.,
Look up context for your poems.",How to Study English Literature4," Sometimes, knowing the type of poem you’re studying, such as whether it’s a sonnet or sestina or haiku, can be very important to being able to discuss its meaning. You can often determine what type of poetry you’re dealing with by examining the rhyme scheme (the pattern of rhymes at the end of each line) and the meter (the number of poetic “feet” each line has).


For example, Edna St. Vincent Millay tackles how difficult it is to write poetry in her poem “I Will Put Chaos into Fourteen Lines.” Knowing that this poem is a sonnet about writing sonnets helps explain part of what the poem’s goal is: putting a little modern “chaos” into a very old and established poetic form. Recognizing that Millay uses a classic Petrarchan rhyme scheme and that many of the lines are in iambic pentameter (meaning they sound like “ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM ta-TUM”) will help you identify the poem as a sonnet.
Many modern poets write in free verse, but this doesn’t mean they aren’t also paying close attention to the form of their poetry. Look for elements such as alliteration, assonance, repetition, enjambment (the breaking of poetic lines), and rhythm in free verse poetry just as you would in more formally structured poetry.

, This is particularly important for poems such as dramatic monologues, where the speaker is definitely ‘’not’’ supposed to be the poet. Felicia Hemans, Robert Browning, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson all wrote dramatic monologues from the points of view of characters very different than themselves.


Identifying the speaker can be trickier in lyric poetry, such as the type written by poets like Wordsworth or John Keats, because these poems are often written in first-person but don’t make a clear distinction between the speaker and the poet. Nevertheless, even in poems that are written using first-person pronouns like “I”, always refer to the speaker as the speaker, not the poet.

, Just as with prose writing, symbolism shows up all the time in poetry. Be on the lookout for repeated elements, especially things like colors or natural imagery.


For example, in William Wordsworth’s poem “Tintern Abbey,” the eye is an important symbol that represents many things, including the poet’s imagination. Wordsworth will often play on the similarity of sound between I and eye, further relating the two concepts.
Symbolism is all over the place in the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. One key symbol is the hall of Heorot, King Hrothgar’s great golden mead-hall. Heorot symbolizes community, bravery, warmth, safety, wealth, and civilization, so when Grendel invades Heorot and murders warriors in their sleep there, he’s violating everything about the Scyldings’ lives.

, Just make sure you know the basics such as structure of the poem, themes, and overarching idea or story.


It can sometimes be helpful to memorize a key line or two from a poem so that you can use it as evidence. For example, if you’re studying Walt Whitman’s huge poem Leaves of Grass, you might want to memorize the short phrase “dismiss whatever insults your own soul; and your very flesh shall be a great poem.” This short quotation encapsulates much of the meaning from the larger text, and being able to drop it into an exam will help you support your claims.

, Context is just as important for poetry as it is for fiction or drama. Knowing what types of issues the poet may have been addressing can help you understand the goal of the poetry.


Contextual information can also be useful in keeping you from making incorrect statements about poems. For example, it’s important to know that Shakespeare’s sonnets are not all written to female lovers, even though that was the standard for sonnets of the era. In fact, most of them are written to a “fair youth,” a wealthy young man to whom the poet has some sort of deep, possibly romantic, attraction."
"
Re-read passages you don’t understand.,
Avoid skimming material.,
Read passages aloud.,
Make flash cards.",How to Study English Literature5," Particularly in poetry, authors may use language unconventionally in order to make a more powerful impact on the reader. This can be confusing at first, but re-reading the passage slowly and carefully will reward your attention.Look for footnotes and other aids. Often in books edited for a student audience, the editors will include explanatory footnotes, word definitions, and other aids that can help you grasp what’s going on. Don’t ignore these! They can really help clear up confusing passages.

, Especially if you’re reading poetry or plays, reading everything is very important. Skipping things such as stage directions in a Shakespeare play can mean you miss out on crucial information. Language in poems is precisely chosen and structured to have a particular effect, so missing even a word or two could damage your understanding of the whole text.

, This technique works especially well with poetry and plays, but it can also work for long, dense passages of prose in a novel, especially if it’s something like a Charles Dickens novel where sentences can run to a full paragraph. Reading the language aloud will help point out elements such as rhythm, alliteration, and repetition, which are all things that your exam may ask you to speak about.

, If you’re having trouble remembering things, make yourself some flash cards. Sometimes, the transfer of material from one medium to another (e.g., from written notes to flash cards) will help you learn it more effectively.


Flash cards are especially helpful for memorizing things such as literary terms and character names. They may be less helpful for remembering more complex information.

Purchase a well-translated version.,
Refrain from forcing yourself to read.,
Review the book when you’re relaxed.,
Consult a study aid.",How to Read Les Miserables1," Les Miserables has many different translated versions. Choose one that suits your needs for reading and that has been accurately translated.


In general, academic versions of Les Mis will offer the best translations with useful annotations. You can usually purchase these at specialty bookstores and even online retailers.;
, You can make reading Les Mis a chore by forcing yourself to read it either out of personal or societal expectations. Avoid pressuring yourself and you will be able to truly enjoy reading this work about imperial France and redemption.Keep the book available around your home or office. This may encourage you to pick it up if you’re bored or instead of watching TV.Take Les Mis with you on vacation, to a pool or amusement park, or on your morning commute. Having the book with you can entertain you when you’re bored or need a distraction.

, Steer clear of reading when you are stressed or in a hurry. Reading Les Mis when you’re relaxed may help you enjoy the story more.Studies have shown that a positive and relaxing environment can motivate you to read.For example, keep your copy of Les Mis next to your bed. This will allow you to reach for it before you go to sleep.Or, make a date with yourself to bring it to the coffee shop on Saturday morning and read as you sip a cappuccino.

, If you are having a hard time getting through Les Mis because it deals with complex historical events, consider consulting a study aid to help you get through the book. This may help you understand the text and its topics as well as actually enjoy the book.Most major works of literature have study aids with annotated comments that can explain difficult sections of the book. CliffsNotes, Shmoop, and Masterplots can help you unpack the harder thematic and historical elements.
You may also want to peruse a history textbook to provide you with vital context on imperial France, which can also help you to better understand Les Mis. Mark Traugott's The Insurgent Barricade provides a fascinating look at the origins of Parisian barricades and how they were used in political rebellions.Discuss any difficulties with your instructor or friend. They may be able to suggest effective ways to get through the book.

Study the cast list.,
Skim the play.,
Read the play out loud with a friend.,
Watch an adaptation.,
Record each character’s motivations.,
Map out the stage directions on a piece of paper.,
Reread the play.",How to Read the Classics2," The cast list comes at the very beginning of the play before the first scene. It will show the characters in the play as well as their relationships to one another. It may even provide a brief line on their motivations or role in the play. Learning the cast list before you begin can help you keep track of different characters as they appear throughout the play., Before you do anything, you should skim the play. Plays do not take long to read, but they only provide dialogue and a few stage directions. There is little interior thought, and it may be hard to grasp the motivations of each character. Skimming quickly through the text at first can help you learn the plot of the play.


During this brief read-through, you should look up any words, terms, or directions you do not know. This will make later readings easier to follow., Assign parts so that you and a friend (or multiple friends) each have a part. Read the words out loud to each other. Add emotion, inflection, and bravado to make it fun. You may even act out the movement. This will help you understand the action and the emotion of the play.

, Plays are meant to be heard and seen, not read. After reading through the play once, you may want to watch a version of the play, either on television or live on the stage. You will see how the actors have interpreted the words, motivations, and actions. Props and movements will help you imagine the play more vividly., Unlike a novel, the character’s inner thoughts and motivations may not be instantly recognizable. As you take notes, question each character’s motivations. Why are they doing what they are doing? Point to places in the text that demonstrate these motives.

, Plays all have some kind of scene direction. Shakespearean plays have minimal direction while twentieth century plays may have abundant direction. Draw a rectangle on a piece of paper to represent a stage. Draw circles for each character, and map their movement through the scene. This can help you visualize where characters are going, who they are speaking to, and when they enter/exit., Once you have seen the play or mapped out its movements, you should read the play one last time. You will probably have a firm grasp on what is going on and how events are unfolding. Now, you can read it for meaning and themes. Your visualization of the text may be much stronger."

Identify the genre or form of the poem.,
Read it out loud.,
Listen to a recitation.,
Tap out the meter.,
Mark rhyme scheme.,
Consider the title of the poem.",How to Read the Classics3," Different genres of poetry follow different conventions. If you can identify the poem’s genre before reading, you will be able to follow its structure, narrative, themes and meter with greater ease. There are many different genres of poetry, but many classics will fall into a particular form.



Epic Poetry: A long narrative poem that describes heroic or mythological events. Example: The Odyssey by Homer

Sonnet: a poem of fourteen lines. Sonnets typically are Petrarchan (two stanzas of four lines each plus one stanza of six lines) or English (three stanzas of four lines and a stanza with two lines). Example: “Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer’s Day? (Sonnet 18)” by William Shakespeare

Ballad: a folk tale told in song, typically taken from oral tradition. Example: “The Ballad of Chevy Chase”

Free verse: poems that do not have any identifiable meter, rhyme, or form. Example: “Song of Myself” by Walt Whitman, Reading aloud can help you figure out the sounds of the poem while increasing your comprehension of it. Recite the poem in a slow but natural voice. You do not have to pause at the end of every line. As you do so, try to note where you are naturally pausing.What words are you emphasizing?
Does the poem sound lyrical, or are there abrupt breaks in the verse?
Which sounds repeat through the poem? What kind of effect does this create?

, If you are having trouble listening to your own voice, you can find a recording of the poem where an actor or poet recites the verse. Pay attention to where they are pausing and how they are emphasizing each word. Does the sound of the poem have any particular effect on how you interpret it?

, Many poems have an established meter. This means that there is a certain number of stressed and unstressed syllables in every line. See if you can identify which syllables are strongly pronounced (stressed) and which are lightly pronounced (unstressed). Stressed syllables are those that are pronounced with emphasis while unstressed are pronounced quickly with no emphasis. Count the number of syllables in the line. Recite the line slowly, tapping along to your words. A hard tap should signal a stressed syllable while a light tap signifies an unstressed syllable.


For example, in the line “If music be the food of love, play on,” the stressed syllables are bolded and the unstressed are not.
Mark stressed syllables with a / or a ^.
Mark unstressed syllables with an x or a u.
Be aware that free verse poems have no meter.

, Many forms of poem have distinct patterns of rhyme. The rhyme scheme will usually be somewhat consistent through the poem. Assign a letter to every type of rhyme, and use that letter to mark every time that rhyme is used.


For example in Alfred, Lord Tennyson’s poem “In Memoriam,” the following stanza has an ABBA rhyme scheme: “To-night ungather'd let us leave/This laurel, let this holly stand:/We live within the stranger's land,/And strangely falls our Christmas-eve.” The A rhyme signifies that “leave” and “eve” rhyme while the B rhyme marks that “stand” and “land” rhyme.

, Sometimes the title of the poem can give away what it is about. If the poem itself seems ambiguous and obscure, reread the title for clues. You may be surprised at what the poem is actually saying. Locate imagery in the poem that connects it to its title.

"
Research the historical period and the author.,
Obtain a brief overview of the work of literature.,
Choose a modern translation of the book with annotations.,
Research recent literary critiques on the text.,
Identify figurative language and imagery.",How to Read the Classics4," You may find a book confusing, especially if it was written more than a hundred years before you were born. You can do research on the historical context to find out more about the book itself. You should also search for the author's biography. This may help you understand what events are occurring in the narrative or why the characters do the things that they do.

, If you struggle with reading classic works, especially historical works, you can find a brief summary on the internet. This will help you process the difficult language as you work your way through the novel. It can also help you with understanding symbolism, imagery, allusions, foreshadowing, and other literary devices.

, Classics were generally written in the distant past. They may contain phrases or words that are no longer used, and their sentences can be long and confusing. Annotated books may have updated the spellings of the original text, and they will have plentiful notes to help guide your reading.

, Literary scholars are trained to understand books critically. You can gain keen insight on a text by researching what critics and scholars have to say on the matter. They can explain the historical context, provide a biography of the author, and connect motifs to philosophical theories. By getting someone else's opinion through a critique, you can obtain a better analysis of the book.


Don’t be afraid to disagree with literary critics. Reading their analyses are supposed to help you think more critically about the book. You should not accept anything they say blindly.

, As you begin reading classic literature, pay attention what is being described. You may find that the language is vague, but you can discover what it means. Literature often uses figurative language to signify something other than its literal meaning. Knowing what literary devices are being used can help you interpret the text.Metaphor: a phrase that describes one thing by comparing it to something else or by referring to something entirely different. For example, the phrase “an elephant in the room” signifies that somebody is ignoring an important problem.

Hyperbole: an extreme exaggeration. “Her eyes were as big as dinner plates” is hyperbole.

Allusion: a reference to another work of art, person or event. The title of the novel Ulysses by James Joyce is an allusion to The Odyssey.


Metonymy: a word that has associations with a larger institution but is used to signify the whole. For example, the White House is metonymy for the US Presidency.

Irony: a phrase that should signify one thing but actually means the opposite. It may also represent a situation where things occur differently than anticipated. In Samuel Coleridge’s Rime of the Ancient Mariner, “Water, water, everywhere,/Nor any drop to drink” is an example of irony.

Create a work plan.,
Begin reading the book as soon as possible.,
Break up the book into manageable pieces.,
Employ “gutting” strategies.,
Write notes as you read.",How to Read Les Miserables2," If you feel overwhelmed by Les Mis or don’t enjoy reading, develop a plan to tackle the assignment. This can help you strategically get through the assignment.There are different ways to develop a plan for tackling your reading assignment. For example, if you have three weeks to read this 1500-page tome, you can divide it into a set of daily readings of 71.5 pages.
You could also allot each chapter of the book a specified amount of time. That can help you not get mired on one part of story.For example, you could aim to read one chapter a day, or multiple chapters if they are shorter.
Give yourself breaks to refresh your brain and recharge your batteries., It is never too early to start required reading. This can minimize your stress and help you retain information. It may also help you enjoy the book more.Read for 30-60 minutes a day to help you get through Les Mis in a more effective manner.

, Reading shorter and more manageable sections can help you successfully finish your required reading. This can ensure that you get through every section of the reading, even if it’s not enjoyable.Pace yourself by not exceeding the allotted time for each chapter. This can motivate you to get through the text., People who read a lot of texts, including academics, use techniques to quickly “gut”—or get the most important information—from reading assignments. Learning how to gut Les Mis may help you more effectively and enjoyably get through the book.The most important sections of any text are generally the introduction and the conclusion, or the first few and final chapters. Make sure to read these thoroughly and then skim through the remainder of the text for important details.
In many cases, just reading the first page of a novel can give you a general idea of a book’s subject.Skimming the book, which is the equivalent of reading about 450 words a minute, can help you get the important plot points of the book without focusing on language, character development or minor themes.You may also want to use a study aid that provides plot summaries to help you distinguish what you should read, skim, and simply skip.
You can get a grasp on the plot from a study aid and then skim for important literary devices such as dialogue or imagery.

, Keep notes on the book while you’re reading Les Mis. You may need to recall the information for a class or another juncture. By taking notes as you read, you can construct a built-in study aid.


Taking notes is a delicate balancing act between getting too little and too much information. Don’t write down everything you read, only the most relevant information or details.
Write your notes by hand. Studies have shown that people retain information more effectively writing notes instead of typing them in to a computer or recording them on a device."

Rely on media other than books.,
Suggest it for your book club.,
Listen to the Les Mis audiobook.,
Take your time.",How to Read Les Miserables3," Les Miserables comes in many different forms than just the novel. It’s popularity has spurred musicals, plays, and movies.

Talk to your teacher about study sheets or guides for the exam.",How to Pass a Literature Quiz Without Reading the Actual Material1," Many literature courses will hold class discussions on key topics or themes in the assigned text. If you took notes during these discussions, refer to them to help you study for the literature exam.


Often, detailed class notes can help you identify possible exam questions. Your teacher may even remind you to highlight certain quotes from the assigned text in preparation for the exam.;
, Reach out to any friends in the class who can help you study for the exam. They may offer to lend you their detailed class notes or recommend certain themes and details you should keep in mind for the exam.


You can also agree to a study sessions with a friend who has completed the assigned readings in exchange for dinner or a coffee. Often, discussing the assigned text out loud with a knowledgeable friend can help you remember key points of the text.

, Your teacher may provide study sheets or guides for the literature exam that can help you get a sense of what to expect. Your classmates may also be able to provide a study sheet that contains quotes or passages of the text that you can then refer to when you write the exam.

Will the students do anything differently as a result of the course? Whether the final goal is to rewire a home or write a screenplay, knowing what students are expected to learn will ensure the required topics are included.
Include sufficient time to accomplish the objectives. The larger the goal, the more time required. Be realistic about the requirements and timeline.
Ensure the outcome is measurable. Either a student can solve the algebra problem with the provided instruction or they cannot.;
, Learning is generally divided into three domains: cognitive, psychomotor, and affective. Attempt to diversify the lesson plan objectives to be as inclusive as possible. Most education should probably include varying amounts of each so as to reach students’ more comprehensively.Cognitive lesson plans are thinking lesson plans. Students should be tasked with objectives that challenge their ability to recall and understand data, apply that knowledge towards a result, then analyze and evaluate it sufficiently that new branches of the concept can be created.
Affective lesson plans deal with students’ emotion, how they receive, reply, and categorize stimuli in a learning environment. Affective growth can be beneficial and accomplished in all disciplines, particularly where self-discipline and appreciation for teamwork can be utilized to improve self-worth and self-confidence.
Psychomotor learning is the physical ability to perform a skill requiring practice.Lesson plan objectives can be anything from simple imitation (i.e. monkey see, monkey do) to articulate, precise movements requiring great skill, speed, and timing., There is no perfect teaching or learning style, and each person learns their own way. Knowing which method works best for your students could improve their understanding and ultimate competency.Visual learners may benefit from being closer to a less wordy presentation. Something with video, vibrant illustrations, or an in-class demonstration would be superb.Lectures will likely benefit auditory learners. Verbal interaction, even with oneself, aids with retention. Be sure to alternate speech patterns to keep the students interested.
Kinesthetic, which means “the sensation of movement or strain in muscles”, is the physical manner in which most people begin to learn as babies and young children. A great idea of kinesthetic arithmetic lessons would be to set up students as sellers and buyers, providing them with enough faux-money to pay for items and receive change.

, The outline should contain the subject matter to be taught, the format by which it will be taught, and the sequence. Be sure to align outline details with the desired outcome and timeline of the class.

, Determine which portions of the lesson plan and which objectives will require presentations, which will be hands-on, etc.


If the objective is for students to understand a play's plot, they may benefit from acting out or watching portions of the play.
Striving for affective growth could be an objective accomplished through heated but cordial debate on a controversial, historical event.
Perhaps a see-saw could be used for a kinesthetic physics lesson. Write the objective to display the outcomes of adding more force or mass to one side of the see-saw.

, Determine what the students currently know, then work on the steps required for coherency.Large objectives can be broken down into daily objectives to reinforce the overall objective. Some objectives can be skipped if the students already comprehend the concept.

, Whether you prefer pop-quizzes and weekly tests (i.e. formative), or comprehensive exams (i.e. summative), including assessments is paramount to the lesson plan objectives. Without measurement of some kind, it’s nearly impossible to determine if the students are learning.


Use minor objectives that help build towards the final, major objective. The evaluation may not necessarily be a test given to students.
Allow enough time for modification based on evaluations. If your students are struggling, it would be wise to alter lesson plans and objectives to either reinforce the concept through alternate instruction, or review the material already presented., Structuring the objectives in a specific manner may more concisely breakdown what is desired. Try to follow a few basic practices such as the examples below:


Ensure objectives clarify final results instead of instruction type.Use action verbs (e.g. compare, contrast, align, categorize) that demonstrate what students are being asked to do.Avoid vague action verbs that do not effectively convey the requirements. Verbs such as ""learn"" do not really provide much guidance.

, Determining if your state follows Common Core State Standards or not is an instrumental step to lesson plan objective creation. Some states follow all standards, others follow only the English Language Arts & Literacy portion, and a few do not follow Common Core at all. Follow your state's lead and promote the current philosophical teaching practice., Whether your location adheres to the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards (NBPTS) or some other organization's standards, utilize the accepted guidelines to ensure your objectives are professional, holistic, and support common standards., Local students may require specific types of instruction. Question local leaders, administrators, and peers regarding and school requirements exterior to aforementioned practices and standards.

, The objective should be something possible with available material; so, create the required list (e.g. book numbers, pictures, A/V equipment). If the ultimate lesson plan objective is to accomplish something that can't be done with the materials on-hand, change the objective.

, Handouts are standardized because you produce them, and each student has an equal starting point in terms of understanding the expectations and objectives. Further, they serve as a handy way for the students to build a reference file with examples for future reference.

, The lesson plan objective should be engaging, something the students want to achieve. Encourage them by showing how something can be done visually.

Research the material online.,
Read online discussions that contain quotes or passages from the material.,
Look up other texts about the material at the library.,
Watch a film or television version of the material.",How to Pass a Literature Quiz Without Reading the Actual Material2," Use the internet to your advantage and do a search of the novel title to read a summary of the material online. Be wary of poor online sources and look for educational sources or information from a trusted study source.Keep in mind you should not copy any information online word for word in your exam. Use the information about the book online to help you get an overall picture of the plot points, the main characters, and the main themes of the book. You can then use this information to answer the exam questions.
Look for online resources that are known study websites and have a detailed breakdown of the text. You can also use the online resources to pick out key themes and terms from the book that you can then use as search terms to find more information on them. This information will likely be useful when you write the exam.

, When you do an online search of the material, focus on reading notes and comments that contain quotes or passages from the assigned text. This will allow you to get a sense of the tone, language, and style of the assigned text, which will likely be useful in your exam. Doing this will allow you to read small amounts of the assigned text, rather than the entire text.

, Head to your school library and do a search for reference articles or texts about the assigned text. Often, there will be scholarly articles on themes or characters in the text, as well as shorter texts that contain a synopsis of the book. This will give you a fundamental understanding of the material and reference points you can use in your exam.

, Depending on the assigned text, you may be able to find a film or television version of the book. However, some film or television adaptations may change around certain elements of the original book and you could end up viewing a version that deviates from the text.


You can check online to see if a television or film version of the film is available, as well as at your school library. Make sure you compare a synopsis of the text with the synopsis of the film or television adaptation to check for any discrepancies. You do not want to summarize a film version of Crime and Punishment in your exam, for example, that includes a drastic ending change. You may have to view several different film or television versions to find one that is close to the events in the book.

Read the questions carefully on a multiple choice exam.,
Budget your time and create an outline for an essay exam.,
Prepare your ideas and statements before you take an oral exam.",How to Pass a Literature Quiz Without Reading the Actual Material3," Though it may be difficult to do well on a literature exam with multiple choice questions if you have not read the assigned text, you can use certain methods to improve your chances of doing well. It's important that you take your time and read each question carefully to ensure you understand what the question is asking and to find possible clues or hints within the question.


Look for qualifiers in the question. Qualifiers are words that alter a statement, such as ""always"", ""most"", ""equal"", ""good"" or ""bad"". You may be given a statement that has a qualifier and asked if it is true or false, such as: ""Raskolnikov is always angry at the world in Crime and Punishment."" The qualifier ""always"" makes this statement false as it is too extreme and unlikely to be true.
You should also look for negatives in a question. Negatives are words like ""no"", ""not"", ""none"" and ""never"", as well as prefixes like ""il-"" (illogical), ""un-"" (uninterested) or ""im-"" (impatient). Remember that a prefix is the same as ""not"", so illogical means ""not logical"", for example, and impatient means ""not patient"". You may be given a question like: ""What does Raskolnikov do that is illogical in Crime and Punishment?"" The question is really asking, ""What does Raskolnikov do that is not logical in Crime and Punishment?""
Use grammatical clues in the question and/or the multiple choice options. Try to eliminate multiple choice options that do not make sense grammatically, even though they may contain correct information. For example, you may have a question like:
In Crime and Punishment, Raskolnikov commits his awful crime:
a. due to madness
b. because he is from Russia
c. there is no justice in his world
d. as a result of a young student's speech in a bar


Answer option (c) is missing a connecting phrase and is not grammatically correct when placed after the beginning of the statement. As well, answer (b) has no connection to the ""crime"" in question. You can then eliminate these two options and are now left with option (a) and option (d).

, If you are heading into an essay exam, you may have limited time to write the essay. Focus on maximizing your time by brainstorming and creating an outline before you write the essay. You should do some online research about the assigned text before the exam to help you create an outline around the essay question.Be sure to read the essay question several times to ensure you understand what you are required to do in your essay. You should then brainstorm a thesis statement. Use your online research to help you create a thesis statement in response to the essay question.
You should then create an outline for the essay. You do not need to follow the five paragraph essay format, unless your teacher specifically asks for a five paragraph essay. Use your thesis statement as a guide for your essay and always include an introductory paragraph and a concluding paragraph. If you are not following the five paragraph essay format, you can write as many paragraph between your introduction and your conclusion as is necessary to explore your thesis statement.

, If you need to take an oral exam for your literature class, you should always prepare a few days before the exam, even if you have not read the assigned text. Use your online research or a study guide provided by a classmate to help you prepare for the oral exam. Being prepared for the oral exam will help you do well, even if you did not read the assigned text.You should be prepared to lecture on the material. You will need to present your ideas clearly, give example from the text to support your ideas, compare different approaches or concepts in the text, and defend your ideas with eloquence and clarity. Begin by writing down your oral responses and practice them so you remember your responses and can recall them quickly.
Use a mirror or a blank wall to practice your oral presentation. You should speak clearly and confidently, using eye contact and not simply reading from your notes. If possible, you should also practice with your classmates or other students who are also preparing for an oral exam. Have your peers ask you questions that your teacher may ask you so you can practice your responses.

Learn their names.,
Associate them with what they are in charge of.,
Learn their symbols.,
Find out what they are supposed to look like.,
Watch a Greek mythology-themed movie.,
Read fiction books which are related to Greek mythology.",How to Know the Twelve Olympians of Greek Mythology," One of the simplest ways to make sure you know the Olympians is to just learn their names. Chant them, write them down, make up a rhyme, whatever works for you. The names of the gods and goddesses are:


Zeus
Poseidon
Hades
Hermes
Athena
Ares
Hephaestus
Aphrodite
Demeter
Hera
Apollo
Artemis;
, Each god or goddess had a whole list of things that they were in charge of, from wine to thieves. Learn some of the more interesting things that the gods were in charge of, and the names will come along with it. For example:



Zeus: King of all the Gods, ruler of Mount Olympus. He is the ruler of clouds, air, the atmosphere, thunder and lightning. He is known to be unfaithful to his wife, Hera, and have offspring with mortals disguised as a mortal himself.

Poseidon: God of the sea and creator of horses; he is known to cause earthquakes with his mighty symbol, which is the trident. He has a rivalry with his niece, Athena, which is elaborated in the Greek myth of how Athens got its name.

Hades: God of the Underworld. The Underworld is where the dead reside, and where most punishments from the gods and goddesses are located.

Hermes: God of thieves and messenger of the gods

Athena: Goddess of wisdom and battle strategy.

Ares: God of war and bloodshed.

Hephaestus: God of craftsmanship and fire.

Aphrodite: Goddess of love and beauty.

Demeter: Goddess of agriculture.

Hera: Queen of the gods and the goddess of weddings, family and motherhood.

Apollo: God of the sun, poetry, music, healing and prophecies.

Artemis: Goddess of the moon, hunting, and animals

, All of the gods had symbols that they used to represent themselves.Zeus: The eagle, thunderbolt, and royal scepter

Poseidon: The trident, dolphins, and horses

Hades: Black helm, skulls or ghosts

Hermes: Winged sandals and caduceus

Athena: Owl and the olive tree

Ares: Vultures, venomous snakes, crossed spears or the boar.

Hephaestus: The hammer, tongs, and an anvil

Aphrodite: Dove, apple, scallop shell and myrtle wreath

Demeter: The cornucopia

Hera: The peacock

Artemis: The bow and arrow and moon, the color silver

Apollo: The laurel wreath

, Study the remaining ancient sculptures or paintings inspired by the Olympians. Do your research on the internet and in libraries to figure out how they are portrayed and what they look like. For example, Aphrodite is always portrayed as a young, beautiful girl.Demeter has long blonde hair and tanned skin, whilst her younger sister Hera has pale skin and liquorice black hair.

, Many movies focus on Greek mythology, and watching one or two may help you to easily learn the ""who's who"" of the Olympians and also be a lot more fun than written learning! Some simple ones to get into include Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief or Disney's Hercules.

, Examples include Percy Jackson and the Olympians or Heroes of Olympus, both written by Rick Riordan. Rick Riordan also released a book on the Twelve Olympians and a sum up of main events in mythology called Percy Jackson's Greek Gods, in which myths are discussed in a modern setting with sarcasm and humour, which would make it easier for it to be learned.

Understand why authors weave deeper meaning into stories.,
Do a little research.,
Do some research on the author.,
Mature.,
Look at the first sentence(s).,
Note any strong responses you have.,
Pay attention to what seems strange, unexpected, or otherwise ""off"" to you.,
Look at symbolism.,
Names are often Important.,
Look for themes.,
Piece the clues together.",How to Find Deeper Meaning in Literature," Authors often present deeper meanings in subtle ways, leaving the reader to have to really think about the story to discover the full meaning of the story. This is not done to be annoying; it is done to let the reader follow the story and use their own imagination and intellect. So that, the readers may feel connected to the plot.


This is not only in books, but in movies, music, and some television as well. And not just ""classics"" but in current media. This also happens throughout literature, from simple fairy tales to long adult novels. Meaning is all around, the same way literature is.
How do authors present deeper meaning? Authors usually are subtle in how they do this, but there are some typical ways:

Symbolism. An object, person, character, or idea in a book has a deeper meaning. For example, in the Chronicles of Narnia, Aslan the Lion is a figure representing Jesus Christ. Using symbolism helps readers look up at the world in a new way. Now, that's literature's beauty, isn't it?
The Protagonist's Journey. The protagonist of the book undergoes a trial and transformation. Harry Potter, for instance, grows as an individual through his adventures in Hogwarts.
Commentary. Often in a science fiction or fantasy world, the author presents a world that comments on ours. For example, ""The Hunger Games"" looks at high-stakes testing for children in a world in which a privileged class is the one that really benefits.

;
, Before beginning, try to find a context in which you can place the book, whether it is the 1600s, the 1980s, or 200 BC. Do some research on the culture and current events of the time, as well.


Geography matters. The world can be very different in technology, culture, and so on from one region of the world to another. What is true in 1940s Japan is not necessarily so in 2015.
Understand race, gender, and ethnicity in your time period. It may be difficult to understand why characters act the way they do if you do not know how factors such as these play out in a novel's setting. For example:

A woman in 1960's America would not report sexual harassment in a company. Things such as a boss saying overly sexual things to a secretary would not be unusual and often was expected.
A homosexual person only 30 years ago would likely be labelled mentally ill.


A little knowledge of the Jazz Age is essential to understanding The Great Gatsby, for instance. The Depression in America has to be understood to understand a story set in the 1930s.

, Learning about the author helps shed some light on his or her world-view. While the writing of an author often echoes the writer's ""truth"", knowing his or her biography will help make it clear. Typically, a quick Wikipedia search will turn up a lot of information.


For example, learning that J.R.R. Tolkien served in the armed forces in World War I will shed some light on how he understood the horrors of war.
Much of William Shakespeare's life is unknown. However, we do know he lived in an age where both Christianity and magic (such as ghosts and magic spells) were accepted realities. His writings reflect this.

, Understanding the deeper meaning of literature through higher thought processes such as symbolism requires a certain amount of brain development. This does not typically occur until age 12 or so. While younger readers can and do make connections, this higher-level thinking is typically not consistent until the junior high or high school.

, Not always, but most often, the first sentence is crucial in understanding the story. Take a look at these two introductions, for instance: ""It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness..."" gives an entirely different impression than ""Mother died today."" Think about a few things when you are examining the first sentence:


How does this statement make me feel?
What sort of person must be saying this?
What kind of mood does this evoke?

, If something in the book disgusts you, it was probably intended to do so. Take a look at your emotional responses, if you have any. Were you offended by something in the book? Why might the author have included that? Are they criticizing someone? Are they criticizing society's attitude toward the thing?

, Why would you insult someone while proposing marriage to them? Why would a church, which should be pristine, be described as grimy? Why is the ugly hunchback the one with the most deep statements? Often when an author challenges expectations, they mean to draw attention to something. They might be foreshadowing or taking a close look at what society has already labeled.

, Using symbols, authors often get messages across that give a deeper message than is seen at the surface. These are typically along themes, such as good versus evil, nature versus mankind, maturing into adulthood, or the like.


Not everything in a piece of writing is necessarily a symbol. Sometimes a dog is white because the author had a childhood dog that was white, for instance, without any deeper meaning.
Symbols are different from culture to culture. For example, in much of Europe, bats are traditionally considered evil beings of the night, while in China they are considered good luck.

, Authors are often (although not always) very significant.


Example: In ""The Great Gatsby"" the name Daisy signify apparent purity (white petals) hiding a corrupted heart (center of the flower is yellow)?
In the ""Harry Potter"" series, J.K. Rowling often makes names important. Sirius Black's name indicates his dark canine nature. (The star ""Sirius"" is nicknamed ""The Dog Star"").

, Are certain words, ideas, or imagery coming up repeatedly?


In Macbeth, time is referenced repeatedly.
In The Stranger, light is mentioned many times. Usually themes will contribute to the greater meaning.
In the ""Narnia"" series, Christian themes are throughout the books, mostly good versus evil, but also the idea of a savior of the world.

, Once you've read through a piece of literature, look at all the things you noted and try to see how they might fit together to create a deeper meaning. Then you can try to match what you've come up with to the author's own life story and see if they parallel somehow. Take your time. There are really no wrong answers so long as you can reinforce your conclusion with details from the work.


It is OK if you cannot do this yourself, as that is what book discussion and a good literature moderator is for. Even expert readers do not always pick up on everything.
This often takes practice, especially if you are just starting out. As you get more experienced, you will likely be able to pick up on things more quickly.

Pair their reading interests with the classics.,
Share your own favorites with enthusiasm.,
Listen attentively to their literary interests.,
Introduce your teen to classic literature through film and television adaptations.,
Help your teen start a book club with friends.,
Lead your teen towards novels with themes relevant to their life.",How to Encourage a Teen to Read Classic Literature1," If your teen enjoys reading outside of the cannon, ask them what they are reading and why they like it, then talk about a work of classic literature you enjoy that explores similar topics.Present them with that book and say something encouraging, such as, “The way you were talking about vampires in Twilight yesterday reminded me of Bram Stoker’s Dracula. Here’s the copy that I read when I was your age. I would be curious to hear what you think about it.”;
, Describe your favorite scene from a classic you’re encouraging them to read. Giving them specific details can entice them to read it themselves.

, If you listen attentively as they talk about their favorite book, they will likely become more receptive to your suggestions.

, Classic novels have the distinction of being constantly adapted for film and TV series. Encouraging a teen to watch a film based on a classic novel might help to introduce them to relevant and recognizable themes in the work, which may make the task of reading it less daunting.It can be exciting to have both read a book and watched its film version; few teenagers can resist smugly asserting that the book was better when their peers discuss the film version.
Some prominent examples of films based on classic literature include William Wyler's adaptation of Wuthering Heights, John Huston's version of Moby-Dick, and Robert Mulligan's version of To Kill a Mockingbird.

Keep in mind that there are many films that borrow loosely from a classic novel rather than adapting it directly. For example, Coppola's Apocalypse Now is based loosely on Conrad's Heart of Darkness. The 2001 comedy Bridget Jones's Diary is a loose adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. If a teen already enjoys these kinds of films, you may be able to encourage them to read the novels that inspired them.

, They can read the book, then watch the film adaptation, then do a fun activity connected to the book’s plot (cooking, playing baseball, etc)., By leading teens towards novelists who dealt with issues they are likely to be facing - social pressures, bodily anxiety, ""fitting in"" - you may be able to spark their interest in the broader body of classic literature.For example, teens reading Dickens' Hard Times may have difficulty applying material about 19th century poverty to their lives. However, they might find the themes of social pressure and anxiety in Salinger's Catcher in the Rye much more applicable.

Teach by example.,
Create an encouraging reading environment.,
Encourage them to take an online quiz.,
Turn reading into a social game.,
Try the 16 before 16 challenge.,
Make frequent trips to the library with your teen.,
Take your teen to the bookstore.",How to Encourage a Teen to Read Classic Literature2," If your teen sees you curled up with a book, it is more likely they will pursue reading themselves. Talk enthusiastically about the books you are reading. You can create an association between reading and pleasure by simply demonstrating your own genuine enthusiasm for books., Television and radios that are constantly on can dull attention spans and discourage attentive reading. Make sure your teen has a lamp that makes reading in bed comfortable. Provide them with a bookshelf for their room and encourage them to collect books. Even if teens aren't reading the classics, a conducive home environment will help them to build the literary foundation for approaching those works later.

, There are several quizzes with titles such as “Which classic book would be perfect for me?” Involving siblings and friends can help turn this into a fun game. These quizzes are appealing to teens because activities that help them discover “who they are” are particularly interesting to them., Wrap 10 classic novels and write catchy summaries of the plot on the kraft paper. Invite a handful of your teen’s friends over and ask them to choose one. (Have a few extra in case they are disappointed by what they chose.) The first three teens to finish their book get a prize., Your teen must race against time to read 16 classics before they turn 16. If they succeed, they get a prize, something they would really love. This works especially well if the student has siblings and it becomes a family tradition., Libraries often have summer challenges that encourage youth to read with prizes and competitions. Reading will likely become more exciting for your teen if they’ve set a goal to read a certain number of books over the summer.


Get involved with your local libraries. Public libraries and school libraries often rely on very tight budgets. When libraries are faced with this minuscule funding, they often focus on reference books at the expense of classic novels. Make an effort to help fund your local libraries (including your teen's school library).

, Libraries and school textbooks often can't offer attractive editions of classic works, but publishers are increasingly paying more attention to book design as they compete with digital book formats. Take your teen to bookstores in your area; they may be inclined to approach classic novels with the help of eye-catching book jackets and cover designs.

Insert a section addressing federal privacy law, if applicable.",How to Write a Syllabus," Word processing software like Microsoft Word is usually the best place to create a syllabus. This is because word processing software will give you the appropriate tools you need to create and format your syllabus.


If you have specific requirements for layouts, margins, and font types for your students’ papers and assignments, you should use the same for your syllabus.
Make sure your word processing software has the ability to save as a .pdf. This way, you’ll be able to share a non-editable version of your syllabus with your students.;
, The first step in creating your syllabus is to put your identification information at the top of the document. Identification information will tell students (and parents) everything they need to know about you, your office and room, and the title of the course.


Type the title of your course at the top of the document. You can follow this by (next to or underneath) the semester, year, and section number of the course.
Underneath the title, add your name (with title). It will appear like: Dr. James F. Clarke.
Put your class location and meeting times.
Insert your contact information like your office number and office hours, email address, and office phone number (if you have one).
Place your room number and/or office number under your contact information.
Depending on style, institutional, and regional customs, you can move information around.
You can choose whether to center, align right, or align left your identification information., Your course description will describe your course in a way that gives students (and parents) an idea about the general content of your course. The point of a description is that someone will be able to read it and form a basic understanding of what your course covers.


Your course description should be a paragraph -- about 4 to 6 sentences in length.
It should introduce students to the course, its purpose, and scope, and describe who should take the class.
Briefly describe the type of content your students will learn. For instance, if your class is an American history survey course, explain how they'll be learning about the period from the Civil War to the present. Consider naming some major events or themes that you'll focus on in the course.
Consult your department or institution to see if they have a template course description for a given course. They'll likely have one if you're teaching a survey course that is offered frequently., Course objectives will give students a sense of what they will accomplish while in the class. Objectives might be specific in that they’ll learn a certain amount of content, or they might be general in that they’ll develop skills while in the class. In order to create a course objective, ask yourself some questions about the class including:


What will students learn taking this course? If students will gain specific content needed as a prerequisite for another course or program, state it here.
What skills will they develop? If they'll be learning how to analyze and synthesize information, say so.
What questions will they be able to answer? If your course focuses on major problems or questions in a certain field or subfield, mention those here., Prerequisites are courses, content, or other qualifications a student must have to take the course for credit. If the course has any prerequisites, list them near the top of the syllabus.


Include the formal name of courses that are prerequisites.
Make sure to include course numbers and course IDs.
If your class is a graduate level course, make sure to note whether undergraduates can take the course for some sort of credit. Consult your department for more information., You also need to include a list of all of the materials needed for your course. While this list might include books, it could also include hardware, software, art supplies, and more. All materials that are required to take the course should be on this list.


Provide students with the name, author, year, and International Standard Book Number (“ISBN”) of the textbook or other assigned texts. the book.
Don’t list materials required by every class, such as notebooks, paper, or pens.
A good rule of thumb is to include any materials not common to other classes, such as a scientific calculator, software, or drafting tools.
If materials are expensive or hard to come by, provide a recommended source for them.

, You also need to provide a statement about the format and organization of the course very close to the start of the syllabus. This statement will tell students how course content will be delivered, how and/or where the class will meet, and what is expected of students in terms of attendance.


Mention how the course is taught (through lectures, labs, or online video lectures).
Note what type of assignments will be given (quizzes, discussion boards, or lab assignments).
Depending on your style and/or the customs of your institution, you may want to include this in your course description., You also need to include a section on your evaluation and grading policy. This section of a syllabus tells students how the major components of the class contribute to their final grade.


Many institutions have specific rules about what should be included in this section, so check with the administrator or department for guidelines on what must be included.
Include your grading scale. For instance, an A equates to a 90% to 100%, a B equates to an 80% to 89%, and so on and so forth.
Explain how assignments will be weighted in order to determine final grades. For instance, exams make up 40% of the total grade, the term paper makes up 30% of the grade, and projects and/or homework make up the remaining 30%.
Provide a statement about any other grade policies, such as if you drop the lowest test or quiz grade.
You may want to also include a definitive statement on your extra credit policy. If you don’t provide extra credit, state it explicitly., Immediately after the evaluation policy section, you should include a section that details your assignment policy. This will give students an idea of how late, missed, or incomplete assignments will affect them and impact their grade.


Include an explicit statement about makeup exams.
Make sure to address your policy about late papers. For example, some teachers or professors like to take a letter grade off per day for papers that are late.
If missing a test or not completing an assignment will substantially impact a student’s grade and make it impossible for them to pass, you should mention this here., A course calendar is possibly the most important part of a good syllabus. Your calendar or schedule will outline how where the class will be, content and assignment wise, throughout the semester (or year).


The calendar may provide a daily breakdown of all lecture topics.
List written assignments on the day they will be assigned and on the day they are due.
List the assignment dates of all readings (from the textbook, other texts, and electronic materials)., Course policies may include rules, and behavioral and academic expectations. This section will give your students a good idea of how they need to conduct themselves while in your classroom or while engaging in coursework.


Many colleges and universities have specific policies and statements that must be included in this section of the syllabus, so check with the appropriate educational institution for guidelines.
Attendance Policy. Most educational institutions have a school wide attendance policy which you may want to include in your syllabus. If the course attendance policy differs from that of the university, you should also include this information.
Class Participation Policy. Describe exactly how students should participate and what their participation will mean to their grade.
Classroom Etiquette. Be sure to spell out the policy on eating and drinking in class, using a cell phone or laptop during class, talking to other students while the instructor is speaking, using an electronic device to record lectures, and proper procedure for arriving late or leaving early., Your institution (secondary or post-secondary) may offer learning support services to students. These support services are often intended to promote student success and may be available to students with or without disabilities.


Let your students know that they do not have to have a disability to take advantage of some learning support services.
If your institution has a learning resource center, mention it in your syllabus.
Your institution might require you to include language about learning support services – check with your administrators., One important section to include is a syllabus change policy. A syllabus change policy will let students know that you have the right to change the syllabus throughout the term of the course with advance notice given to students.


Your syllabus change policy covers schedule of topics, lectures, assignments, and readings.
Most institutions will require you to note that you may not make changes that substantially affect how a student will be evaluated during the course., Post-secondary institutions may require you to add language about their withdrawal or add/drop policy. The add/drop policy will let students know when they can drop the class without academic penalty.


Include the last day they can drop your course without penalty.
Include any other relevant information about your institution’s add/drop or withdrawal policy.
Consider including language about your institution’s first day attendance policy. If you’re at a college or university, they may require students to attend class on the first day or otherwise be dropped from the course., Most educational institutions will require that you include a cheating or plagiarism statement that addresses their honor code policy. In this event, your institution will provide you with a copy of their honor code.


They may even provide you with a boiler plate section to add to your syllabus.
You may need to include the honor code in full in your syllabus.
You may need to summarize the honor code in your syllabus., You be required to provide students with instructions for campus wide emergencies as well as building specific emergencies. These procedures might include:


What to do in the event of a lockdown.
Procedures in case there is a bomb threat.
Instructions on what to do if there is a fire., Federal law prohibits discrimination based on religion. As a result, many secondary and post-secondary institutions have adopted a religious observance policy that protects the ability of students to miss school for religious holidays.


You may want to add language letting your students know that their right to observe religious holidays is protected.
Let your students know that they should contact you in advance if they’re going to miss class or an assignment due to religious observance.
Include language so that your students know they can make up work missed due to religious observance., Federal law requires that public institutions provide accommodations to people with disabilities. Because of this, you need to include a section in your syllabus that addresses the ADA, and explains how your institution offers accommodations.


Very often, students need to register with counseling or a disability resource center.
The administration or the student may present documentation from the institution to the instructor.
Students should provide documentation of a recognized disability to the institution during the enrollment process or shortly thereafter., College and university instructors may want to include language explaining the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). FERPA governs the privacy of students and/or their parents, depending on age and the type of educational institution.


FERPA states that instructors and others at a postsecondary institution cannot discuss a student’s grades, status, or attendance with anyone without their expressed written permission.
FERPA applies to any student 18 or older, or any student attending a postsecondary institution.
Consider letting your students know that they have the right to waive their privacy rights if they sign a waiver.
For students under the age of 18 at secondary institutions, FERPA rights lie with their parents or legal guardians."

Adopt unit plans to create connections for your students.,
Diversify your instructional approach to help meet the needs of more students.,
Plan for longer periods of time so you're forced to pace yourself.,
Map units to provide yourself with clear guidelines.",How to Write a Unit Plan1," At its most basic level, unit planning ensures you are linking each lesson plan to the next. As you develop a unit plan you'll support key concepts and learning goals with a carefully mapped structure.


Use unit planning to weave key concepts and learning goals together over time and between or among disciplines.
Consider overlapping lessons with fellow instructors to provide longer spans of time for study and practice.;
, You may use unit plans within your specific course. Unit plans are also an excellent way to forge interdisciplinary connections. Developing a multi-lesson unit structure provides you with a framework for presenting overarching themes in a variety of ways. Students with diverse learning styles will benefit, and you will be able to explore different ways of teaching without veering off course or running short on time., Planning out several units over the course of a term, or even the entire year, will help you recognize what you can and cannot accomplish during a given period of time. Once you've recognized your limitations you can prioritize key concepts and learning goals., Understanding your broad goals gives you the freedom to have fun developing unique and engaging lessons that will help your students meet these goals.

"
"
Define your objectives.,
Follow a standard template for preparing a unit.,
Survey your resources.,
Study the state standards and become knowledgeable about the actual content/subject matter of your unit plan.,
List in sequential order the major concepts in outline form to be clear on what concepts you are planning to teach within a given time frame.,
Plan and create your assessment tools.,
Pick and choose the lessons.,
Have benchmarks in place.",How to Write a Unit Plan2," Writing a clear goal for each lesson and activity will help focus the learning of your students and your teaching.


For example, if you're planning a history unit on the Great Depression, you may want students to understand 1) the root causes of the Great Depression; 2) the efforts taken by Herbert Hoover to address the Depression; 3) the accomplishments of Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal; 4) challenges to the emerging New Deal order; and 5) the influence of World War II in ending the Depression.
Use these five goals to plan lessons and activities that will meet these goals.

, Normally, these begin with objectives, but also include standards addressed, materials, lessons, assessments, resources, and accommodations for all learners in the classroom.


The templates provided at the end of this article may be useful for course planning.

, Take some time to review what resources are already available to you. Often, there are good resources already in use and taking the time to use a previous lesson or learning methodology will save a lot of time in the long run. Consult experienced fellow teachers; many times they will be willing to share plans and ideas.

, Forty-two states and the District of Columbia use the Common Core State Standards, with Alaska, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Texas, and Virginia retaining different systems.You will be held accountable for meeting these standards; clearly understanding how your unit addresses state standards will make it easier for you and your school to report on outcomes.

, This exercise will help you understand how much material you can realistically fit into a unit and how you should allocate your time. Remember to leave room for adjustment. You may find that in practice, a given concept takes more or less time to convey than anticipated.


If, for example, you have four weeks to address the five Great Depression unit goals outlined above, you may opt to begin with three lessons on the Depression's root causes and end with two focused upon the influence of World War II in ending the Depression. In between, you might allocate roughly a week to each of the other three goals, but leave a ""float"" day or two built into the schedule.
Plan supplemental assignments for ""float"" days that, while enriching, are not required material for meeting state standards. You'll be well-prepared if you do need the lessons, but you'll retain the capacity to sacrifice this material in favor of spending an extra day on a key learning goal.

, After reviewing what resources you can pull from, creating a diversity of assessment tools to evaluate learning is next. Both formative and summative measures should be in place to ensure a broad evaluation of the objectives is met by all students.


Formative assessments monitor student learning to provide ongoing feedback. These tools help you understand how well students are grasping course material so you can make adjustments as you go. Formative assessments typically have little or no point value -- they are meant as a check for the instructor and not as an assessment of student performance.A formative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a request that students submit two key points gleaned from a lecture on the First Hundred Days of the New Deal.
Summative assessments evaluate student learning and are typically given at the end of an instructional unit. These tools typically have high point value as they do gauge student performance.A summative assessment tool for our Great Depression example might be a research paper on a topic of the student's choosing.

, Given the time and the needs of your students, select what fits their learning styles and approaches that will garner their curiosity and interest. Variety will ensure that diverse needs are met.


Our unit on the Great Depression, for example, might mix periodic lectures with examination of primary source documents, conversations about images of the Dust Bowl, audio recordings of some of Franklin Roosevelt's ""Fireside Chats,"" and viewing of the film The Grapes of Wrath.


, Once the unit has begun, have benchmarks to maneuver through the unit. This will help keep you on track for time and ensure that learning objectives are being met.


Formative assessments can provide useful benchmarks.
Plan points at which you will commit to move onto new material even if student understanding remains incomplete. Spending too much time on one segment of your unit sacrifices the others.

"
"
Start your unit planning by considering your goals for the year.,
Develop a series of essential questions that will guide your students toward understanding of course content.,
Refer back to your superstructure as you plan distinct units.",How to Write a Unit Plan3," Starting with your broadest ""road map"" will provide important insight into how you should allocate your time.


What state standards are you required to fulfill in this course?
What are your district's course curriculum requirements?
What are your students' specific needs and learning styles? Consider broad factors such as demographics and past assessment data, but also trust your instincts as you consider the dynamics of your student population.
A broad ""road map"" allows you to circumvent common pitfalls such as running short on instructional time. When planning a post-Civil War U.S. history course, for example, if you begin with the understanding that you'll end the course in 2001 you can plot out a series of units that will enable you to reach that goal.

, These questions will form the superstructure of your course content.


Identify key content, skills, and vocabulary. What will your students need to know when they exit your course?
Develop ways of assessing your students to determine whether they are learning this information. Remember to diversify your assessment tools; some students will respond better to certain forms of assessment than others.
Design a structure that will place these essential questions in a proper learning sequence. Now you have your units, and can focus upon specific lesson plans.
Determine what materials you'll need to properly teach these concepts and skills.

, Remember to leave room for adjustment; some units will proceed more smoothly than others. Generally speaking, however, too much preparation is better than not enough -- plan with the understanding that you may need to trim extra detail. A wise approach will focus on key concepts and then supplement with supporting material that can be sacrificed if necessary."
"
Work with fellow teachers to meet key standards and goals across disciplines.,
Find useful partners.,
Think creatively about how your disciplines overlap.,
Expand your students' exposure to key concepts and learning goals.",How to Write a Unit Plan4," One of the greatest benefits of unit planning is the latitude it offers for developing interdisciplinary strategies to meet student needs. By planning ahead, you'll set a structure in place that gives students the opportunity to view broad concepts from many different angles.


A history teacher undertaking a unit on the Great Depression, for example, may opt to combine forces with an instructor in a related field such as economics or political science. He or she could also travel further afield and coordinate lessons with a science instructor. The history of the Dust Bowl will gain new life from the scientific insight a biology or earth sciences instructor brings, while the science teacher's students will better understand soil science, erosion, and air currents due to the context provided by their study of Dust Bowl history.

, A good interdisciplinary relationship will involve two or more instructors eager to work together to meet student needs. Ensure your colleague(s) will contribute similarly to the overall unit planning workload.

, Scientific research, for example, includes research, reading, and writing -- all hallmarks of English and language arts instruction. If you are a language arts teacher, consider coordinating with your school's biology teacher to coordinate lessons on research and analytical writing with a unit that will require students to write a research report on invertebrates. History or social studies teachers may coordinate with language arts instructors so students are studying the history of the Civil War at the same time they read The Red Badge of Courage.


Following our Dust Bowl example, a science instructor's lesson on meteorology and air currents could lead to a predictive study of where students expect dust might have blown during the 1930s. The students might then share this information with their history teacher and determine the accuracy of their predictions.
When embarking upon an interdisciplinary unit, ensure you coordinate assessment tools as well as lesson plans. Our imaginary science teacher and history instructor would need to be in communication with each other to determine how well their instruction was translating into important learning outcomes.

, Interdisciplinary coordination can provide your students with longer spans of class time for study and practice. Working together may allow you to spend multiple periods one day focused upon a larger-scale science project, while another day you'll use extra time on a language arts component of the interdisciplinary plan.


Approaching the same subject from different angles helps students view concepts in a broader context. Instead of seeing that invertebrate report in isolation, they will understand it as a way to put broader research and writing skills into practice.
Students who feel more confident in one subject than another gain the advantage of recognizing the links between their area of confidence and the skills they've previously found challenging."
,How to Write a Unit Plan5,
"
Assess your students' skills.,
Create a calendar of the semester or school year.,
Choose a theme for each month, and focus areas for each week.,
Locate or write your class's daily schedule.,
Segment the rest of the day into subject areas.,
Arrange these subject areas in small blocks of time of about 10-20 minutes each, depending on the length of your school day.,
Begin to fill in activities and lessons.,
Identify your objective.,
Consider the interests of your current students.,
Choose your approach.,
Gather your materials.,
Implement the lesson.,
Create a list of developmentally appropriate learning objectives for your students.,
Remember that the most developmentally appropriate way for small children to learn is through play.,
Build a classroom around the idea of play.,
Build in adult interaction.",How to Write a Preschool Lesson Plan," Before you can plan effective lessons, you need to establish your students' skill sets in communication, language awareness and reading readiness, number awareness and math readiness, gross and fine motor skills, and social and emotional development.Design lesson plan by keeping in mind the specific user groups - Preschool lesson plans have to be specifically designed to give a proper look for each user groups.In draft stage itself, lesson shall be shared with each staff membersPreschool children develop at different rates and have various levels of support in the home, so it should be no surprise that your students will likely display a wide variety of skills and readiness in various areas of development.Major areas to assess before the start of a semester include: verbal skills, phonological awareness, number awareness, fine and motor skill development
The number of children you have and how much time you have for assessments will likely influence the type of assessment you conduct, but in general brief assessments (when you have 20 minutes per child or less) can be structured (at a desk with a teacher, using flashcards, using paper and pencil, etc.) while longer assessments should be more naturalistic (watching them at play centers, watching their interactions with peers, etc.). Young children don't have the patience or ability to sit for prolonged assessments.
Various early childhood factors contribute to each child's skills. For example, it is not unusual for some 4 year old children to not yet know their alphabets; although more rare, others might already read at a 2nd or 3rd grade level.Identify students with delays, special needs, or giftedness. These students may require additional support throughout the semester, or additional effort to tailor lesson plans to their particular needs.
Under law, all students are guaranteed reasonable accommodation for disabilities and developmental delays. Students with developmental delays or disabilities (including autism and learning disabilities such as ADHD) should be referred for evaluation with the district coordinator, who will conduct a specialized assessment that takes all areas of development into account and can put together an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) to ensure that children receive the services they need to thrive in preschool. This process can vary by state, so check with your site coordinator., This can be done using a simple computer program, poster board, or even a notebook. By including start and end dates and holidays, you will get an overall picture of the plan for the preschool year.


Label breaks and holidays and number each week of instruction. These numbers will correspond to your plans.
Think about the big picture. What are the learning objectives for your students?

, A theme is a broad category, which you can think of as a ongoing topic of discussion or emphasis. A focus area is a subcategory of that theme, or a more particular instance to draw the children's attention to features of the theme.


For instance, the Mississippi State University Early Childhood program suggests monthly units such as ""All About Me,"" ""The Community,"" ""Food,"" ""The Weather,"" etc. These units would each have weekly a focus area. For example, if the month's theme is ""Food,"" the weeks might be divided into the focus areas ""Breakfasts,"" ""Lunches,"" ""Dinners,"" and ""Desserts."" The focus areas will be further developed in daily lessons (in this case, each day might be devoted to the mealtime cuisine of a separate culture).
Some teachers prefer to choose only a few themes and focus areas to begin with, and from there let the students' interests guide the development of the rest of the semester's themes.

, School day lengths vary for preschoolers, with some attending half days and some full days, so begin by writing out what time students arrive and leave and any other built-in daily activities (snack time, recess, lunch, etc.). This might look something like:


8-8:10am: Arrival, pledge of allegiance, roll
9-9:20am: Potty break, snack
10-10:20am: Outdoor recess
10:50: Gather backpacks and line up for home

, These are the areas on which you will focus your individual lessons and activities. Keeping them the same from day to day while changing up the particular activity can help students develop a routine, which helps them feel secure and confident that they know what to expect each day.


These might include oral language/sharing time, letter recognition/phonological awareness, fine motor centers, book time, number recognition and math readiness, small groups, etc.
Remember to focus on all major areas of early learning, including emotional, social, physical, and cognitive development. These are each significant in school readiness, the major goal of preschool curricula.

, Preschoolers' attention spans are short, so changing the activity regularly is a must. This will ensure that the students are able to focus on the activity at hand and meet their learning objective, and it will also help to ward off behavioral problems that can result from boredom. At this point, your schedule may look something like this:


8-8:10am: Arrival, pledge of allegiance, roll
8:10-8:30: Community circle
8:30-8:45: Phonological awareness
8:45-9: Free play in centers OR art
9-9:20: Potty break, snack
9:20-9:40: Reader's workshop
9:40-10: Math
10-10:20: Outdoor recess
10:20-10:40: Vocabulary
10:40-10:50: Community circle
10:50: Gather backpacks and line up for home

, Each activity or lesson should connect the theme, focus area, and subject area.


For instance, your theme for the month might be ""All About Me"" and your focus area for the week might be ""My Family.""
In this case, sharing time in the community circle might involve stating who is in your family, math might involve writing the number of family members, and art might involve a family portrait made of dried noodles and beans.

, The objective should target what you want your students to know or be able to do after a lesson plan has been implemented. Objectives can be skill-based, conceptual, or both.Skill-based objectives require that your students learn to do something new. Examples include: Draw a triangle, button a shirt independently, spell their name.
Conceptual objectives require that your students understand a concept or grasp an idea. Examples include: Identify a triangle, describe the weather, share their feelings in circle time.
Some objectives combine skills and concepts, like sounding out a word, which requires students to understand the relationship between letters and sounds (a concept) and to put them together verbally into a word (a skill).

, Ask them about what they want to learn about, and keep an ongoing list to refer back to for ideas.


Students of all ages learn best when they are engaged in the subject at hand. Some students, particularly those with attention or behavioral problems, benefit from lessons structured specifically around their areas of interest.Some common preschool interests include: animals, particularly baby animals; seasons and weather; dinosaurs; sea life; outer space; fairy tales; robots; dolls and domestic activities like cooking, cleaning, and keeping house.
Preschoolers also often have favorite pop culture figures and imaginary characters, and while these vary, you can get a good idea by asking your students who their favorite singers, cartoon characters, or video game characters are, or by paying attention to who is on their backpack or character apparel.

, This will vary depending on your objective, the skills of your students, and the interests of your students. You will also want to vary your approach from activity to activity and from day to day, to keep the interest of the students. Approaches might include:


Writing or tracing letters or numbers
Painting, drawing, or other art
Gross motor exercises or activities
Books that are relevant to the theme for story time and for children to read independently
Songs with or without motions
Sorting and counting activities using small figures or toys, etc.

, This might include paper, pencils, crayons, craft supplies, books, a tape player, or other items.


Be sure to plan enough for every student, plus extras in case of mistakes or accidents.

, Keep an eye on the time, but also don't be afraid to go off script. Some of the best learning moments happen when teachers respond to their students' questions and interests, even if it diverts from the original plan.


Be sure to make notes afterwards about what worked well and what did not. In future years, you can use these notes to reuse, rewrite, or scrap plans depending on how well they worked during implementation.

, While standards for childhood development exist, you may need to tailor the objectives to your particular students. For instance, in general students from lower income backgrounds tend to require more intensive interventions early on, while students from higher income backgrounds have benefited from more access to books, one-on-one time with adults, and supplemental enrichment activities throughout their early childhoods and have a head start entering preschool.The same is true for students who come from English speaking homes versus students for whom English is a second language.Remember that the primary function of preschool is kindergarten readiness, so work with local kindergarten teachers to determine the most vital areas for focus. In general, these include:


Expressive and receptive language: Students should be able to speak in complete sentences most of the time, understand and follow directions with more than one step, understand vocabulary related to position, size, and comparison (such as like/different, top/bottom, in/out), and make simple predictions about a story.Cognitive/learning readiness: Students should be able to match similar pictures; classify objects by physical features such as color, size, and shape; recognize pattern sequences; sequence up to three story pictures; retell a simple story; complete a simple puzzle; and identify five or more colors.Phonological awareness and print recognition: Students should be able to recognize own name in print, point to and identify letters in name, attempt to write name, demonstrates book awareness (such as reading books from left to right and words read from top to bottom, even if they are unable to read), identify rhyming words, match at least 3 letters with their sound, use symbols or drawings to express ideas.Mathematics: Students should be able to count up to five objects, match numerals 0-5 with that number of grouped objects, arrange numbers in order, identify at least three shapes, count to ten, and understand the concept of more or less.Social/emotional preparedness: Students should be able to identify self by name, age, and gender; interact with other students; make needs known to peers and teacher; demonstrate independence by washing hands, using bathroom, eating, and dressing; and demonstrate ability to separate from parents.Motor development: Students should be able to use pencils, crayons, and scissors with control; copy a line, circle, and X; hop, jump, run, catch a ball., Preschool lessons should be fun, engaging, and should involve a variety of senses and skills. In general, activities that involve rote memorization or repetition will be less interesting to preschoolers than similar activities.


Spend lots of unstructured time on the playground. While these might not seem like ""lessons"" in the traditional sense of the word, researchers have found that free play shapes development of the prefrontal cortex during a critical period of early childhood, which has lifelong implications for emotional regulation, planning, and problem solving., Centers in the classroom should be designed to encourage imaginative, cooperative play. This can encourage role playing, turn taking, and cooperation with peers. This can increase students interpersonal skills and self-confidence.Consider a center designed to mimic a playhouse, with a kitchen set, small toddler-sized table and chairs, baby dolls and bassinet, etc. Small, affordable toys from stores like Ikea or second hand shops can make this very affordable.
Create a costume wardrobe. This can range from fancy costumes to simple silk scarves. You can often find costumes on sale right after Halloween, or simply bring creative clothing from a second hand store like overalls, a fancy princess dress, a cowboy hat, any type of uniform, etc.
Plush stuffed animal toys are often the beginning of many creative games for preschoolers. Children can use their imagination to pretend that these are students in a classroom, pets in a home, animals in a rescue center or veterinary clinic, etc. Choose toys that you can easily wash every few months in a washing machine.

, This can often be difficult in large classes, but find a way to spend time with each child either daily or weekly, engaging in a small game or one-on-one reading time. Studies show that adult interaction is crucial for developing confidence and early literacy skills. It also reinforces the student-teacher bond which makes a child feel safer and more secure in school.In addition to one-on-one time, consider inviting parent volunteers to read to children once a week in small groups. The number of volunteers you get can determine the size of the groups; anything from one-on-one to groups of five students per adult will foster relationships and discussion that are key to early literacy.

Know about the time surrounding the book.,
Look at female characters.,
Look at male-female interaction.,
Note loaded words and implications.,
Put your information together.",How to Identify Feminism in Literature," Background research is often helpful in identifying themes in a story. What were the standards, expectations, and limitations for women when the piece was written? Readers of today may consider certain things normal when a century ago, they were frowned upon. 

So a girl rejected a proposal from an unpleasant suitor, you might say. Who wouldn't? It will change your idea of the scene if you know that females couldn't inherit property at the time the book was written; the family is all sisters, so after their father's death, all property would go to a cousin, and they would have nothing. This girl's marriage would have provided her family with money and supported them, yet she still wouldn't marry for anything but love.;
, How much attention or ""screen time"" do they get throughout the work? Is the story's focus a woman? (The woman need not even appear for this to be true; in a short story called ""A Jury of Her Peers,"" for instance, a woman is the single focus of the story, yet she never once appears herself.) Look at characterization, as well. Is the character unusually independent for her time? Does she challenge the status quo?, You might imagine that a feminist work would have, say, a married couple equal in authority, or one where the woman presides over the man. But a feminist work could just as easily have a man who overpowers and mistreats a woman: often writers would talk about uncomfortable topics that no one else wanted to, such as abuse, in order to draw attention to injustices or problems in the real world. This likely applies to anything that appalls or offends you; writing does not become renowned literature by being offensive for the sake of it., Sometimes you'll need to look closely to understand an author's meaning. Compliments may veil bitterness; acceptance may veil condemnation. Some things to take note of include:

Allusions. A man is persistently pursuing a girl who does not want anything to do with him. Does the author consider this bad or wrong? Perhaps the man is compared to the cat in pursuit of the bird. The implications of this simile could be negative; a cat seeks only to kill a bird - thus there could be a subtext of danger or predation.
Loaded words. Look for words with subtexts. ""Muscular"" and ""brutish"" can mean almost the same thing literally, but the implication of ""brutish"" is decidedly negative. If a woman's husband is described as brutish, take it as a warning sign.

, Is there enough pointing to feminism that you can come to that conclusion? None of these steps works on its own; they support one another. Consider how many different angles you have supporting the idea of feminism."

Scientific writings have historically been the most censored/banned texts. Today, scientific texts are generally allowed.

Charles Darwin's The Origins of Species could not legally be taught in many states for years.
Copernicus was forced (under threat of torture or death) to state that his sun-centered solar system was false.



Black Boy and Black Like Me were suppressed because they challenged the racial norms of the day. Black Boy is still challenged in libraries.;
,


At the top of the 2000-2009 American Library Association's banned/challenged book list is the Harry Potter series. People who obviously haven't read the books suggest that Harry Potter supports witchcraft, has magical spells, etc. Any reader of the series would tell you that (in the books): You have to be born with magical abilities, All of the spells named are either plays on words (like Avada Kedavra which is a play on the magician's Abracadabra) or Latinization of words or phrases with extra syllables thrown in.
Another example of this is The Satanic Verses by Salman Rushdie, which is probably better named, ""The Anti-Satanic Verses"". A death sentence was pronounced against Rushdie in absentia for his book.

,



The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn describes the time before the ""War Between the States"" when slavery still existed. It is often challenged for its use of the word ""Nigger"". The term was common for the time it was written about and didn't carry the derogatory implications that the term does today, or not nearly to the same degree. The term was derived from the Latin word ""nigger"", meaning ""black"" or ""dark"". This is similar to the term ""Indians"" which described the Native Americans. Today, ""Indians"" is often considered improper, though it is still widely used.

Mein Kampf by Adolph Hitler is a historical document, though its statements and suggestions are terribly bigoted. Reading the book is one of the best ways to learn from history. It is history's greatest example of the politics of hate, and where it leads to. Like all authors, Hitler wrote about what he knew.

,


Many of the children's books by Judy Blume have been challenged on this basis. Some parents believe they can completely isolate their children from sexual discussions. Judy Blume's works are often written about children who are nearing adolescence. Her books often discuss subjects that parents want to avoid.
Some books, like 1984 and Brave New World have some sexual content. Usually, the choice is made to allow these only after 5th grade.
Religious works are no exception. Members of almost every religion have tried to suppress the writings of other religions.

, Ask for an explanation for any final decisions that were made.

, Most libraries have groups that review books. Ask how you can participate.

, Banned Books Week is the national book community's annual celebration of the Freedom to Read. Hundreds of libraries and bookstores around the country draw attention to the problem of censorship by mounting displays of challenged books and hosting a variety of events.

Ideally, look at a scheme of work left by your predecessor. If one isn't available, ask a few colleagues if you can see their schemes of work and look for predominant commonalities between them to gauge what is expected at the institution., Schemes of work are available on teaching resource websites for purchase and download. Search for one to save yourself time in the lesson planning process, or to have a template to modify. Be sure that any school or department-specific requirements are acknowledged and listed on the document you end up with.For instance, schemes of work are available on Click Teaching, a teaching resource website that teachers can subscribe to for approximately $50 a year., Use a Word document (and make a table on it) or create an Excel spreadsheet to write your schedule of work. Start by adding the basic information and add to the document as you wish (e.g. adding a column called “Initials” or “Signature” at the end of the chart to sign and show that a learning goal was completed on schedule . Create several main columns in the chart, labelled:


“Date” or “Lesson number”, to delineate each interval
“Topic” (i.e. the overall subject matter of a specific unit)
“Lesson content”: a brief overview of the lesson planned, which can be broken down into sub-topics
“Specific objectives”
“Learning Activities”
“Resources”
“Assessment”

This will give you a sense of the content and structure that is usually used.


Look into specific teaching methods. Montessori, Waldorf, Reggio Emilia, and High/Scope are useful places to start your research. These frameworks provide details about early childhood experiences, teaching methods, and curriculum design.;
, Unless you are working in a new school, your supervisor should have access to some sort of curriculum or teaching guide from previous years. Even if your task is to change the existing curriculum, let your supervisor know that you would like to use the old structure as a model.

, Talk to other teachers in your school or other preschool teachers in your network. Ask them if they would be willing to share their curricula with you. Most teachers are generous about sharing materials and strategies for student success.


Ask an experienced co-worker to help you. Approach a friendly veteran teacher, and ask for some tips. Most teachers are busy, especially in the beginning of the year, so it may help to come to them with specific questions.

, This may be dictated by the type of preschool you choose to work in. On the other hand, you may have the freedom to decide on the structure of your classroom.


Play-based settings are more student centered, allowing children to choose most of the activities they do throughout the day. Classrooms are usually divided into sections such as a kitchen, a reading area, dramatic play, and so on. The teacher encourages the students to learn through play.
Academic settings are more teacher directed, and tend to prepare students for specific skills that they will need to learn in kindergarten. Teachers prepare students to recognize numbers, letters, and sounds.

, Local governments usually have set standards for each age group. Standards are often divided into subject areas like mathematics or social studies. Within each subject area, students have to meet certain performance standards to show that they have made acceptable progress. They are generally skills-based objectives that explain what students should be able to do without going into detail about content., A common way to organize a preschool curriculum is by thematic units. Units are larger topics that can be explored for weeks at a time and through many subject areas. Once you have your units, you can begin to add appropriate, standards-based activities.


Possible unit topics include animals, community, plants, or family.Units generally last from one to five weeks, depending on the amount of material that needs to be covered., Each standard should have at least three learning experiences that help students progress. Make a list of experiences that are both developmentally appropriate and capable of meeting the state standard.For example, a possible learning standard is “Recognizing rhythm and rhyme.” A learning experience for a unit about planets could have students create nonsense words for Twinkle Twinkle Little Star. This learning experience fits the topic of the unit and also meets the learning standard., Preschool students learn best when participating in different types of hands-on activities.Avoid long full group sessions with a lot of teacher talk. Instead, encourage children to explore topics through the five senses.

, It is important to not only vary the activity, but also to change locations in the room and the size of the groups. Let students move from small group to full group activities throughout the day., Design experiments and observations of the natural and social world to encourage curiosity. Allow students to touch, smell, taste, and hear, and observe the world around them.


If you have a science area, bring physical materials to the science center based on the current area of study. Plan outdoor discovery times to expand upon classroom learning. For example, try an insect hunt during a unit on insects., Preschool provides an introduction to the more rigorous reading and writing based learning that happens in grade school. Be sure to find developmentally appropriate activities that prepare children for success in later years.


Promote literacy by decorating the classroom labels, magazines, and letters. Make lists of age-appropriate books to read aloud, and give students time to engage with books individually. Be sure to also allow students plenty of time to develop writing skills through the use of tools like paintbrushes and crayons.Include pre-writing activities. These activities promote strength in children’s hands and help them develop the fine-motor skills necessary for writing. Good activities allow children to manipulate small objects with their hands. Try having them cut playdough with child-safe scissors, finger paint, and use crayons to color shapes on graphic organizers., Use drawing, music, dance, and drama to encourage kids to be creative and learn new skills. Arts focussed activities provide opportunities for students to practice literacy, socialization, and perceptual skills.Encourage dramatic play. The benefits of dramatic play range from social-emotional to cognitive and academic. In their make believe sessions, children learn about verbal communication, teamwork, abstract thinking, and more.Create a dramatic play area equipped with props like dolls, clothes, and other household items.Sing songs. Songs, especially rhyming songs, help children get sense of the structure of a language. Through singing, they gain phonemic awareness, vocabulary, and rhythm., Preschool is a time when children begin to learn about socialization. Guide students to learn about their communities and their peers through dramatic play, studies of different career paths, and studies of other cultures.


Encourage socialization and social awareness by teaching about members in the community. Allow students to dress as different community members and act out roles. Plan for the children to meet adults in their community via trips and classroom visits.

, Depending on the teaching method you are using, your classroom may look different. A student-based classroom will have more sections for student exploration such as a sandbox and a water table. An academic classroom may have a larger full-group area for students to learn from teacher-led activities.

, Use your state standards and units listed in your curriculum to write create lessons. Activities do not need to be rigidly structured as they are in grade school. You should, however, create a basic daily routine to follow, as this is helpful to young children. Try to strike a balance between small group, medium group, and whole group activities.


Avoid spending too much time on one topic. Most children cannot pay attention to one activity for more than about 40 minutes. This is especially true for young ones that are just getting adjusted to school life."

Read through the course materials.,
Divide reading time appropriately.,
Research your constraints.,
Set out academic objectives.,
Collaborate with students.",How to Write a Scheme of Work2," To get a better idea of how the course content will unfurl over the course of the term, read through the main course materials as outlined in last year’s syllabus or scheme of work. If there is a specific textbook associated with the subject that you’re teaching (e.g. mathematics), review it and take note of how much focus is allotted for different topics. Complete your scheme of work accordingly.For instance, two chapters might be devoted to polynomial functions, while differential equations might only be covered in one chapter.

, If multiple course materials are assigned for a course, decide how much time and academic focus each should be allotted. For example, if various novels or plays are assigned in an English course, give each a sufficient measure of focus. If you add or remove course content, make sure that there is an appropriate amount of reading for each week., Before planning and detailing your scheme of work, get information about the curriculum requirements in place at your institution. For instance, students might have to master a certain set of skills in an introductory course to be prepared for a more advanced course the following year. Ask the school administration, or review the previous instructor’s work and materials to get a better idea of what constraints might be in place.


In addition, look into whether the class could benefit from new course materials and updated unit plans of learning.

, Based on the course materials and grade requirements, write a list of learning objectives for each individual unit and for the course as a whole. Adjust and edit these objectives as you work out time constraints and actionable learning activities, to ensure that you add well-thought out goals to your scheme of work. Make sure that each objective follows the S.M.A.R.T. acronym:Specific
Measurable
Attainable/achievable
Realistic
Time-bound

, Schemes of work are working documents, so you can always collaborate with students or colleagues and adjust the document after the initial copy is produced. This offers the opportunity for you to confer with students about upcoming learning activities and goals, and modify them accordingly. Show students a copy of the first draft of your scheme of work and get their feedback and ideas about how learning should progress.For instance, a teacher may have initially scheduled a brief lecture and note-taking for a lesson on the Cold War, but amends the unit plan to schedule a class discussion instead to defer to the preferences of the class.

"
"
Break down the duration of the course.,
Factor in scheduling interruptions.,
Work around other teachers' schedules.",How to Write a Scheme of Work3," Break down the total duration of the class into the key topics to be covered, or units. Each one of these sections should account for a fundamental lesson to be learned at a specific interval of the term in order to fulfill the curriculum requirements. These unit plans should cover either a week or a month of study and together, form an organized sequence of learning for students. For instance, in an introductory Anthropology course, you might plan a week-long unit entitled “The Agricultural Revolution” during which you will teach students about the origins and rise of farming.

, When planning the schedule, make a point of noting all upcoming events and conflicts that will interrupt a straight-forward, linear scheme of work. Look through a calendar to mark down statutory holidays, and through a school calendar to take note of any school breaks, examinations, or assemblies that will interrupt normal class time. Allow time for review and practice in the event that students have trouble grasping course material and need more time to absorb it.For example, a unit like WWII in a 20th century history course might be stretched over two weeks instead of one week to accommodate a statutory holiday, and allow for review to ensure that all students are well-versed in this important component of the class.

, Consult with colleagues to ensure that there are no major conflicts with your schedules. For example, avoid scheduling a major assignment on a day that your students will have a midterm exam in another class. Advise teachers of your prospective dates for exams and major projects."

, Remember being a little kid and having teachers telling you to sound it out? With Bengali, that's even more important. Since the alphabet is syllabic it is a little easier to sound out the whole word.

, If you can't figure out how to say a word or it doesn't sound correct, search the internet for the correct pronunciation. There are all sorts of very short videos that can help you double check your pronunciation.

, Learning any language is hard, but starting with common phrases is a great way to begin getting a handle on the language. It will also help you navigate if you are traveling to an area where people speak the Bengali language. Start with the basics., The Bengali alphabet is syllabic and all consonants have an inherent vowel with two different pronunciations. It’s important that you learn these if you want to recognize and speak common words accurately.Learn to draw the alphabet as you learn what sound each letter makes. This will help you recognize the letter much more easily. Try learning the alphabet the same way you learned the English alphabet as a little kid. Draw out each letter and saw the sound that it makes as you draw it out. You'll have to memorize all of them.

, Study the sound that each letter makes, not just the way the letter works. Unlike English, many letters make multiple sounds. Try to master these sounds. For example, go through the alphabet and practice matching the pronunciations for two letters together into short words. This will give you an idea of how to combine letters. You’ll also want to understand certain pronunciations that are different than English. For example, the sound of T is a soft T – similar to the T in Spanish.

, You don't need to become an expert, you just need to recognize the differences from your own language. Understanding how the language operates will give you a better understanding of what you are actually saying. Once you understand that, you'll better be able to say common words in the correct context. Bengali operates with a subject, object, verb word order versus a subject, verb, object order like English. Bengali also uses postpositions rather than prepositions. Like English, there is no grammatical gender – however, verbs do indicate person, tense, and status., Find a book written and Bengali and start flipping through the pages. You don’t need to understand the story or even the words, just try to recognize the letters and pick out common words that you know. This will familiarize you with words that are used the most. If you can, find a children's book that relates to numbers and food. You probably will want to familiarize yourself with these words the most if you are going to be traveling.

, Write down words and say them out loud to yourself. You can buy a workbook if you want some extra help, or find worksheets online. You can find plenty of videos online that offer the correct pronunciation of words. Try to match what you’re saying with the correct pronunciation. It doesn’t matter if you know what the word means if no one else can understand what you’re saying.

, If you don’t have a Bengali friend to speak with, you can always find one online! Search “Speak with a Bengali” online and you’ll find plenty of sites that allow you to speak with someone over the Internet. Even if you’re just exchanging small pleasantries this is a good start. , Find a movie that is entirely in the Bengali language. Even if you don’t know what is going on this will help you get an idea of the rhythm of the language and how words are said. You’ll be surprised how helpful it is.

Know the rules about addressing different sexes.,
Practice your pronunciation.,
Modify the greeting depending on your audience.,
Greet people in the appropriate order.,
Avoid physical contact unless it is initiated.,
Do not rush the conversation.",How to Say Hello in Pakistan1," Muslim countries are very concerned with respecting defined boundaries between the sexes. If you are new to Pakistan and its culture, it is best to err on the side of caution when addressing the opposite sex. Keep in mind that there are strict rules about men addressing women and about women addressing men. Most Muslim women will not respond to greetings from men outside their families, and many men consider greetings from women, especially non-Muslim women, as very improper and impolite., The complicated Persian and Arabic origin dialects make Urdu a difficult language for non-native speakers.The accent can vary between regions, but the most appropriate greeting when speaking with a Muslim is the Salam greeting.


Use the phrase ""As-Salam-u-Alaikum"", which means ""Peace be unto you"".This phrase is pronounced “us-saa-laam-muu-alie-kum.”

, As with other languages, the pronouns in the Salam greeting will change depending on who you are greeting. For example, the Salam greeting would be different if you are meeting a male business associate versus meeting the girlfriend of a colleague. To modify the Salam greeting, you must change the “you” in the phrase, which is represented by the “-kum” part of As-Salam-u-Alaikum:As-Salāmu `alayk(a): use when greeting one male
As-Salāmu `alayk(i): use when greeting one female
As-Salāmu `alayk(umā): use when greeting two people of any gender
As-Salāmu `alayk(unna): use when greeting multiple females only'
As-Salāmu `alayk(umu): use when greeting a group of three or more people, where at least one is a male or if you are meeting a member of state such as a prime minister, president, king, etc.

, Hierarchy is very important in Pakistan so greetings must be extended in a particular order. This is especially true if you are meeting people for business. Show respect by arriving on time and greeting the oldest person or the person with the highest position in the organization first. Then greet people in descending order of age or position. If you do not know everyone in the group, ask a mutual acquaintance to introduce you. Do not introduce yourself because this is considered very rude. Some other tips:It is customary in Pakistan to need less personal space than many western cultures require, so don’t be surprised or back away if people stand very close to you while in a meeting.
Only exchange business cards with either the right hand or with both hands. Never use the left hand, as this is considered extremely rude.
Make sure your business card lists your title and any advanced degrees in order to show your status. If you are given a business card, be sure to show respect by studying the card and admiring their position and degrees before you place it into your cardholder.

, Because the conventions of propriety are much stricter in Muslim countries, you should base any physical greetings, like shaking hands or embracing, on the cues from the Muslim you are greeting. If you are close with the person or they are of the middle class, shaking hands and embracing is much more common, even across sex lines.Men typically shake hands with one another, and hugs are also common between Muslim and non-Muslim men if they have developed a relationship.
Women will rarely hug or shake hands with men; however, some women in the middle and upper classes have adopted wearing gloves in order to bypass the strict law that says women can only make physical contact with male members of their family.

, Despite the strict rules governing the sexes, Pakistani culture is an incredibly social and vocal culture. Once you have initiated the conversation with the Salam greeting, prepare for a longer conversation about the person's health, their family, and their business.Show interest in the conversation, and don’t try to cut them off, as this is considered rude.

Say ""hej!"",
Politely greet someone with ""hallo"".,
Greet someone based on the time of day.,
Greet someone informally.,
Enjoy yourself!",How to Say Hello in Danish1," This casual greeting translates to ""hi"" or ""hello.""


Pronounce this word as high.;
, Although more common when answering the phone, this world is also acceptable to use in person, and translates to ""hello"".


Pronounce this word as hah-lo


, Depending on whether it is morning, the afternoon, or the evening you will either say god morgen, god eftermiddag, goddag, or god aften. Like English, French, and the many latin based languages, these are common phrases and considered appropriate and polite to use with anyone from friends to strangers, regardless of social hierarchy. In Scandinavian countries like Denmark and Norway ""god morgen"" is used until 12 AM when you switch to greeting with ""god eftermiddag"".

Always greet a fellow Muslim.,
Be aware of the rules dictating who initiates a greeting.,
Respond to any greeting promptly.,
Greet any male elders first.,
Greet the rest of the group in the appropriate order.,
Participate in the resulting conversation.",How to Say Hello in Pakistan2," In Muslim countries like Pakistan, it is considered extremely impolite to not greet a fellow Muslim. According to the Muslim holy text, the Quran, the Salam greeting has been mandatory since its creation, and the greeting is commanded by Allah.To not greet a fellow Muslim with “As-Salam-u-Alaikum” is to go against scripture, which immoral and punishable.

, In Pakistan, the culture is informed and mandated by the Quran, including who is responsible for initiating a greeting. These rules are considered holy and are strictly followed. When in Pakistan, the rules for initiating a greeting include:The person who arrives greets the Muslims that are present.
The person who is riding greets the one who is walking.
The person who is walking greets the one who is sitting.
The smaller group greets the bigger group.
The young greet the elders present.

, If you did not initiate the greeting first, it is considered unacceptable to not respond accordingly. According to the Quran, it is also obligatory for a Muslim to return the Salam greeting regardless of whether or not the other person is Muslim. Not returning the Salam greeting goes against the Quran’s scripture.Respond with ""wa Alaikum Assalam wa Rahmatullah,"" which means ""May the peace, mercy, and blessings of Allah be upon you.""
This phrase is pronounced: ""waa-alie-kum-us-salam waa-rah-ma-tull-la-he.""

, In Pakistani and Muslim cultures, elders are respected highly, and your greeting should reflect this. If you are greeting a large gathering, always start by greeting the eldest males in attendance. Even if you are an elder, if you are the person arriving you must be the one to initiate the greeting, starting with your fellow elders. If you are unsure of whom the eldest is, it is best to bow your head and speak the Salam greeting in the general direction of the elders.This is considered extremely polite and you will gain respect from the group by doing so.

, After greeting the eldest male, it is best to acknowledge and greet the rest of the group in descending order, according to the Quran. Greet the other male members of the group next, and then acknowledge the women present. Current practices encourage extending the greeting to the children as well so that they become accustomed to the Salam greeting practices from an early age., Unlike other greetings, the Salam greeting is truly a conversation starter in Pakistan and is not meant as a passing “Hello.” Once you have initiated or responded to the Salam greeting, get comfortable and ready yourself for a longer, pleasant conversation about your health, your family, and your business. Avoid speaking only of yourself and be sure to ask the other person/people about their affairs as well."

Master the basics.,
Practice, practice, practice.,
Get creative.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in French, German and Italian1"," As with any language, there are dozens of ways to tell someone you love them. Start small and work your way up. You may be nervous to begin with, so it's best to start simple.


""I love you"" is ""Je t'aime."" It sounds like zhuh - tem. This is the strongest way to tell someone you care.
""I adore you"" is ""Je t'adore."" It sounds like zhuh - tah - door (the r is very soft and should only be hinted at).
""I want you"" is ""Je te désire."" It sounds like zhuh - tuh - duh - zai - uh.;
, As with anything, practice will make saying these words so much easier. The sounds in French aren't the same as in English; practice the accent along with the words.


Almost every translation website has an audio option. Listen to a native speaker say the words and emulate the exact sound. There are also plenty of videos on the web that can show you the exact mouth and tongue formation to nail the sound.

, If you've got the ""Je t'aime"" down, go a little above and beyond to express your feelings. There are many more poetic, meaningful ways to show your emotions.


Add terms of endearment. Just like you might say, ""I love you, babe,"" or ""I love you, sweetheart,"" the same goes in French. ""Mon amour,"" ""ma/mon chéri(e),"" and ""mon bébé"" will spruce up the phrase. That's ""my love,"" ""my darling,"" and ""my baby"", respectively. ""Ma chérie"" is for a woman; ""mon chéri"" is for a man.

The possessive adjectives ""mon"" and ""ma"" (my) have to agree with the gender of the term of endearment -- not your own gender nor necessarily that of the person you're talking to. Generally speaking, masculine terms of endearment can be used for men and women, while feminine terms of endearment can only be used for women.

Claus: Hej! ""Hey!""

Emmy: Goddag! ""Good day!""

Claus: Hvordan har du det? ""How are you?""

Emmy: Fint, tak. Hvad med dig? ""Fine, thanks. How about you?""

Claus: Det går godt! ""It's going well!""

, This is the most common greeting among Danish speakers. Although considered informal, it is perfectly acceptable to use with your friends, those younger than you, as well as social superiors and elders.


""Hej"" is pronounced like the English word high, with a rising intonation.
If you say ""hej"" twice in a row, this is actually the informal goodbye.
When answering the phone it is more common to say ""hallo"". This is pronounced hah-lo.

, ""Goddag"" is pronounced in two short syllables, with the second syllable stressed and rising. The first d is silent, and, although it might be confusing to English speakers, in Danish ""dag"" is actually pronounced similar to the word ""day."" Comparatively, English pronunciation sounds crisp, with consonants being clearly enunciated, whereas Danish seems to have a natural slur to it. Be sure to listen to the audio clip to understand how natural speakers sound.


Pronounce this as goo'dey


,""Once you can say hello, you'll probably want to follow up by asking people how they are doing. In Dutch the letters ""hv"" proceed question words like how and what. The h is silent, and when spoken, this word (despite its written length) appears to collapse into a sound more similar to ""vin"" or ""win"" to English speaker's ears. But be sure to listen closely to the slowed down example and it becomes clear that the d is in fact enunciated.


Pronounce this phrase as vor-dan-har-doo-dehThe ""du"" in this phrase refers to ""you"" in the informal. If you would like to show respect or are speaking to someone older or socially superior to you, use ""De"".

, Hvad med dig?""The ""i"" in ""fint"" is pronounced as the ""ee"" in ""geese"". However, the sound is short and not elongated. ""Tak"", meaning thank you, is pronounced as the word ""tack"" in English. Hvad med dig is pronounced phonetically similar to ""ver muh die."" The r in Danish, similar to German and French, is uvular and pronounced at the back of the throat. Note that ""med"" is a short syllable within this phrase and is less emphasized compared to the words ""Hvad"" and ""dig.""


Pronounce this as feent-tack, ver-muh-die.

, This is an informal way of saying ""It's going well."" Similar to in English, it is common to reply informally in this way, as opposed to referring directly to yourself, as in ""I am well, thank you.""

Say আমি তোমাকে/তোমাদের ভালোবাসি.,
Tweak the phrase for romance.,
Change the wording if you're replying in kind.,
Go a little more formal when required.,
Adjust your wording for emphasis or poetry.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in Bengali"," Bengali does not inflect for gender or number. However, it does have a plural form of the pronoun you.

In singular-accusative (or object position), it is তোমাকে, roughly tomake with a soft 't'.
For plural-accusative, it is তোমাদের, roughly tomader with a soft 't'.
আমি (ami) is 'I' and ভালোবাসি (bhalobashi) is 'love'.
The broad phonetic transcription is /ami tomake bhalobashi/ or /ami tomader bhalobashi/.;
, For romantic love, instead of /bhalobashi/, প্রেম করি i.e. /prem kori/ can be used., To say 'I love you' back to some one, just add /o/ with /ami/, like আমিও তোমাকে ভালোবাসি i.e. /amio tomake bhalobashi/

আমিও তোমাকে আরো ভালোবাসি (/amio tomake aro bhalobashi/) or আমিও তোমাকে আরো বেশি ভালোবাসি (/amio tomake aro beshi bhalobashi/) means I love you (even) more"". The feeling can be further intensified by lengthening the sound /o/ of /aro/


, Instead of তোমাকে/তোমাদের, আপনাকে/আপনাদের (apnake/apnader, with soft 'd' like 'th' of 'other' in English) can be used for more respect or formal situations (colloquially, it's mostly used for formal addressals).

তোকে/তোদের (toke/toder, again, with soft 't' and soft 'd') can be used as highly informal address.

, Bengali is a free-phrasal language. So, the words can be re-ordered to shift emphasis or for poetic requirements. For example, তোমাকে আমি ভালোবাসি (/tomake ami bhalobashi/) may mean, ""It is you, whom I love"" or ভালোবাসি তোমাকে আমি (/bhalobashi tomake ami/) may mean ""It is love what I feel for you""."

Dropping the beginning of the greeting may be perceived as disrespectful., If you're friends with someone, ""selamat"" is not always necessary.

It is frequently used in Malaysia and Indonesia as an informal greeting., In formal situations, such as interactions with bosses or teachers, always start with, ""Selamat."" Dropping the beginning of the greeting may be perceived as disrespectful.Err on the side of formality. While an informal greeting is not a major social faux pas, it's generally best not to risk offending others. This is especially important if you're unfamiliar with a country's culture. If you're uncertain how friendly to be with someone, keep the ""selamat"" in place just in case.

Get the sounds right.,
Put the whole phrase together.,
Make it effortless.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in French, German and Italian2"," Different variations of German may pronounce ""Ich"" (""I"") different ways, and generally it's impossible to write correctly in English. It's in the IPA, a phoneme that doesn't exist in English.


However, English used to have this phoneme. Put your mouth in position to sound out the word ""human."" That very first sound--where air is coming out for the ""h"" but your mouth is ready to say the ""u""--is the most similar to . Now put an ""ih"" in front to get the proper pronunciation of ""Ich.""

Many websites may write ""ish"" or ""esh."" This is close, but not perfect. Think of ""sh,"" but put the middle of your tongue to the roof of your mouth, spread it out, and make the ""sh"" sound. It may sound funny at first.



, Now that you have ""Ich,"" you can work on the whole phrase: Ich liebe dich.


""Liebe"" is a bit easier. The second syllable, ""buh"" has a hint of an ""r."" Think of the sound in ""burn."" ""Liebe"" should sound somewhere between lee-buh and lee-bur.
""Dich"" has the same sound as ""Ich."" Put a ""d"" in front of it and you're ready!

, Practice it over and over until you're making those 's and touching lightly on that invisible ""r."" Ich liebe dich, Ich liebe dich. Getting it?


Don't be tempted to use ""du"" instead of ""dich."" ""Du"" does mean you, yes, but that's for the nominative case. German uses cases (English used to) and here, ""you"" needs to be in the accusative case.

Know the subtle differences.,
Pick your phrase and get the pronunciation down.,
Say it.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in French, German and Italian3"," In Italian, there are two main phrases to say that you love someone: Ti amo and Ti voglio bene. Their differences are slowly morphing as the language changes and evolves.


""Ti amo"" implies a sexual relationship. An element of lust is present.
""Ti voglio bene"" is considerably less sexual. It's more ""I care for you."" As a human, as someone you'd risk your life for. It's both less serious because it's less passionate, but more serious because of the sense of commitment.

, Once you decide which one is more appropriate, start practicing how to say it. ""Ti amo"" is a bit easier than ""Ti voglio bene,"" but both can be easy.


""Ti amo"" is pretty straightfoward: tee ah-mo. Simple as that!
""Ti voglio bene"" sounds like tee VOH-lee-oh BAY-neh. Think of the vowel in ""bay"" without the ""y.""

, You've got it down pat, you've been practicing, and now you're ready! When the moment is ripe, go for it. All your hard work will surely pay off.


If it's appropriate, add a ""cara mia."" That's ""my darling."" Imagine it: cara mia, ti voglio bene. You can practically hear the hearts pounding from over here.

Make it a game.,
Play some music, but only if they're quiet.,
Turn off the lights.,
Waste their time.,
Put your hand up.,
Make some noise.,
Make them put their hands up.,
Use a rewards system.,
Clap your hands.,
Award groups.,
Be calm and don't yell.",How to Quiet a Classroom," Especially for primary students, if you play ""The Quiet Game"" with them, they will quiet down quickly. Give them a few seconds to finish up their conversations, make lots of noise, etc., and then start playing ""The Quiet Game"": the students must be quiet for as long as possible. If you want, set a timer or tell them that you would like them to be quiet for 5 minutes. If they make noise or talk, start the 5 minutes over. If students don't cooperate, you may want to add a small prize/reward/sticker, etc. for the person or group that stays quiet the longest.;
, Depending on what music you play, this trick can work with intermediate grades as well. Tell the students that you'll turn on the radio/CD player/iPod, etc. and they can listen to music, but only if they're quiet. Once the noise level gets too high, you will turn off the music system. If you're doing this, make sure that the music you're playing is music that the students like. For example, if you're teaching 1st grade, play their favourite children's CD. If you're teaching intermediate, turn on a popular radio station. If you don't play music they like, they won't quiet down.

, If the classroom is too loud for the students to even hear you ask them to quiet down, flick the lights on and off a couple times to get their attention and then ask them to quiet down.

, Tell them that if they waste your time (class time), you'll waste their time. Every time the students get too noisy, watch the clock or look at your watch, counting the seconds/minutes that it takes for them to quiet down. Tell them that they have to make up those minutes at recess time. You could also simply put strikes on the board once they're too loud. Each strike represents 1 minute that they must wait before going out to recess.

, In most schools, when a teacher raises their hand, it's a signal for students to quiet down. If this alone doesn't work, you might want to add an incentive - for example, if students can quiet down in under five seconds, they'll all receive a sticker.

, This is another tip that will get the student's attention. By making a noise such as ringing a bell, blowing a kazoo, using a noisemaker, etc. will get the student's attention. You could also use this as a symbol to be quiet. Once you make the noise, the students must quiet down. This saves you from losing your voice.

, Try to quiet the class down, and then tell the class, ""If you're listening to me, put your hands up."" This will show you who is and isn't listening to you, and will also ensure that students are giving you their full attention and not fiddling around with pens, pencils, etc. Once you know who isn't listening, you can call their name and make sure that they're listening to you.

, Lots of teachers use rewards systems such as marble jars - when kids quiet down quickly, you put a handful of marbles in the marble jar. When the kids are noisy and don't listen when you ask them to quiet down, take a handful of marbles out of the marble jar. You could also take 1 marble out of the jar for every minute that you waited for quiet. Once the marble jar is full, give the class a prize, such as a pajama day, watching a movie in the afternoon, going outside, etc.

, Clap out a pattern and have the students repeat that pattern after you. Continue to do this until the class is quiet and you have everyone's attention. This is a great idea for primary classes, but works on intermediate classes as well, if used sparingly otherwise they'll feel like you're treating them like babies.

, Put the students in groups and have a tally chart with the name of each group on it. Tell the students to be quiet, and whichever group is quiet the longest/the fastest will get a point for their group. You could also award one point for every minute that each group is quiet for, so that the groups stay quiet for a long time. Students get really competitive for points and will make sure that their other group members are quiet. At the end of the week or month, award a prize to the group with the most points.

, Ask for peace and quiet in a calm, cool, and collected voice. When you're calm, the students are sure to follow the example that you're setting and will be calm and quiet. If there's a quiet mood in the classroom, the students will be quiet.

Some native Khmer speakers render it ""knhom srolanh nak.""""Knhom"" (also rendered ""khnhom"" or ""kyom"" or "" is the word you use for ""I"" if you want it to be gender-neutral or generic. Pronounce it ""ken-yooom.""
""Nak"" is the word you use for ""you"" if you want it to be gender-neutral or generic. The ""k"" is very subtle (almost imperceptible): say it like ""naHk"";
, Depending on whether you are a male or female, and whether the person you are addressing is male or female, you should use different words for say the phrase ""I love you.""


""Bong"" is the word you use for ""I"" when you are a male referring to yourself or the word for ""you"" when you're speaking to a male lover.
""Oun"" is the word you use for ""I"" when you are a female referring to yourself or the word ""you"" when you are speaking to a female lover.
These words will be necessary to say ""I"" and ""you"" in Khmer when you say the phrase ""I love you.""

, Love in Khmer is written ស្រឡាញ់. Regardless of whether you are male or female, or if the object of your affection is male or female, ""love"" is pronounced the same way.


One common way to phonetically render the Khmer word for ""love"" is ""srolang."" Another way is ""srolahn."" As you say the ""r,"" slightly roll it with your tongue; the ""g"" falls off the end and is almost imperceptible (which is why some renderings leave it off altogether).
To some English speakers, the word ""srolahn"" is reminiscent of the German word ""Fräulein,"" which means ""Miss.""

, Now that you know the appropriate words for male and female genders, you can put these words together with ""love"" to say ""I love you"" to the object of your affection.


The translation for ""I love you"" in Khmer is ""Kyom srolang bong"" which is if you say it to a male. (Kyom is the gender-neutral form of ""I."") If you are a female addressing a male lover, say, ""Oun srolang bong.""
If you say it to a female you will say ""Kyom srolang oun."" (Kyom is the gender-neutral form of ""I."") If you are a male addressing a female lover, say, ""Bong srolang oun.""

, The Khmer language is ancient and borrows from many other Austroasiatic languages, most notably Thai and Lao. It is similar to other southeast Asian languages such as Vietnamese and Mon,and has a beautiful flowing script. If you know much about Asian language systems, you'll know that this means that Khmer, both in print and spoken aloud, is very different from the English alphabet system.


The Khmer alphabet is alphasyllabic, meaning that each letter represents a syllable rather than one sound like in English.It is written from left to right, with no spaces between words in a given sentence.
Khmer contains 33 consonant letters, 14 independent vowels, and 21 vowel diacritics (essentially an accent mark written above or below a letter that changes the way it is pronounced).None of these letters are similar to English, which can make it hard to learn for native English speakers.

, There are many systems that people use to ""romanize"" the Khmer language, that is, to render it in roman alphabetic characters like those used in the English language.This can make it hard to learn how to pronounce Khmer phrases, as you will find many variations of how Khmer words are written in phonetically in English.

, While you can learn the gist of the language by reading about it, the best way to learn to pronounce phrases in Khmer is to listen to native speakers.

Communicate the sadness of onsra.,
Shout about the joys of retrouvailles.,
Bare your heart, and tell them of your tuqburni.,
Send a message to tell of your saudade feeling.,
Explain how you knew Koi No Yokan would happen to you two.,
Share the mamihlapinatapai moment you had.,
Describe the experience of kilig at seeing someone you like unexpectedly.,
Forget it, you are forelsket.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in Different Languages1"," Onsra is pronounced uhns-’rah. It is a word from the Boro language of India, and it describes the sad and sweet feelings that you get when you realize that your love is coming to an end.This word is a noun because it is a feeling. You could say something like, “I get this bittersweet feeling of onsra, that what we have is coming to a close.” Then explain the origin of the word and its definition. This can help you explain a feeling you both might feel without saying it.
Telling someone you feel this way may open up the door for talking about the end of the relationship. You can talk about the good things you have shared together. Acknowledging the feeling of onsra could end up making your goodbye more meaningful.
Consider whether the other person agrees that the relationship is coming to an end before you use the word. You might not want to surprise them with your feelings when you are using a new word.;
, Retrouvailles is pronounced ruh-trooh-vahy. It is a French word, and it means the great happiness you feel when you see someone you love after you have been apart for a long time. This word translates as “rediscovery” in French.


This word can help you share the sense of rediscovery you feel seeing the person you love again. This word doesn’t have to be used only for lovers, you can also tell your friends that you feel this sense of rediscovery in your friendship.
You can say, “Seeing you again feels like retrouvailles; a rediscovery of all the reasons I already love you and more.”

, Tuqburni is pronounced ‘tooq-bur-nah. Tuqburni is an Arabic word, and it translates directly to “you bury me”. It describes the incredible and intense feeling of a love for a person that you can’t imagine your life without.


You would use this expression with someone whom you have a serious, committed or deep romantic relationship with. For example, “I have waited so long to feel deep love like tuqburni for someone. Finally, I have you and I have found tuqburni.”
Be careful not to overwhelm a new relationship with this kind of intense emotion. Save this phrase for a relationship where your intense love is shared.
You can also playfully joke with your friends about tuqburni for them.

, Saudade is pronounced saw-’dah-djee. This is a Portuguese word that means being overcome by the feeling of missing a person you love.


If you want a new way to tell someone you love how much you miss them, try using the word saudade. For example, send them a text message that says “I can’t stand this saudade anymore. When do I get to see you again?”

, Koi No Yokan is pronounced ‘koy-noh-yo-kin. It is a Japanese word, and it describes the feeling that you get that you and another person who you have just met will end up falling in love with each other.


For example, if you want to be playful you can tell someone “When I first met you and you were talking about your wine of the month club, I just knew Koi No Yokan. I was sure that we were destined to fall deeply in love.”
This is a cute way to express your delight at getting together. Telling him or her that you knew that it would be love from the start is a sweet way to flatter the person you have started something romantic with.
You can also use this expression if your romantic relationship was slow in the making. This expression doesn’t mean love at first sight, but instead, it is a knowing sense that things are going to happen eventually.

, Mamihlapinatapai is pronounced ‘mah-mih-lah-pee-nah-tah-pay. This is a word from the language of Tierra del Fuego called Fuegian. It refers to that particular look or feeling that is exchanged between two people who desire each other but are for some reason either unwilling or unable to make the first move.


After you are together you can ask him or her, “Was it just me or did we have a mamihlapinatapai moment in the cab we shared when we were just friends?”
Tell your friends about an exciting mamihlapinatapai moment you had with someone. These stories are always fun to hear.

, Kilig is from the language Tagalog and it refers to that ridiculous rush feeling you get when something good has happened for you in love. You are walking on cloud nine when you experience kilig.


For example, you might tell your friends about how you accidently squealed in the library when you read a message someone you like sent you.

, The word for forelsket is Norwegian, and it refers to the feeling of pure excitement and anticipation you have when you are first falling in love with someone. Others may be sick of hearing you talk about that person all of the time, but you can’t help yourself; you’re forelsket!


You might want to thank your best friend after your forelsket is over. You could say, “You really stayed with me through my forelsket!”
If you are in a relationship with the person you love then you can tell them, “You are making me totally forelsket!”

Say ""तिमीलाई कस्तो छ?"",
Use ""तिमि कसरी हो?""","How to Say ""How Are You"" in Nepali1"," This is pronounced ""tee-mee-lai kas-to chuh"". This is supposed to be said casually, to a friend, or someone your age. It is best not to say this in a formal environment.
, as a less common alternative. It is pronounced ""tee-mee kas-ree ho."""

Read through the different translations of I love you.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in Different Languages2"," Take note that in some languages you will say different versions of I love you based on the gender of the person to whom you are speaking. In other cases, there is a distinction between saying I love you to a lover, and I love you to a friend. There is also different intensities of love; I love you's that are stronger and weaker. For example, in Spanish you say “te quiero” to a friend and you reserve “te amo” for a lover. For many, when you say te amo you are taking a serious step in your relationship.

Choose a language that has meaning to one or both of you.,
Practice your pronunciation.,
Make the person you love laugh.,
Make a note of the word in your phone.,
Send the word or phrase in a text message.,
Tell them in person how you feel.","How to Say ""I Love You"" in Different Languages3"," Consider the relationship you have with the person you want to tell I love you. Do they speak any other languages? Are they interested in any particular languages? Or is there an inside joke between you two involving another country that might be fun to reference?


If you just finished watching a television series about Patagonia, for example, learn how to say I love you in Mapuche (Mapudungun) or in Spanish with a Chilean accent. , Use Google translate to practice your pronunciation.Listen to the words and repeat them aloud at a normal volume. Say the words to someone as practice and get their feedback.


Say the words to yourself in a mirror. Say the whole sentence that you plan on saying. Try saying the sentence aloud until you are comfortable.

, Overemphasize the words or say them in a funny ways after you tell the person you love them. You can be silly and playful and keep telling them the words over and over again.

, You can always show him/her the note and explain what it is about the person that makes you feel that way. Seeing that you cared enough about them to made a special note will make them feel loved.

, A text message is a great way to communicate your affection without having to worry about saying the word correctly. Getting a thoughtful text message will make that person feel especially loved and special.

, This can be a more intimate way of communicating your feelings for someone. Find a situation where you can bring up the word. It can be on a walk that you take or during a pause in conversation during dinner.


Don’t worry too much about saying it perfectly, it is unlikely that your loved one will know the correct pronunciation. Also, it is the thought that counts when you are saying I love you.

"
"
Point.,
Name or describe the person the first time they're mentioned.,
Once you've established a person, use classifiers to talk about them.,
Use directional verbs to show actions of the third party.,
Turn your head and use your eyes to indicate movement or speech from/to the third party.,
Use your counting fingers to show multiple third parties at one time.",How to Refer to a Third Party in ASL," If the third party is in the room or nearby, you can point directly to that person to show your conversation partner the person to whom you wish to refer. If they're not in the room, then just point to the left or right. Usually, you point to your dominant side first (and always point with your dominant signing hand). If you've already established a person on that side, point to the other side instead.;
, In ASL, it's natural to first establish a person in the signing space, and then you can just point to that side until you decide to ""put"" someone else there. For example, you might sign MY BROTHER to start a sentence. Now you can just point to the right every time you want to say something about your brother.


If you know a person's name, go ahead describe them (my brother, my friend, etc.) and point to their location in the signing space, then sign NAME and spell out their name. If they have a name sign, give that after spelling, and point again to reinforce that that person will be to the right (or left).
You also may want to add additional information about that person when you first establish them. For example, MY COWORKER NAME J-A-N-E-T LOUD, ANNOYING. You can then tell a story about what that person did, and your conversation partner will have a clear picture in their mind.

, After you establish a third party in the signing space, you can represent them with a classifier. People are shown using a ""1"" classifier (index finger upright) or if you want to show walking, kneeling, falling down, etc. you can use an upside down V classifier. For example, instead of signing word for word ""My sister was running around and fell down on her knees, so I hurried over to her,"" you would establish your sister on one hand, yourself on the other, and then ""run"" two fingers around the signing space, have them ""fall down"" into a bent ""kneeling position"" while you make an expression of pain, and then have the ""you"" hand run over to the kneeling hand.

, In addition to classifiers, you can also incorporate a third party into many ASL verbs. For example, to sign ""Michael asked me,"" you'd point to the right, spell Michael, then bend your finger for the verb ""ask"" from the right side of your body, pointing towards you.

, In the previous example, you might want to ask the question ""as"" Michael. To do this, you'd turn your head left (remember, Michael is on your right side) and maybe look a bit down if Michael is taller than you. You would use facial expressions to take on Michael's personality, as well. You could then do a whole dialogue by turning from side to side, because you've established who's who. You can use your eyes in a similar way. If Michael is walking past you, you could use the ""1"" classifier to move Michael across your body and then follow that finger with your eyes.

, It's difficult to show more than 2 to 3 individuals in the signing space at a time, but if you're talking about a group of five or fewer people, you can improvise with your counting fingers. Use the non-dominant hand to form a number, rotated to the side so that the fingertips are pointing towards your other hand and your palm is facing your chest.


Indicate the subject first. For example, you might sign ""I have three sisters,"" then hold up your rotated three hand.
Point to each finger in turn to describe the people. Each person will reside in a particular finger, and that won't change. So you might point to the thumb, sign a name, an age, adjectives, etc., then hold up your three again and do the same with the index and middle. The thumb now represents the person you described after pointing to the thumb.
Use this system to talk about one, some, or all of the people described. For example, if all your sisters are nice, you can sign ""nice,"" then sweep your finger over all three fingertips. You could also sign nice, then use your thumb and index finger of the other hand to point to thumb and middle of your ""three,"" indicating that only the first and the third sister you described are nice.

Consider hiring a tutor.",How to Pass a Foreign Language Class," Knowing the meanings of words is the foundation of your language study. Try to learn a group of words that are related to each other. You'll be more likely to remember them.If you already have some language experience and want to build your vocabulary, spend time reading in the language. Look up words you don't know. Experts suggest that free reading is the most effective if you already know 3000 to 5000 words in the language.;
, A classic way to learn a large number of words is to make flashcards. Write the word on one side and write the definition on the other. To make the meaning easier to remember, try to include an image. Have someone quiz you or just go through the cards on your own until you've mastered them.For verbs, try writing all the different tenses on the side of the card where you've written the English definition. That way, you have to recall the forms of the verb as well as the definition.
Use different colors to indicate different types of words. For example, use different colors to indicate the gender of nouns, prepositions, verbs, etc. This will help you recall important vocabulary information.

, Simply put, grammar makes up the rules of a foreign language. While vocabulary is important, it's also critical to understand how these words interact. For example, words may mean different things when placed in different orders in a sentence. You'll need to learn the rules that are specific to your foreign language in order to effectively read, write, and understand the language.Use memory tricks to memorize key grammar rules (like mnemonics, learn word associations, and study grammar in context).
Listen to the way native speakers speak the language. Pay attention to word order and the gender of nouns.

, Keep study sessions short, but frequent. Try to review the material from each class at least every few days. You don't need to sit down and study for hours at a time. Instead, stay focused and keep the study session brief. For example, spend 10 minutes every day going over your class notes or spend 30 minutes at the end of the week to review all the material you covered.


Studying on a regular basis will make you feel more prepared and make it easier to build on information the instructor gives. This is especially important with foreign languages.Avoid cramming the night before an exam. While you may be able to study information to pass an exam, researchers argue that you won't be able to remember the information for very long., There's no right or wrong way to take notes, but you should develop a style that works for you. While your notes don't need to be perfectly written, you should be able to read and understand them later on. Your notes should include the main points of the lesson with plenty of details so you understand the concepts later.You can develop your own system of abbreviations so you can take faster notes. If you're having trouble keeping up with the instructor's pace, don't be afraid to ask questions or ask the instructor to repeat something.
Taking notes will help you follow along in class and engage with the material. If you miss a class, make sure to ask a classmate for good notes from the class.

, Try a variety of study techniques. Once you've found what helps you learn, use a combination of tactics. For example, maybe you've discovered that using flashcards to learn vocabulary didn't help you. Instead, you might learn best by repeatedly writing down words and placing them all around your home.You might also try learning through:


Reading stories in the language.
Mnemonics (devices to help you memorize).
Writing vocabulary into sentences so you have context.
Repetition

, Set aside plenty of time for the class. This doesn't just mean time to attend class. It should also include time to study and prepare for the class, time to do homework, and time that you may need to meet up with a study group or the instructor to get help. Set a schedule and stick to it, so you're not rushing to finish an assignment or get ready for an exam.


Don't forget the importance of rest. Research shows that people are able to learn and retain language better when they get plenty of sleep.The National Sleep Foundation recommends that most adults need 7 to 9 hours of sleep, while teenagers need 8 to 10 hours., Your foreign language instructor will most likely hand out a syllabus at the beginning of the term. This contract between you and the instructor lays out what the instructor will do over the term and what the instructor expects of you. The syllabus will include important information, including:The instructor's office location and hours
Requirements (like exams, papers, oral exams, homework) and the grading scale
A schedule of classes
Learning outcomes (several things you should be able to do by the end of the term)
Attendance policy
Disability accommodation

, This is one of the simplest but most important requirements for passing a language class. Regular attendance lets you practice the content in small but frequent amounts. You should also interact and participate in the lessons. This will help you improve your pronunciation and social skills.Good attendance also signals to the instructor that you're serious about doing well in the course. Don't expect much help at the last minute if you haven't shown up for class in a few months.

, Homework may make up a large portion of your final grade or it may only account for a small part of it, depending on the instructor. Regardless of how much it's worth, you should complete all of your homework. Homework can help you recall and expand on the language skills you've learned.


Again, doing your homework shows your instructor that you're taking the course seriously.

, Your instructor will probably test your ability to write the language by assigning a written essay. You may be given a simple theme to write about, but this is your chance to demonstrate your grasp of the language. Try to be as detailed as possible, using correct grammar and spelling.


Avoid using the same vocabulary words over and over in your essay. Show your understanding of the language by using a variety of words in your paper.

, To see how well you can speak the language, your instructor may expect you to give an in-class speech or give a brief presentation about a specific topic. Usually, you're given these prompts ahead of time, so make sure to prepare before hand. Make sure your speech follows all the requirements set by the instructor (uses certain vocabulary, is the right length, demonstrates understanding of the lesson, etc).


Ask to see if you can use an outline when giving the speech or presentation. While most instructors don't want you to completely write out your dialogue many are alright with using a brief road map of what you'll say.

, Practice your interpersonal communication by including dialogue work. Your instructor may use class time to get you and fellow classmates to interact or respond to small conversations. Or, you can get together with another student and try to have a discussion.


Practice speaking with a variety of people so you learn different things. For example, speaking with a native speaker or your instructor can help you with pronunciation. Or, speaking with a peer can help you both work on structuring responses at a slower pace.

, Most instructors include several exams that are worth large portions of your overall class grade. It's important to be prepared for these exams, so you pass them easily. Find out what material the exam will cover and become familiar with it in the weeks before the exam, not at the last minute.


Your instructor may test you by asking you to perform an oral examination. You may be asked to participate in a short conversation speaking the foreign language.

, Understanding dialogue and being able to speak is critical to foreign language learning. While your instructor will probably have you work on conversations in class, you should expose yourself to the language as much as possible.


Listen to radio programs in the language to gauge how much you understand. It's also a good way to see if you have a hard time following along to faster dialogue.
Watch a movie in the foreign language and put English subtitles on. This way, you can see if your translation of the film's dialogue is accurate.

, Your instructor will probably pass out valuable information sheets or outlines for the class lessons. You can often take notes on these sheets throughout the lesson so that you can refer back to them when you study.


Don't forget to read and refer to your class textbook. In addition to giving broad themes, textbooks usually give lots of detailed examples which can help you understand key concepts.

, Ask several classmates to meet up and go over course material together. Keep the group small so you don't become distracted. Meet on a regular basis and go over coursework. For example, meet at the end of every week to review notes from the week's instruction.Write down any questions or concerns you're unable to work through as a group. This way, you can ask the instructor to explain the concepts and you'll be better prepared for exams.

, If you have a quick question, don't hesitate to ask your instructor during or after the lesson. This can clear up any minor confusion you might have. But, if you're having trouble understanding a larger concept or theme, you may want to go to the instructor's office hours. This way, you'll have more time to go over the material.Attending your instructor's office hours is also a good way to show the instructor that you're taking the language class seriously.
Don't wait until the day before an exam to contact your instructor. Instead, ask questions as soon as you have them.

, If you'd like more one-on-one explanation or a chance to work on your conversational skills, hire a private tutor. Make sure the tutor is qualified and will be able to work on any areas you're concerned with. For example, you might want to hire a tutor so that you can work speaking skills. You might hire someone who has experience speaking the language in the country of origin.


Consider asking your instructor to recommend a tutor. The instructor might be able to recommend former students who'd be willing to work with you or fellow colleagues that also work as tutors.
Your school may offer drop-in tutors for you to work with. Check your program's language resources to find out more."

Know the text!,
Translate it yourself.,
Learn all of the vocabulary.,
Read up on the background.,
Read up on other works by the same author.,
Prepare a line by line translation.,
Look at and make a note of all the stylistic elements.,
Practice!,
Read it aloud!",How to Revise for a Set Text Exam," It may sound simple, but this is possibly the most important piece of advice. Read a translation of it in English over and over again. In the exam, if you get stuck on a passage, you can recognize where you are in the text from an odd word you recognize.;
, Even if you have already translated it in class with your teacher, translate it again by yourself. Once you have spent hours poring over what the text could possibly mean, you will know it a whole lot better.

, Make a list of all the vocabulary in the text that you don’t know, or that you do know but are liable of forgetting. Then learn it as you would any other vocabulary: make flash cards, relate them to English words that have been derived from them, group them into categories, etc. You may also want to split the text and the vocabulary into sections, so when you revise, you could do, e.g. the first page of the text and all the vocabulary that was on that page.

, What was happening at that time? If the text refers to any historical events, people or places, read up on what they were. Find out about the author. What was his background? Why, when and where was s/he writing from? If your set text is part of a larger body of work, make sure you know what happens in the rest of it. If you don't feel like translating it too, make sure you have a brief overview anyway.

, Try to translate them too, if at all possible. Figure out what themes/stylistic elements s/he likes to use. If you know the literary style and the habits of the author, it will make them more easy to translate.

, This is possibly the most useful revision tool you can personally make. Write down each line, or clause of the text on a separate line, and write its respective English translation under it, in a different colour if possible. You could also use different font styles and sizes, anything that contrasts the English and the original language text. Leave a space between each English/translation pair of lines. This method makes it much clearer to see which part of the translation goes with which part of the text, compared to simply having two separate massive blocks of text. This is especially important for languages like Latin, where there doesn’t have to be a nominative-verb-accusative word order, and words can be strewn all over the sentence.

, Mark anything you find on a copy of the text, or indeed on your line by line translation. Look at which particular techniques the author likes to use, and be prepared to write about why they are effective in creating an atmosphere, drama, excitement, tension, etc. Check for, for example:


Poly/asyndeton
Alliteration/Assonance/Sibilance
Simile/Metaphor
Word Order
Obscure vocabulary
Emotive language
Imagery
Onomatopoeia
Repetition
Meter/Scansion
Language specific techniques, e.g. in Latin, the historic present or historic infinitive.

, Practice translating portions of the text into English without your translation or a dictionary (unless you are allowed one in your exam, of course). Also practise writing about the techniques of the writer and their effectiveness. If possible, try to find some past papers on the same texts. Although texts are often changed, it is possible that your texts were used in an exam a few years earlier.

, Language is to be heard. So if you are translating a Latin speech or Greek play lock yourself in a room and give a performance of it. You'll be surprised how much of it you retain.

Recognize the key points of Metacognition: think ""multiple representations"" for critical thinking -- not just words, but learning experiences through a set of activities that help students think about their learning:Metacognitive experiences are student's experiences that involve one's current, on-going cognitive endeavor -- using the process of thinking in learning situations.Metacognitive skills include planning the approach to a learning task, checking on comprehension, evaluating progress on a task and maintaining motivation to see a task to completion to become aware of distracting stimuli -- both internal and external -- and so to sustain effort over time.,
Seek ""linguistic intelligence"" (word smart): deal with improving the language for imparting knowledge, accurate word use, selection of phrases, and pauses (such as wait time for student reaction and to answer questions) in oral and written forms, where strategies like thinking aloud while performing a task include self-questioning, such as:
Planning - What do I already know about this topic?,
Evaluate ""logical intelligence"" (reasoning smart): answer a question using a plan and steps -- show comprehension by explaining the concept, applying it, example:


Plan an essay: brainstorm, listing related bits pro and con; make concept maps, flow charts, semantic webs, use bubbles containing your words and connect bubbles with ""kite-strings"" to other relevant words in their bubbles.,
Apply ""mathematical intelligence"" (number/geometric/abstract smart): use analytical logic, using many and varied graphical and verbal representations to:


Describe, draw, use graphs, setup Cartesian coordinates, apply geometry, use color, measure, diagram, use mapping;
Collect data, organize, find patterns and report using: logic, arithmetic, number systems, mathematical operations, algebraic relations, creating a function, sets, statistics, central tendencies (mean, median, mode), chance and probability;
Evaluate mathematical information: solve the word/story problem using a plan, steps -- explain, apply the plan to solve the problem.

,
Project ""spatial intelligence"" (visually smart): instruct students to use their abilities to create two- and three-dimensional pictures (in the mind) for the concrete or abstract subject to apply and transfer it using:


Multiple views/viewpoints to assemble 2-dimensional views: front, back, top, footprint, sides/faces;
Graphical variations, visualizing (realizing), simultaneous information (visual plane and space);
Perspective in 3-dimensional space: visualize depth, think of a focal point, realize there is convergence (a disappearing point), rather than mechanical parallel representations, in the distance/background toward the horizon;
Order, flow, steps, sequencing, presenting sequential information.

,
Use Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence (""body smart""): physical action and interaction, physical stimulus and robust body activities are the best pathways to help them learn.,
Practice musical intelligence (""music smart"").,
Communicate using ""interpersonal intelligence"" (people smart): deal with the skills of classroom management, just a few rules, with many procedures and establishing a rapport and mutual trust with the students for hassle free interaction.

,
Know your ""intra-personal intelligence"" (be self smart): get on useful terms with oneself (self-motivate, plan, start/take initiative, be industrious/follow-through, finish, report out).

,
Help ""naturalist intelligence"" (nature smart): motivate through the ability to work and apply geo-science, the natural environment, to teach using nature, nature trails, field trips, plants in the windows, a school garden, planting trees, etc.

,
Do a formative assessment: decide and plan lessons with the needed complexes of understanding and transmission skills to reach the trainees before structuring the quality and quantity of the training.",How to Put Metacognition in Process for Teachers,"


Metacognition -- student will use prior knowledge to plan a strategy for successful learning, in steps to problem solve, using necessary tools, reflecting on, monitoring and evaluating your results, and modifying your approach as needed.;
, How have I solved problems like this before? What should I do first?
Monitoring - What should I look for in this reading? How should I proceed? What information is important to remember?
Evaluating - What did I learn? Did I get the results I expected? What could I have done differently? Can I apply this way of thinking to other problems or situations? Is there anything I don’t understand—any gaps in my knowledge? Do I need to go back through the task to fill in any gaps in understanding?

, Make connections of your thoughts and knowledge, possibly by using a simple frame of thinking, such as:
(1) Read the essay question; (2) identify the theme or topic of the essay; (3)brainstorm and choose your best ideas; (4) use five paragraphs; (5) the first paragraph states your theme and introduction; (6) develop the body using three paragraphs of evidence and discussion: examples, comparison, contrast, etc. and (7) state a conclusion in a final paragraph. (8) Also, if this involves research, state your sources in the format used by your teacher, school or a standard writing manual/handbook.

,,, Acting out learning as much as possible, activities to walk around when they are learning.Role play as planets, moon, sun, etc., as atoms: electrons, nucleus, neutrons, protons and more by drawing and taping an atom, the nucleus and its orbits on the floor. Let your child move around on it to learn the role of all of the particles. Place objects within their sight and reach.
Use hand gestures, body action, miming of information, etc.,
Display and use the world globe, math shapes such as cube, pyramid, cone, etc. Use manipulative objects: construction sets, Legos, modeling clay, science experiments, props to use in dramatizations, outdoors gear (work shoes, bags to collect rocks, leaves, feathers, plants, flowers, etc.), storage for keeping the specimens they collect, sports equipment, puzzles, dance music,...
Model mathematic skills, addition and subtraction -- give young learners boxes and a set of plastic cubes, have them move them around in the boxes, to illustrate it.

Dimensions (length, width, area, volumes), teach them hand gestures that signify what they are. For example an area of a triangle (1/2 breadth x height) has 3 hand gestures - for 1/2 use one hand sideways to cut the other hand's palm in half, for breadth put your palms together and move them apart horizontally, for height put your hands together one on top of the other and move them apart vertically.


Science -- role play a butterfly's lifecycle from caterpillar to cocoon to butterfly

Experiments, use materials and projects to learn science, mathematics, manipulatives (using objects), etc. -- Conduct science experiments - home chemistry, simple physics etc.


Geography -- Teach your child some dance moves from other countries. Have your child make up hand gestures for various geological formations that they have to learn about
History -- Help your child make a drama about the Indian independence movement and play all the characters

Play silent charades to learn about various historical occurrences



, Use songs, percussion, clapping, singing geometry, rapping math facts, play music during art and other quiet activities.

,,,, This will position the trainer and the trainee on the same wavelength.


Understanding can be facilitated, when participants are engaged and applying the learning in real world problems, relevant situations, and labs, experiments, and involved with ""Eureka!"" experiences. The impact is necessarily different from the intellectual experience created when originally delivering the concept.

Encourage your child to experiment with other learning styles.",How to Motivate Kids to Do Well in School," To motivate your child to do well in school, it’s important to get your child’s perspective on their interests and abilities. Listen to your child and offer your own observations as to where their greatest strengths lie. You may be surprised to learn that you child is interested in a subject that you weren’t aware of.For example, you might ask, “What’s your favorite subject in school? What makes it your favorite?” or “What’s your least favorite subject in school? Is it because you’re not interested in the subject or you think it’s too hard?”
Don’t dismiss your child’s interests if they don’t line up with your own. For example, if your child loves literature and you rarely read, don’t tell your child that literature is useless. Instead, find a way to support your child’s interest—for example, you might offer to take them to library on Saturdays.;
, Set your highest expectations for your child with the subjects that most interest them and where they have the greatest ability. Make it clear to your child that with subjects where they have little interest or ability, you still expect diligent effort but you will consider them successful if they try their best.For example, if you child excels in math and loves the subject, tell them that you expect them to get straight As in math. On the other hand, if they have trouble with social studies—memorizing state capitals, for example—tell them you expect them to put in thirty minutes of work on the subject every night. Tell them that as long as they put in the work, you’re not concerned about the final grade.
If you’re afraid your child simply isn’t trying hard enough in a particular subject, and that’s why they’re doing poorly, making them work in that area every night will quickly decide the issue. If they just needed to work harder, you’ll see their grades rise. If they really have little aptitude for the subject, at least they’ll be learning to put effort into difficult things.

, Goals are important for children to measure their progress and to feel a sense of accomplishment. The right goals can help motivate your child to put in the extra effort to do well in school.Write them down. Children, like, adults, are more likely to put the effort into completing a goal if its written down. Post the list on the refrigerator or on their bedroom door so it’s conspicuous.
Make them specific. Instead of a general goal like “improve reading comprehension,” make the goal specific. For example, “Raise English grade from B- to B+.”

, Looking at a giant pile of work to be done can be overwhelming. If you break the workload down into daily tasks, it can lessen the stress of having to work on many different subjects every week.


Set out specific daily activities that can help your child achieve their homework goals. #*For example, you might write, “Spend fifteen minutes studying assigned reading material every day. Spend another five minutes discussing the material with the teacher or a parent.”

, Children pick up on adults’ attitudes towards the world and reflect those attitudes back. If you disparage school or treat it as something unenjoyable, your child will likely see it that way too.In the morning, try to be upbeat about the coming school day even if you’re not a morning person. This will help teach your child that school isn’t something to dread. For example, you might start each morning by asking your child what they’re looking forward to most during the day.
Instead of talking to your child about how they “have” to go to school, talk about school as an opportunity for your child to learn interesting things and see their friends every day.

, Keeping in touch with your child’s teacher serves two purposes. First, it shows your child that you’re personally involved with their learning experience. Second, it allows you to share questions and concerns with the teacher and get their first-hand perspective on how to help your child do their best.Attend parent-teacher conferences whenever they are held. This is the time your teacher sets aside to talk with you directly about your child’s performance and how they might improve.
Talk to your child’s teacher before or after school. If you drop your child off in the morning or pick them up in the afternoon, set aside five minutes to speak to their teacher about any issues your child may be having.

, Create a study area in your house that is dedicated to homework time. Having this space will reinforce the importance of school to your child and they’ll see that you take school and homework seriously.


Make the space comfortable and inviting, but free of distractions. For example, tape your child’s goal sheet over the desk and include a few plants to liven up the area.
If possible, place the study area away from the living room and your child’s bedroom. This will cut down on distractions like TV, computers, and conversation.
If your child has trouble staying focused, a separate space for homework will ensure that they stay on task. You can even set a rule that your child can’t leave the homework area (except to use the bathroom) until they’ve completed their homework.

, A common excuse from children for their lack of interest in school is that it’s “boring” or not relevant to their real lives. If you can find ways to relate school-work to your children’s everyday lives, they’ll be more inclined to feel interested in the material.Start by asking your child what they want to be when they grow up. If they have an idea, talk about what is required to get there. For example, if they want to be a doctor, talk about the importance of science and math.
Keep up with your child’s curriculum and look for areas where you can provide real-world perspective. For example, if your child is learning about medieval history, find a museum that has displays of armor or other artifacts from that time period.

, Children are more likely to feel motivated to keep trying when their efforts, instead of their accomplishments, are acknowledged. Acknowledging your child’s efforts lets them know that hard work is more valuable than specific results.If your child does well on a test, comment on their hard work. For example, you might say, “Your hard work really paid off on this test.”

, Descriptive words are different than the usual kinds of evaluative praise we give children. Evaluative praise involves judgments like “good” and “bad.” On the other hand, descriptive words simply relate true observations, such as “you got all of your homework done on time.”


Words of praise such as “this is really good” teach your child to rely on someone else's assessment. On the other hand, descriptive words such as, “This paper really demonstrates your knowledge of the material,” is just an observation and has no evaluative judgment. Thus, it will teach your child to form her own positive self-assessment., When your child doesn’t perform up to their expectations, provide encouragement in the form of constructive advice about how to do better the next time.For example, if you child does poorly on a math test despite studying hard, tell them that the two of you will work on a different study method for the next test.
Never put down your child’s efforts. If you criticize your child after they put in effort, they’ll feel like there’s no point in trying.

, If your child isn’t’ living up to their potential or is simply refusing to do their homework, you should make it clear that you expect them to do better. However, you don’t want to be overly critical or push your child away.


Tell your child that if they don’t do their homework you will start taking away privileges such as TV and videogames.
Avoid judgmental words. Never tell your child that they’re stupid or lazy.
Make it clear that any punishment is simply a way to motivate your child to do better. For example, you might say, “TV is taking up too much of your time and you’re not getting your work done. If you can show me that you can get your work done with time to spare, I’ll let you watch TV again.”

, Children learn in different ways. If you notice whether your child is primarily an auditory, visual, or tactile learner, you can help your child develop more efficient study habits.To figure out your child’s learning style, watch how they try to figure out a math problem. If your child is a visual learner they will probably want to see a picture of the quantities in the problem. If they’re an auditory learner, they may want to recite the problem out loud. If they’re a tactile learner, they may want to touch real objects that represent the quantities in the problem.

, Most homework can be adapted to fit one of the three primary learning styles. Training your child to do so will help your child learn more easily and teach them a valuable skill that will keep them motivated when they encounter difficult problems.If your child is an auditory learner, have them read math problems or book chapters out loud. For memorizing, have them use mnemonic devices that use familiar phrases or make use of alliteration. For example, if your child has to remember the four states of matter, suggest the mnemonic Parents Get Lazy Sometimes.
If you child is a visual learner, have them turn math assignments into visual problems. For example, if it’s an addition problem like 8 + 9, have your child draw eight coins on one side of a line and nine coins on the other side. To help your child absorb reading material, have them draw out a plot line or draw a picture of the characters.
If your child is tactile learner, help them finds ways to turn assignments into hands-on projects. It’s not always possible to translate assignments into tactile projects, but if you give your child lots of objects and space to work with, they will often find creative ways to make problems tactile.

, Although children have primary learning styles, it’s important for them to get comfortable learning through other means since they won’t always have the time, space, or materials to translate assignments into their primary learning style.For example, if you notice your child always reads math problems out loud, encourage them to try one problem by drawing it out instead of talking out loud.

Make the room comfortable.,
Arrange desks according to the activity.,
Arrange the room for ease of movement.",How to Resolve Classroom Management Issues1," Try your best to create an inviting environment for your students and yourself! High or low temperatures, hard seats, and poor lighting don’t make for a great learning environment. Remember that your goal is to create a space for students to perform their best.If your classroom has windows, let some natural light and fresh air in. Keep the room at a cool temperature. If it is too hot or too cold, students may start to complain and get distracted from the their classwork.
Create an area with a rug and pillows or beanbags to rest on. This could be reading area or a resting area for students who need a break. Pillows and other comfortable items work best in elementary school classrooms.
Bring in plants to add some life to the room.;
, It is common for teachers to arrange desks in rows that face the front of the room. This is a good seating arrangement if you want students to work individually or take a test. Group work and student interaction, however, is to be expected in a modern classroom. Think about the type of activity you will be doing in your lesson and arrange the desks in way that facilitates that activity.


If you plan to have students do any kind of group work like creating a poster or having a discussion, set the desks up in small clusters of four or five students.
Maybe you want students to be able to talk to a partner, but most of the lesson involves facing the board. Try setting up the room in rows, but set the desks close to each other so that they are touching. Create two aisles so that the classroom resembles a theater.

, It is important that the teacher is able to move around the room easily. This communicates that you are in charge of the entire room, as you can easily approach a student’s desk to check their work or correct behavior. This also makes it easier to talk privately with a student if necessary.Move around the room during your lesson. It helps to have big walkways so that you can move from the front to the back of the room easily. You can do this if desks are arranged in small groups, neat rows, or a large circle.

Create classroom rules.,
Create consequences.,
Be consistent.,
Don’t be afraid to talk to students outside of the room.,
Use a strong voice.,
Subtly address off-task students.,
Maintain a safe environment.,
Keep contact with parents.",How to Resolve Classroom Management Issues2," Rules are key for good classroom management. They create behavioral expectations that you can refer to throughout the year. Your rules must be short, simple, comprehensive, enforceable, clear to the students, and meaningful to you. You should have no more than five classroom rules that cover nearly all possible misbehaviors.To come up with a set of rules, try making a list of all the possible problematic behaviors that can occur in the classroom. After making that list, create three to five short rules that can address all the behaviors on your list.Write the rules on a large piece of paper and hang them in a visible place in the room.
For example, a good set of rules looks like:

Listen and follow directions.
Raise your hand to speak or leave your seat.
Keep your body to yourself.
Respect the classroom and the teacher.
Participate and do your best.



, Once you have a set of rules, you must create consequences for students who break the rules. This is important, because students will test you and break rules left and right if no consequences are given. Talk to other teachers and administrators about appropriate consequences for the students at your school. Also consider reaching out to parents to see what kinds of consequences work at home. Talking to people who know your students well can help you figure out what kinds of things they will respond to.


Consequences should be meaningful to students. If, for example, students enjoy being sent out of the classroom, this may not be a good consequence for regularly disrupting the class.
Remember to match the consequence to the severity of the rule. Consequences might be a time-out, a call home, a zero for the day, detention, extra homework, or a quiz.

, The key to managing a classroom is to always be consistent in enforcing rules. This is where most teachers run into problems. It is easy to let small misbehaviors slide, but not enforcing your rules will lead to a chaotic classroom in a few months and a stressful school year. You must enforce rules from the first day and every single day afterward. It is hard, but you must be confident that consistency makes for a better learning environment. , Sometimes things can get quite out of hand in a classroom. Students can become emotional or disrespectful pretty quickly. If need be, take a student outside of the classroom and talk privately with them.


For example, a student may look very tired and sad when they arrive. You, and other students, might notice that something is not right with them, but you don’t want to draw all the attention to this one student. Instead, talk to the student outside and find out what’s going on. It might be appropriate to send them to a guidance counselor or to let them get some water before returning to the classroom.

, This doesn’t always mean speaking loudly or firmly. Rather, strong voice involves using your voice to manage student behavior effectively. Sometimes this means using a firm and commanding tone, and other times it means lowering your volume to make it clear that you expect a quiet classroom.


Address student interruptions by self-interrupting (or interrupting the speaker). If you are talking and a student interrupts or causes a distraction, stop speaking. Keep your body very still and silent until the student is prepared to listen again. Do this early and often before disruptive behavior becomes a pattern., Off-task behavior is a common classroom management issue. Students use their cell phones, fidget under their desks, whisper to their friends, and so on. Stopping your lesson to chastise one student takes time and may draw unnecessary attention to something other than your learning. Instead, keep going with your lesson and casually walk toward the student that is off task. Your presence at their desk may be enough to get them to put the cellphone away. If not, tap on their desk or give them a serious look.


Remember that the idea is to draw as little attention as possible to the misbehavior. If a tap on the desk doesn’t work, you can quietly tell the student to get on task and move on.

, If students become so disruptive that the learning environment is compromised, you may need to remove the disruptive student. Students who get physically violent must be immediately removed in a calm and safe manner. Although difficult students can cause anxiety, and even fear, try to remain calm and confident that the issue will be resolved.


Extremely disruptive students are a challenge. You must be very firm and clear in giving them instructions for exactly what you need them to do. For example, “Stand up. Pick up your bags. Walk to the hallway. Wait for me out there.” This may be a time for you to talk privately and find out if the appropriate next step is to call an administrator, let the student cool down, give them a different task, or call home.
If students become violent you must act immediately. Call or send a student to get an administrator or security guard. Do not leave the room. You are the adult in charge, and you should not leave students alone in a potentially dangerous classroom. Do not get in the middle of student fights or aggressive episodes. Be sure to follow your school's emergency protocol in this type of situation.

, Your student’s parents know them much better than you do. Receptive parents can be helpful when it comes to managing student behavior. Most parents generally don’t want to hear that their child is misbehaving in school, and it is certainly not the first phone call they want to get from you. If possible, try to make contact with parents to say something positive before problems arise. Hopefully they will be more receptive to your phone calls and will talk to their child about whatever problems you raise.


Talking to parents is not always easy. You want parents to be on your side, but it may be difficult if they get defensive or question you when you critique their child. Remember to be friendly and confident when you speak to parents. Tell them clear facts--not your interpretation--about what is going on with their child. Prepare to talk about solutions and ask them for support in making their child successful."
"
Balance your enthusiasm.,
Prepare engaging activities.,
Create incentives to do well.,
Notice good behavior.",How to Resolve Classroom Management Issues3," You want your classroom to be a calm environment, but you don’t want it to be boring. Be strategic about when to be an energetic teacher and when to be relaxed and serious.You should show the most enthusiasm when you are teaching content or engaging in content-related discussions with your students.
Be calm and controlled in periods that are not related to the lesson. This includes transitions, when students enter and leave the room, and when students misbehave.

, Children tend to misbehave when they are not interested in the lesson. Kids are less likely to be bored if they are engaged in what is going on in the classroom. Every lesson won’t be like a day at the amusement park, but you can mix things up to keep student interest alive. Prepare activities that are both educational and fun.Bring in review games, songs, videos, scavenger hunts, artistic projects, or pop culture related topics.

, Talk to your students in the beginning of the year to find out what kinds of things they enjoy. Do they like movies? What kinds of snacks do they like? How much do they care about their grades? Are they competitive? This will give you a sense of the kinds of incentives to create for learning.


For example, you can create a system where students are awarded points for exceptional behavior or outstanding work. Allow students to turn in their points at the end of the month in exchange for snacks, a movie voucher, or extra credit. Add more excitement by turning the point system into a competition., Always be on the lookout for good behavior. Create a positive environment by focussing on what students do well. Remember that praise should be genuine and truthful.For example, try saying, “I see you’re listening carefully, Alana,” or “Jordan is doing a great job focusing on his worksheet.”

"
Don't allow access to test materials.,
Let students know that there will be several version of the test.,
Give open book tests or allow students to bring notes.,
Give access to test questions before the test.,
Review the honor code before tests.,
Require students to show a student ID to take a test.",How to Prevent Students from Cheating1," It is important to keep test materials secure before a test, including making sure that all copies and the original are accounted for after copying. Some students may try to access test questions before a test, even if that means they have to break into your classroom or office to get them. To prevent this, never leave your keys hanging in the door and don't give them to a ""trusted"" student for any reason.Also, do not assume that tests and answer guides left at school will be safe. If you are going to leave such materials at school, be sure to lock them in a file cabinet and keep the key with you at all times.;
, If you are giving a test or quiz, create two versions. Tell the students that there will be several versions and then give them to alternating students. This will prevent students from assuming that they can cheat off their neighbors and it will help them to focus on their own work.Be sure that you keep track of what test version each student has. This can be done by numbering the version and having the students write what number they have on the top of their tests.
Do not distinguish different versions in a way which students can easily tell which version another student has (for example, by color). Otherwise, students can look around them for other students with the same version.

, One way to prevent cheating is to allow students to bring information with them into class on the day of a test. This forces them to study the material before the test and figure out what they need to bring. This way, the students don't necessarily need to memorize all the information but they will need to know the content overall.


Eventually your students will learn that having the material at the their fingertips is of no use to them unless they have already spent time studying the material.
This will require that your questions are thoughtfully constructed. They should not require simply one-word answers, but instead force the students to synthesize a variety of information.

, If you don't want to have an open book or note test but you want your students to focus their studying, consider giving them the test questions before the test. You can give them a list of more questions than you plan on giving them, and tell them that you will choose your test questions out of this list. That way, they will be forced to review more information than you are actually going to test them on but they will be prepared for the test., If your honor code states that students are not only obligated to not cheat, but also that they are obligated to report any cheating they suspect, this sometimes works well. On assignments and exams, you can require that they sign an honor pledge stating that they did not cheat, nor did they not report any cheating they noticed. You may choose to not grade an assignment or exam which the honor pledge is not signed.


Make it clear what the consequences of cheating are when they sign the honor code. You should also have these consequences posted on the syllabus for the class, so that students can refer to it whenever needed.

, If your class is so big that you don't know everyone enrolled in it, then a common way of cheating for students is to have someone else take the test for them. To stop this, require the students to show you their IDs when they enter and check this against your class roster.This can be done either when entering the exam room or when collecting the exam.
Tell students ahead of time that you will not permit entry into the exam room or not grade an exam if the student does not appear on your roster, the student does not have an ID with them, or the student has a false ID.

Mix things up in the classroom.",How to Motivate Students," The thing about students is that they are exposed to so many different people acting as ""teachers"" in their lives. Everyone and everything is trying extremely hard to stimulate these students, make them think, make them work, and make them into people the world can be proud of. Because of this overwhelming input of stimulus and influence, students struggle to find their own identity and are inherently suspicious of anyone who tries to influence them.


Once they have recognized this, they tend to deal with the constant environmental pressure by adopting one important policy: ""I will only allow you to influence me if you prove to me that you're worth it."" This policy is their mechanism of making sure that the right person gets to them at the right time, and it's a good way of doing it. The only time it becomes an issue is when they get impressed by a person who is a bad influence, or when a good person makes no effort to impress them.;
, If you want to motivate your students, then you have to prove that you are person who is worth listening to. They may be suspicious of you on the first day, but you can work to earn their trust and respect. To do this, you have to stand out to them. You can't do this if you blend into the murky background of life. You need to stand out, catch their attention and hold it. Here are some ways to make a positive impression on your students:


Be vocal. Have an opinion and make sure you submit it at an appropriate time. Avoid talking too much and/or being too opinionated. You need to come across as being informative, intelligent, and as a person who is not afraid to speak their mind, not someone who is arrogant and self-centered.
Be passionate about what you're teaching. Wide eyes, a grin and barely suppressed enthusiasm does wonders for a student. Even if they're not interested in your subject, your manner would amuse them. Most of all, because you are adamantly expressing your love for a subject, they will tend to mark you as a genuine person.
Be energetic. Enthusiasm is contagious. It is also a lot harder for students to fall asleep in class if the teacher is bouncing off the walls (not that I am recommending bouncing off the walls). Make sure you have the energy to market your subject and yourself well.
Put an effort into your appearance. You need to make a good impression; make sure you walk into class looking good. Try to dress a little better or differently than the average person.

, Do more than the average teacher is expected to do. In the case of a student who is struggling to turn in work on time, the next time it happens, call him after class and go through the entire assignment with him. Help the student write it, show the student how to do research, and show him some papers other students have written. This is great because it eliminates multiple problems: if it's the student's attitude, you are eliminating their excuses and if they genuinely were struggling with the work, they know exactly how to deal with it now.


Be attentive, answer all questions and make sure they've completely understood your actions. Make sure you tell them that you will not work with them like this again. Ask them if they have understood and wait for their affirmative response before dismissing them.
Of course, there's a difference between going the extra mile and letting your students take advantage of you. You should give them extra help when they need it, but do not do so if it means sacrificing your principles.

, If you want the students to be excited about what you're teaching, then you'll have to go above and beyond the curriculum. Keep the students updated with recent developments regarding their subject. If you are a science teacher for example, you could 1) Bring an article from Scientific American for the students to read in class or 2) Give the students a summary of the article, show them pictures of the article, ask them questions about the concepts in the article and what certain sentences mean and tell them that you have copies of the article if anyone wants to pick them up after class. The second option is the better one.


You need to understand that it is your job to get the students interested, not the job of the material you present to them.

, Do an extensive class project that is unconventional and fun. For example, your class could put on a science-related (or whichever subject related) play that you could perform at a local museum for younger children. The whole class could write a book that you could publish using a self-publishing service and donate it to a local library.


The thing about this is that the idea has to be different; you have to do it during class time or during some time in school (to avoid transportation and excess time issues) and you have to work with everyone every step of the way.

, Having a good sense of humor can help you engage students, make the material more lively, and make it easier for them to relate to you. The fact of the matter is, if you're serious 100% of the time, it'll be much harder for them to care and to really connect with you. Though you don't have to be a goofball, joking around every chance you get, if you create a more fun environment for your students, they will likely be more motivated and eager to learn.

, You are trying to convince students that you are worth listening to, especially if you are trying to motivate them towards your field of study. You need to exhibit your talents. You are not just a teacher; you are really and truly good at what you do. It is almost like how you would present yourself during a job interview. Be humble about it, but don't hide it. Make sure your pride comes through when you are talking to the students about your experiences or contributions. If you have impressive contacts, invite them over. Try not to ask them to make a speech though; an interview type of interaction would be best.


If your students think that you don't really know your stuff, then they'll be more likely to get lazy when it comes to assignments, or to think that you won't notice if they haven't read the material carefully.

, If a student looks depressed or unwell, call him or her out after class and just ask if he or she is all right. Try to keep yourself semi-occupied when you do this. Look at them when you ask, but don't keep staring until you get an answer. If they say they are fine, don't press them unless you think there's a serious problem at hand. Just say, ""Just thought you looked a bit down back there"" and drop it and continue working. Just the fact that you're concerned is enough for them.


If a student who is having trouble sees that you care enough to notice him or her, then this will motivate the student to work harder. If the student thinks that you don't care whether he works hard or not or don't care how he is feeling, then he'll be much less likely to make an effort.
Consider bending a few rules if a student is really having a hard time. This requires a bit of care, but tends to really establish trust. If a student has been consistently not turning in work and they show up and tell you they haven't completed the assignment again, you need to recognize that something is wrong (even if it is just the student's attitude) and help. Discretely give them a bit more time to do it and make the topic a little bit easier. Yes, it's bending the rules, but what you're doing is eliminating reasons for this to repeat itself. Make sure it is clear that you will not grant extensions like this again.

, Your students are less likely to be motivated if they feel that you are simply lecturing at them and not caring what they think. If you ask them what they think about a certain political issue, a literary passage, or the validity of a scientific experiment, they are more likely to perk up and to speak out. If they feel that you care about what they have to say, they will come out of their shells and will be excited to share their views with you.


Remember that there's a difference between encouraging a healthy debate and having students share their unsubstantiated opinions. Make sure that the students always have evidence to back up their ideas.
Of course, if you're teaching math or a foreign language and there is less room for students to share their opinions, try bringing some additional relevant information about the subject into the classroom. Sure, your 8th grade students may not have an opinion on Spanish verb conjugation in the present tense, but they may have an opinion on the effectiveness of immersion learning if you bring in a relevant article about the process.

, If you lecture all the time, students are likely to zone out. If you want to keep students motivated to learn and keep them on their toes, then you have to facilitate meaningful class discussions throughout your class. Ask questions, not of the class, but of each student directly, calling each one out by name. The fact of the matter is, no student wants to be called on without knowing the answer to the question, and if the students know this is a possibility, they will be prepared with an answer throughout the class.


Not only will this make students more likely to read up on the material and be prepared for class, but it will also make them more excited to come to class, because they will feel that their opinions matter.

, If you have a new class and you stand up before them and tell them how you know they are all wonderful people and in this class they will learn how to change the world, the students won't believe you and they will lose respect for you. What they're thinking is how can you know what kind of people they are without making an effort to find out? How do you expect them to change the world when you aren't telling them what the world is? How can you have the exact same expectation of everybody? And they're right.


To most teachers, all students are the same and so they feel comfortable expressing themselves in that sort of speech, but to a good teacher, each student is different.
Even avoid the ""Some of You"" speech (""Some of you will become lawyers, some of you doctors, etc""). Save the speech for one of the last classes you have with them (not the last class) and make it personal. For example: ""Ryan will find a cure for cancer, Kevin will give Bill Gates a run for his money, Wendy will decorate the world, Carol will probably give Kevin a run for his money..."".
Add a bit of humor and make sure it's obvious to the students that you have gotten to know something about every one of them. These are your expectations for these kids, just as you have proven yourself to them, they have proven themselves to you.

, Expose them to the stimulus that they were blocking off before. Issues concerning people, the community, the country, the world. Anything that is important to you. Anything you want to motivate them with. Now that you've gained their trust and they've decided you're worth listening to... they will. They will try to understand where you're coming from and why you feel a certain way. Even if they don't agree, they will be willing to make the effort.


You may have trouble motivating your students because they look at your subject, whether it's British literature or American history, and don't see how it applies to their everyday lives. Bring in a book review or a newspaper article, and show them that what they're learning does have an impact on the outside world. If they see practical, real-life applications to the subject matter, they will be much more inclined to care about it.

, You'll be amazed by how motivated students get if you ask them to present on a topic either in groups or individually. They will feel the excitement and responsibility of being an expert on a particular topic, whether it's The Catcher in the Rye or electron configuration. Preparing for projects or presentations outside of class will make students more eager to learn, and is a great way to mix up the curriculum and to keep things interesting.


Also, having students present on a given topic will get their peers more motivated to learn. Sometimes, students can get sick of seeing you standing up in front of the class the entire time, and seeing their peers presenting on a subject can be a breath of fresh air.

, Group work can help students get to know each other, make them see the material in a new light, and can help them feel motivated to succeed. If a student is working on his own, he may not feel the same pressure to succeed as he would when working with a group of other people, where he has a designated role. Group work is also a great way to mix up the curriculum, so students do something different during class.


You can also encourage some healthy competition between groups. Whether you have a grammar challenge on the board, group Jeopardy about a given topic, or another activity or game that each group tries to win, you'll find that students get more motivated to participate and get the correct answer when they have some competition (as long as it is healthy, and not discouraging).

, Extra credit assignments can help students take the material to a new level and work to improve their grades. For example, if you're a chemistry teacher and know that some students are struggling, assign an optional book report on a fun-but-science-themed book like The Universe in a Nutshell. Students will have fun appreciating science on a new level and will gain insight into the material while improving their grades.


You can give assignments that show a larger application of your material. If you're an English teacher, for example, give extra credit to students who attend a poetry reading in your community and report on it. Have them share their report with the class; this will help motivate students and will encourage them to go above and beyond, too.

, Students get more motivated when they are given some choices during their coursework. Choices help them feel like they have some control over their learning and motivation. Give them a choice of lab partner, or provide them with a number of options when you give their next essay or short assignment. You can still provide plenty of structure while allowing students to have some choices as well.

, If you want to motivate students, then your feedback has to be thorough, clear, and meaningful. If they see what their strengths are and where they can improve, they will be much more motivated to learn than they would if all they got on their assignments was a written grade and a sentence of inscrutable feedback. Take the time to let them see that you really care about their success and that you would love to help them improve.


If you have the time, you can schedule conferences with students to chart their progress throughout the course. This individual attention will show them that you really care and that you're keeping an eye on their work.

, Give students rubrics, clear instructions, and even examples of successful assignments to show them what you're looking for. If they have no idea what you really want or how to succeed in your class, they will be much less motivated to do well. Having clear directions and a teacher who is willing to answer any questions they may have about the assignment can help motivate them to do well.


Take the time to answer questions after you explain an assignment. Students may act like they know everything, but if you press them, you'll find that there is always room for clarification.

, Though lecturing may be appropriate to your subject matter, the more you can mix things up in the classroom, the more motivated students will be. For example, you can give a 10-15 minute ""mini lecture,"" followed by a group assignment that demonstrates knowledge of the concepts you just covered. Then, you can create an activity on the board, have a student present on an extra credit assignment, or show a quick video about your material. Keeping a dynamic class schedule will keep students motivated and on their toes.


Having an agenda for each class, either on paper or written on the board, can also help motivate students, who like to know what to expect.

Give your students a choice whenever possible.,
Inspire students by introducing activities that relate to them.,
Do not dismiss what your students like to talk about as petty conversation.,
Teach at a level that is challenging and respectful to the intelligence of your students.,
Take your students seriously.,
Be approachable so that students can feel comfortable enough to come to you with issues or concerns.,
Be sure your students understand why they are learning the material.",How to Motivate High School Students1," Offering choices gives students a sense of control rather than feeling constantly directed. For example, you could give assignment themes and allow students to pick from them.


Teenagers with a sense of choice will feel less like there is a huge authoritative presence over them. Additionally, they will feel like they have more opportunities for creativity if you offer them choices.;
, Incorporate popular culture, relevant news, and interesting or provocative themes into your curriculum. These are the things that students are comfortable and familiar with, so they will be more inclined to pay attention.


Read the news and pay attention to what your students are talking about before and after class. There may be a way to connect a celebrity scandal to a topic you are trying to teach if you think creatively enough.

, These are the topics which your students enjoy learning more about. If you try hard enough, you will likely recognize the value in these topics as well.

, If you give students assignments that are far too easy, they will likely tune out. Therefore, opt for levels that challenge a student. Just make sure that you don't raise the level to one that your students find to achieve. Raise the expectation to a level just above their capability.


If at all possible, be available for outside help in order to ensure students understand the higher level topics. It is difficult to spend time outside class hours, but holding office hours drives home the point that you genuinely care for your students.
Check in with your students in the form of quizzes or informal discussion to gauge how well they are managing the challenge level of your curriculum. It is important to make sure that everyone in the class understands the material.

, Teenagers will resent you if they can sense a condescending or pandering tone. Do not underestimate the importance of simply treating them like you would treat any other adult.


This means you should consider criticisms and compliments equally. Students may be able to tell you ways that your teaching could be improved which you may not realize yourself. While the way in which they tell you may not always be respectful, try to consider what you can draw from the critiques, if anything.
Do not enforce silly rules or play games meant for children. Teenagers want to feel like an adult and will resent rules which force them to behave like children. Do not use too many childish games to teach your material.

, Always be open so that they believe nothing they have to say is ridiculous. By doing this, students will be more inclined to let you know when they are feeling uninspired. And when this occurs, consider it a challenge for you to find a way to motivate your student.


You do not need to act as a therapist to each and every student, but it is important to be mindful of external influences in students' lives which could affect their learning.
Do not ever force the student to tell you why they are feeling depressed or uninspired. Try to let them come to you about these issues.

, Oftentimes, students feel a large disconnect between the material and the real world. In addition to teaching the material, teach how the material can apply to the real world both in the workforce and in everyday life.


For example, an English teacher should try to relate how different interpretations of novels can help students think about different perspectives people can have. The teacher could then connect this to how it can help in analyzing people's motive in the workplace, in relationships, in politics or in any interpersonal context.
Try to avoid rote memorization of material. Students will respect the material if they can easily understand how it will be used in the future.

Allow students to use only items that you provide.,
Watch the students carefully during testing.,
Have students take all items off their desks.,
Be cautious about students leaving the room.,
Keep track of who is sitting where.,
Move students you suspect are cheating.",How to Prevent Students from Cheating2," If you are worried about students bringing answers into the test, then supply all items they will need for the test. That way, you can make sure that they are taking an exam with a clean blue book, for example.Letting students know you will be doing this beforehand will prevent some students from trying to cheat in the first place. However, it may drive some students towards other ways of cheating.

, Do not leave the classroom during test administration and keep an eye on what your students are doing. You may have honest students, but even then you should not give them the opportunity to be tempted cheat by leaving the room.


If you are teaching a large seminar class, it is likely that you will have teaching assistants that are helping with your class. Have them watch the students during testing, so that more of the room can be watched at one time., Do not allow students to have cell phones, MP3 players, notebooks, or books on their desks during tests. This will eliminate older ways of cheating, such as writing answers on the desk, and many newer methods of cheating, such as putting answers in their phones, from being used.If you are especially worried about cheating, do not even allow students to have labeled water bottles on their desk, as a common trick is to write answers on the inside of the label and to re glue it to the bottle.
You may also require that backpacks be placed in the front of the room (or some other open space) rather than underneath desks for the duration of the exam.

, If you allow a student to leave the classroom during an exam, ask them to empty their pockets. In general, you should only allow students to leave the room if they absolutely need to. In cases where you do decide that it is okay for a student to leave the room, such as if they need to use the restroom, you need to make sure that they do not take any notes or electronics with them.Allow only one student to leave the room at a time. This will allow you to keep track of who leaves and how long they are gone. If someone is taking frequent bathroom breaks, there is a chance that they have stashed answers in the bathroom.
You may tell a student that they must show you where their phone is, and require that it stay in the room.

, You can create a seating chart, or on an exam booklet cover, you can require students to write down the names of those sitting directly to any direction (left, right, front, back) of them. If an allegation of ""I saw the student sitting to my cheating"" arises, it can make it easier to figure out who to talk to. It also allows you to compare answers of those sitting close to each other for similarity during grading.

This would be especially useful in very large university courses, where students may not know the names of those sitting next to them during the exam.
You can also create a seating chart documenting who sat where, it you have a small class. If you have a large class, number the seats and have students write their seat number on their test., If you believe a student's eyes are wandering too much, reseat them. First, reassure the student that you doing so is not an accusation of cheating, and that you simply want to ensure that they are showing their own work. If they choose to comply, take no action. If they are unwilling to comply, you can assume that they were cheating or had the intention of cheating.If you need to reseat a student, try to put them somewhere where they are away from other students. Being a seat away from other students may make it easier for that student to focus on their own test.

Use software that checks for plagiarism.,
Make homework count for only a small portion of a student's grade.,
Make your expectations clear.,
Assigns group projects and presentations.",How to Prevent Students from Cheating3," Since most students are very technologically savvy, you can use that knowledge to your benefit. Have students turn in assignments through an online software program that checks it for plagiarism.Most universities have this type of program built into the websites that they use for students.
There tend to be more cases of cheating in the computer science department than other departments at many universities, simply because they have great resources for automated cheat checking.

, Making homework count for only roughly 10% of the grade is typically enough to ensure that the students do the assignments. In addition, if you grade the assignments based more on effort than accuracy, this will provide students with little incentive to cheating on homework. Most cheating on homework is in the form of excessive collaboration or searching for answers on the internet. If you use this type of weighting and thoughtfully construct your exams, the exams will enforce the no cheating policy for homework better than you can.The students who choose to cheat will likely have their grades lowered as a result of poor performance on exams, as those who are too used to being able to freely collaborate or use the internet may have a hard time with individual assessments.
This make it so there is very little incentive for copying solutions and not very much energy needs to be put into dealing with cheating on homework.

, If you don't want your students working on homework together, you need to make that clear before the assignment is even given. Some students will work together effectively, which can enhance the learning process. However, it can be a problem if one student just copies other students assignments. Decide whether you want students to work independently and then let them know, so that they cannot claim ignorance of your policy.You can always state that you are OK with students working together, but what they turn in must be their own solutions. This allows them to work together but it also requires them to do some independent work as well.

, There are certain types of homework assignments that are more difficult to cheat on than others. Group projects and presentations are particularly hard for students to cheat on, unless they are all in on it together. In a group, each student will have specific responsibilities and they will be accountable to each other for the final product. In a group, each student will have specific responsibilities and they will be accountable to each other for the final product. When students are working together, individual students will find it harder to cheat, since that cheating will be exposed to their classmates.While group projects and presentations will not eliminate cheating all together, they do make cheating less likely.

Photocopy or scan a random sample of exams before returning them to students.,
Limit a student's ability to change their answers.,
Do not accept any homework submitted after solutions have been released.,
Do not give credit for an answer on an exam that just magically appeared.,
Make regrade request deadlines relatively soon after the assignment or exam was returned.",How to Prevent Students from Cheating4," A very common way of cheating is submitting a modified exam for a regrade. Having a photocopy or scan of the original test will allow you to see if the resubmitted test has been altered. Should you catch a student modifying an exam and submitting it for a regrade, the photocopy or scan becomes hard evidence when you report the case for academic action.


This can often happen with students who are very close to the next grade up, who hope to potentially raise a B- grade to a B, for example. So, when photocopying or scanning a sample of exams before returning them, focus especially on those with scores near the grade boundaries.

, For example, with short answer exams you can draw a tight box around the response or draw a line across any blank space while grading. This prevents students from trying to add to their answer before requesting a regrade.For scantron exams, using pen, draw lines connecting the filled in answer choices before returning the scantron sheets to students. It is like playing ""connect the dots"" but it will prevent students from changing their answer and claiming that the machine made a mistake.
Websites like Gradescope allow you to return exams electronically. After all exams have been collected, you can scan them, match the submissions to students, grade the exams, and then release the grades online. Students will login to see their scores and a scan of their exam submission. This way, students cannot alter their exam prior to asking for a regrade. In addition, homework can also be submitted and graded on Gradescope, so this can prevent the altering of homework assignments after grading, as well as prevent claims of lost homework.

, Once solutions are released you have no control over where they can end up, and the copying of solutions is definitely a possibility for any homework attempted to be submitted after that time. To make up for this strict policy, you can choose to drop the one or two lowest homework scores.


If a student has a good reason for not turning in an assignment on time, they should be given a slightly different assignment from the rest of the class, so that no cheating can occur.

, Require that students show all of their work and/or provide reasoning for the answer they arrived at. It is very easy to simply copy a final answer off of another student on an exam.


If you suspect a student copied off of another student for an exam question or changed their answer after the fact, ask them to reproduce or interpret their solution individually in your presence a few days later. If there is a large difference in their ability to produce that solution during the exam and reproduce the solution individually in your presence, cheating may have occurred.

, Students should only require roughly one week to request a regrade after work is returned. Make the deadline the same for everybody, regardless of whether they picked the assignment or exam up before your set deadline. This way, once the class ends you are not pressured to review a ton of assignments that were returned months ago. Students, especially those near the course grade boundaries, may want to make attempts to seek extra points to raise their course grades at the end of the term."

Avoid lecturing as your primary teaching technique.,
Invite people to your class that students can look up to.,
Do not over test the students.,
Be engaged with your own topics.",How to Motivate High School Students2," No matter how engaging you are, students will likely grow tired of purely listening. Try to encourage discussion and ask questions of the students frequently.


In your lectures, try to keep them light-hearted and maybe try to crack a joke every so often. Do not be too uptight and formal with lecturing.

, These would be role models that students can identify to, such as relevant or local authors, entrepreneurs, and philanthropists.


If the students can see clearly how to structure their learning or careers in order to achieve what these people have, they will be much more inspired in their studies.
Be sure the guest understands what the class is about so that it has some relation to the material.

, Tests and quizzes are an effective way to gauge the students' understanding level, but they can also add unnecessary stress. Students will respond better, and feel more comfortable, in discussions.


It is also important to remember that tests do not necessarily gauge the understanding level of every student. Some students simply do not test well, even if they understand the material.

, Students can tell when a teacher does not care about the topic he or she is teaching. It is incredibly important to try maintaining an interest in your subject.


Try to encourage the administration to allow you to have some wiggle room in creating your own curriculum. It is much ore difficult in public schools due to the common core, but try to fight for freedom in the classroom.

Anticipate compliance.,
Close your requests with the appropriate language.,
Differentiate between discipline and managing behaviour.,
Stop on my SIGNAL.,
Disregard the secondary behaviours.,
Keep your instruction DIRECT.,
Avoid going for the throat FIRST!,
Distract – Diffuse – Disperse.,
Use the assertive “I message”.,
Never make it PERSONAL.,
Model behavior.,
Know when to IGNORE.,
Direct the learning to the MISCREANT.",How to Manage Student Behaviour when Relief Teaching," Generally most students want to behave and very few really want the tension of getting into trouble. So if you give instructions, anticipate that the student will comply and act as if this is the case. For example, in your travels around the room you notice Gina is reading a book and not doing her math. You take the least intrusive path, “Thanks for putting that book away, Gina.” And continue to move around the room as if you know Gina is going to comply. Gina feels your expectation and 99.9% of the time she will comply, because she is not going to get any mileage if she doesn’t. You have already moved on! Consider the alternative action. You say the same thing, but stand at Gina’s desk with arms on your hips and a snarl ready on your lips. You’re ready for a fight and Gina is likely to accommodate you.;
, Close your request. You can close off a request by prefacing your statement with an expectation of compliance. Such statements like “Thank you for closing the windows for me, Paul”. Few students are likely to refuse a request phrased in such a way.

, Relief teachers seem to take things to heart far too often. Learn to differentiate between discipline and behaviour. Discipline is a belief system of values and principles. Children learn that at home. Discipline involves the principles of honesty, fairness and the values of integrity and personal accountability amongst many many more. Teachers don’t discipline students, we manage their behaviour. Parents are still accountable (not teachers) if their child breaks the law, damages property. Society dumps on teachers far too easily. So … don’t reach for the bottle just yet. Ahh heck – go for it anyway!

, Do the class know when you want their attention? Avoid screaming, “Listen Now!” because as a Relief Teacher the class is not attuned to your voice. Try other options like a small bell, clap of hands, a silly bike horn. Experiment with different techniques that will work for you. Whatever you use, it is important to have a STOP SIGNAL at your disposal.

, Secondary behaviours are those that occur when you have a discussion with the student and the student wants to take control. They are 'chase me' behaviours designed to push your buttons, gain a furious response and ultimately distract you from the purpose of the discussion. Some kids are masters at it, having practised it very well at home. OK. So you want Freddie (it’s a shame that, statistically, most of the offenders are boys) to leave the room. You have exhausted all of your positive reinforcement, redirection techniques, warnings and sanctions and need him to leave. The secondary behaviours are the chair being thrown back, stamping, general huffing and puffing posturing. Freddie is building up a real performance for the benefit of his classmates. Don't allow him to take control of your behaviour. Resist the temptation to address the secondary behaviours at the moment. Instead, remember them for later.

, Major long-term studies have proven the irrefutable success of direct instruction (now called explicit teaching) The term refers to a method for teaching that is fast-paced and provides constant interaction between students and the teacher. Direct Instruction is rich in structure and drilling and content. It is starting to become more popular given the current drive for proven results. Many studies have proven its success as a teaching strategy.


What does it mean for the Relief Teacher and how do you DO it? Direct instruction is a sequence of supports:• setting a purpose for learning, telling students what to do, showing them how to do it, guiding their hands-on application of the new learning.

, As hard as it might prove to be, don’t go for the throat first. Start with the non-intrusive strategies. You might have to take a few deep breaths first. You do remember that World War One started with one shot. I have sometimes been caught out by not making a concerted effort to get all the facts first.

, The truth of the matter is that sometimes you are going to be confronted with a disagreement between students. This can happen within metres of a teacher. Here is a simple strategy that (usually) works. Firstly, DISTRACT students from hurting or hitting - what ever is occurring. This might be a whistle or calling out. If you can use humour, now is a good time to apply it. If not - DON'T. Secondly, DIFFUSE the anger by NOT being angry yourself. (Riots develop when both sides are angry.) Avoid shouting or panicking. Be calm - at least sound calm. Keep your directions short and clear. Never give more than ONE direction at a time. ""Bill, thanks for standing over there. John, thanks for putting your hands down."" Repeat if necessary but do not change the directions. ""OK. Let's sit down and face opposite directions."" Having students sit on the ground really has a calming effect. (Watch what NYPD do). and then handcuff them to the nearest pole. Thirdly, DISPERSE. You only need the offenders. Chase the watchers away. (Move on citizens. Nothing to see here) The next step depends on your level of authority. If you are comfortable dealing with the offenders at this point, then do it. I suggest if you are a relief teacher you probably need to pass the offenders over to some one. Now ... that is another article!

, These I-messages are expressions of our feelings. Thomas Gordon, creator of Teacher Effectiveness Training (TET), tells us to structure these messages in three parts. First, include a description of the child’s behavior. “When you talk while I talk...” Second, relate the effect this behavior has on the teacher. “...I have to stop my teaching...” And third, let the student know the feeling that it generates in the teacher. “...which frustrates me.”

, If an important goal is for our students to treat each other with respect, then the responsibility for modelling respectful communication is on you. Words can be very powerful. Be careful how you use them. Be sure that your words focus on the behaviour not on the student. There is a very big difference between saying, ""You are so lazy!"" and, ""You haven't done your homework.""

, Kids love double standards. A teacher yelling at a student for yelling in the playground just doesn’t make sense. Make no mistake, you are on show. The students want to see how you solve conflict. They will often use that as an exemplar.

, Sometimes you have to learn to pick the battles. There is no good coming back with, “We won the battle, General but we lost the war!” Some relief teachers (and some teachers) target the most trivial matters which are blown out of all proportion.

, The student who continually misbehaves is often disengaging themselves from the lesson for a purpose. Perhaps they are finding the work too difficult and do not want to show themselves up as being a dunderhead. Being a rebellious youth is far more socially acceptable. If you suspect this is the case, engage the student in a learning activity that shows the rest of the class they are capable. You have to tread carefully here and manufacture a situation when the student looks good.

Basically, it lays out what you believe about education and how students should learn. You can talk about the environment you want to create and how you plan to create that environment, both physically and emotionally., Your school will have certain consequences and even certain rewards already in place. You can and should use this system as the basis of your own. Build off these and incorporate your own policies, procedures, and rules to create a positive classroom environment for your students.

, Most management plans have some type of positive reinforcement. For instance, you can have kids earn stickers or stars towards a certain reward. These types of plans help motivate students to stay on task., Not every child will be motivated by the same reward. If you choose to do so, you can have a system where each kid chooses her own reward.For instance, some kids may enjoy being rewarded by working in a group, while other kids might enjoy choosing their own activity for a period. Still others may prefer a prize of some sort. Finding what motivates each child can help encourage all personality types.You can also build plans based on age level, as what motivates a second grader will not likely motivate a high school student.
One teacher identifies these six groups as the main motivators: praise, power (helping the teacher), projects (deciding what learning activity to do), people (playing outside, working in a group), prestige (recognition in front of the school), prizes, and praise (affirmation from the teacher)., While positive reinforcement is the best way to deal with behavior in the classroom, you will also need consequences for negative actions, as well. These consequences should be progressive; that is, each one should be more severe than the last one.Stick with consequences that are easy for you to enforce; that is, you shouldn't need to stop everything to enforce it. It's often best to start with a warning, as all kids make mistakes.You can move on to other consequences, such as a time-out, a write-up, or a letter sent home. For instance, you could start with a warning, move on to a write-up, and then go to a letter home. Alternatively, so many write-ups could equal a letter home.

, For instance, maybe each kid starts fresh everyday with consequences. Alternatively, you could have consequences carry for a week.With rewards, you should generally let them carry over for the whole year, meaning that kids keep earning towards rewards all year. Once one reward is earned, you let the kid move on to earning the next one. You could have the rewards get progressively better or just let each small goal speak for itself.

, Rules should be simple enough for kids to understand. They should be to the point with little-to-no gray area. You should also be able to enforce them easily., Make the basic rules. If you word them carefully, you'll be able to cover a lot of ground with just a few rules. For instance, one rule could be to ""Respect the classroom, your peers, and your teacher,"" as that covers being nice to other children, not talking back to the teacher, and not trashing the classroom.Keep it short and simple. Four or five rules is better than 10.Rules should give instruction about what to do, not what not to do. For instance, ""Keep your hands to yourself"" is better than ""Don't touch others."", Start building relationships with your students by being friendly and getting to know each other. Share the rules, rewards, and consequences so they know up front how you expect them to behave. Also, establish a routine. A routine lets students know what to expect each day in class. While moving away from the routine periodically can be effective for special days, doing it often causes students to be unprepared.

, Get your students' parents on board by laying out your basic rules. You can also tell them about the rewards and consequences systems. That way, parents know what to expect throughout the year.

, It is important that you follow the classroom rules, too. For instance, show you are respectful of each student's ideas. It will let them know they can trust you.

, Probably the most important part of any classroom management plan is being consistent with how you implement it. That means enforcing rules even when you don't want to, as kids will come to understand that you mean what you say in the classroom., That is, when you see a child doing well, show her you notice it by saying it aloud or smiling at her. When you see a kid starting to act up, shake your head at her, frown, or making a ""tsking"" noise if you're not ready to give her a warning.Another way you can reinforce behavior is pointing to where you keep the rewards system, whether it is publicly displayed or not., Write up a form letter if one of your consequences is a letter home. That way, you'll have it on hand when you need it. Keep it simple and to the point.This letter should not express anger. Rather, it should lay out what happened in the classroom in a straightforward way.You should have blanks for the child's name, what the child did, and the date. You can leave the blanks on the computer, or print out form letters that you fill in by hand, whichever you find easiest.

Younger students will typically benefit from having the class rules simply worded and posted visibly, while older students benefit from getting them in writing.


Aim for having no more than five big rules, or categories of rules to go over, or you'll lose them.;
, It's important to avoid including vague rules in your classroom rules, or to try to enforce silly things you'll be unable to control. It may annoy you to clean gum off the bottom of the desks at the end of each semester, but trying to police students for gum is a waste of your time. Focus on what's most important.


You don't need to make your students go through a whole list of ""Banned"" items, like gum, phones, or other devices. Simply put ""no distractions"" on your list and confiscate serious things as they come up.

, The simpler your rules the better, but how you explain them is just as important. Remember to repeat the most important information and to check for comprehension. Request that your students respond to keep them engaged, or to repeat important rules or directions to make sure they're hearing you.

, Every class is different. Younger students will need ""simple"" rules explained, while teenagers should be mostly aware of what's expected. Good teachers are willing to go with the flow and change it up depending on what works for each group of students.


Try to remember to explain what you'll be doing in class each day. Avoid just launching into lessons and hoping your students follow. Your students will appreciate knowing why you're doing what you're doing.

, Spend the first few days of each semester establishing the basic ""flow"" of each period, or each day. There are many different ways to organize a day, so lots of this will depend on what you want to do and what you teach, but when students come into your classroom, they should already have some idea of what you'll do that day.


Try outlining the period or the day on the board before the school day starts. This both gives you a reference point throughout the day, as well as the students an idea of what will happen. You could even list a specific instruction on the board for them to start without having to tell them.
Alternatively, you might find it effective to switch up the order of lessons in some groups of students. If math just doesn't seem to be working after lunch, try switching it to another time of day.

, While some teachers imagine that being an old-school ruler-breaker will be the way to establish authority, and teaching does require a certain degree of sternness, it's also important to keep things positive and to remember to praise your students on a regular basis. If you run negative, remind yourself to say at least one positive thing to the entire class each day, and praise specific students one-on-one.


Teaching involves negative feedback, it's unavoidable. But try to limit your negative feedback as much as possible, and talk about it in terms of what can be improved, not what the students ""did wrong."" Look forward, not backward. Teach yourself to say ""What we could do better is"" instead of ""What you did wrong was.""
Don't embellish praise. Even if your students are young, don't condescend to them. Don't tell your students their essays were ""All perfect!"" if they weren't. Praise the work your class put in, the behavior, and the effort, not the quality, until the quality praise is deserved.

, If you are engaged, your students will be too. You'll quickly learn what works and what doesn't, so don't be afraid to take risks and try new projects, styles of teaching, and activities. You can abandon failed experiments when they come up. try to keep it fun.


Aim for at least one new lesson or project per year to try to keep yourself engaged. If it works well, keep it. If not, never speak of it again.
Avoid convoluted point-based behavior systems. Token systems that involve a complicated set of rules for behavior and other methods tend to confuse students more than excite them. Keep it simple.

, The less you have to say each day, the better off your classroom will be. Whatever you're teaching, it's better to keep students active, instead of passively sitting and listening to you talk. try to limit this as much as possible and keep the day activity-based.

, Students will be forced to pay attention and engage with lessons if they're called on regularly. This also has the effect of encouraging students to contribute and talk when they have something to say, rather than waiting to be called on when they may not have a good answer.

, It's great to play the occasional game, break into small groups, and do some solo free-writing in a class period, but you wouldn't want to do too many of the same types of tasks in one day, or in the same week. try to space out different kinds of activities to keep things fresh and avoid boredom ruts.

, Maybe every Monday will involve a free-write, while every Friday will involve some kind of group activity. Try keeping things consistent from week to week so your students will be able to anticipate things and you'll have to explain less.

, It's helpful to give short and simple tasks to break up the work and the routine in the day, rather than giving students long multi-part projects that will bog them down. Consider breaking up assignments into smaller chunks to make it easier on your students and keep them engaged.

, Most discipline problems are better handled before they start. If you've got problem students, it's important to have the consequences of actions clearly defined and to follow through with the consequences swiftly.


If a student forgets to bring their textbook to the classroom, what is the consequence? What if it happens again? What if the student actively defies you? You shouldn't have to struggle for an answer to these questions when they happen. Decide beforehand.

, If you start making exceptions for some students, the rest of the students will notice and your authority over the classroom will suffer. If you're going to punish one student for talking out, you've got to punish others for the same task. For this reason, it's important to only establish rules that you will be able to enforce and to enforce those rules.


Rules aren't always dissuasive to students. It's important to remember that your students will forget pencils, screw around during work time, and generally break your rules. It's going to happen. If you have a difficult to enforce rule like ""Three typos in a paper results in automatic failure,"" you can bet it will come up just as often as it will encourage your students to proofread.

, It's not generally a good idea to ""make an example"" of problem students. This can backfire quickly and easily, especially if you're an inexperienced teacher. Instead, it's important to take class clowns or troublemakers away from their audience and talk to them one-on-one. You'll see the stony exterior of these students start to crack in private.Arrange a conference with problematic students' parents, if necessary. Often, getting the student's parents on your team can be a quick and effective way at corralling trouble-making students.

, Ideally, your classroom should be neither too hot nor too cold, which produces the best results for student performance.Every now and then, though, you'll have a class full of goof-offs and troublemakers that are difficult to quiet down. If you're having consistent problems with the behavior of your students, consider bumping the temperature of your classroom up a few degrees to keep them slightly drowsier.

Decide which rules are most important.,
Choose no more than 5 rules for your classroom.,
Make sure students know the rules.,
Outline consequences.,
Post the rules.,
Have the students make a commitment to the rules.,
Use non-verbal communication.,
Praise students for acting appropriately.,
Get parents involved early on.,
Give students tools for interacting with each other.",How to Maintain Classroom Discipline1," Think about which rules will keep your class a safe and fun learning environment. Design rules to reflect this goal. These rules will be different depending on the ages of the students and the type of class you’re teaching. Some sample rules might include:


Treat others with respect.
Take care of yourself.
Take care of classroom property.
Raise your hand to speak or to get someone’s attention.;
, This will make it easier for students to remember them. These rules will guide behavior in a variety of circumstances so that you don’t need to spell out rules for every scenario., Take time on the first day of class to cover your classroom’s rules. Explain what each rule means. Give examples of how rules are followed or not followed.

, Tell students about consequences for breaking the rules. These might occur in stages, such as a warning, then staying after class, then detention, then visiting the principal, and so on.


You might include a time-out or break for younger students. Younger students who are disruptive may need to be removed from a situation for a few minutes to recover their attention. Then they can rejoin the class., Make a rules poster and hang it in the classroom. Phrase the rules in positive ways. For example, instead of saying, “Don’t push other people,” you can write, “Treat others with respect.”, Ask the students to come to an agreement with you about the rules. They can sign a pledge form or even just raise their hands. In doing so, they will promise to uphold the class rules. Another way to get students to buy into the rules is for students to take ownership of them. Get their input when developing rules for the classroom.Take time every now and then to talk about the rules and review them with students.

, Using hand signals, body cues and other tactics can be helpful in getting students’ attention. For example, you might turn the lights off and on when it’s time to wrap up an activity.Hand signals work particularly well with primary grades. Changing the non-verbal cues periodically will keep students from getting bored with them., Make a positive example of students behaving properly by letting students know when they have followed the rules. By showing students what good behavior looks like, they will know how to model the behavior.Make sure to praise different students. Don’t always praise the same few students.

, If there are discipline problems at the elementary school level, it can be helpful to get in touch with the child’s parents. Think about doing this before the discipline problem becomes serious. Earlier intervention can redirect a child away from problematic behavior.

, Reinforce positive interactions by giving students tools to handle disagreements and miscommunications. Having tools to use for these interactions may help diffuse potential discipline problems.


For example, talk about how students should ask another student for permission to take something. A student should look directly at the other student, wait until she is listening, and ask politely.
Give students tools if they disagree with each other. For example, have students look calmly at each other and say, “I understand how you feel.” Then the student can explain his opinion calmly.

This approach works well for a variety of settings and learning goals. Use the following points as your guide for designing how students will complete an activity with good behavior and success:C – Conversation: Can students talk during this activity? With whom? About what?
H – Help: How should students get your attention if they need help?
A – Activity: What is the objective of the activity?
M – Movement: Can students get out of their seats for the activity?
P – Participation: How will students demonstrate that they are participating?
S – Success: If students complete the CHAMPS expectations, they should be successful with the activity and good behavior.

, Students need to know what to expect in the class. Middle schoolers especially appreciate knowing your expectations and boundaries. It is important to follow a routine. Keep your class relatively structured so that students know what’s coming next., Middle schoolers tend to get distracted easily. It’s good to mix up your routine every so often with spontaneous and unexpected activities. They appreciate active learning experiences that come out of the blue., Your students are curious about you and want to hear stories about your life. Don’t share everything, of course, but relating stories about yourself from time to time helps transform you into a human being that students can relate to. Likewise, get to know your students. If they feel that you’re invested in their interests, they will be more likely to respect you and behave properly., Treat every day as a new opportunity for success in your classroom. Middle schoolers can swing wildly with emotions at this age, and having patience and positivity will make your job more enjoyable.

, When you speak in a normal voice, students will typically respond by also speaking in a normal voice with moderate volume. If the classroom is noisy, don’t respond by raising your voice. Rather, you might start speaking in a normal voice so that the students need to quiet down to hear you. Or, you might wait to speak until the students are quiet, Assign new seats to your students every month. This mixes up who sits next to whom, and can help eliminate some behavioral problems. Place a name card on each desk to assign seats., Having an orderly classroom may help students act more orderly. If the classroom is messy or disorganized, students may not take you as seriously., One of the easiest ways to bring on discipline issues is to bore your students. If your lessons are unclear, disorganized, or not engaging enough for the students, they may lose attention. Keep students engaged and focused by delivering lessons that elicit interest., Keep moving throughout the classroom when you’re teaching and when students are doing group or individual work. Students notice that you’re engaged with their progress. Give hints to students as they work on problems., "

, Show interest in your students by getting to know them. Make sure you know their names. Find out other information about them by asking questions.


Keep in mind, however, that you shouldn’t become the student’s close friend. It’s important to maintain a level of distance in order to preserve your authority in the classroom. Otherwise, a student may seek special treatment or favors, especially when dealing with a discipline issue., When your students are engaged in the class material, they will take more responsibility in the conduct of the class. Plan out interesting and engaging lessons and incorporate fun activities to keep up their involvement.For example, take simple polls in the class to determine how students feel about a particular issue.

, Even though these students are teenagers, they may still need to work on their social-emotional skills. Help students problem-solve their issues with friends and classmates.For example, if a student misbehaves or upsets another student, help this student come up with his own method of reparations that will be a meaningful solution.

, Treat your students equally. Although you might have favorite students, don’t show this to your students. Apply discipline evenly across the board.

, Treat every day as a new opportunity for success in your classroom. Don’t assume the worst of your students.

, Keep moving throughout the classroom when you’re teaching and when students are doing group or individual work. Students notice that you’re engaged with their progress. Give hints to students as they work on problems., , If you need to talk with a student about discipline, don’t do so in a way that humiliates the student. Take the student aside or talk to him outside the classroom. Don’t use the instance as a moment to embarrass the student in front of his peers."

Include rules on your syllabus.,
Talk about your rules on the first day of class.,
Look and act professionally.,
Get to know students by name.,
Explore the discipline issue before acting.,
Keep a paper trail of discipline problems.",How to Maintain Classroom Discipline4," The college classroom is full of adult students who should not need to be told how to behave. It is a good idea, however, to be very clear on your rules for your classroom.


For example, you might include rules about participating in class discussions. This might include speaking respectfully to classmates and refraining from personal attacks.
Also consider including policies regarding academic dishonesty, technology use, handing in assignments, and so on.
Check with your institution to get proper wording on college-wide policies.

, Set up the class from the very start with your expectations for classroom conduct. Give examples of how these rules are put into effect and how you will implement consequences.

, If you want your students to take you seriously, it’s important to look and act professional. Appearing too casual may make your students doubt your authority.


Although you should maintain professionalism, you don’t need to be completely inaccessible to students. You can reveal things about yourself that give you more of a human dimension, so that students understand where you’re coming from., Oftentimes, the college classroom is a huge nameless group of students. This creates and maintains distance between the students and the instructor, which can make students feel alienated. If you know students by name, you can create a collegial environment in which students feel invested.

, If a student is causing disruption by repeatedly arriving late to class, consider possible reasons for this. Pull the student aside at the end of class or talk with him during office hours. It may be that the student is commuting from a job to school and can’t get to class on time. In this case, you might make a special exception or suggest that the student take a different class to accommodate his schedule., If you encounter discipline problems, be sure to document every step that you’ve taken. Talk with your administrator or supervisor about your department’s appropriate procedure for handling discipline problems.

Break students Schoolwork into smaller chunks.,
Offer Students a Choice


Sometimes students act out because they don't get what they want or because they want attention.,
Tell/show students the agenda for the day


Occasionally students will misbehave or portray certain behaviors because of a surprise in their day.,
Have the agenda for the day in a place that all students can access and explain the day in the morning.,
Rearrange the classroom setting.",How to Improve Student Behavior in the Classroom,"


Many times students will act out or misbehave due to the fact that they are overwhelmed by how much work they have to do. What this strategy suggests is breaking up what you want students to do/learn into more manageable chunks. In between each chunk give the students a little break. The source here calls these breaks, fun breaks. These fun breaks can be as simple as having students jump up and down for a minute or two. Giving students breaks can also encourage them to act accordingly and work hard so that they can be rewarded with fun breaks.;
, This strategy can help to reduce behaviors due to these wants of students. What this strategy suggests is giving students the option of choosing something for themselves. For example, you can give students the chance to decide where they want to sit, who they want to work with, what activity they want to do first, and so on. This gives students the feeling of having attention because it is what they are choosing to do, but it also gets things done.

, This could be something as simple as not knowing they were going to watch an educational movie or that they would be working on addition in math. These surprises can cause students to be overwhelmed or have anxiety. Something teachers can do to prevent these behaviors and feelings is to let students know what they will be doing for the day.

, This can help students to prepare for what they will be doing and could help them to be less overwhelmed.

,


Many times students misbehave due to the fact of who they are sitting by or how the classroom is set up. Something as simple as rearranging the classroom or the seating chart can prevent misbehavior.

As difficult as it may be at times, try to control any feeling of dislike you have for a student. Work to overcome any prejudice you have toward a particular student or type of student. Treat each new day as a chance to begin again if you've had a bad experience with a student.;
,


As soon as possible, learn their names and some of their interests. Being able to talk about sports, pets, travels, hobbies, music and other things that matter to your students helps build rapport.
Be aware of any special needs your students have. Medical conditions, language difficulties, and cultural differences can affect learning. Being aware helps you connect and avoid problems and misunderstandings while being able to personally assist your students with any special needs they have.
Express concern when bad things happen. A death or illness in the student's family, for example, can seriously alter student behavior. If the student trusts you, he will more likely share personal problems. You may then be in a position to refer the student to a school counselor if necessary.

, It is a mistake to get too personal with your students, but sharing stories about your children or pets is certainly a way to bond with them. Talk about a sporting event or a movie you saw. Share pictures of a trip you took. This makes you more human and approachable.

, Although you hold a position of power, your role of instructor should be one of facilitator and guide. Keep your students' best interests in mind at all times.

, Endeavor to be both fair and consistent both in the classroom and elsewhere on the school grounds. One method used by many teachers who work with younger students is assertive discipline, a system where the student is held accountable for his actions and knows the specific consequence which will follow misbehavior. Actions and consequences are posted and understood by all.

, Make lessons interesting and stimulating. Student motivation is essential for a successful learning experience. Show that you are a professional and know what you are doing.

, If your students feel they can talk to you about questions and concerns they have, they will trust you.

,


Let students know that failure is a part of learning. Make sure every student feels that it is possible to succeed and even excel.
Ridicule and sarcasm should be discouraged. When students respect each other, they feel safe.
At the same time, students need to know that you expect their best efforts. Insist on high standards. Students should value their successes.

, Look for ways to make these connections if even for a few minutes a day. Students who are shy or difficult especially benefit from a one-to-one relationship with their instructor.

, Teachers are humans and there will be times when you may lose control. But try to behave as a responsible professional at all times.

, This can be a delicate balancing act, but when your students are able to make some decisions they develop a sense of ownership of the classroom or the course. Teachers who are too strict often find they spend more time trying to maintain control or student interest than they do teaching.

Reward the student.,
Be enthusiastic yourself.",How to Help a Stubborn Student Become More Interested in Studies," Ask the student why he or she isn't interested in his or her studies. If you know the reasons that the student has for lacking interest, you will have a better understanding of where the student is coming from. It will help you to find solutions tailored to what might interest the student.;
, It can help to tell the student that everyone has to do things they don't much like in order to be able to do things that they do like. Explain that this applies not only to studies but also to work, keeping house, getting along with people we don't much like, etc. If the student can understand that life is about balancing the undesirable tasks with the fun things, it can sometimes help to clarify that it's short term pain for long term gain. In fact, try to use an analogy with something the student enjoys, such as sports, gaming or fashion. For example:


""You know how sometimes when you're playing a game on your Xbox, you have to play a lot of levels before you can get the prize or reward you're after, studying can be the same. Sometimes you have to learn all the sums or words off by heart so that you can then get into the more inventive and free thinking work that does interest you.""

, Use these to create study regimes that have more interest for the student. For example, if the student is really interested in cars or fashion, try to tailor the learning materials to focus on these areas. In math, the student could be learning about how many meters of cloth are needed to make an inventory of clothes or how many metallic sheets are needed to fulfill an order of new cars. In art, the student could be asked to paint a dress or a car. In science, the student could be asked to research the strongest fibers or how to make a car more aerodynamic. By shifting the focus to something the student cares about, the learning process can be made a little more easy and a lot more interesting.

, If the student feels anxious about failing or incompetent, you'll need to work on improving the student's thinking abilities as much as their learning abilities. This isn't a time for cliched ""think positive"" sayings; it is a time for getting to the root of what makes the student feel so lacking in confidence and scared of failing. It also means looking at how you might be fueling this fear, such as expecting too much of the student or demanding responsiveness before the student is ready.


If your child has high standards of perfectionism, is anxious or depressed or has a learning disorder, it is a good idea to get help from a qualified therapist.

, Learning skills are different from learning a subject. These are such things as taking notes, reading to comprehend, breaking down text, skimming, learning how to revise properly, etc. None of these skills are innate and need to be taught. They are not always taught well in the school system, so you may need to set aside some time to address this in detail. Once the student has grasped learning skills, he or she may find learning a lot easier and more enjoyable.

, Choose a reward that acts as a good incentive, such as cake or money. Any reward must be directly linked to achievements and should not be the reason for doing the study. Always clarify that the learning process is as important as the end result.


Rewards can include a family round-up of achievements each week. This makes the achievements more public and acknowledged by everyone the student cares about.

, The student will pick up on your own disdain or dislike for any subject and may simply use this as an excuse to not perform. Keep any such thoughts to yourself and instead, express interest. And with that, you may now dance and drink tea in celebration when your student child rushes upstairs to grab his or study books.

Use a THINK - PAIR - SHARE strategy.,
Have a CHAT TIME agreement.,
Seat the students in single desks facing the board or teacher and then move them around the room to talk.,
Balance passive tasks with group work.,
Vary everything about the lesson - talk softer, talk faster, speed the activity up, slow it down.,
Use a conch (or similar).,
Break up class time with some physical activity.,
Try an investigation where talking is an essential part of the activity.

,
Play non-invasive music.,
Listen.",How to Manage a Chatty Class While Relief Teaching,";
, Have an agreement that every 20 minutes, give students a 3 minute CHAT TIME. When the chat time is over, restart the timer started for another 20 minutes. It works well.

, When you call them back to their chairs, ensure they know that it is a NO-TALK time.

, Students often get chatty after prolonged periods of passive activity. Balance these passive periods with active periods.

, Sometimes this can refocus a group.

, Remember Lord of the Flies? Have a discussion time where only the CONCH holder can talk. This activity is best completed in a circle but can be achieved while students are seated. Instead of a conch, use a foam ball that can be passed by throwing.

, A chatty group can sometimes benefit by a physical game. Always carry a set of tennis balls so you don't have to rely on getting sporting equipment. There are hundreds of games you can play with a tennis ball, including just throwing and catching with a partner.

,, Some groups just like a bit of noise to fill the vacant space left by a silent activity. Try playing non-invasive music if you want the students to do a silent activity.

, Honestly, just stand back and see whether the noise if ACTUALLY working noise. Perhaps the talking you hear is really discussion about the activity you are doing. If it is not interfering with the learning, then go with it. Maybe even join in.

, Under FERPA, once a student has turned 18, you may not share information with his her parent/guardian unless their parent/guardian claimed them as a dependent (as defined by the Internal Revenue Code) for tax purposes or the parent/guardian was appointed as a legal guardian by the court because the student is incompetent. http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html The usual definition of incompetent is having an impairment (disability) that would prevent someone from managing his or her own affairs (i.e. medical affairs, financial affairs). If you violate this, the student may file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education Family Policy Compliance Office. The number is 1-800-USA-LEARN (1-800-872-5327). Their address is 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-852.

Use the LEAST system.,
Remain calm.,
Address conflicts away from other students.,
Don’t get into arguments with students.,
Use the conflict as a teachable moment.",How to Maintain Classroom Discipline5," The National Education Association developed the LEAST system to give teachers a strategy for handling conflict in the classroom. Start with the first step and, if necessary, move to the next step. Progress through the steps to deal with classroom conflict.L: Leave it alone. If the disturbance in the classroom is minor and will likely not recur, ignore it.

E: End the action indirectly. When a student disrupts the classroom, let him or her know that you see their actions. Give a nonverbal sign, such as raising your eyebrows, waving your hand or walking toward him or her.

A: Attend more fully. Ask the student to tell you about the issue. Ask what’s happening and who is involved.

S: Spell out directions. Remind the student of the rules and consequences. Plan to follow through with consequences after you have warned the student.

T: Treat student progress. Make notes about the discipline issue. Write down what happened, who was involved, when it happened, and what your response was.

, Keeping a level head is the best thing you can do in a conflict situation. Do not show negative or angry emotions to students. Instead, stay calm and collected. Talk in a normal voice.


It may help to take a couple of deep breaths to calm yourself down., Take the student out of the classroom to talk about the conflict. This will take the student out of the immediate physical situation. It will also remove him from his peers, who may be contributing to the discipline problem.Don’t involve other students in the conflict.

, Remain neutral with students. If a student is trying to make you argue with him, don’t rise to the bait. Instead, maintain a firm yet calm stance.If the student continues to try arguing with you, say, “We will discuss this after class.” This closes down the conflict momentarily., If an argument arises in class, talk about it during the next class session. Ask your students how they would have dealt with the argument. Have them think about how they can understand perspectives that they don’t agree with.This can work especially well when you are talking about sensitive issues in your class. If the discussion gets heated, ask students to take a moment to reflect on the issue in silence. Then ask them to reflect on why the discussion has gotten so heated.

"
"
Keep the other students safe.,
Keep calm and neutral.,
Do not touch the student.,
Send a student for help.,
Document the incident.,
Contact the student’s parents.,
Talk with your students about the incident.",How to Maintain Classroom Discipline6," If a student starts to get violently angry, your first priority is to keep the other students safe. If there is bullying going on in your classroom, learn strategies to stop bullying.
You might think about dismissing the class early if the situation escalates.

, Don’t engage with the student until he has calmed down. Remain calm yourself, and don’t take sides.

, It may be a natural move to put your hand on the student’s shoulder to try calming them down. But when someone is angry, it is sometimes unclear what they may do in response. Maintain your distance from the student., If the situation has escalated, ask another student to get help. Having another teacher or person of authority may help diffuse the situation and can give you support., If there is a troublesome incident, such as a violent or excessively angry student, you should keep a record of what happened. Immediately after the incident occurs, write down what happened. Include details about what happened, when it happened, the names of those involved, and so on.


Give a copy of this account to your administration. Also keep a copy in case a parent wants to see it.

, If the incident was severe, you or your principal will likely need to contact the student’s parents. Tell them the facts about what happened. Don’t add in your opinions. Stick to the facts.

, Use the conflict as a teachable moment. This is also a good time to reassure your students that they are safe in your classroom.

Acquire ice lolly sticks.,
Write a name of your students on one side of the stick.,
Place the ice lolly sticks in a cup.,
During the lesson, instead of making them put their hands up, pick a name from random out of the cup and ask the person a question.",How to Get Pupils to Behave in Class1," Get enough for each student in the class to have one.;
, Each student should have their name written on an individual stick.

, Make sure the side with the name on is at the bottom of the cup.

, Students in the class would then have to pay more attention in order to get the right answer in case they are randomly picked.


Students with anxiety disorders or other disabilities may not thrive with this method, and may become too panicked to participate well. Consider not having a stick for them, or finding a less unpredictable way for them to participate.

Think of a prize.,
Pick the 'secret student':


If you are doing the prize for the grade, ask the homeroom teacher(s) to participate in this and pick the student during homeroom.,
Tell your class that one of them has been selected.,
Monitor the student throughout the day/lesson.,
The next day/lesson, if the selected student has overall acted good in the lesson, announce the student to the class.",How to Get Pupils to Behave in Class2," It could be for the whole grade (like a school trip to someplace nice; a water park for example, or you can give a prize for the individual student (like chocolate or candy).

,
Pick from random out of your class. You can use the idea from the 'Ice Lolly Method' to pick out a random student.

, Don't say who, even to the student (hence the name 'secret student') and tell them that if they are on their best behaviour the selected student will win the prize.

, Be sure to not make it obvious, though, or other students will start misbehaving knowing that it's not them. If the prize is for the grade then ask other teachers who teach your students to tell you how the student has been acting.

,


If the prize is for the selected student only, give them their prize, if it's for the grade, select a target of well behaved secret students and if they reach it they can have their award.
If the student has overall acted badly, don't announce them to the class and tell the students that the 'secret student' misbehaved. Don't say their name to the class, though; it may embarrass them.

Dress smartly.,
Don't go on the computer while students are working.,
Use traffic lights.,
Change seats.,
Keep the cafeteria healthy.",How to Get Pupils to Behave in Class3," Students may think they can misbehave and that you are laid back if you are wearing something like T-Shirts and Jeans. Try wearing button-up shirts with ties and plain dark trousers. Avoid wearing too much bright colours. Don't go overboard, or students could feel scared of you a lot of the time in the bad way.

, Students will think they can mess around while you are not paying attention. Instead, walk around the class to observe and make sure that students are working and not just chatting.

, Give each student 3  pieces of paper, one with green, one with red and the other with orange. Tell your students that if they understand the work to put the green piece of paper on top, if they somewhat understand to put the orange piece of paper on top, and if they don't understand at all to put the red piece of paper on top. This will help it be easy for you to tell if a student needs help. Sometimes when students don't understand the work they will give up on it and talk with their friends.


Make the paper smaller so that they don't take up too much space.
Laminate the paper to stop them from drawing on it.
If a student is continuously putting up red and giving up on the work, try motivating them and encourage them to give it a go.

, Monitor chatty students to see who they are most likely to chat to and move them to sit by more hard working and quieter students.


If you don't know a class that well, try changing seats after a while to get to know who they work well with and who they misbehave with.

, If your cafeteria supplies sugary drinks, ask for them to replace it with juice or water. While energy is necessary for pupils to learn, too much sugar could cause them to be more hyper in lessons and not pay attention.

Be an effective monitor of students' behavior.,
Make sure that students' needs are being met.,
Move around the classroom.,
During group work, circulate around the room.",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom1," This is because it will put pressure on students to comply with the classroom rules and procedures since they know they are being watched. This strategy is a preventative strategy, meaning that it will help prevent negative behavior from occurring.


Intervene immediately if one student is bothering or bullying another.
Students may act out if they feel that you aren't paying enough attention to them.;
, Students may behave oddly because they are overwhelmed, or it's the only way to communicate.


Flopping on the floor or noncompliance usually mean that a student is overwhelmed, and may need a short break.
Drinking from the sink probably means they are thirsty.
Difficulty staying in their seat probably means they need more activity in their day.

, Move around as you teach, and don't leave your back facing the class for long periods of time (Evertson 135).

, This will allow you to help students who need it, but also keep an eye out for warning signs of stress. It may be difficult to monitor students during individual work as well, since some students may need extra help and attention than others, who may become jealous.


Encourage students to ask their neighbor for help before asking you (Evertson 135).

Teach autistic/sensory children about the signs of a meltdown.,
Teach self-calming techniques.,
Teach them how and when to get an adult.,
Keep a box of stim toys.",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom2," Encourage them to recognize when they are overwhelmed, and to communicate that they are distressed to an adult. If you notice mounting distress, ask if they need a break.


You can set up a calming down corner for this purpose.

, Behavioral issues may arise when a child becomes overwhelmed by emotions or stimuli, and they may not know how to calm down. Teach them how to use...


Counting
Deep breathing
Imagery
Stimming (rocking, fidgeting—common in autistic students)
Self-talk, Some problems can be solved by deep breathing; others require adult intervention. Tell them to try to solve it by themselves, and if they can't, they should get a grown-up.


Teach assertiveness: ""I need help with _____, please."" Emphasize that it is okay to ask for help, and they are not being an annoyance.
They won't tell a grown-up if the grown-ups don't listen. Respect their communication, and if they come to you with a problem, put forth an honest effort to help out.

, These include stress balls, tangles, rubber sea urchins, beanbags, and other toys they can manipulate in their hands. Encourage them to go to the box and pick one out whenever they need to. This can help with...


Fidgeting and restlessness
Keeping hands to self
Staying in their seat
Emotional regulation

Set up a clear visual schedule, with a picture and word(s) representing each activity.,
Give 5- and 10-minute warnings before a transition occurs.,
Keep your rules and consequences consistent.,
Consider making a poster of some basic class rules.",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom3," This will help students predict their day. Try to keep each day similar to the next.


For example, math always happens at 1:00, after recess.
At the beginning of each day, read the schedule aloud. Hang it where students can easily look at it for reference.

, Handling transitions can be difficult for some special needs students, and giving extra time to prepare can help.


Consider getting a light-up timer to demonstrate how much time is left.
Praise them when they handle it well.

, Inconsistent behavior on your part will lead to confusion and anxiety among students.


Don't let a ""better-behaved"" student get away with doing something that a ""worse-behaved"" student isn't allowed to do. This is unfair, and they won't understand how rules work.
Some students may try to test limits. Make it clear that the consequences will be the same each time.

, These include ""Be respectful of everyone,"" ""Keep your hands to yourself,"" and ""Don't talk while the teacher talks."" This can help the students remember the rules, and you can point out the poster if a child is refusing to follow a rule.

"
"
Although it is not a good idea to ignore negative behavior, it is important to approach students who are misbehaving without overreacting (Evertson 137).,
Give a quiet signal if they are acting inappropriately.,
Thank the students who are behaving well.,
Provide a clear alternative.,
When students begin using a better behavior, consolidate the gain.,
Always listen well and seek to understand.",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom4," This strategy should be used while students are misbehaving, or even after a lesson if approaching the situation would be even more distracting and is inconvenient in the middle of a lesson. It is important to not overreact during these situations, because that may cause students to enjoy the attention and continue the action for more attention.

, Move closer to the student or making eye contact directly with the student and use a signal such as a finger to the lips to signal to be quiet or to shake one's head back and forth (Evertson 137). This strategy is effective because it avoids confronting the student in front of the whole class abruptly while still providing a reminder for that student to get back on task.

, For example, ""Thank you for getting out your books so quickly."" The students will self-evaluate whether they are doing this or not, and the ones who aren't may decide that they should do so.

, Children may misbehave because they don't know how else to get what they want. Tell them what you'd like them to do instead, and why this is a better idea, and they may meet your positive expectations.


""You must keep your hands to yourself. It's rude to touch other people without their permission. If you need to flap your hands around, keep them to yourself, or go pick out a stim toy from the bin.""
""It's not okay to scream indoors. Some people have sensitive ears and your screaming hurts them. If you want something, please take some deep breaths and ask for it with your words or with the picture binder.""

, Tell them that you appreciate it, and that you are happy to see them communicating well. ""Thank you for telling me that you need a drink so calmly! I'll go get you a cup of water.""

, If you know why they're doing what they're doing, you can meet the need and teach them to communicate better. Once the children sense that you care about what they have to say (whether they say it ""correctly"" or not), they will open up.

"

In order to provide praise to students, a teacher needs to be nonjudgmental and praise the individual student's accomplishment or the class, rather than comparing one student or one class to another (Curran 6).,
Accept individual differences.,
Admit your mistakes.,
Validate their feelings.",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom5," This is important because it promotes individual growth and allows the student to feel special rather than putting down another student or promoting unhealthy competition in the classroom. Effective praise or rewards create a positive classroom environment  because it allows students to feel accomplished on a personal level and may prevent negative types of behavior (Curran 6).

, Rather than viewing it as looking past a disability to see a person, see a person who has a disability. Don't try to make them indistinguishable from their peers—focus on learning skills and adapting to the world (Real Social Skills). Teach them to accept themselves and others.


Assume that any repetitive motions are important, even if they don't make sense to you (Real Social Skills).

, Sometimes, you may lose your temper or behave in a way that you regret. It is okay to apologize, and go back on what you said (Biesman).


""I'm sorry that I raised my voice at you. I don't want to be scary or yell at you. I'm very sorry.""
""I'm sorry that I put you in time out. You were trying to tell me that something was wrong, and I wasn't listening. I should have taken some deep breaths and listened more carefully to you.""

, This helps them feel understood.Practice validating others' feelings—not just for the students, but for everyone in your life.""I'm sorry to hear that. It must have been no fun.""
""So you're feeling angry with her because she took your toy while you were still playing with it.""
""I understand it can be no fun being away from your mom all morning.""

Ask students if they want to work alone, or in a group, or in another setting such as the floor or reading corner (Curran 13).

,
Work on cooperation, not compliance (Biesman).",How to Handle Behavioral Issues in the Classroom6," Maybe they'd rather read chapter books than play with their peers. This is their choice to make (Real Social Skills). Teach them how to interact, but do not force interaction. Respecting their autonomy and choices will make them feel valued as human beings.

, Try manipulatives during math, computers during writers workshop, or different genres of books for reading (Curran 13). Choice could be included in assignments by allowing students different ways to express their ideas such as through art, writing, or a presentation (Curran 13).

,, Compliance training removes choices, which can leave children vulnerable to peer pressure and abuse. Cooperation encourages working together, while each person's autonomy is respected.


Rather than saying no, try saying yes with conditions. Or, explain why you said no, and offer a way to make it more agreeable.

Know the different types of love.,

Know how ""愛"" is used.,
Know how ""恋"" is used.,
Know the Japanese alphabets.,
Know basic stroke order.",How to Write Love in Japanese1," In Japanese, due to the varying ways of saying certain things based on politeness and the weight some words can carry, it's important to know what the different types of love are. The three most commonly used are 好き (suki), 愛 (ai), and 恋 (koi).

, Suki is the most common way of expressing love, although when translated to English, it would be closer to the definition of ""like"" than ""love"". However, it is often used as an expression of love, and saying ""daisuke"" (大好き) is a way of saying you really like someone.

, Ai is commonly heard when translating ""love"" to Japanese, but it's actually rarely used. It is meant as a very strong expression of love; saying ""愛してる"" (ai shiteru) is reserved for people you truly love, such as a very close partner.

, Koi is used when referring to love in third person, and as such, is not used as an expression of affection towards the person you're speaking to. It's not very commonly seen in expressions of affection as a result.

, When children and non-native Japanese speakers are learning how to write in Japanese, they initially start with learning hiragana, which are simple characters commonly used in Japanese writing. Katakana is another basic alphabet, but it is reserved for foreign words, such as names. Kanji are the characters derived from Chinese, which are much more complex to write than hiragana, but are sometimes used to help clarify the context of a sentence when reading.

, Whether you're going to be writing in hiragana or kanji, you'll need to learn how to write properly, as writing with the wrong stroke order can make it look like your sentence says something else entirely. Stroke order typically sticks to two rules: if the stroke is horizontal, it most likely started on the left side, whereas if the stroke is vertical, it probably started at the top. There are a few exceptions, but not many.


While learning stroke order may seem pointless, it's actually necessary to learn in order to tell certain characters apart. For example, two katakana characters - シ and ツ, respectively - can be mistaken for the other character if written in improper stroke order and direction, which can jumble up a sentence at worst, and make it tough to read at best. Additionally, characters aren't always clearly written, as opposed to when they're printed on a screen, and there are other more cursive styles of writing that can make it crucial to write in proper stroke order.

",How to Write Love in Japanese2," Writing す can throw many people off at first because of the loop in the middle of the character, so feel free to practice if necessary.


Draw a medium-length horizontal line, starting on the left and going to the right.






Start drawing a vertical line in the middle of the horizontal line. Shortly after the lines connect, loop your line up into a circle, then bring it back down.





;
, After writing す, you're going to need to write ""ki"" (き) in order to make it into a word, and not just a sound.


Draw a short horizontal line going from left to right.






Draw another horizontal line below the first one, making it slightly longer than the first horizontal line. Again, go from left to right.






Starting above the center of the shorter horizontal line, draw a vertical line that slopes slightly to the right. After you've crossed both horizontal lines, swoop the line to the left and curve it back to the right, stopping once you're about a third of the way from connecting to the vertical line.







,, Writing あ isn't nearly as simple as it looks. If you need to, practice a few times to get it right.


Draw a short horizontal line, going from left to right.






Draw a longer vertical line, starting from top to bottom.






Draw the loop. Start a small amount up, next to the vertical line you just drew. Loop downwards, then up, and then to the side. Make sure to cross the vertical line with the upper part of the loop.







, い is fairly simple to write, as it only consists of two lines.


Starting from the top, draw a slightly curved vertical line, and curve it back up at the end.






Start parallel from the first line and draw a shorter vertical line.







,, こ is easy to write, as it's only two lines.


Start with the top line. Writing from left to right, draw a line of medium length. Sometimes, the first line will curve slightly and ""hook"" back, as shown in the picture above.






To write the lower line, curve the beginning of the line so that the line looks somewhat like a curved ""Z"" with the center line missing. This line is often slightly longer than the line above it.







, Like ""ko"", い is only two lines, making it a simple character to write.


Start from the top. Draw a slightly curved vertical line, and ""hook"" it back up once you've reached the end of the line.






Parallel from the first line, draw a vertical line roughly about half the size of the original line.

",How to Write Love in Japanese3," To start writing the kanji for ""suki"", begin by drawing a vertical line from top-to-bottom that leans to the left. Then, change the direction it's moving in, so that the line, while still vertical, is directing towards the right.

, The second stroke in the kanji is somewhat similar to writing a ""fu"" in katakana (フ), so imitate the stroke order and simply stretch it out.

, To the right of the symbol you just wrote will be an imitation of the kanji 子, but smaller.


Start by drawing a horizontal line, going from left to right. Then make a sharp diagonal angle back inwards, stopping when your pen or pencil is perpendicular to the center of the horizontal line. Continue writing, but vertically, until you reach the bottom of the line you're writing on; once the line is that long, curve it back upwards a small amount.






Where the diagonal line becomes vertical, draw a horizontal line going from left to right.







, The ""ki"" sound in 好き isn't connected to the kanji like one might expect - rather, the kanji is simply for the ""su"" sound, and hiragana is used for the ""ki"" sound. Writing き should be easy enough if you've practiced it enough times, however.


Write a short horizontal line, going from left to right.






Underneath the first line, write a slightly longer horizontal line. Again, go from left to right.






Starting above the center of the shorter horizontal line, draw a vertical line that slopes slightly to the right. After you've crossed both horizontal lines, swoop the line to the left and curve it back to the right, stopping once you're about a third of the way from connecting to the vertical line.







,, To begin writing the kanji for ""ai"", start between the center and the top of the line and draw a slightly curved line, going from left to right.

, Underneath your first stroke for the kanji, write three short, slightly tilted lines.


Start with the leftmost dash, and write from top to bottom. This dash starts slightly to the left of where the first stroke started, and it doesn't matter whether it connects to your first stroke or not.






Continue to the center dash. This dash is written exactly like the previous one, except it's centered rather than to the left.






Move to the rightmost dash. This stroke is also top to bottom, but is diagonal going from right to left rather than left to right.







, Underneath and to the left of the three dashes, write a slightly diagonal line going from top to bottom. This dash should be short.

, Starting next to the top of the dash you just wrote, write a straight line, then ""hook"" it back around once it's longer than the first stroke you made (the curved line).

, To the left of the hooked line, draw a slightly diagonal dash going from top to bottom. The dash should be going left to right.

, Next to the dash you just wrote, draw a line that hooks upwards, going from left to right. It should be shorter than the first hooked line.

, Above the center of the hooked line, draw a diagonal, slightly curved dash going from left to right. The dash should be extremely short.

, To the right of your second hooked line, draw a diagonal dash that tips from left to right. Write it from top to bottom.

, Underneath and to the left of the second hooked line, write a short stroke resembling a dash. It should tip from right to left.

, Starting where the last dash started, write ""fu"" (フ) in katakana and lengthen the lower stroke until it's about the length of the stroke it's connected to.

, Starting halfway down the stroke written before the previous one, write a curved line going from left to right. The stroke should end where the previous stroke curves.

,, The first stroke in the kanji for ""koi"" is a simple short line, centered above where the rest of the kanji will be written. This line is drawn diagonally from top to bottom.

, The next stroke is a horizontal line that is much longer than the line you initially drew. It should converge with your first stroke, and goes from left to right.


If you're having trouble getting it to look right, think of it as drawing a flat lid to a jar. The short vertical stroke (the ""handle"") will be in the center, connecting with the actual ""lid"" (the horizontal stroke) of the jar.

, Starting from the top and writing vertically, create a line curving out to the left. This line will be under the horizontal line you wrote before, and to the left of where the first stroke ends.

, Parallel to where your curved line started, write a vertical line from top to bottom. Once the line is at a certain length, create a short, sharp angle that goes diagonally and to the left.

, To the left of the curved line, write a quick dash from top to bottom that's roughly perpendicular to the curved line. The dash should bend outwards, similar to the curved line next to it.

, From top to bottom, write a diagonal dash next to the angled line. This dash extends out to the left and looks like it's somewhat close to being horizontal.

, Below all the aforementioned lines, write a slightly diagonal dash starting from top to bottom. The line should curve out to the left, but only slightly so.

, Starting from the left, write a stroke that looks somewhat like a hook. The ""hook"" should be slightly diagonal so that the curved section becomes the lowest part of the kanji.

, Above the hook and centered between the two lines in the middle of the kanji, write a small, U-shaped curve.

, The last stroke of the kanji is simply a slightly curved line, similar to the one above where it should be written. It should be written from left to right, and rest slightly above and off to the side of the ""hook"" that was written earlier.

A teacher's job is not to make a formal diagnosis, but it's a good idea to be on the lookout for patterns of behavior that could be signs of a problem.Know the signs of internalized problems. Students with internalized emotional problems are typically withdrawn, anxious, or depressed.Signs include isolation from peers or being a bully victim, moodiness, apathy, self abuse, and frequent crying.
Know the signs of externalized problems. Students with externalized problems are often aggressive, disruptive, or anti-social.Be aware of behaviors such as damaging property, bullying others, ignoring or having conflicts with authorities, and temper tantrums.;
, Making clear, detailed notes about the specific behaviors you observe can help a professional make a better judgement about the nature of the student's problem.Make your observations in an unbiased way that describes student behaviors factually and keeps your emotional responses out.
Identify not only the behaviors themselves, but also how often they occur and how long they last.For example: ""After being told he could not go out in the rain, Jerry began screaming and beating on his desk with his fists. This went on for about 30 seconds. This was the third temper tantrum he's had this week.""

, In addition to documenting the student's behaviors, it may be helpful to make note of any possible causes for the behavior that you might be aware of. Emotional and behavior problems can come from a variety of sources, including:Family issues. If you aware of problems a student is experiencing at home, it will be important to make note of these.
School issues. Problems with peers (such as bullying) or other teachers can also contribute to emotional and behavioral problems.
Community issues. The community that a student lives in can also promote the development of emotional or behavioral problems. Growing up around gang violence, for example, can increase the risk of issues.
Biological factors. Genetics and other biological issues can also make emotional or behavioral problems more likely. If you know, for example, that a student's mother or father has suffered from a psychological issue of some kind, this could be very important.

, If you believe a student has an ongoing emotional or behavioral problem, don't try to deal with it on your own. Refer the the student to the school psychologist or another professional who can make a formal diagnosis and develop a plan., Once you know a student has behavioral or emotional issues, you can start developing lessons that are conducive to her or his learning style. One valuable strategy is to make sure your lessons are clear, relevant, and interesting to the student.


Students with emotional and behavioral problems often have trouble staying motivated and/or paying attention. Crafting lessons in a way that allows him or her to see how the material is relevant now, rather than in some distant future, can help hold the student's attention.Delivering lessons in a lively, engaging manner and calling on students to contribute can also help students with emotional or behavioral problems stay focused.

, Assignments, whether homework or in-class activities, can also be tailored to help students with emotional or behavioral problems. Teachers have found success with several different strategies, including the following:Make sure the goals and instructions are clear.
Manage the difficulty of assignments. Students with emotional problems often fear failure, so don't set them up to fail!
Keep assignments short, or break them up into parts. Because students with emotional and behavioral problems have a harder time staying motivated, keeping assignments short, or dividing larger projects into multiple short tasks can be very helpful.
Make assignments ""hands-on."" Giving students a chance to do something in the real world helps keep them engaged.
Give students a choice. When possible, create multiple assignments with the same learning goals, and allow the student to choose the one she or he is most comfortable with.

, Teachers who go the extra mile to motivate students, both in lessons and assignments, often have better luck with students struggling with emotional or behavioral problems. Here are some tried and tested ideas:Provide varied awards. Providing students with emotional or behavioral problems with certificates of achievement and other symbolic awards can help them feel motivated and encouraged. Vary the nature of these awards to keep them interested.
Have students log their own achievements on an accomplishment sheet. As these sheets grow, so will student motivation.
Provide encouraging feedback on assignments, either verbally or in written form.

, The classroom environment also plays an important role in helping students with emotional or behavioral problems succeed. Controlling the physical environment to minimize distractions can be a big help for some students. For example, try the following:Avoid over-stimulation. Students with behavioral problems are easily distracted, so you can avoid over-stimulating them by making the classroom setting a simple, uncluttered one. Keep storage areas neat or out of sight. Remove unnecessary equipment. Keep displays and decoration simple, and remove sources of distracting noise.
Position students with behavioral or emotional problems away from high-traffic areas such as the water fountain or pencil sharpener.
Create a quiet area using partitions such as cubicle walls or even painted cardboard so the student has a private space to cool-off after emotional outbursts or to focus on difficult tasks.

, Students with behavioral problems typically find it easier to follow rules that are simple and clear. When you explain the class rules to your students, make sure they are as concise as possible.


When possible, state the rules in positive terms, e.g. ""Students should be quiet when the teacher is talking"" rather than ""Students should not talk while the teacher is talking.""
Likewise, make sure the consequences for violation of the rules are logical, clear, and consistent. If talking during a presentation results in a timeout, for example, make sure this consequence occurs every time, and that the timeout is always in the same place and for the same amount of time.

, Students with behavioral or emotional problems are often most successful when they have a regular routine to follow.Try structuring your class days in a consistent way from one day to the next.


When you create your schedule, be mindful of the fact that students with behavioral problems often have trouble focusing on a single task for too long.
Giving warnings when transitions between activities or tasks are about to occur can also be helpful, along with giving students adequate time for the transition., Creating an environment where students feel encouraged and respected can also go a long way toward helping students with emotional and behavioral problems succeed. For example:Make sure students know you are listening when they talk to you using active listening techniques, such as maintaining eye contact, nodding, etc.
Use open ended-questions in class discussion that encourage reflection rather than simple repetition of facts. These questions are less threatening and more engaging.
Show interest in students. Encourage them to talk about their own interests, likes, and dislikes.

, Students with behavioral or emotional problems are more prone to disruptive classroom behaviors. You can help these students manage their behavior by avoiding triggers for these behaviors, defusing conflict, and providing appropriate consequences.Point systems and other forms of encouragement are often the most effective way to promote desired classroom behaviors.Ignoring attention-seeking disruptions can be an effective way of discouraging them.When behaviors get in the way of other students' ability to learn, or when ignoring the behavior has failed, a clear and consistent timeout policy often works well., Ultimately, no teacher can achieve success with a troubled student alone. It is important to involve the student's parents and to communicate with them regularly.


Many teachers have found that involving parents in discussions about homework and even lesson plans can be very helpful, especially if this communication occurs consistently. Don't wait for problems to occur. If you know a student has emotional or behavioral issues, get the parents involved, and keep them involved, right away.Some schools have found that regular planning meetings that include the teachers, parents, and school counselors or psychologists have been highly effective in promoting student success., Schools provide a variety of resources for teachers working with students that have emotional or behavioral problems. Make sure you know what resources are available and are making the most of them.


Schools may provide any number of different types of assistance, ranging from help with curriculum, assistants that come help in class, out of class counseling for the student, and alternative learning settings for special-education students., There are also a number of non-profit and governmental organizations that can provide resources and guidance for educators dealing with students with behavioral or emotional issues. Visit their websites or contact them to see what help they can offer. A partial list of these organizations includes:The Center on Positive Behavioral Interventions and Support
The Council for Exceptional Children
The Council for Children with Behavioral Disorders
The National Association of School Psychologists

Keep learning tools organized and in their own designated places.,
Incorporate the use of markers to assist with certain visual challenges.,
Ensure that the learning environment is physically safe for children at all times.,
Verify that adequate lighting is provided for visually impaired children.,
Verify that the working distance for the children is close enough to be effective.",How to Work With Visually Impaired Children1," This procedure will allow children to find learning the materials and supplies they need on a regular basis without having to constantly look for certain supplies.;
, Markers such as fluorescent stickers and ribbons can help children locate certain items or locations. For example, if a child needs help finding their locker in a school hallway, you can mark the locker with a bright fluorescent sticker.

, Visually impaired children may have difficulty avoiding certain hazards such as objects laying in the middle of the floor or open drawers and cabinets.


Keep doors, drawers, cabinets, and similar objects either completely closed or open at all times.
Encourage adults and children without visual impairments to keep rooms clean, and to store potentially hazardous objects such as balls, toys, and other learning aids away from floor traffic.

, Most children with visual impairments will require bright lights for an optimal learning experience.


Open windows to let in natural sunlight or place the children in a specific area of the room that receives the brightest light source.

, Some visually impaired children may have difficulty reading text and participating in other activities if they are located too far away from the learning materials.


Place visually impaired children near the front of the room during lectures, film presentations, and other activities.

"
"
Verbalize your physical actions consistently.,
Use full, specific descriptions in your teaching at all times.,
Talk using an expressive voice.,
Encourage speakers to identify themselves using their names.,
Communicate and teach using hearing and tactile methods when possible.,
Use learning materials that contain basic designs and bright colors.",How to Work With Visually Impaired Children2," This will help visually impaired children become more aware of their surroundings and other nearby physical movements. For example, announce your presence as you enter and leave the room.


Announce when you are moving to a different section of the room or coming near a particular child. This will prevent them from becoming confused or startled if their impairment does not allow them to follow your movements.

, In most cases, vague words and expressions can result in misunderstanding or failure to grasp specific meanings. For example, instead of saying, ""Pick up that pencil over there,"" say ""Pick up that red pencil on the desk next to the clock.""

, Visually impaired children will often have difficulty seeing your face and expressions as you speak. For example, when you are praising a child on their good work, smile as you speak so they can hear the approval and happiness in your voice.

, This will allow visually impaired children to identify who is speaking to or addressing them, especially if their impairment does not allow them to clearly see the speaker.

, Visually impaired children must rely more on these other senses for the most effective learning experience. For example, instead of instructing children to read from a standard textbook, read the text out loud to them, or provide them with braille textbooks.


Use learning aids and tools that are specifically developed for the blind and visually impaired. Examples of tools you can use are text-to-audio systems, recordings, and other audio devices.

, Visual aids that are considered ""busy"" in appearance and contain multiple graphics and colors can be more difficult for visually impaired children to interpret.


Use materials with pictures and graphics that contain circles, squares, and triangles, and other basic designs.
Use colors that are bold and bright in appearance, such as red, bright yellow, and blue. Light, pastel colors are often difficult for visually impaired to see clearly.

Consider whether the behavior is maladaptive or different. An autistic child flapping her hands is harming no one, and can choose for herself whether to fit in. An autistic child hitting her head or screaming in class is causing harm.;
, Compare all records to see if any patterns emerge.


If possible, ask the student about it. For example, ""Why did you throw that?"" or ""Why were you hitting your head this morning?""
For example, a bell rings 80% of the time before Anisha throws herself on the ground and screams. It would be reasonable to suggest that the bell may be upsetting her.
For example, when Jordan throws a tantrum, his father will give him a lollipop to quiet him for a while. Jordan learns that if he throws a tantrum, he will get a lollipop.

, If there is a pattern, this may eliminate the target behavior without a formal modification plan.


For example, give Anisha warning before the school bell rings so that she can cover her ears. Without the startling loud noise, she may stop pitching herself to the floor and screaming.
For example, Jordan's dad stops giving him candy when he throws a fit. Instead, he instructs Jordan on ways to calm himself, and encourages him to communicate his needs verbally. In time, Jordan throws fewer tantrums.
If this works, stop here. If not, and there is no pattern, continue on.

, A reward should be in addition to the things they already enjoy. For example, it could mean buying a new song for a preteen who loves music, or getting a new game for a girl who loves games, and letting her have 30 minutes of time with the special game as a reward.


Do not restrict access to something that the person could previously access freely. For example, it would be punitive to restrict a girl's access to a game that she used to be always able to play during her free time.
Consider ethics. Access to food/water, relaxation time, or things they love (e.g. their teddy bear or their books) should not be dependent on their performance.

, Full team input is required as each member may have picked up on an important aspect of the behavior. Example:


If X behavior occurs, Johnny will not earn a point that hour towards the attaining the reward he wants.
When Johnny does not engage in the behavior, he earns the point and moves closer to his reward.
Johnny has earned all points necessary for the reward by not engaging in the target behavior.
Immediately provide him with the reward.

, This way, if the reward does not work, one can offer a larger reward. (If one starts with the largest reward and it does not work, then there is nowhere to go.)

, Input and feedback from all members is important for evaluating and adjusting the program.


Encourage compassionate firmness. The student's unhappiness will not change the plan, but that does not mean they will be denied an empathetic response. Encourage members to validate the student's feelings and help them cope with stress.
Listen carefully to members' concerns.

, Meet regularly with the full team and professional to review all data, interpret it, and make modifications when necessary.


Behavior escalation is normal early on. The child or patient tries harder, thinking that they will get the old response if they continue. This means that the plan is targeting the correct behavior. This can be alarming, but it will fade if one continues with the plan.

, Show the child/patient some examples of what they must do to get the reward.


Be specific. The student needs to know exactly what behavior is being addressed, what they can do instead, and why they should (both in terms of reward, and why the alternate is better).
Role playing can be helpful.

, This is how the team can decide if the alternate behavior is being used.


As a team to decide when the alternate behavior, or modified behavior has been in place long enough to begin a fade out of the rewards.
In ""fading out"" the rewards may come less frequently, or take more points to earn.
The goal is eventually to have natural supports take over.

, This is a way of managing to reinforce the new behavior without being as dependent on a reward.


""Good Job"", a hug, a high five, and spending more time together can all be examples of this.

, This is done when the program has achieved its goal.

, All notes, charts, and data should be saved for use as a template for behavior modification that has worked for this individual.

We will be using tricks like taking the standard formula for a line, y = mx + b, and standing it on its head to become x = mP +b where P=y; we can do so because the dependent and independent variable have exchanged roles. Open an Excel workbook and create 3 worksheets: Regression, Demand Curves and Saves. We'll be using Demand Curves in the next article.;

,, There are 17 Price vs. Units Sold observations in this example. Depending on your population size, a sample size of anywhere from 2.5% to 11.125% will give you a statistically good to extremely high confidence level that your curve accurately reflects your true economic situation, with tolerable error bounds. 2.5% applies to large populations, 11.125% applies to smaller populations.

,
Enter to cell E33, aligned left, the note of the final formula arrived at: X = 60/SQRT(py+2) + 95*(0.85^py) - (48/(py^2+1)) and format the columns it runs over format fill yellow and format the font of cell range E33:H51 blue-purple, or 'electric blue' it's sometimes called.
Enter to E34 SUM of:, enter to F34 60/SQRT(py+2), enter to G34  +95*(0.85^py) and enter to H34  -(48/(py^2+.5)). Note that the sum of 60+95-48 = 107, or 100% of the market units of 85, plus a large fudge factor because of the action of the denominators. If the denominators take back about 6.5% overall, it'll work out. Mine take back about 9% -- off by 2.7323% actually, which is acceptable as curves go for our purposes. Goal seeking can easily remedy the situation. This is found by taking column C *1.07 * a variable called Rate, and summing the results, then Goal Seeking versus either C52 or E52 and changing the Rate cell until the difference in Sum to UNIT FINDS or Sum of: is zero. The average of all the rates over all py's, taking them as =(60/107)/SQRT(py+2), =95/107*(0.85^py) and =-(48/107)/(py^2+5) (less the top rate which skews the results) is 23.23%, or 107-85, approx. By multiplying this total rate by 107, we can come close to the figure under the Sum of: column used to create the curve. We're saying that we can account for ALL the buyers' willingness to buy a given quantity of units at a given price -- the market is summed altogether in the chart.
Select cell range E35:E51 and enter to cell E35 the formula w/o quotes ""=SUM(F35:H35)"" and Edit Fill Down.
In the first formula, 60/SQRT(py+2), we're basically saying that 60% of the market is influenced by a factor which is diminished by the square root of (price +$2), the effect of which is to account for 34.64 of the 85 units sold (almost half) but 9.86 of the bottom 10 units sold, as the formula's effect indeed increases with fewer units sold. So this effect is like a bargain-hunter's effect and is telling us how price-sensitive the units are in terms of elasticity. It's saying nearly half to all of the purchasing decision is based on price alone. Enter to cell range F35:F51 into cell F35 the formula w/o quotes ""=60/SQRT(py+2)"" and Edit Fill Down.
In the second formula, 95*(0.85^py), we're basically saying that 95% of the market is influenced by another big factor: competition -- what items are out there which are near-substitutes for our item. We are competing well on price, but we are also competing on relative value in a dynamic economy. This factor is very important over large sales of our unit, accounting for 80.75 of the 85 units, but diminishes in importance to only .32 of the last 10 units. Therefore, the effect of the denominator as a factor on the 95 grows steadily less and less until it's near zero. Enter to cell range G35:G51 into cell G35 the formula w/o quotes ""=95*(0.85^py)"" and Edit Fill Down.
In the last and final formula of -(48/(py^2+0.5)), we have a take-back where we are losing business to our competition on marketing savvy, packaging, discounting, sales force motivation, competitive compensation etc. -- on mega sales only. Notice that we lose 32 unit sales at the level of 85 unit sales but only 1.88 unit sales just below it at 63.75 unit sales. Evidently, There's some sort of magic large quantity sale we're missing the boat on that doesn't much affect the vast majority of our sales. Perhaps 48 is the number of sales reps we have and we just need 2 more or something. You play with it and figure it out! In the meantime, enter it first by entering to cell range H35:H51 into cell H35 the formula w/o quotes ""-(48/(py^2+0.5))"" and Edit Fill Down.

, Delete the series which is for columns B and D, leaving only 2 series, one for B and C and one for B and E. Click in the plot area, select Series 1 of the two plot series via Chart Layout.  If it is for B and C, insert the Chart Title """"Findings"" via editing the series formula in the formula bar until it reads as follows: ""=SERIES(""Findings"",Regression!$C$35:$C$51,Regression!$B$35:$B$51,1)"" w/o quotes. Do Chart Layout Current Selection Series ""Findings"" and Format Selection Line - No Line, Marker Style red dot size 8, Marker Fill red. Then do Current Selection Series 2 and edit it in the formula bar until it reads as follows: ""=SERIES(""Demand Function Curve"",Regression!$E$35:$E$51,Regression!$B$35:$B$51,2)"", w/o quotes and do Format Selection, Smoothed Line Black 2 pt. No Markers.
However, Price is on the bottom and Units are along the vertical, which is backwards -- we need to fix that. Now here's the tricky part: Select either series  and do menu item Chart Source Data ... and click on each series and exchange manually the X-values' column letters for the Y-values' column letters. For example, if the X value read =Regression!$B$35:$B$51, change them to read =Regression!$C$35:$C$51, and do the opposite for the Y-values, and then do the other series. Demand Function Curve should end up with the X values reading ""=Regression!$E$35:$E$51"" and the Y-values reading ""=Regression!$B$35:$B$51"" -- in both cases, the Y-values should refer to B column.
Lastly, add the above title, as shown in the picture, and the axes labels, font size 16.

Minimize the number of distractions that the student might notice. A student with ADHD shouldn’t sit near windows or doors, which can serve as distractions to the student.
Seat the student right in front of you, so they can look at you easily, without being distracted by other students.
Organize your classroom in rows. Students facing the front of the classroom are encouraged to pay close attention to the teacher. Seating around tables with other students can be a distracting configuration for students with ADHD.;
, Children with ADHD are constantly trying to make sense of their environment. Teachers can help by organizing the classroom. Establish a storage system that separates items into categories and reduces the crowding that leads to overloading. Consider color-coded storage cubes and wall hooks as well as open shelves. Use picture or word labels to remind them what goes where.Label storage tubs with corresponding pictures. Have separate storage tubs for books, pencils, paper and other supplies. , Use calendars, written schedules and poster boards to remind the student of classroom rules, schedules, assignments, and so on., As you begin the lesson, mark it with an aural cue, such as an egg timer or another noise. Make sure to look directly at the student as you give instructions, and give the instructions in simple pieces.

, Make a list on the board that includes the objectives of the lesson and what the student will learn. Also list the activities for the student to read. Go over these activities., Try different activities that move at different paces. Vary the momentum of the class so that your student stays interested.Give frequent breaks help your student refocus his attention.

, Children with ADHD need tasks to be broken into steps—chunking—that are given either one at a time or in written form. Give positive feedback as the child completes each step. , At the end of the lesson, summarize what you talked about and what the students learned. Ask the student to repeat the main points so that it will stick in their mind better., Students with ADHD generally don't do well sitting still, and should find ways to fidget that don't disrupt the class.Encourage your student to fidget calmly using a stress ball, tangle toy, or other fidget toy.Wiggly students may benefit from a sensory seat cushion, or an exercise ball used as a chair.
Remove distracting objects from the classroom, such as rubber bands, toys and other objects., The student will benefit from getting a professional diagnosis of ADHD from a mental health professional. As you observe the student’s level of ADHD, schedule a conference with the parents to suggest visiting a mental health professional for an official diagnosis. Some ADHD signs to look for include:


Inattentive ADHD: Has trouble paying attention; doesn’t follow through with homework; is organizationally challenged; avoids tasks requiring sustained focus (like schoolwork); can’t keep track of or often loses keys, glasses, papers, tools, etc.; is easily distracted
Hyperactive/impulsive ADHD: : Fidgety, squirmy; taps hands or feet; feels restless; struggles to play quietly/do quiet activities; excessive talking; struggles to wait for his turn.

, Meet with the student’s parents to discuss a variety of topics, such as effective rewards and consequences and effective homework routines. You should also discuss how you and the parents will communicate on a regular basis about problems and successes. In addition, suggest ways that the parents can mirror what you are doing in the classroom for greater consistency. For some students, the student can achieve success pretty easily when you establish consistent schedules, routines, and homework communication methods. Organizational tools are also effective. These include planners, color-coded binders, and checklists., Students with ADHD often take medication to help with distractibility and hyperactivity. Depending on the student, he may need to take a dose of medication during the school day. Talk with the parents to find out if the student needs to visit the school nurse during the day to receive medication.Observe the student’s behavior to monitor if their medication seems like it’s wearing off. This will help the parents determine if the timing of the medication needs to be adjusted.

, Children qualify for free special education services based on one of two basic reasons: they have a qualifying disability or they have fallen far behind their peers academically. Once parents recognize that their child is not succeeding in school and they feel additional help is required, parents may request a special education evaluation. Talk to the parent about making this request in writing. The student may receive minor accommodations (such as extra time for taking tests) or more major interventions, such as self-contained classrooms with teachers and aides who are specially trained to deal with children with disruptive behaviors.Once qualified, a child with ADHD may have access to other school-based services, as well, such as riding home in a smaller bus with extra staff who supervise students more closely than a lone driver is able to do.

, Some schools may try to tell parents that ADHD is not a disability that qualifies a student for special services. It is true that ADHD is not listed as one of the 13 disability categories in the language of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). But category 9 is “other health impairment,” which is later defined as “… chronic or acute health problems such as asthma, attention deficit disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder… which adversely affect a child’s educational performance.” , Once the parents have provided documentation of the student’s ADHD diagnosis, you can complete a special education evaluation, known as an individualized education plan (IEP). This IEP will show that the child’s disability is interfering with his education.


An IEP is a formalized document created by school staff and parents that spells out the academic, behavioral, and social goals of special-ed students. It also describes how results will be determined and specific interventions that will be used to achieve the goals. It lists decisions made concerning self-contained classrooms, percentage of time in mainstream classrooms, accommodations, discipline, testing, and more.
You will participate in an IEP conference along with the parents.The school is legally bound to follow the guidelines laid down in the IEP. Teachers who fail to follow the IEP can be held responsible.
The school is also required to invite parents to regular IEP conferences to evaluate the progress of the child and the effectiveness of the plan. Then adjustments can be made as needed.
Once a child has an initial IEP, it becomes easier to establish special education services when the student changes schools or transfers to a new school district.

, All children need discipline and they need to learn that bad behavior comes with consequences.For discipline to be effective at changing behavior, it must be consistent. The student will know the rules and the consequences for breaking the rules. The consequence happens the same every time the rule is broken. Consistency is vital, and a lack of it can lead to a child developing confusion about the expectations.


It’s crucial that all caretakers are on board, maintaining the same expectations and consequences. When there is a weak link amongst the adults in the child’s sphere, that weakness will be exploited every time. He or she may “shop for a better answer” or play the “divide and conquer” game. Talk with the student’s parents about how you can help maintain consistent discipline.

, Be kind but firm. Don’t argue or vacillate. Once you give a specific instruction, it is to be followed without exception. If you allow the student to argue, they see that as an opportunity to win. Thus, you lose., Sometimes kids misbehave because they don't know how else to deal with a problem. Ask about the reasoning behind their actions, then ask them what they think they could do instead. Work together with them to find a better way to handle this problem.


Sometimes, misbehavior is a sign of an underlying problem. For example, maybe your student is trying to leave the classroom because peers are bullying her, or because she's often thirsty and would benefit from having water accessible (such as a water bottle).

, Don’t talk until the student is focused on you. Make sure that the student looks at you. If you assign a task, make the instructions brief and have him repeat it back to you. Wait for the job to be completed before distracting him with anything else.Not all students can focus and make eye contact at the same time. If you aren't sure if they're paying attention, ask ""Are you listening?"" or have them repeat what you said.

, You can get someone to cooperate better by asking nicely than by demanding or threatening. Those with ADHD are even more sensitive to the threats or demands, as they tend to feel that they’re “always” messing up or in trouble. Regardless of your teaching style or personality, it’s extremely important that you keep the input ratio weighted to the positive side: A child with ADHD needs to feel that he or she is being praised more often than criticized. The positive input must significantly outweigh the negative input to counterbalance all the feelings of failure that is encountered in a typical day.


Make sure the praise is immediate, and use different phrases so that you’re not repeating the same phrases over and over.

You will need inventory statistics like total output. You will also need the fixed costs, variable costs and total costs for a given quantity production (output).;
, Consider the following columns in your spreadsheet:


Use the header ""Output"" in your first column. You can fill the rows with single unit increases in output or larger jumps. For instance, it may be numbered 1,2,3, etc. or it can be numbered in larger increments, such as 1000, 2000, 3000, etc.
Consider whether you want to simply add ""Total Cost"" or add 3 columns for ""Fixed Cost,"" ""Variable Cost"" and ""Total Cost."" If you do not want to include the numbers for fixed and variable cost, make sure both these figures are calculated in the total cost.
Type the correct ""Total Cost"" figures for each rise in output. You will be able to figure out marginal cost for each increase in output based on these figures.

,, You will figure out the marginal cost for each level of output separately.


Keep in mind that marginal cost is based on the changes in cost as you produce more. The figures will plot change in output and cost throughout your chart.

, To calculate marginal cost, you will need to take the change in total cost divided by the change in total output.

, Subtract the total cost of the first row (after headings) by the total cost of the second row. This is your change in total cost.

, This is your change in total output.

,


For example, if your first row of data shows total output of 1,000 for a cost of $8,000 and the second row of data shows a total output of 2,000 for a cost of $12,000, your formula would be marginal cost=$12,000-$8,000)/(2,000-1,000).

,


In our example, we simplify to get marginal cost=$4,000/1,000 or marginal cost=$4.

, The first row of data will not have a marginal cost, because marginal cost cannot be calculated based on an output of zero.

,


If you are using Microsoft Excel, you can include a formula to automatically calculate the data. Enter an equals sign in the blank box under your marginal cost column, then replace the data numbers with cell numbers. For example, ""=(F4-F3)/(G4-G3)."" Then click ""Enter."" Drag the formula down the column to reproduce it in each row.

Convert to real GDP.",How to Calculate the Growth Rate of Nominal GDP,"  Nominal GDP is the GDP of the country measured at current market prices. Real GDP, on the other hand, is adjusted for inflation or deflation. Many economist use real GDP instead of nominal GDP when determining the growth rate of an economy.

Nominal GDP represents the output of the country at current prices, and therefore is useless when comparing output for different periods. 

For example, knowing that a country's annual nominal GDP was $1 billion in 1940 but $200 billion now does not tell you much about the actual relative output between those two periods. You would have to convert the figures to real GDP to see how they compare.;
, Nominal GDP can be calculated by adding together the country's expenditures over the time period. Four categories of spending are added together, the first being consumption. This is the sum that consumers spend on durable goods, non-durable goods, and services. This would include personal items such as food, clothing, rent, and services like health care.

Consumption is the largest and most stable part of nominal GDP. 

However, imported goods are not included, as they are part of the final category, net exports., The second part of nominal GDP is investment. This represents all of the money spent on capital equipment, increases in inventory, and structures. Items that would fall into this category include the purchase of business machinery, new homes, and the construction of new factories.

Stocks and bonds are not included here since they do not add to any actual output., This is the accumulation of spending by all levels of government on goods and services. Examples include military purchases, teacher pensions and government salaries. Deducted from this amount are government transfer payments such as welfare or unemployment payments., The sum of all imports is calculated and then subtracted from the sum of all exports. The difference between the amount of foreign goods consumed domestically and the amount of domestic goods consumed in foreign countries makes up the net exports. When exports exceed imports, it adds to the amount of GDP.

Add up the four categories to arrive at nominal GDP for the time period., In order to calculate your nominal GDP growth rate, you'll need nominal GDP figures for more than one time period. These periods can be consecutive or removed by any number of periods, as long as you have reliable data for each. Check to make sure that your nominal GDPs are for the same time period, for the same nation, and expressed in the same currency., The simplest way to calculate nominal GDP growth is by analyzing two consecutive periods. For this type of calculation, the formula is simply the  one for percent change. Specifically, it is NGDP Growth=NGDPx−NGDPx−1NGDPx−1{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}={\frac {NGDP_{x}-NGDP_{x-1}}{NGDP_{x-1}}}}. In the formula, NGDPx{\displaystyle NGDP_{x}} represents the later period and NGDPx−1{\displaystyle NGDP_{x-1}} is the earlier.

Enter your own data to calculate nominal GDP growth.

For example, if NGDP were $200 billion one period and $210 the next, your equation would be: NGDP Growth=$210B−$200B$200B{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}={\frac {\$210B-\$200B}{\$200B}}}


, Simply perform the subtraction and division specified by the equation to solve. Your answer will be a decimal and must be multiplied by 100 to arrive at your growth rate in percentage form.Using the previous example, the equation would first solve to NGDP Growth=$10B$200B{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}={\frac {\$10B}{\$200B}}}.

Then, dividing gives NGDP Growth=0.05{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=0.05}.

Finally, multiply by 100 to get NGDP Growth=5%{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=5\%}.

Your nominal GDP growth rate between the two periods is 5 percent. 


, Cumulative growth refers to the total growth in nominal GDP between non-consecutive periods. It is calculated the same way as consecutive growth, by substituting NGDPx{\displaystyle NGDP_{x}} for a later period and NGDPx−1{\displaystyle NGDP_{x-1}} for the earlier one. Use the method described for calculating simple NGDP growth to find cumulative growth.For example, imagine that a record of nominal GDP growth shows a value of $200 billion one year and $280 billion five years later. 

The cumulative growth can be calculated as 40 percent using the above method. 


, Average growth can show you how much a figure grew each period during a longer time period. You might think that the average growth would simply be the cumulative growth divided by the number of periods, but this is not the case. Average growth is calculated using a different formula.

The formula, specific to calculating NGDP, can be expressed as NGDP Growth=(NGDPxNGDPx−1)1t−1{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=({\frac {NGDP_{x}}{NGDP_{x-1}}})^{\frac {1}{t}}-1}.The variable t{\displaystyle t} represents the number of time periods.



So, continuing with the cumulative growth example, we would have NGDP Growth=($280B$200)15−1{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=({\frac {\$280B}{\$200}})^{\frac {1}{5}}-1}. 

This would then simplify to NGDP Growth=(1.4)15−1{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=(1.4)^{\frac {1}{5}}-1}.

Then, the exponent can be solved by raising 1.4 to the power of 1 divided by 5, or 0.2. This is done on a calculator using the exponent button or can be entered into a search engine as ""1.4^0.2"". The result is 1.0696 when rounded to four decimal places. 

This leaves the equation as NGDP Growth=1.0696−1{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=1.0696-1}.

So, the result is NGDP Growth=0.0696{\displaystyle {\text{NGDP Growth}}=0.0696}.

Multiplying by 100, we get the average growth rate over the time period, which is 6.96 percent. 


, The primary function of nominal GDP is to express the total output of a country over a time period (usually a quarter or year) at its present market value. Nominal GDP growth can then be used to find the growth or decrease in output between years with inflation or deflation included. While this growth may not serve as a reliable measure of actual output between years, comparing market values between years can be useful for other purposes., The primary use of nominal GDP growth is to measure inflation between years. Real GDP growth is calculated for the same set of years. Then, the two growth rates are compared to assess inflation. If nominal GDP is rising faster than real GDP, the country's currency is experiencing inflation. If nominal GDP is growing at a slower rate, the country is experiencing deflation., Real GDP adds one more step to the summation of nominal GDP by factoring out inflation or deflation from GDP. The nominal GDP is modified by the GDP deflator, a measure of relative prices, to arrive at real GDP. The GDP deflator is composed of price indexes for the two periods being compared. For example, the price indexes of two years might be 105 for a base year and 120 for the current.The GDP deflator to convert nominal GDP for the current year to real GDP would then be 105÷120{\displaystyle 105\div 120}, or 0.875. 

So, if the nominal GDP for that year were $100 billion, real GDP would be 0.875×$100billion{\displaystyle 0.875\times \$100billion}, or $87.5 billion.

Assume the best.,
Avoid assumptions.,
Don't fear disability.,
Treat their disability and its symptoms as natural.,
Talk to them the same way you'd talk to another kid their age.,
Don't disclose an invisible disability without consent.,
Recognize their strengths.,
Let them support you.,
See the person and the disability.",How to Treat Children and Teens With Special Needs," Presume competence, and always err on the side of assuming that the child means well. Sometimes disabled children are assumed to be angry or disobedient when their disability is impeding their ability to move smoothly or process the demands being placed upon them.;
, Instead, ask questions if you don't know. If you're well-meaning, most people with special needs are happy to fill you in.


Don't assume that someone with a physical or developmental disability is intellectually disabled.
Ask before helping out: ""Do you want me to move this chair out of your way?"" Sometimes the disabled person wants to do something different than you anticipated (e.g. getting out of the wheelchair to sit in the chair).
Abilities can vary day to day. Someone who can walk with crutches today might need a wheelchair tomorrow.

, It may be new to you, but to the person with special needs, it's a fact of life. Disability does not need to be scary.

, Kids and teens with special needs may be insecure about their disability. Treat it similarly to how you'd handle a peanut allergy: talk about it calmly and casually, and accommodate it without making a fuss. This sends the message that you care, and that their needs are not a burden.


Assume that any harmless disability symptoms (e.g. stimming) are there for a reason. Treat them as a personal quirk and let them be.
If you aren't sure about their needs, it's okay to ask. ""Do you need help with the door?"" ""Is the noise bothering you?""

, Bending down and using baby talk might be appropriate with a two-year-old, but not with a twelve-year-old. Use a tone and body language that convey respect for them.


If they are fully articulate, then model your vocabulary usage after theirs. Listening to the words they use will help you know what level of words they understand.
If they are not fully articulate, then use the same vocabulary you'd use for their same-age peers. (For example, you would use your normal vocabulary with a nonverbal seventeen-year-old.)

, Some disabled people can ""pass"" as non-disabled, and while this can drain energy, it also makes them less vulnerable to discrimination and intrusive questions. If they have an invisible disability, talk with them about who knows and who doesn't know. Maybe it's public knowledge, or maybe it's a secret.

, Disability means they face challenges, but this does not make them devoid of strengths. Encourage their talents and cheer them on.


Treat their strengths the same way you'd treat a non-disabled person's strengths.

, Kids and teens with special needs are worthwhile people, and they often have something to contribute (whether it's help with your calculus homework or a hug when you need it). Give them a chance. They may surprise you.

, They want to be seen as a person, while having their limits and challenges respected. If you accommodate their needs, recognize their strengths, and listen to them, you will have achieved this.

Since these amounts must be supported by evidence, bills or payment receipts generally are required.If you're dealing with a breach of contract, financial reports showing your profits and losses before and after the breach will be beneficial.
You also should gather any invoices for other expenses, such as if you had to hire someone else to finish a job after a contractor breached your contract.
For personal injury cases, documents might include medical bills and receipts for prescriptions or medical equipment such as crutches that you had to buy.
Pay check stubs and work schedules will prove the amount of money you make if you had to miss work as a result of your injury.;
, In a personal injury case, medical expenses include doctor or hospital bills as well as the cost of any drugs, therapy, or other medical treatment the plaintiff needed as a result of their injuries.You'll also want to include any over-the-counter medicines or medical equipment you had to purchase.
For example, if you treated your pain from an auto accident by taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, the cost of that medication should also be considered part of your medical expenses.
Generally, the expenses you include are unreimbursed, out-of-pocket expenses – not anything covered by insurance.
This could include your deductibles or co-pays, as well as over-the-counter or alternative treatments that weren't covered by insurance at all.

, These expenses can come about in a personal injury case or a breach of contract case. If property was damaged as a result of the defendant's actions, the plaintiff can recover the expenses they incurred to repair or replace that property.For example, if you were in a car accident, you may have personal injuries and property damage. The repair bills for your car should be included as part of your actual damages.
Just as with medical expenses, your property damage expenses should include only expenses that you had to pay out of pocket – not anything covered by your insurance.
In a breach of contract case, you also might have property damages. For example, a construction contractor might breach their contract and abandon a work site, resulting in damage to the property.

, If the plaintiff had to miss work as a result of their injuries, they are entitled to recover those wages from the defendant. Lost wages also may occur in a breach of contract case, if the plaintiff missed work because of the breach.Typically lost wages include only unpaid amounts for hours or days that you couldn't work because of your injuries or other problems.
However, if you took paid time off, you should include those hours as though you were not paid for them. You lost those paid hours, so you still lost the same value.
Likewise, if you took unpaid vacation time that was accrued time off, you may be able to get some value for those hours.

, Particularly in a breach of contract case, the plaintiff may have incurred other expenses or losses, such as the loss of profits, legal costs, or travel expenses.For example, if you are a subcontractor, you may have had to settle a lawsuit or breach another contract as a result of the defendant's breach.
If you had to get a babysitter at any time so you could deal with your injuries or with the breach of contract, the amounts you paid the babysitter can be included in your actual expenses.
Basically, any costs you have that relate to the breach of contract or the personal injury you suffered, they should be included in your total economic damages.

, Not all damages from a personal injury or breach of contract occur in the past. There may be ongoing costs associated with the acts of the defendant, and the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for these.Particularly in a personal injury lawsuit, you may not be fully recovered or released from your doctor when you initiate your lawsuit.
You can use your past medical bills, coupled with how long your doctor estimates it will take you to recover, to estimate your future medical expenses.
The percentage of those expenses that will be covered by your insurance should be taken into consideration as well.

, General damages typically consist of damages for pain and suffering. These types of damages typically are not available in breach of contract cases.As much as the breach of contract may have been upsetting or mentally taxing to you, judges typically don't consider awarding damages for ""pain and suffering"" in contract cases.
Although you can add them to your settlement calculations if you feel so inclined, you're unlikely to get the other party to agree to pay them, since the other party will know the odds they'll have to pay them after a trial are slim to none.
However, there are other general damages that you may be able to recover in breach of contract cases. These include money for things such as loss of business opportunities or damage to your business reputation.
Due to the difficulty of proving these damages – as well as damages for pain and suffering in personal injury cases – it's important to talk to an attorney when you attempt to calculate these settlement amounts.

, To use the multiplier method to calculate your general damages, you must first total your past and estimated future medical expenses. This total will then be multiplied by a value ranging from 1.5 to 5.Special damages are those economic damages that are quantifiable and can be proven with reference to receipts or financial reports.
Your medical damages will include your unreimbursed hospital or doctor's bills, the costs for prescription drugs or other assistive devices, as well as over-the-counter medications and any bills for therapy.
Medical damages should include both your past and estimated future medical expenses.
This total of special damages is the amount that will be multiplied by a specific number called the ""multiplier"" to arrive at the total value of your case.

, Whether calculating general damages using the multiplier method or any other method, you can't expect to get a full recovery of all damages if you were partly to blame for the injury you incurred.A civil lawsuit is designed to make the person responsible pay for the damages that resulted from their acts. But if both parties are to some degree responsible, they'll share the costs.
For example, if you were involved in a car accident and each of you was equally at fault for that accident, you can only expect to get the person your sue to pay for 50 percent of your damages.
However, if they were 80 percent at fault for the accident, they should pay most if not all of your damages.

, You generally will need the medical opinion of a healthcare professional to make this estimation, and you may need more than one. The period of time it takes to recover from the injury may indicate a full recovery or an optimal recovery.Keep in mind that if the other party doubts or disagrees with your doctor's estimation, they may request that you be evaluated by another doctor of their choosing.
You typically can expect a higher settlement amount for longer recovery times. In terms of using a multiplier, a longer recovery time would mean a larger multiplier would be used.
For example, if your doctor believes that you will be fully recovered from your injuries within six months, that six-month period would affect the multiplier.
Depending on the severity of your injuries, a six-month recovery period might merit a multiplier of 2, while a two-year recovery period would merit a multiplier of 3 or 4.

, If the injury has left you with some degree of disability, that disability typically is valued by calculating the percent to which your normal functioning is impaired. This impairment can be to a specific part of your body, or to your body as a whole.Disability ratings are frequently used in workers' compensation and disability cases, but the same principals may be used in calculating settlement amounts in personal injury cases as well.
A doctor uses the permanent impairment guide published by the American Medical Association to evaluate the level of disability you retain after medical treatment and therapy are complete.
For example, suppose you broke your leg in an auto accident. After the bone has healed, you still have somewhat limited mobility compared to before the injury, and cannot stand for long periods of time or walk long distances.
From this, your doctor may conclude that you have a percentage of permanent disability as a result of the accident.
Impairment typically is expressed as a percentage, and this percentage is related either to the individual body part or the body as a whole. So after that broken leg, your doctor might conclude that you have a 10 percent impairment to your leg.

, Both physical and mental injuries can result in a significant loss to your quality of life. This can include anything from not being able to participate in activities you once enjoyed to having anxiety or other difficulty relating to others.For example, if you broke your leg in an auto accident, you can no longer walk or run while your leg is in a cast. If you were a member of a community soccer team, you wouldn't be able to play.
Your loss of ability to participate in the community soccer league would be something to consider separately from the injury itself when calculating your settlement amount.
Essentially, anything you used to do frequently before the injury that you can no longer do after the injury will have an impact on your quality of life and can impact the relative value of your case.
Many states also recognize ""loss of consortium,"" which refers to the negative impact an injury can have on your romantic relationship with your spouse or partner.

, This method, named after the Latin for ""per day,"" assigns a dollar amount for each day you were injured and then totals the days before your recovery. This method is used to determine the amount of money to which you're entitled for your pain and suffering as a result of the injury.Particularly if you suffered a relatively minor injury from which a full recovery is expected, the per diem method may get you a more generous settlement amount than the multiplier method.
To find the day rate, you would need to look at how much you make at work. If you make $30,000 a year, for example, your day rate would be $120 a day (assuming 250 working days per year).
Using the day rate is particularly helpful if you have made a full recovery from your injuries, without any remaining disability or impairment.
The per diem method can't be used effectively for long-term or permanent disability, because you have no way of knowing how long you'll live.

, In some cases, whether based in personal injury or in breach of contract, you may be entitled to punitive damages if the defendant's actions were intentional or particularly egregious.As indicated by the name, punitive damages are intended to punish the defendant for acts that are seen as particularly wrongful.
Some states don't allow punitive damages at all. In others, state law caps punitive damages, not allowing plaintiffs to get more than that amount.
Punitive damages also may be available in a breach of contract case. Review your contract to see if it has a clause relating to punitive damages.
Keep in mind that punitive damages are awarded by a jury, but seldom will a defendant agree to a settlement that includes punitive damages. So while it's important to consider it, punitive damages shouldn't be included in your settlement calculations.

, To finally determine how much a legal case is worth, look at the elements that must be proven at trial. Consider how much evidence is available to prove each of those elements.If you've hired an attorney, they'll be able to help with this evaluation. The relative strength of the plaintiff's case also depends on whether the defendant has any strong defenses, and vice versa.
When you evaluate evidence, keep the burden of proof in mind. In a civil case, the elements of a claim must only be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.
This means the plaintiff must prove that their version of events more likely than not happened. It's a much lower burden than the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard prosecutors must meet in criminal cases.
On the other hand, the defendant has the burden of proof for any defenses they raise. The same ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard typically applies.

, Actual damages are the specific amount you've already spent repairing the damage or treating the injury caused by the defendant, or specific losses you've incurred as the result of a contract breach.Actual damages also may be referred to as economic damages, or as special damages. All of these names mean the same thing.
Typically, this amount will represent the lowest number of your settlement range. However, it may be adjusted downward depending on other factors.
For example, if both parties are equally responsible for the accident that resulted in the plaintiff's injuries, the minimum settlement would be 50 percent of the plaintiff's economic damages.

, Civil litigation is expensive and time-consuming. These costs can make a lower settlement reached shortly after you file your complaint more valuable than a much higher award at trial.For example, the discovery process in a civil case can cost thousands of dollars. It may be reasonable to take a lower settlement, even if it's several thousand less than your case is worth, if it means you could avoid incurring these costs.
By the same token, if you've already spent a significant amount on litigation of the court case, the settlement should take these expenses into account – even if court costs and legal fees are not specifically addressed.
If you've hired an attorney, rely on their estimate of court costs and legal fees. These amounts also should be discussed in your retainer agreement.
If you have a breach of contract case, look at whether your contract provides for the breaching party to pay the other party's attorney's fees. If so, these will be considered separately from the settlement amount you calculate, then added to the final settlement amount.

, Based on the strengths and weaknesses of the case, you can assign probabilities as a percentage that indicates the likelihood that each particular outcome will occur.This sort of analysis typically should be left up to your attorney. But if you have a good understanding of the amount of evidence you have, and the evidence needed to prove the various elements of your case, you can make a good estimate yourself.
For example, suppose there are four specific things that you must prove to show that the defendant was responsible for your injuries. You have definitive, iron-clad proof of three of those things, but only circumstantial evidence of the fourth thing, you might estimate your probability of winning at trial at 75 percent.

, Based on your assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of your case and your probability analysis, you should be able to find a specific amount that your case is worth.Your settlement range should be built around this particular valuation, with the lower end of the range representing the actual costs you've incurred as a result of the defendant's acts.
Keep in mind that during settlement negotiations, you and the defendant most likely will meet somewhere in the middle.
For this reason, you should set the upper end of your range high enough that you have room to negotiate without going below the amount you've decided is the true value of your case.

Take the cost of an individual can of soda.,
For example, subtract the $1.00 cost of a can of soda from the $2.00 selling price.,
Divide the gross profit for a single unit by the cost of that single unit.,Repeat this procedure with several potential products to figure out the most profitable goods for your business.",How to Calculate Margin," This can be for the year, the month or the quarter, but all data should be gathered over the same period of time to achieve accurate figures.;
, This is your receipts from all sales in the period.

, This may include production costs, if you make the products in-house. It may be the purchase price of the goods sold, if you buy them from a supplier.


Do not factor in taxes, interest or general business expenses. These are not accounted for in gross profit margin, but they are later used to figure out net income derived from the business as a whole.
If you want to figure out the profitability of several products, you can separate the total revenue and the total cost of goods sold for each product and find individual gross profit margins.

,


For example, if you made $200 selling 100 cans of soda and the cost of the goods sold was $100, then your gross profit would be $100.

, Multiply the number by 100 to get a percentage, rather than a decimal.


For example, divide $100 by $100 and the figure is 1. If you multiply it by 100, you get a gross profit percentage of 100 percent.

,, Subtract it from the selling price of an individual can.

, $1.00 is your gross profit.

, Multiply by 100 to get the percentage.


In our example, the gross profit margin is $1.00 divided by $1.00, so we get a profit margin percentage of 100 percent.
