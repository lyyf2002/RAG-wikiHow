Start with consumer spending.,
Add in investment.,
Insert the excess of exports over imports.,
Include government spending.",How to Calculate GDP2," Consumer spending is the measure of all spending a nation's consumers make on good and services during the year.

Examples of consumer spending would include the purchase of consumable goods like food and clothing, durable goods like tools and furniture, and services such as hair cuts and doctor visits.

, When economists calculate GDP, investment does not mean the purchase of stocks and bonds, but rather money spent by businesses to acquire goods and services to help or maintain the business.


Examples of investments include materials or contracting services used when a business builds a new factory, equipment purchases and software to help a business run efficiently.

, Because GDP only calculates products produced domestically, imports must be subtracted out. Exports must be added in because once they leave the country, they will not be added in through consumer spending. To account for imports and exports, take the total value of exports and subtract the total value of imports. Then, add this result into the equation.


If a nation's imports have a higher value than its exports, this number will be negative. If the number is negative, subtract it instead of adding it.

, The money a government spends on goods and services must be added to calculate GDP.


Examples of government spending include payroll for public employees, spending on infrastructure and defense spending. Social security and unemployment benefits are considered transfer payments and are not included in government spending because the money is simply transferred from one person to another.

, Proprietor's income is the money earned by business owners, including incorporated businesses, partnerships and sole proprietor-ships.

, This is the income earned by stockholders.

, This is all sales tax, business property tax and license fees.

, This is the decrease in value of goods.

, To calculate this, take the total payments received by domestic citizens from foreign entities and subtract the total payments sent to foreign entities for domestic production.

Differentiate between nominal and real GDP for a more accurate picture about how a country is doing.,
Choose a base year.,
Decide how much prices have gone up from the base year.,
Divide the nominal GDP by the deflator.",How to Calculate GDP4," The main difference between nominal and real GDP is that real GDP takes inflation into account. If you don't take inflation into account, you could believe that a country's GDP is increasing when really their prices are increasing.


Think about it like this. If GDP of country A was $1 billion in 2012, but in 2013 it printed and then circulated $500 million, of course its GDP is going to be bigger in 2013 than it was in 2012. But this increase isn't a good reflection of the goods and services produced in country A. Real GDP effectively discounts these inflationary increases.

, Your base year can be a year back, five years, 10, or even 100. But you need to choose a year against which to compare the inflation. Because, at heart, real GDP is a comparison. And a comparison is only really a comparison if two or more things — years and figures — are being weighed against one another. For a simple real GDP calculation, choose the year prior to the year you're looking at.

, This number is also called the ""deflator."" If your rate of inflation from the base year to the current year is 25%, for example, you'd list that inflationary rate as 125, or 1 (100%) plus .25 (25%) times 100. For all cases of inflation, the deflator is going to be higher than 1.

If, for example, the country that you're measuring actually experienced deflation, where purchasing power increased instead of decreased, the deflator would drop below 1. Say, for example, the rate of deflation was 25% from the base period to the current period. That means the currency can buy 25% more than it used to in its base period. Your deflator would be 75, or 1 (100%) minus .25 (25%) times 100.

, Real GDP is equal to the ratio of your nominal GDP divided by 100. As an equation, it starts off like this: Nominal GDP ÷ Real GDP = Deflator ÷ 100.


So, if your current nominal GDP is $10 million, and your deflator is 125 (inflation was 25% from the base period to the current period), this is how you'd set up your equation:

$10,000,000 ÷ Real GDP = 125 ÷ 100
$10,000,000 ÷ Real GDP = 1.25
$10,000,000 = 1.25 X Real GDP
$10,000,000 ÷ 1.25 = Real GDP
$8,000,000 = Real GDP

Determine the principal.,
Determine the interest rate.,
Measure the term of the loan.,
Calculate the interest.,
Try another example.",How to Calculate Interest1," The principal is the amount of money that you will use to calculate the interest. This could be an amount of money that you deposit into a savings account or bond of some kind. In that case, you will be earning the interest that you calculate. Alternatively, if you borrow money, such as a home mortgage, the principal is the amount that you borrow, and you will calculate interest that you owe.

In either case, whether you will be collecting the interest or paying the interest, the amount of the principal is generally symbolized by the variable P.For example, if you have made a loan to a friend of $2,000, the principal loaned would be $2,000.
;
, Before you can calculate how much your principal will appreciate, you need to know by what rate your principal will grow. This is your interest rate. The interest rate is generally advertised or agreed upon between the parties before the loan is made.For example, suppose you loaned money to a friend under the understanding that at the end of 6 months your friend would pay you back the $2,000 plus 1.5%. The one-time interest rate is 1.5%. But before you can use the rate of 1.5% you must convert it to a decimal. To change percent to a decimal, divide by 100:

1.5% ÷ 100 = 0.015. 




, The term is another name for the length of the loan. In some cases, you will agree to the length of the loan when you borrow it. For example, most mortgages have a defined term. For many private loans, the borrower and lender may agree to any term they wish.

It is important that the length of the term match the interest rate, or at least be measured in the same units. For example, if your interest rate is for a year, then your term should be measured in years as well. If the rate is advertised as 3% per year, but the loan is only six months, then you would calculate a 3% annual interest rate for a term of 0.5 years.

As another example, if the rate is agreed to be 1% per month, and you borrow the money for six months, then the term for calculation would be 6.


, To calculate interest, multiply the principal by the interest rate and the term of the loan. This formula can be expressed algebraically as:


I=P∗r∗t{\displaystyle I=P*r*t}

Using the above example of the loan to a friend, the principal (P{\displaystyle P}) is $2,000, and the rate (r{\displaystyle r}) is 0.015 for six months. Because the agreement in this example was for a single term of six months, the variable t{\displaystyle t} in this case is 1. Then calculate the interest as follows:


I=Prt=(2000)(0.015)(1)=30{\displaystyle I=Prt=(2000)(0.015)(1)=30}. Thus, the interest due is $30.



If you want to calculate the amount of the full payment due (A), with the interest and the return of the principal, then use the formula A=P(1+rt){\displaystyle A=P(1+rt)}. This calculation would look like:


A=P(1+rt){\displaystyle A=P(1+rt)}


A=2000(1+.015∗1){\displaystyle A=2000(1+.015*1)}


A=2000(1.015){\displaystyle A=2000(1.015)}


A=2,030{\displaystyle A=2,030}




, Just for more practice, suppose you deposit $5,000 in a savings account with a 3% annual interest rate. After only three months, you withdraw the money and any interest due at that time.


A=P(1+rt){\displaystyle A=P(1+rt)}


A=5000(1+.03∗0.25){\displaystyle A=5000(1+.03*0.25)}


A=5000(1.0075){\displaystyle A=5000(1.0075)}


A=5037.5{\displaystyle A=5037.5}

In three months, you would earn $37.50 interest.

Note that t=0.25 here, because three months is one-fourth (0.25) of the original one year term.

Calculate the consumer surplus.",How to Calculate Consumer Surplus," Most people have heard the phrase ""supply and demand"" used in reference to the mysterious forces governing market economies, but many don't understand these concepts' full implications. ""Demand"" refers to the desire for a good or service in the marketplace. Generally, if all other factors are equal, demand for a product will fall as its price increases.For example, let's say that a company is about to release a new model of television. The more they charge for this new model, the fewer televisions they can expect to sell overall. This is because consumers have limited amounts of money to spend and, by paying for a more expensive television, they may have to forego spending money on other things which can give them some greater benefit (groceries, gasoline, mortgage, etc.).;
, Conversely, the law of supply dictates that products and services that demand a high price will be supplied at a high rate. Essentially, people who sell things want to make as much revenue as possible by selling lots of expensive products, so, if a certain type of product or service is very lucrative, producers will rush to produce that product or service.For example, let's say that right before Mother's Day, tulips become very expensive. In response to this, the farmers who have the ability to produce tulips will pour resources into this activity, generating as many tulips as possible to take advantage of the high-price situation.

, One very common way that economists express the relationship between supply and demand is via 2-dimensional x/y graph. Usually, in this case, the x axis is set as Q, the quantity of goods in the marketplace, and the y axis is set as P, the price of the goods. Demand is expressed as a curve sloping from the top left to the bottom right of the graph and supply is expressed as a curve sloping from the bottom left to the top right.The intersection of the supply and demand curves is the point at which the market is at equilibrium—in other words, the point at which producers are producing precisely as many goods and services as consumers demand., Marginal utility is the increase in satisfaction a consumer gets from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. In very general terms, the marginal utility of goods and services is subject to diminishing returns—in other words, each additional unit purchased provides less and less benefit to the consumer. Eventually, the marginal utility of the good or service diminishes to the point that it's not ""worth it"" for the consumer to purchase an additional unit.For example, let's say that a consumer is very hungry. She goes to a restaurant and orders a hamburger for $5. After this hamburger, she's still a little hungry, so she orders another hamburger for $5. The marginal utility of this second hamburger is slightly less than that of the first since it provides less satisfaction in terms of relief from hunger for its cost than the first hamburger does. The consumer decides not to buy a third hamburger because she's full, and thus, the third hamburger has virtually no marginal utility for her.

, Consumer surplus is broadly defined as the difference between an item's ""total value"" or ""total value received"" to consumers and the actual price that they pay for it. In other words, if consumers pay less for a product than what it's worth to them, consumer surplus represents their “savings”.As a simplified example, let's say that a consumer is in the market for a used car. He has given himself $10,000 to spend. If he buys a car with everything he wants for $6,000, we can say that he has a consumer surplus of $4,000. In other words, the car was worth $10,000 to him, but he ended up with the car and a surplus of $4,000 to spend as he pleases on other things.

, As noted above, economists use graphs to compare the relationship between supply and demand in the marketplace. Since consumer surplus is calculated based on this relationship, we'll use this type of graph in our calculation.As noted above, set the y axis as P (price) and the x axis as Q (quantity of goods).The different intervals along the axes will correspond to different respective values—price intervals for the price axis and quantities of goods for the quantity axis.

, Supply and demand curves—especially in early examples of consumer surplus—are usually represented as linear equations (straight lines on the graph). Your consumer surplus problem may already have the supply and demand curves plotted, or you may have to plot them.


As with the explanation of the curves on a graph earlier, the demand curve will slope down starting from the top left, and the supply curve will slope up starting from the bottom left.
The supply and demand curves for any good or service will be different, but should accurately reflect the relationship between the demand (in terms of the amount of money consumers would potentially spend) and the supply (in terms of the amount of goods purchased).

, As discussed earlier, equilibrium in the supply and demand relationship is the point on the graph where the two curves intersect one another.For example, let’s say the point of equilibrium is at 15 units with a price point of $5/unit.

, Now that you know the point of equilibrium, draw a horizontal line starting from that point that intersects perpendicular to the price axis.For our example, we know that the point is going to intersect the price axis at $5.


The triangular area between this horizontal line, the vertical line of the price axis, and where the demand curve intersects both is the area corresponding to consumer surplus., Since the triangle corresponding to consumer surplus is a right triangle (the equilibrium point intersects the price axis at a 90° angle) and the ‘’area’’ of that triangle is what you want to calculate, you must know how to calculate the area of a right triangle. The equation for it is 1/2(base x height) or (base x height)/2., Now that you know the equation and the numbers, you’re ready to plug them in.


For our example, the base of the triangle is the quantity demanded at the point of equilibrium, which is 15.
To get the height of the triangle for our example, we must take the equilibrium price point ($5) and subtract it from the price point at which the demand curve intersects the price axis (let’s say $12 for your example. 12 - 5 = 7, so we would use a height of 7.

, With the numbers plugged into the equation, you’re ready to solve. With the running example, CS = 1/2(15 x 7) = 1/2 x 105 = $52.50.

Understand the meaning of compound interest.,
Know the principal amount.,
Measure the rate.,
Know when the interest will compound.,
Know the term of the loan.,
Identify the variables from the situation.,
Apply the formula and calculate the compounded interest.",How to Calculate Interest2," Compound interest means that as your interest is earned, the interest goes back into the account, and you begin earning (or paying) interest on top of interest. As a simple example, if you deposit $100 at 5% interest per year, then at the end of one year you will earn $5 interest. If you return that to the account, then at the end of the second year, you will earn 5% of $105, not just the original $100. Over time, this can increase quite substantially.The formula for calculating the value (A) of compounding interest is:


A=P(1+rn)nt{\displaystyle A=P(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}}




, As with simple interest, the calculation begins with the amount of the principal. The calculation is the same, whether you are calculating interest on money borrowed or money loaned. The principal amount is generally denoted with the variable P{\displaystyle P}., The interest rate must be agreed upon at the outset and should be presented in a decimal number for calculation. Recall that the percent number can be converted to a decimal by dividing by 100 (or, as a shortcut, moving the decimal point two places to the left). Make sure that you know the length of time that the interest rate applies to. The rate is noted algebraically as r{\displaystyle r}.For example, a credit card may advertise interest of 15% per year. However, interest is generally applied each month, so you may want to know the monthly interest rate. In that case, divide by 12, to find the monthly interest rate of 1.25% per month. These two rates, 15% per year or 1.25% per month, are equivalent to each other.


, Compounding interest means that the interest will be calculated periodically and added back to the principal amount. For some loans, this may happen once a year. For some, it may happen each month or each quarter. You need to know how many times a year the interest will be compounded.If interest is compounded annually, then n=1.

If interest is compounded quarterly, for example, then n=4.


, The term is the length of time for which the interest will be calculated. The term is generally measured in years. If you need to calculate interest for some other length of time, you will need to convert into years.For example, for a loan of one year, then t=1{\displaystyle t=1}. But, for a term of 18 months, then t=1.5{\displaystyle t=1.5}.


, Suppose, for this example, you deposit $5,000 into a savings account that pays 5%, compounded monthly. What will be the value of this account after three years?First, identify the variables that you need to solve the problem. In this case:


P=$5,000{\displaystyle P=\$5,000}


r=0.05{\displaystyle r=0.05}


n=12{\displaystyle n=12}


t=3{\displaystyle t=3}




, Once you have understood the situation and identified the variables, enter them into the formula to find the amount of the interest.

For the problem started above, this would look as follows:


A=P(1+rn)nt{\displaystyle A=P(1+{\frac {r}{n}})^{nt}}


A=5000(1+0.0512)12∗3{\displaystyle A=5000(1+{\frac {0.05}{12}})^{12*3}}


A=5000(1+0.00417)36{\displaystyle A=5000(1+0.00417)^{36}}


A=5000(1.00417)36{\displaystyle A=5000(1.00417)^{36}}


A=5000(1.1616){\displaystyle A=5000(1.1616)}


A=5808{\displaystyle A=5808}



Thus, after three years, compound interest will have amounted to $808, in addition to the original $5,000 deposit.

"
Understand continuously compounding interest.,
Know the variables for calculating the interest.,
Know the details of your loan.,
Use the formula to calculate the interest.",How to Calculate Interest3," As you saw in the previous example, compound interest grows faster than simple interest by adding the interest back to the principal at certain times. Compounding quarterly is more valuable than compounding annually. Compounding monthly is even more valuable than compounding quarterly. The most valuable situation would have the interest compounding continuously - that is, every instant. As quickly as interest can be calculated, it is returned to the account and adds to the principal. This is obviously only theoretical.Using some calculus, mathematicians have developed a formula that simulates interest that is compounded and added back to the account in a continuous stream. This formula, which is used to calculate continuously compounding interest, is:


A=Pert{\displaystyle A=Pe^{rt}}




, The formula for the continuously compounding interest looks similar to the early situations, with some slight differences. The variables for the formula are:A{\displaystyle A} is the future value (or Amount) of money that the loan will be worth after compounding the interest.


P{\displaystyle P} is the principal.


e{\displaystyle e}. Although this looks like a variable, it is actually a constant number. The letter e{\displaystyle e} is a special number called “Euler’s constant,” named for the mathematician Leonard  Euler who discovered its properties. 

Most advanced graphing calculators have a button for ex{\displaystyle e^{x}}. If you press this button, with the number 1, to represent e1{\displaystyle e^{1}}, you will learn that the value of e{\displaystyle e} is approximately 2.718.




r{\displaystyle r} is the interest rate per year.


t{\displaystyle t} is the term of the loan, measured in years.


, Banks typically use continuously compounding interest on home mortgage loans. Suppose you want to borrow $200,000 at a rate of 4.2% for a 30 year mortgage. The variables that you will use for the calculation are, therefore:P=200,000{\displaystyle P=200,000}


e{\displaystyle e}, again, is not a variable but is the constant 2.718.


r=0.042{\displaystyle r=0.042}


t=30{\displaystyle t=30}


, Apply the values to the formula to calculate the amount of interest that you will owe on the 30 year loan.A=Pert{\displaystyle A=Pe^{rt}}


A=200000∗2.718(0.042)(30){\displaystyle A=200000*2.718^{(0.042)(30)}}


A=200000∗2.7181.26{\displaystyle A=200000*2.718^{1.26}}


A=200000∗3.525{\displaystyle A=200000*3.525}


A=705000{\displaystyle A=705000}

Notice the enormous value of compounding interest continuously.

Understanding this measurement is a way of knowing whether the general economy for the country (or other chosen location) is getting better, worse or staying stable over time.GDP figures are generally made available on a quarterly basis. To calculate the “annualized” GDP growth rate specifically, use data for the full year, not just a selected quarter.

This figure is always called the “growth” rate and uses a single formula, regardless of whether the GDP is increasing or decreasing. If the value of the GDP increases from one year to the next, the formula will produce a positive result. If the result is negative, the value is dropping, and you can say that there has been “negative growth” over the selected time period.
;
, In the United States, the accepted source for GDP data is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). The BEA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Commerce, which is charged with calculating the GDP for the United States. The BEA has the resources available to collect all the sales and employment data that becomes part of the GDP.Visit the BEA website at http://www.bea.gov. From the home page, you can see numerous links to National GDP, Regional GDP, and a wide variety of press releases and data releases.

For the annual GDP for the country, choose the link to “GDP.” You will be directed to a spreadsheet that contains the GDP, broken down by year and quarter for approximately the last 100 years.


, To determine the annualized GDP growth rate, you need to know the GDP of two consecutive years. Using the data from the BEA, find the annual GDP for one year and the annual GDP for the next year.

If the GDP is reported quarterly, add together the four quarters for the year to find the annual GDP. For example, the BEA reports quarterly GDP data for the U.S. For the years, 2015 and 2016, add the quarters together as follows to find the annual GDP of each year. The data shown here is reported in terms of billions of dollars:


2015 GDP=$17,783.60+$17,998.30+$18,141.90+$18,222.80=$72,146.60{\displaystyle {\text{2015 GDP}}=\$17,783.60+\$17,998.30+\$18,141.90+\$18,222.80=\$72,146.60}


2016 GDP=$18,281.60+$18,450.10+$18,675.30+$18,860.80=$74,267.80{\displaystyle {\text{2016 GDP}}=\$18,281.60+\$18,450.10+\$18,675.30+\$18,860.80=\$74,267.80}


, To calculate the growth rate over the chosen time period, use the formula:


Rate=Final GDP−Initial GDPInitial GDP{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}={\frac {{\text{Final GDP}}-{\text{Initial GDP}}}{\text{Initial GDP}}}}

For the example of calculating the annual growth rate from 2015 to 2016, insert the figures as follows:


Rate=Final GDP−Initial GDPInitial GDP{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}={\frac {{\text{Final GDP}}-{\text{Initial GDP}}}{\text{Initial GDP}}}}


Rate=$74,267.80−$72,146.60$72,146.60{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}={\frac {\$74,267.80-\$72,146.60}{\$72,146.60}}}


Rate=0.02940{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}=0.02940}




, The growth rate formula provides you with a final result as a decimal number. To convert this to a percentage form that makes sense to economists, multiply by 100%. You can then report the annual growth rate as a percentage figure.For example, again using the data from 2015 to 2016, the calculation produced a result of 0.02940. Convert this to a percentage as follows:


0.02940∗100%=2.940%{\displaystyle 0.02940*100\%=2.940\%}



Thus, you can report that the annualized growth rate of the U.S. GDP from 2015 to 2016 is 2.940%. Because the figure is positive, the GDP is improving over that time period.


, A comparison of GDP growth rates does not have to be limited to annual data. In fact, economists often want to know results and see trends over smaller time periods.In the U.S., the BEA calculates and reports GDP data each quarter.You can use and manipulate the data in any way you wish, as long as you define your calculations appropriately. For example, you might want to measure a short-term GDP growth from the third quarter of 2016 to the fourth quarter of 2016. 

Alternatively, you might want to compare the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2016. Note that, while this is a measure of data from two different years, this is not an annualized calculation. It is a comparison of a specific portion of each year, perhaps to determine whether the time of year has any impact on spending or production.

Finally, someone studying long range changes in economies might even want to compare decades. For example, you could compare the GDP from 1980-1989 to the GDP from 1990-1999. You would do this by adding together the GDPs of the ten individual years.


, Whether you want to calculate a growth rate over an annual range or for a shorter or longer time period, the formula remains the same. You find the difference of the two chosen time periods, divided by the GDP of the initial time period.While you can measure quarters, years, decades or any other period you wish, you must be consistent. For example, it would be meaningless to compare the GDP of one quarter of a year, to the GDP of another full year.

Suppose, for example, you wish to find the growth rate of the GDP from the third quarter of 2016 ($18,675.30) to the fourth quarter of 2016 ($18,860.80). The calculation would be as follows:


Rate=Final GDP−Initial GDPInitial GDP{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}={\frac {{\text{Final GDP}}-{\text{Initial GDP}}}{\text{Initial GDP}}}}


Rate=$18,860.80−$18,675.30$18,675.30{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}={\frac {\$18,860.80-\$18,675.30}{\$18,675.30}}}


Rate=0.009933{\displaystyle {\text{Rate}}=0.009933}




, Finally, use the figure that you obtain from the calculation and convert it to a percentage by multiplying by 100%. The result is the growth or decline of the GDP over your selected time period.

For the final two quarters of 2016, this calculation is:


0.009933∗100%=0.9933%{\displaystyle 0.009933*100\%=0.9933\%}



You would report that the GDP increased by 0.9933%, or almost 1% over the given two quarters.


, The GDP is the gross domestic product of any identified geographic area. Usually, people measure and compare the GDP of individual countries. However, within the U.S., you might compare the GDP of separate states. On a broader scale, you may wish to find the GDP of North America or Asia.Just as you need to define a location if you want to calculate GDP growth rates, you also need to understand what location is being represented when you read GDP data.


, The GDP can be calculated in one of three different ways. Each method is valid but describes a slightly different approach to viewing the economy. When you calculate the GDP, you need to define which method you are using. The three methods are:Expenditures approach. This method calculates the sum of expenditures by final consumers of products. The traditional formula when calculating GDP in this way is:

GDP = Consumption + Investment + Gov’t Spending + (Exports - Imports)



Income approach. Less commonly used, this method accounts for all the incomes earned and costs incurred in the country’s production.

Value-added approach. This calculation measures the total sales of an area minus the value of services or supplies added during the course of production. This approach is regularly used in measuring U.S. industrial production.


, The expenditures approach is the most direct calculation and the one most commonly used and studied by economists around the world. This calculation takes into account the following basic areas:Consumption. This first term accounts for personal consumption expenditures, which is basically the total amount of money that the population spends over the selected time period. The BEA breaks this down into two subcategories of goods and services. Goods are concrete items that can be bought and sold, and services are payments for other people’s labor or expertise.

Investment. The investment figure constitutes the total of purchases that businesses make in the process of creating their products. This would include purchases of all supplies used in production as well as new equipment or machinery used to expand production. The investment category also includes materials used in residential construction projects.

Government Spending. This item tracks what the government of the chosen region or country actually spends over the selected time period. Values are calculated at the prices that the government actually spends on items as diverse as office equipment, building supplies for government projects or weapons and items for the military.

Net exports. Some formulas for GDP include a single term of “net exports,” while others will incorporate two terms, exports and imports. As long as both are included, the result will be the same. The calculation is to add all exports to the GDP and deduct the value of all imports. The net is the positive growth for the GDP., The GDP, in basic terms, is the sum of the data that you calculated in the preceding step. When all the portions are determined, they are added to provide the final result.

For example, the BEA reports the following figures for the fourth quarter GDP of 2016 (figures are in billions of dollars):

Consumption = $12,980.40

Investment = $3,106.50

Government = $3,312.10

Net exports = -$538.30

GDP = $18,860.70

Be patient in your climb up the career ladder.,
Hone your analytical skills.,
Stay current.,
Work on your social skills, too.,
Dive into your critical-thinking abilities.",How to Become an Economist," To make college that much easier, start setting yourself up for success now. Take introductory courses in high school that'll give you a grip on what you'll be immersing yourself into in college. Get familiar with the topics at hand, stay up-to-date on current political and economic events, and start making it plan A for your future.


If you don't know much about this area, start reading and watching TV. Freakonomics, The Armchair Economist, and The Naked Economist are all great books that make their material exciting. You should also look at The Economist and the Wall Street Journal for more current information. When it comes to TV, watch a variety of channels to get different economic and political perspectives.;
, It's a good idea to major in economics, business management, or a math-related field, like statistics. Dive right into classes like microeconomics, macroeconomics, econometrics and economic thought and theory. You'll also need classes in marketing, finance, and accounting.


Don't forget classes in politics and industry, too. These sectors are closely linked with local and global economies and can help specialize your knowledge and land you jobs in the future.

, Most successful economists have education beyond that of a bachelor's. The job outlook is better the more education you have, too. Though it is possible to get a job in a related field with just an undergraduate degree, consider getting your master's to up your career potential.


If you do stop at the bachelor level, you may find work as a research assistant, financial analyst, market research analyst, or similar other positions in business, finance, and consulting.
Many choose to get a part-time job in a related field to get work experience and then pursue higher education simultaneously to climb the career ladder as efficiently as possible.

, Master's (and PhD) candidates often get internships during their time at college, working with a professor or private company assisting with research. This looks great on a resume and can be your foothold into the academic or professional world of economics. Scope out your opportunities during your studies to supplement your education.


To get a balance of experience prior to your degree, try to do work in the private sector, with the government, and do research. This will give you a taste of the possible routes in front of you and help you make a decision later.

, Again, with more education comes more job opportunities (and higher pay). If you get your PhD, you could teach or work just about anywhere. This takes several years, and includes completing detailed research in a specialty field. It is a research-based degree that focuses on upper level understanding of quantitative analysis.


What can you specialize in? Industrial organization, game theory, international economics, income distribution and econometrics are just a few topics grad students choose to pursue individually.
Join a professional organization. If you have an advanced degree in a particular area, there is likely a professional organization you can join to meet and network with other fellow economists; two examples are the Association for Social Economics and the National Association for Business Economists.This can lead to great connections and job opportunities in the future.

, At the beginning, any job will do. Most economists don't start out as full-fledged economists. It'll be easier to land a gig as a financial researcher, an accountant, or as an assistant to an economist. You can then work your way up in the company.


If you have the right combination of education and experience, you could also look into working for business, research, or international organizations.

, Plenty of economists with higher degrees also teach part-time to supplement their income and keep up-to-date on and participate in research. During the time it takes to work your up the ladder, teaching can be a very convenient gig to keep your passions alive.


With a master's degree you can teach in community colleges and in high schools. It'll take a PhD to teach at the university level.

, Many economists and hopeful economists wind up working for the government. With the plethora of positions they need filled, this isn't exactly surprising. If private sector work doesn't seem for you, consider this as a valid alternative.


Most government positions accept those with only bachelor's degrees, but more education will ensure you a higher paid, higher-on-the-totem pole position.

, The U.S. Bureau of Labor and Statistics says the job outlook for economists through 2020 is going to be slower than average.Government or the private sector may be your best chance for employment.If you have to start out as an accountant or research assistant, consider it paying your dues. You'll rise to the top eventually.


Consider a job in any related business a step in the right direction. Many companies hire from within and with the right qualifications, you could easily become next in line. In this career, it's important to roll with the punches to stay on top of your game.

, Economists are constantly collecting and scrutinizing even the tiniest bits of information. You will be a researcher, an analyst, and a forecaster. You will look for trends and patterns and essentially be a problem-solver. It's easy to see that analytical skills are a must-have even to just do your job at a basic level.


If you love puzzles, your analytical skills likely come natural to you. If you rock a good Sudoku game and enjoy websites like Lumosity, keep it up. To be a spark in the economics industry, your mind has to be firing on all pistons.

, Economists are constantly looking at past and current trends to predict the future. They are on the frontier of the political climate and are always a step ahead of the curve. To make sure you're on the cusp (and to stay employed), you'll need to stay current with political and international events and trends.


Make sure to read local, regional, and international news. Familiarize yourself with future projections made by other economic analysts and follow political trends. You should be constantly reading (whether it's a book or on the Internet) to be able to analyze situations from multiple angles.

, Economists are constantly having to convince others of their findings. They're making presentations and giving speeches, forecasting the future, dispelling myths, and finding patterns to help their employer succeed and account for tomorrow. You need to be able to pinpoint relevant information in addition to relaying it to different types of people.


Many economists find themselves in slightly different fields, like writing a column about their knowledge, doing TV specials, or giving seminars. Because of the wide array of options that can spider out from this career, it's best to as well-balanced as possible.

, Every day you're going to be confronted with complex problems and need to use higher level reasoning and logic. You'll need to take the data in front of you and think about it outside of the box, how it applies to different situations, and what it means for the future.


Every detail matters and can change your thinking. You'll need to be nit-picky and focused to be accurate. It will require diligence and a meticulousness not seen in many other careers. It's hard work, but it can be very rewarding.

Record the asset's price at several points in time.,
Familiarize yourself with the formula used for calculating a growth rate.,
Calculate the asset's growth rate using the formula above.,
Annualize the growth rate for easy analysis.",How to Calculate an Asset Growth Rate," To calculate a growth rate, you will need at least 2 data points. The farther apart these data points are, the more accurate the growth rate is likely to be. For example, it is better to use price points 10 years apart than points 1 year apart.


Having more than 2 price points will allow you to calculate the asset's constant change in price over small periods of time. This is useful is you plan to adjust your figures for market movements.;
, An asset's growth rate between 2 price points can be calculated using the following formula: GR = (P2 - P1) / P1. In this formula, ""GR"" represents the growth rate, ""P1"" represents the early price point, and ""P2"" represents the later price point.

, To arrive at the growth rate between your 2 points in time, plug your numbers into the growth formula. For example, consider a stock that was priced at $43 per share 10 years ago, and is currently priced at $60.


Using the formula above, the stock's growth rate is (60 - 43) / 43, or 0.39. This means that the stock increased in value by 39 percent over the 10-year period analyzed.






Note that this growth rate is not an annual return. The asset above can be expected to grow by 39 percent every decade, not every year.

, Generally, you will want to know how big of a return you can expect on an asset on an annual basis. Converting a long-term growth rate to an annual growth rate uses a slightly more complicated formula than above. The formula is: i = (P2 / P1) ^ (1 / n) - 1. In this formula, ""i"" represents the annual growth rate, and ""n"" represents the number of years between the 2 price points.


In the example above, the annual growth rate is: (60 / 43) ^ (1 / 10) - 1, or 0.0338. This means that this stock grew by an average of 3.38 percent each year over the 10-year period.






Using an annualized growth rate will better allow you to compare assets against each other. It will also allow you to determine whether an asset meets your required rate of return for a given level of risk.

Convert the percentage discount to a decimal.,
Multiply the original price by the decimal.,
Subtract the discount from the original price.",How to Calculate a Discount1," To do this, think of the percent number with a decimal to the right of the last digit. Move the decimal point two places to the left to get the converted decimal.You can also use the %{\displaystyle \%} sign on a calculator.

For example, you might want to calculate the sale price of a pair of shoes that is regularly $69.95. If the shoes are 25% off, you need to convert 25% to a decimal by thinking 25%=25.00%=.25{\displaystyle 25\%=25.00\%=.25}.
;
, You can  multiply the decimal by hand, or use a calculator. This will tell you the discount, or what value is being taken off the original price.For example, to find the 25% discount on a pair of $69.95 shoes, you would calculate 69.95×.25=17.49{\displaystyle 69.95\times .25=17.49}.


, To subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and subtract as you would whole numbers. Be careful to drop the decimal point down into your answer. You can also use a calculator. The difference will be the sale price of the item.For example, if a pair of shoes that are originally $69.95 have a discount of $17.49, calculate the sale price by subtracting:69.95−17.49=52.46{\displaystyle 69.95-17.49=52.46}. So, the shoes are on sale for $52.46.

Simplify your lessons: Good teachers make it easy to understand complicated things.,
Keep your students attention.",How to Be a Professional Teacher," Create a good first impression from day one of the academic year.;
, It is important for teachers to dress in clean clothes with no stains or odor whether they teach in the gym, the shop, or the math classroom. This also means no denim or t-shirts.  Revealing clothes are the number one ""no-no"" for female teachers. Male teachers should remember that a tie and jacket worn to work, can easily be removed, should the need arise. Teachers should arrive at work, looking the part, not dressed looking like their students. 

, A professional teacher understands the need to start the day well, every day. Truly professional teachers will make sure that they arrive at least ten minutes before the first bell rings, so as to prepare themselves mentally for the day ahead.

, Check your diary the night before and plan the day ahead. Professional teachers plan thoroughly too for every lesson and class. They stick to their work programme and assessment schedule, to ensure that not only syllabus content is covered, but also the necessary skills for their students' longer-term success in their specific subject or learning area.

, Professionals embrace the corporate identity and values and model these for the clients - in this case, the children they teach.

, Manage your students' behaviour. A professional teacher will not keep running to school management for assistance with classroom discipline, for example.

, Make sure your notes and handouts are professionally presented. Professional teachers should never have to be asked to re-do a piece of work because its presentation is shoddy.

, Professionals keep their work up to date and plan ahead. Amateurs leave work until the last minute.

, A three day rule of thumb should apply. If you take too long to hand back class tests and so on, the students will have lost interest in the task and their results by the time you return their work.

, Model respect for authority for your students and gaining their respect will be much easier for you.

, A professional teacher will not create negativity in a staff room or engage in mindless gossip and the spreading of dissent.

, A professional teacher will not be a doomsayer and throw cold water on new ideas or suggestions for positive change. A professional will not vocalise negative thoughts like ""That will never work at this school.""

, The better you get to know your students, the more influence you will have on their attitude towards your subject and on their lives in general. Remember the adage: ""Teachers touch eternity; they never know where their influence may end.""

, Follow the maxim ""Do unto others."" Never publicly humiliate or belittle your students. Do not discuss their results or grades in front of other students. Don't personalise issues with students. Leave their family, background, religion, behaviour, and personal circumstances out of public disciplinary processes and discussions.

, Model responsible adult values, exhibit self-control, choose your words carefully and consider the impact they may have on a particular student or group of students.

, A professional teacher will use students' personal information to assist in helping a child to reach his or her potential. Confidential information will not be disclosed over tea during recess, or used as a weapon against a student. Confidential information such as the content of staff meetings too will be treated in the strictest of confidence.

, Try to include parents in the educational process and encourage their support of the school's disciplinary processes and procedures. Be polite and calm when dealing with parents. Keep reminding them that every discussion about the child needs to be undertaken with the child's best interests at heart.

, Remember that as a professional teacher you are offering a service to the students and the school community. You are duty-bound to take your ""in loco parentis"" role seriously. Explain why certain rules are in place and follow all institutional risk management procedures.

, Walk the talk. Put the needs of the institution above your own. Remember you are one person in a group of professionals who share a common goal and vision.

, Constantly provide benchmarks for improvement for your students. Give praise when it is due, lots of it. Draw gently alongside those who are in need of help and find creative ways to assist them to improve their grades.

, As a professional teacher, the grades your students achieve are a reflection on you. Bear this in mind, in all you do.

, Always support your school if negative people are bad-mouthing the institution. Swearing and being drunk in public will cause community members to lose respect not only for you, but for the profession at large.

,, Take short courses to keep yourself mentally stimulated. Your renewed enthusiasm for your subject will be rewarded by increased student interest and enthusiasm for the subject itself.

, Use examples, models and coloured pictures and Photographs. Teach in illustrations that your students can relate to.

, Teach your students why the knowledge you convey is important and how they can apply what they learn in their daily lives. Then they are more likely to remember what you teach.

Obtain a bachelor's degree.,
Review your international degree.,
Take an alternative certification program offered by your Florida school district.,
Pass a Florida Teacher Certification Examinations Subject Area Examination.",How to Become an Elementary School Teacher in Florida1," Enroll in an education program to receive a degree from an accredited college or university. Consider majoring in education and specializing in the age group you want to teach. Otherwise, look at a major related to the subject you wish to teach.Spend at least 30 semester hours learning necessary educational content for Florida grade school teachers. Examples include learning the methods and content for teaching writing, science and math to elementary school students.Meet regularly with an academic or career adviser to help you pick courses appropriate to your career goal and make sure you are on track to graduate.;
, If you are pursuing an international degree, make sure your non-U.S. degree is the equivalent of a bachelor's degree from a U.S. university. Know that international degrees will be tailored to the educational systems for the country of origin, so there may be a learning curve upon arriving in Florida.Get a report from a credential evaluation agency approved by Florida's Bureau of Educator Certification or an accredited 4-year U.S. college or university to determine if your international degree is eligible.
Have your current transcripts ready for review, as well as an educational plan including any future courses you plan to take and any research you intend to do in childhood education while still in school.
Once you obtain your international degree, have a copy of your non-U.S. college or university's diploma verified to be true by a notary public or a certification officer in one of Florida's school district offices. Each page of your diploma should say, ""I HEREBY CERTIFY THAT THIS IS A TRUE AND CORRECT COPY OF THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENT"" and be signed and sealed by a notary or signed by the certification officer., The programs are suitable for new teachers, recent college graduates or those changing careers who need professional teaching preparation and experience.Alternative certification programs must be initially and continually approved by the state. These programs use student performance in the course and during the first year of teaching as factors in their approval processes.
All community colleges and four state universities in Florida have Educator Preparation Institutes (EPI) that give these programs.

, Start by taking the subject area examination for elementary education. If you want to teach a specific subject to grade school students, such as art or a foreign language, you may also take a different Subject Area Examination for that subject.The minimum passing score for a FTCE exam is 200.
Passing the exam qualifies you for a Temporary Certificate for that subject. This certificate allows you teach full time for up to three years while working to pass the exam."

Round the original price to the nearest ten.,
Calculate 10 percent of the rounded price.,
Determine the number of tens in the percent off.,
Multiply 10% of the rounded price by the appropriate factor.,
Calculate 5% of the rounded price, if necessary.,
Add the remaining 5% to the discount, if necessary.,
Subtract the discount from the rounded price.",How to Calculate a Discount2," Use normal  rounding rules to round up or down. Doing this will make it easier to calculate the percent discount of the number.For example, if the original price of a shirt is $47.89, round the price up to $50.00


, To mentally calculate 10% of a price, think of the price written as dollars and cents with a decimal point. Then, move the decimal point one place to the left. This will show you the number that is equal to 10%.For example, to calculate 10% of $50, think $50=$50.00=$5.00{\displaystyle \$50=\$50.00=\$5.00}. So, 5 is 10% of 50.


, To figure out the number of tens, divide by the percentage by 10 using normal division rules. Don’t worry about fives in the percentage for now.

For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you would need to know how many tens are in 35. Since 35÷10=3.5{\displaystyle 35\div 10=3.5}, there are 3 tens in 35.


, The factor is determined by the number of tens in the percent off. Since you determined what 10% of the price is, find a larger percent by multiplying by the number of tens.

For example, if you found that 10% of $50 is 5, to find out how much 30% of 50 is, you would multiply $5 by 3, since there are 3 tens in 30: 5×3=15{\displaystyle 5\times 3=15}. So, 30% of $50 is $15.


, You will need to do this step if the percent off discount ends in a 5 rather than a 0 (for example, 35% or 55% off). It is easy to calculate 5% by simply dividing 10% of the original price by 2, since 5% is half of 10%.

For example, if 10% of $50 is $5, then 5% of $50 is $2.50, since $2.50 is half of $5.


, This will give you the total estimated discount of the item.

For example, if a shirt is 35% off, you first found 30% of the original price was $15. Then you found that 5% of the original price was $2.50. So adding the values of 30% and 5%, you get $15+$2.50=$17.50{\displaystyle \$15+\$2.50=\$17.50}. So, the estimated discount of the shirt is $17.50.


, This will give you an estimate of the sale price of the item.

For example, if the rounded price of a shirt is $50, and you found the 35% discount to be $17.50, you would calculate $50−$17.50=$32.50{\displaystyle \$50-\$17.50=\$32.50}. So, a $47.89 shirt that is 35% off is about $32.50 on sale.

Calculate the exact sale price.,
Find the exact sale price of a camera that is 15% off.,
Estimate the sale price.",How to Calculate a Discount3," A television is originally priced at $154.88. It now has a 40% discount.

Convert the percentage discount to a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left: 40%=40.0%=.40{\displaystyle 40\%=40.0\%=.40}.

Multiply the original price by the decimal: 154.88×.40=61.95{\displaystyle 154.88\times .40=61.95}.

Subtract the discount from the original price: 154.88−61.95=92.93{\displaystyle 154.88-61.95=92.93}. So, the sale price of the television is $92.93.


, The original price is $449.95.

Convert the percentage discount to a decimal by moving the decimal two places to the left: 15%=15.0%=.15{\displaystyle 15\%=15.0\%=.15}.

Multiply the original price by the decimal: 449.95×.15=67.49{\displaystyle 449.95\times .15=67.49}.

Subtract the discount from the original price: 449.95−67.49=382.46{\displaystyle 449.95-67.49=382.46}. So, the sale price of the camera is $382.46.


, A tablet is regularly $199.99. On sale, it is 45% off.

Round the original price to the nearest ten. Since $199.99 is only 1 cent away from $200, you would round up.

Calculate 10% of the rounded price. Moving the decimal one place to the left, you should see that 10% of $200.00 is $20.00.

Determine the number of tens in the percent off. Since 10×4=40{\displaystyle 10\times 4=40}, you know that there are 4 tens in 45%.

Multiply 10% of the rounded price by the appropriate factor. Since the percentage off is 45%, you would multiply 10% of the rounded price by 4: $20×4=$80{\displaystyle \$20\times 4=\$80}

Calculate 5% of the rounded price. This is half of 10%, which is $20. So half of $20 is $10.

Add the remaining 5% to the discount. 40% is $80, and 5% is $10, so 45% is $90.

Subtract the discount from the rounded price: $200−$90=$110{\displaystyle \$200-\$90=\$110}. So the estimated sale price is $110.

Do your best and ask for help when needed.,
Don’t panic if you don’t know an answer.,
Set a good example.,
Be a guide for certain, and a friend if possible.",How to Be a Good Mentor1," The main focus of being a mentor is to provide guidance as best you can, and to stay positive for both of you. If there's something you're both finding difficult, don't be afraid to ask someone else for help — such as a teacher if you're in school, an expert in the subject, someone more senior than you at your workplace, etc.Good mentors don’t need to know everything; in fact, they need to know that they don’t know everything. Experience, expertise, and a record of success are all valuable attributes in a mentor. But so is having the confidence to admit your imperfections and willingness to seek out answers and guidance along with your mentee. Show them that this is what successful people do.;
, Mentors are not computers or encyclopedias that have all the answers on a certain subject. Remember, this is a good thing, not a sign of your inadequacy. Turn your uncertainty regarding an answer into a learning (and mentoring) opportunity.Instead of making up a response or ignoring a question you’re not sure about, turn it back over to your mentee. Ask them something like ""So how would you do it?"". Listen to their response and find a way to build on it, with further questions, clarifications, or guidance.

, If your mentee doesn’t have legitimate reasons to look up to you, respect you, and accept that you “practice what you preach,” why should they want you as a mentor to begin with? Set the right example both in how you approach the mentoring relationship and how you “live” the guidance you give.Be punctual, prepared, and engaged for mentoring sessions. If it seems like a chore or a punishment for either of you, the relationship isn’t working.
Mentoring isn’t a “do as I say, not as I do” kind of deal; it can, however, be a “do as I do, not as I’ve done” situation, in which you draw upon your past mistakes and failures for useful guidance.

, Being a good mentor means being able to be objective and fair with your coaching and criticism. If this means you can’t be “buddy-buddy” with your mentee, so be it. Good mentors share a few similarities with good parents — one of them being that they don’t obsess over whether or not they’re “friends” with their charges.This doesn’t mean that you can’t be a good mentor to a friend, though. You just have to make sure that your friendship doesn’t prevent you from giving the honest feedback that is necessary in a good mentoring relationship.
Also, “don’t (necessarily) be a friend” isn’t the same thing as “don’t be friendly.” Be kind, approachable, and encouraging to your mentee; be an attentive and compassionate listener. Use discretion in regards to what is shared with you during sessions.

If the student does not already play an instrument, teaching the basics of an instrument and how to play it will encourage the learner to apply what has been learned.,
Select an instrument that isn't too complicated and that is generally acceptable and useful.",How to Teach Music Theory Fundamentals2," In this way, the student can understand music theory more fully. Doing so without an instrument can prove boring, unfruitful, and sometimes even pointless. The practical side often brings to life the reasons you've already highlighted above.

, The piano or the guitar can be the best choices for this, since they are versatile instruments and offer a broad range of sounds. Additionally, the layout of the keyboard (on the piano) and the fretboard (on the guitar) facilitate visualizing chords and scales while the student practices.

Buy a book with a friendly music theory syllabus.,
Decide how much content you'll teach in each lesson.",How to Teach Music Theory Fundamentals3," Make sure it exemplifies through the same instrument you'll be teaching by. Having this kind of guide will help you a lot in keeping things organized in your lessons and in your own head.

, You can also try splitting the lesson into two parts, the first for theory and the second for applying the theory on the instrument. Doing it in this manner will give your student a stronger and deeper understanding of the fundamentals, which will help a lot with the overall music studies.

If you're teaching your student an instrument and would like him or her to know only a little theory in order to enhance the performance, then you only need to teach your pupil the fundamentals.,
Start with the basics of rhythm and tempo.",How to Teach Music Theory Fundamentals4," In that case, make sure you pick the most relevant topics.

, Then move on to time values, pitch, scales, time signature and so on. You don't need to explain complicated things like cadences or modes at this stage. Keep it as light and simple as possible. The deeper learning will come later when the student is more personally motivated and self-directed in the learning.

Exude optimism.,
Stay in control at all times.,
Serve your mentee a steady diet of the ""feedback sandwich”.,
Lay on the praise.",How to Be a Good Mentor2," Being a mentor is a tough job, and so too is being mentored. It is common for mentees to be short on self-confidence to begin with, or to have their confidence shaken in the face of setbacks or criticism. As a mentor, be honest and realistic with your guidance and feedback, but do so with an air of optimism. Help your mentee believe that self-improvement is never out of reach.Even when difficulties arise, never act like your mentee is failing or will never comprehend your guidance. If they don't do so well at a task or exam or project related to your mentoring, keep smiling and offer to help them with what they got wrong. If they do do well, feel proud of what they have accomplished with your help and congratulate them.

, You might assume that only the mentee is apt to get upset or frustrated by poor results. However, you invest a lot into the relationship as a good mentor, and your own frustrations about not “getting through” to or adequately helping your mentee might cause you to project these emotions outwardly. Basically, you might be mad at yourself, but be tempted to direct this anger toward your mentee.


Never, ever, curse at the learner, or say (or even intimate) that they are worthless or dim-witted. Not only will you crush their confidence, you will likely face sanctions if your mentorship has some sort of affiliation. Never let your frustrations get the best of you in front of your mentee. Take a break or make an excuse to cancel or cut a session short if necessary.
Even if the problems are primarily the mentee’s doing, steer clear of accusatory “you” statements; stick with “I” and “we” statements that focus on things you can work on together. For instance, don’t say “If you would just pay attention to what I’m saying here….”; try “I think we need to find better ways to communicate with each other.”, Start by complimenting them, identifying some of their strongest points. Then nicely lay out some areas they need to work on. Be direct, but not unkind. Finish it off with some further encouragement, projecting a positive outcome of future efforts.For instance: “The ideas you presented during yesterday’s conference call were fantastic. We should continue to work on your poise and delivery, though, so that the full impact of what you’re advocating for is felt by all. Just keep working hard and coming up with those great solutions, and before long you’ll be the one running the conference calls!”

, Make sure they know that you believe in them, and that you are aware of their efforts and improvements. Don’t withhold deserved praise, thinking that this withholding will help “toughen up” your mentee or stoke their motivation. When they’ve earned it, even for minor successes, give it to them.


On the other side of the coin, don’t manufacture false praise just for the sake of saying something nice. You risk losing your credibility if your false praise is transparent. If your mentee has given you little reason to offer praise, focus your energies on constructive criticism and responding to their questions."

Choose a time and place that’s good for both of you.,
Be patient and polite, and expect the same.,
Encourage yourself as well.,
Be a mentor even at a distance.",How to Be a Good Mentor3," Some mentoring relationships may operate on a consistent weekly schedule, while others are less rigidly structured. In any case, try not to force mentoring sessions into times or places full of distractions, or when one or both of you are exhausted or preoccupied.


Pick a good place to mentor them in. You want to keep their attention on you, without them getting bored or their attention wandering. For school students, a library would be the traditional choice, and a good one too - it will be quieter than other places, there may be room to spread out books or papers, and if you need a book you're in the right place!
Make sure you are always prepared for a mentoring session. Don’t try to squeeze in some mentoring when you’re distracted by a dozen other things, and reschedule a weekly session if necessary when you’ve been unable to properly prepare. A delayed but fully engaged session is far more beneficial than a half-hearted but on-schedule one., Even if you combined the world’s most effective mentor with the world’s most eager mentee, you wouldn’t see some sort of immediate transformation. Mentoring is about incrementally laying the groundwork for lasting change and self-improvement. It’s not a race or a competition; it’s a process, and it requires patience from both sides.Rome wasn’t built in day, and your mentee won’t be transformed after one session either. Whether they are fast or slow learners, remain calm. If they're not getting something, try to explain it in different ways until they do - or just come back to it later.
Establish ground rules early on regarding mutual respect and accountability. Create an atmosphere in which some degree of personal sharing can occur and so-called “stupid questions” can be asked, but define the roles of mentor and mentee and the proper nature of interactions between the two.

, The mentee isn’t the only one who might question their abilities or results. There will be times when you’ll feel like you’re not doing a good enough job, or simply feel down because the results your mentee is working so hard for don’t seem to be paying off. Remind yourself that you are doing your best, and you are making a positive difference in this other person’s life.


You don’t have to brag about your own success and experience in your field, or assume that such things mean that you are automatically a great mentor. However, you should draw on these realities as confidence-boosters in your ability to achieve your goals, including mentoring.When your mentee is struggling, keep smiling and offer to help them. When they do succeed, feel proud of what they have accomplished with your help and congratulate them. Give yourself a pat on the back as well. Their success is something for both of you to be proud of.

, There will be times when you can’t meet with your mentee face-to-face, and some mentoring relationships may in fact be conducted entirely from a distance. Even if you do lose out on some of the interpersonal connection in such instances, you can develop and effective mentoring partnership regardless. Stay focused on the core concepts of support, guidance, constructive feedback, and accessibility.In an online or similar distance-based mentorship, be available to your mentee but set boundaries as well. You don’t have to respond at 2 am if that is not the nature of your mentoring relationship.
Use online resources to your advantage in distance mentoring. Locate helpful links, pages, forums, videos, documents, games, and so on. But don’t expect these to replace the core mentor-mentee connection that needs to be forged and maintained.

Say ""comida"" as a general term for ""food"" or ""meal"".,
Say ""alimento"" for ""food"" or ""nourishment."",
Use ""sustento"" for ""sustenance."",
Use ""comestibles"" for ""edibles."",
Learn the names of the daily meals.,
Learn the various terms for ""snack.""",How to Say Food in Spanish1," This is probably the most important food-related word you'll want to know. It's used in virtually all Spanish-speaking countries as an all-purpose word for ""food."" It can also be used the same way as ""meal"" is used in English: ""la comida"" can be both the general idea of food and the specific food you eat when you sit down at your plate.


""Comida"" is pronounced ""koh-MEE-thah."" When d is used before a vowel at the end of a word in Spanish, it gets a soft sound that's very similar to the ""th"" sound in English (as in ""th"").Be sure to put stress on the ""ee"" part of the word. It's ""koh-MEE-thah,"" not ""koh-mee-THAH"" or ""KOH-mee-thah."" In the rest of this article, the syllable written in capitals gets the stress.;
, This is another common word used to refer to food. Unlike ""comida,"" it isn't usually used for ""meal,"" but you can use it metaphorically to discuss fuel, feed, and so on (e.g., ""alimento para el fuego"" means ""fuel for the fire"").


Pronounce ""alimento"" ""all-ee-MEN-toe."" The first syllable sounds like the word ""all"" (not the name ""Al"").

, This word is a somewhat old-fashioned way to describe food. Here, the focus is on the fact that the food is sustaining the person eating it — it's implied that it's his or her source of survival in a way that isn't usually done for ""normal"" food. For example, a prisoner's meager rations might be ""su sustento"" (""his sustenance""). You can also use this word to refer to a person's means of living (i.e., a job).


Pronounce this word ""soos-TEHN-toe."" Note that the first syllable uses a ""oo"" sound (as in ""root"") rather than an ""oh"" sound (as in ""toe"").

, This isn't a word that's usually used when people are talking about the food in their day-to-day meals. Instead, it's mainly used for referring to food as a product or commodity. For example, ""la tienda de comestibles"" is ""the edibles store,"" or what we would call a grocery store.Pronounce this word ""koh-meh-STEE-blays."" The word ends with a hard s sound (as in ""glass"") rather than a soft s (like an English z). This is true in general for the Spanish s., If you want to talk specifically about the food you would typically eat at a given time of the day, you can use the name of the meal. These are:


Breakfast: el desayuno (""deh-sah-JOO-no"" or ""deh-sah-YOO-no"")
Lunch: el almuerzo (""all-MWEHR-so"")
Dinner: la cena (""SAY-nah"")

, Like English, Spanish has many different ways to refer to the small meals you eat between the ""main"" ones — in other words, snacks. A few of the most common ones are listed below. There are many others that vary from region to region.


el tentempié (""ten-temp-ee-AY"")
el bocadillo (""boh-cah-DEE-joe"" or ""boh-cah-DEE-yo"")
el piscolabis (""pees-coh-LAW-bees"")

"
"
Try ""cebo."",
Say ""pasto"" for ""feed"" or ""chow."",
Use ""pitanza"" for ""daily rations"" or ""grub."",
Use ""pan"" as a metaphor for food in general.",How to Say Food in Spanish2," This literally means ""bait"" or ""lure"" (like you would use for fishing). It's often used as a slang term for food the same way you might use ""chow"" or ""chum"" in English.


""Cebo"" is pronounced ""SAY-bo."" Like in English, the""c"" is pronounced like an ""s"" if it's before an e.

, This noun is often used for ""food"" and ""nourishment"", but it also means ""pasture"", ""grass"", ""feed"", and ""grazing"". Though its dictionary definition contains mostly agricultural meanings, it's often used for people as well. Like with ""cebo,"" the usage is similar to ""chow.""


This word is pronounced ""PAH-stow."" It's almost exactly like the English word ""pasta,"" only with an ""oh"" sound at the end (as in ""toe"").

, This word sounds a little like the English word ""pittance,"" but its meaning is actually much closer to ""daily rations."" You can use this definition or use the word as a sling term for ""food"" in general.The proper pronunciation is ""pee-TAN-sah.""

, The literal meaning of ""pan"" is ""bread."" However, the word is sometimes used to convey the idea of food or sustenance in general. This is done in English, too (e.g., ""our daily bread"").


""Pan"" is easy to pronounce — it's just ""PAHN"" (rhymes with ""John""). Spanish speakers use a somewhat short, ""punchy"" pronunciation for this word. The ""ah"" sound isn't drawn out like in the English word ""pawn"" — it's quick and staccato.
An expression you may want to know is ""Pan de cada día"" (""PAHN dey kah-da DEE-uh""). This is literally ""bread of every day,"" or, in English, ""daily bread.""

, Depending on the classroom policy, the teacher may ask you to bring a snack for the class to enjoy. You can bring this snack yourself or delegate the responsibility to another parent. The snack should be a healthy treat that is safe for all of the children to eat. Be sure to discuss snack ideas with the other parents and the teacher.Some schools do not allow outside food.

Learn the infinitive form.,
Say limpiar in the present tense.,
Use limpiar in the past tense.,
Understand how to say limpiar in the future tense.,
Use the transitive verb form.",How to Say Clean in Spanish1," The verb in Spanish that means ""to clean"" is limpiar. It is a regular verb, conjugated the same as all other -ar verbs in Spanish. Use the infinitive if you have two verbs, or a verb phrase.For example, if you wanted to say ""we have to clean the house"" in Spanish, you would say ""tenemos que limpiar la casa.""
To conjugate regular -ar verbs, simply remove the -ar ending from the verb stem and replace it with a different ending appropriate to the subject of your sentence and verb tense you want to use. For example, to create the first-person present-tense form of the verb limpiar, you would remove the -ar to create the verb stem limpi-, then add an -o to arrive at limpio – ""I clean."";
, Present tense may be the one you use the most in Spanish. Unlike English, in Spanish the same verb form is also used for progressive actions. ""Clean"" in the present tense also means ""am/is/are cleaning.""If you want to say ""I am cleaning my house,"" you would say ""yo limpio mi casa"" (or simply ""limpio mi casa"" – the pronoun isn't necessary.)
To say ""you are cleaning my house,"" you would say ""limpias mi casa"" (familiar) or ""limpia mi casa"" (formal). The ""formal you"" form is also used to say ""he or she is cleaning my house.""
To say ""we are cleaning my house,"" you would say ""limpiamos mi casa."" To say ""they are cleaning my house"" or ""you all are cleaning my house,"" you would say ""limpian mi casa.""

, In Spanish, the past (or ""preterite"") tense of limpiar is used to mean you cleaned something, just as in English. The past tense should not be used to refer to actions that are ongoing, but rather things that took place completely in the past.To say ""I cleaned my house,"" you would say ""limpié mi casa."" To say ""you cleaned my house,"" you would say ""limpiaste mi casa"" (familiar) or ""limpió mi casa"" (formal). The formal you form is also used to say ""he or she cleaned my house.""
To say ""we cleaned my house,"" you would say ""limpiamos mi casa."" To say ""they cleaned my house"" or ""you all cleaned my house,"" you would say ""limpiaron mi casa.""

, In Spanish, the future tense of the verb ""limpiar"" simply means ""will clean."" However, there is no helper verb in Spanish as there is in English.To say ""I will clean my house,"" you would say ""limpiaré mi casa."" To say ""you will clean my house, you would say ""limpiarás mi casa"" (familiar) or ""limpiará mi casa"" (formal). The same form used for the formal ""you"" pronoun is also used to say ""he or she will clean my house.""
To say ""we will clean my house,"" you would say ""limpiaremos mi casa."" To say ""they will clean my house"" or ""you all will clean my house,"" you would say ""limpiarán mi casa.""

, If you want to speak in Spanish about cleaning up or tidying up a place, you use the transitive verb form, which is the same as the infinitive limpiar. This word is used to talk about cleaning up something messy, or to clean up a neighborhood or area by getting rid of corruption.In English, you also might say someone ""cleaned up"" to mean that they won something, or made a huge profit.

Understand the infinitive form of lavar.,
Use lavar in the present tense.,
Say lavar in the past tense.,
Understand how to conjugate lavar in the future tense.,
Learn the reflexive verb lavarse.",How to Say Clean in Spanish2," The verb lavar can be more directly translated to the English verb ""to wash,"" but it is frequently used in many contexts where the verb ""to clean"" would be interchangeable in English.Lavar is a regular -ar verb, conjugated by removing the -ar ending from the verb stem and replacing it with the appropriate ending depending on the subject of the sentence and the verb tense you want to use.

, The literal English translation of the Spanish verb lavar in present tense is used to mean both ""wash"" and ""am/is/are washing."" There is no helper verb to distinguish progressive action, but your reader or listener will understand your meaning from the context of your sentence.To say ""I wash the car,"" you would say ""lavo el auto."" (In Spain, use the word ""coche"" for ""car."") To say ""you wash the car,"" you would say ""lavas el auto"" (familiar) or ""lava el auto"" (formal). You also would say ""lava el auto"" to say ""he or she washed the car.""
To say ""we wash the car,"" you would say ""lavamos el auto."" To say ""they wash the car"" or ""you all wash the car,"" you would say ""lavan el auto.""

, Using the past tense of lavar means you washed something. For the past tense to be correct, the action must have started and ended completely at some point in the past.To say ""I washed the car,"" you would say ""lavé el auto."" To say ""you wash the car,"" you would say ""lavaste el auto"" (familiar) or ""lavó el auto"" (formal). ""Lavó el auto"" is also used to say ""he or she washed the car."" Your reader or listener will understand which you mean by the context and the rest of your sentence.
To say ""we washed the car,"" you would say ""lavamos el auto."" To say ""they washed the car"" or ""you all washed the car,"" you would say ""lavaron el auto.""

, Similarly to English, the future tense conjugation of the verb lavar in Spanish means ""will wash."" Unlike English, the Spanish language doesn't use a helper verb with the future tense.To say ""I will wash the car,"" you would say ""lavaré el auto."" To say ""you will wash the car"" you would say ""lavarás el auto"" (familiar) or ""lavará el auto"" (formal). ""Lavará el auto"" also is used to say ""he or she will wash the car.""
To say ""we will wash the car,"" you would say ""lavaremos el auto."" To say ""they will wash the car"" or ""you all will wash the car,"" you would say ""lavarán el auto.""

, If you want to say that you are washing yourself, the verb is conjugated somewhat differently than if you are washing some other object. You also must include a pronoun to match the subject.The reflexive pronouns in Spanish are me (myself), te (yourself), se (himself, herself, yourself), nos (ourselves), os (yourselves), and se (themselves, yourselves).
To say ""I wash myself,"" you would say ""yo me lavo."" To say ""you wash yourself,"" you would say ""tú te lavas"" (familiar) or ""usted se lava"" (formal). To say ""he/she washes him/herself,"" you would also say ""él/ella se lava.""
To say ""we wash ourselves,"" you would say ""nosotros/as nos lavamos."" To say ""they wash themselves"" or ""you all wash themselves,"" you would say ""ellos/as se lavan.""

Use limpio if you mean that something is not dirty.,
Say puro if you mean that something is pure.,
Understand that limpio is also the adverb form of the word.",How to Say Clean in Spanish3," The basic adjective for ""clean"" in Spanish is limpio. If the noun the adjective describes is feminine, you would use limpia. If the adjective describes a plural noun, add an s.For example, if you've just washed the dishes, you might say ""los platos estan limpios,"" which means ""the dishes are clean.""

Limpio also is used in Spanish if you're describing someone who was a formerly addicted to drugs or alcohol but went to rehab and is now ""clean,"" meaning they no longer do drugs or drink alcohol. For example, you might say ""Tras un mes desintoxicándose, estaba limpio,"" or ""After a month in rehab, he was clean.""

, Sometimes in English you might use the word ""clean"" to mean pure, such as when you're talking about air or water. In Spanish, the word ""limpio"" is also used in this sense, but more often the word ""puro"" is used.Change the word to ""pura"" if you're using the word to describe a feminine noun, and add an s if the noun is plural.
For example, if you wanted to say ""the water is clean,"" you might say ""es agua pura."" You also might say ""el agua está limpia.""

, Similarly to English, ""clean"" is sometimes used in Spanish to describe how someone acted or how someone behaves. This is like saying ""fairly"" in English.For example, you might say ""este equipo siempre juega limpio,"" which means ""this team always plays clean,"" to talk about a team that always plays fairly or never cheats.

Saying something is beautiful.,
Telling a woman she is beautiful.,
Telling a man he is beautiful.",How to Say Beautiful in Spanish," Just as in English, you can use the word ""beautiful"" to describe many things in Spanish, such as the weather, an item of clothing, or a beautiful view. There is no set rule for when to use which synonym for beautiful. It depends on the noun you're defining.

""El jardín es hermoso."" (""The garden is beautiful."")

Know the five vowels.,
Say the letter ""a."",
Pronounce the letter ""e."" The letter ""e"" in Spanish sounds like the ""e"" in ""weigh"" or the ""a"" in the word ""late."",
Practice saying the letter ""i."",
Say the letter ""o."",
Be careful with the letter ""u."",
Do not drag out the sound.,
Practice diphthongs.,
Know the similarities with the English language.,
Make your ""h"" silent.,
Pay attention to the letter ""c"".,
Pronounce ""j"" as an ""h"".,
Role your ""r""s. The letter ""r"" is always rolled when you speak Spanish.This may be difficult for some native English speakers because this sound does not exist in the English language.,
Look out for double consonants.,
""R"" and ""rr"" make different sounds.,
Pronounce ""x"" like a ""j"" or an ""sh"".,
Be careful with the letter ""g"".,
Adjust how you say ""z"".,
Recognize the difference between ""n"" and ""ñ"".",How to Pronounce Spanish Words," The Spanish language uses the same vowels that are used in the English language, ""a,"" ""e,"" ""i,"" ""o,"" and ""u."" There are five vowel sounds that you should become familiar with. Unlike the English language, each of these vowels always makes the same sound in every single word. Also remember that vowels are never silent when you are pronouncing Spanish words., The letter ""a"" in Spanish is sounds like the ""a"" in the word ""father."" If a Spanish word has more than one ""a,"" all of the ""a""s will make the same sound (e.g. mañana). ""Mañana"" sounds like ""mah-nya-nah""The long ""a"" found in words such as ""blame"" or ""name"" is never used when you speak Spanish., For example, ""pero"" should sound like you are saying ""pay-ro."" The long ""e"" sound in words like ""need"" or ""speed"" are not used when you are speaking Spanish., The letter ""i"" in Spanish sounds like the ""i"" in the word ""machine.""The Spanish ""i"" also sounds like the long ""e"" in the word ""be."" Never pronounce ""i"" with the sound used in the word ""hide,"" ""if,"" or ""hit.""For example, ""hijo"" sounds like ""ee-ha.""

, The letter ""o"" in Spanish is always pronounced as a long ""o"" in the English language. Spanish ""o""s sound like the ""o"" in the word ""no.""Avoid pronouncing the ""o"" that is used in the word ""opportunity"" and ""other."" For example, ""como"" sounds like ""koh-moh.""

, The letter ""u"" in Spanish is pronounced like the ""u"" in the word ""lunar."" This letter only makes one sound in the Spanish language. In English, words that begin with the letter ""u"" (e.g. useful, utilize) make a ""y"" sound. However, do not use this pronunciation of the letter ""u"" when you pronounce Spanish words.""Cúrcuma"" sounds like ""koor-koo-mah.""


The letter ""u"" never makes the sound found in the word ""flutter"" or ""ultimate"" either., Native English speakers have a tendency to drag out vowel sounds. Spanish vowels should be pronounced using short sounds. For example, in English you may pronounce the word ""hey,"" as ""heeeeey."" Instead, keep the pronunciation short as if you are saying ""late.""Elongating the sound of your vowels when you speak Spanish will alert others that you are not a native Spanish speaker and can make it more difficult for other people to understand what you are saying.

, A diphthong is two vowels next to each other. When you see this, pronounce the sound of the first vowel and then pronounce the sound of the second vowel. Practice until you can say the two sounds as one syllable. You will have to make the sounds quickly and not drag out the sounds of each individual vowel.For example, ""feo"" sounds like ""feh-oh,""cuando"" sounds like ""kooahn-doh"", and ""suizo"" sounds like ""sooee-soh."", Some consonants are pronounced the same in English and Spanish including the letters: ""d,"" ""f,"" ""k,"" ""l,"" ""m,"" ""n,"" ""p,"" and ""t."" The letter ""b"" is also pronounced the same in both English and Spanish. Note that the letter ""b"" and ""v"" are pronounced the same when you speak Spanish. For example, the word ""vaca"" sounds like ""baca."", There is no sound for the letter ""h"" in the Spanish language. When you see an ""h,"" pronounce the word as if it is not there at all.For example, ignore the ""h"" in words such as ""hola"" and ""hombre."" The only exception to the silent ""h"" is if you see ""ch"" together. Say ""ch"" as you normally would in English (e.g. cheers, child).The ""ch"" sound is the ""ch"" from the Scottish language.


""Hola"" sounds like ""oh-la.""

, In most instances, the letter ""c"" is pronounced as a ""k"" in the English language (e.g. case, careful, carpet). Words such as ""casa,"" ""cosa,"" and ""cuota"" follow this rule. If the ""c"" is before the letter ""e"" or ""i"" (e.g. cielo, acento), pronounce is as an ""s"" like in the word ""sin.""You also use the ""k"" sound when you see the letters ""qu."" For example, you would pronounce ""quiero"" as if it is spelled ""kiero."", The sound of the English ""j"" in words like ""judge"" and ""jump"" is never used when you speak Spanish.Most native English speakers are able to pronounce a ""j"" as a strong ""h"". For example, ""jugar"" would sound like ""hoo-gar.""However,this is not the exact sound that a native Spanish speaker would make. The Spanish ""j"" makes the same sound as the ""ch"" in the Scottish word ""loch,"" but we do not have this sound in the English language so it is more difficult.The ""ch"" sound is similar to an ""x""or ""ks"" sound used in the word ""box.""


The ""j"" sound is difficult and will take practice to pronounce correctly., To practice rolling your ""r,"" say ""brr"" but use your tongue instead of your lips to make the sound. Your tongue should touch your upper teeth/roof of your mouth to help make the sound.

, The double consonant ""ll"" has a unique sound. Treat ""ll"" as the letter ""y"" as in the English word ""yes"" or ""you.""For example, the word ""llama"" should be pronounced as if it is spelled ""yama."" The Spanish ""pollo"" sounds like ""poy-yoh.""You are probably used to pronouncing ""ll"" correctly when you say the word ""tortilla."" Just keep this in mind when you see any other Spanish words with an ""ll.""

, Flap your tongue against the roof of your mouth to mahe the ""rr"" sound. The ""rr"" sound is called a trilled sound.


You may sometimes see a ""cc."" You will only see this in front of an ""i"" or an ""e."" Pronounce the ""cc"" as a ""ks."" The word "" acción"" would be pronounced as "" aks-ión."", This pronunciation usually applies to Mexican names such as ""Mexico,"" ""Oaxaca,"" ""Texas,"" and ""Xochimilco."" You may see the words ""Mexico"" and ""Texas"" written as ""Mejico"" or ""Tejas."" In the word ""Xochimilcho,"" the letter ""x"" is pronounced like as ""s."" If you see an ""x"" in a word that is not some sort of name (e.g. exito, taxi, explicar), pronounce the ""x"" as you normally would in English., The sound the letter ""g"" makes will depend on the letters around it. If the ""g"" is before an ""a,"" ""o,"" or ""u,"" pronounce it as a hard ""g"" sound like in the word ""golly."" Spanish words like ""gato"" and ""agonia"" follow this rule. If the ""g"" is before an ""e"" or an ""i,"" it sounds like the Spanish ""j."" Spanish words like ""gente,"" and ""gigante"" are pronounced using the Spanish ""j"" sound.The combination of ""gu"" makes a single sound and changes depending on the letters around it as well.


If ""gu"" is before an ""i"" or an ""e,"" it makes the hard ""g"" sound. Words like ""guerra"" and ""guisar"" are examples of this.
If ""gu"" is before an ""a"" or an ""o,"" it sounds like a ""gw."" Examples of this rule include words like ""guante,"" ""guapo,"" and ""ambiguo.""

, The pronunciation of the letter ""z"" will vary depending on the type of Spanish that you are speaking. In Spain, ""z"" is pronounced as a ""th"" like in the words ""they"" or ""there."" In other Spanish speaking countries, the letter ""z"" is pronounced exactly like the letter ""s."" The Spanish ""z"" never sounds like the English ""z"" in the word ""zone.""For example, ""zapato"" may be pronounced as ""sapato"" or ""thapato"" depending on the dialect.

, The Spanish ""ñ"" is pronounced as an ""ny."" It sounds the same as when you say the ""ny"" in the word ""canyon.""This distinction is important because it can change the meaning of a word. For example, ""ordeñar"" means to milk something. While ""ordenar"" means to organize."

Bear in mind, too, that idioms are an integral part of every language. How else would you spice up your spiel to prevent it from being plain, ordinary and mundane? How would you make jokes, use double entendres or make puns?

Learn Spanish pronunciation.,
Learn to pronounce letters of the alphabet in Spanish.,
Learn numbers next.,
Memorize simple words.,
Learn some basic conversational phrases.",How to Learn to Speak Spanish1," The Spanish alphabet is identical to English, but the pronunciation of each letter is significantly different. Some of the sounds are difficult for English speakers because they don't occur in that language. A good way to start learning Spanish is to learn how to pronounce each letter of the alphabet. From there, you can learn how to pronounce words. Phrases and then whole sentences, which come next, will be a lot easier. See below for the phonetic pronunciation of each letter in Spanish.:


A = ah, B = beh, C = seh, D = deh, E = eh, F = eh-feh, G = heh, H = ah-cheh, I = ee

J = hoh-tah, K = kah, L = eh-leh, M = eh-meh, N = eh-neh, Ñ = eh-nyeh, O = oh

P = peh, Q = koo, R = eh-reh, S = eh-seh, T = teh, U = oo, V = -beh

W = oo-bleh-doubleh, X = eh-kees, Y = ee gryeh-gah and Z = theh-tah.Note that the only letter in the Spanish alphabet that does not exist in English is the letter Ñ, pronounced eh-nyeh. It is a completely separate letter from the letter N. It's closest approximation in English would be the ""ny"" sound in the word ""canyon."";
, Once you learn the pronunciation rules of Spanish, you will be able to pronounce any word in that language.


ca, co, cu = kah, koh, koo. ce, ci = theh, thee or seh, see

ch sounds like English ch

ga, go, gu = gah, goh, goo. ge, gi = heh, hee

h does not sound. Hombre is pronounced ohmbreh

hua, hue, hui, huo = wah, weh, wee, woh

ll sounds like English y or like English j. Calle is kah-yeh or kah-jeh.
r at the beginning of a word and rr in the middle of a word are rolled. See How to Roll Your ""R""s

r in the middle of a word is like tt in butter in an American accent. Loro = lohttoh.
que, qui = keh, kee

v sounds like b
y sounds like English y or like English j. Yo is yoh or joh.
See How to Pronounce Spanish Letters and Certain Sounds.

, Knowing how to count is an essential skill in any language. Learning to count in Spanish isn't hard, as the names of numbers in Spanish are similar to English. Numbers one through ten are listed below:


One = Uno, Two = Dos, Three = Tres, Four = Cuatro, Five = Cinco, Six = Seis, Seven = Siete, Eight = Ocho, Nine = Nueve, Ten = Diez.Be aware that the number one -- ""uno"" -- changes when it's used in front of either a masculine or feminine noun. For example, the term ""one man"" is ""un hombre"", while the term ""one girl"" is ""una chica""., The wider the vocabulary you have at your disposal, the easier it is to speak a language fluently. Familiarize yourself with as many simple, everyday Spanish words as possible - you'll be surprised at how quickly they build up!


One of the easiest ways to do this is to use cognates - words that share a similar meaning, spelling and pronunciation in both languages. Learning Spanish cognates of English words is a great way to rapidly increase your vocabulary, as 30%-40% of English words have a Spanish cognate.For words without cognates, try using one of the following memorization methods: When you hear a word in English, think of how you would say it in Spanish. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you at all times for this purpose. Alternatively, try attaching little Spanish labels to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it!
It is important to learn a word or phrase from ‘Spanish to English’ as well as ‘English to Spanish.’ That way you will remember how to say it, not just recognize it when you hear it.

, By learning the basics of polite conversation, you'll very quickly be able to interact with Spanish speakers on a simple level. Jot down some everyday Spanish phrases in a notebook and make a point of learning between five and ten of them every day. Here's a few to get you started:


Hello! = ¡Hola!Yes = SíNo = NoThank you! = ¡Gracias! -- pronounced ""grah-thyahs"" or ""grah-syas""Please = Por favorWhat is your name? = ¿Cómo se llama usted?My name is... = Me llamo...Nice to meet you = Mucho gustoSee you later! = ¡Hasta luego! -- pronounced ""ahs-tah lweh-goh""Goodbye = ¡Adiós! -- pronounced ""ah-dyohs"""

Learn how to conjugate regular verbs.,
Learn how to conjugate common, irregular verbs.,
Learn Spanish gender rules.,
Learn how to use the definite and indefinite articles.",How to Learn to Speak Spanish2," Learning how to conjugate verbs is a major part of learning how to speak Spanish correctly. Conjugation means taking the infinitive form of a verb (to talk, to eat) and changing its form to indicate who is performing an action and when that action is being performed. When learning how to conjugate verbs in Spanish, the best place to start is with regular verbs in the present tense. Regular verbs in Spanish all end in either ""-ar"", ""-er"" or ""-ir"", and how each verb is conjugated will depend on its ending.An explanation of how each type of regular verb is conjugated in the present tense follow below:



Verbs ending in ""-ar"". Hablar is the infinitive form of the Spanish verb ""to speak."" To change the verb into the present tense, all you need to do is drop the ""-ar"" and add a different ending, which varies depending on the subject pronoun.For example:

""I speak"" becomes yo hablo

""You speak (informal)"" becomes tú hablas

""You speak (formal)"" becomes usted habla

""He/she speaks"" becomes él/ella habla

""We speak"" becomes nosotros/as hablamos

""You all speak (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as habláis

""You all speak (formal)"" becomes ustedes hablan

""They speak"" becomes ellos/ellas hablan

As you can see, the six different endings used are -o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis and -an. These endings will be the same for every single regular verb that ends in ""-ar"", such as bailar (to dance), buscar (to look for), comprar (to buy) and trabajar (to work).Verbs ending in ""-er"". Comer is the infinitive form of the Spanish verb ""to eat."" To change the verb into the present tense, drop the ""-er"" and add the endings -o, -es, -e, -emos, -éis or -en, depending on the subject pronoun.For example:

""I eat"" becomes yo como

""You eat (informal)"" becomes tú comes

""You eat (formal)"" becomes usted come

""He/she eats"" becomes él/ella come

""We eat"" becomes nosotros/as comemos

""You all eat (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as coméis

""You all eat (formal)"" becomes ustedes comen

""They eat"" becomes ellos/ellas comen

These six endings will be the same for every regular ""-er"" verb, such as aprender (to learn), beber (to drink), leer (to read) and vender (to sell).



Verbs ending in ""-ir"". Vivir is the infinitive form of the Spanish verb ""to live"". To change the verb into the present tense, drop the ""-ir"" and add the endings -o, -es, -e, -imos, -ís or -en, depending on the subject pronoun.For example:

""I live"" becomes yo vivo

""You live (informal)"" becomes tú vives

""You live (formal)"" becomes usted vive

""He/she live"" becomes él/ella vive

""We live"" becomes nosotros/as vivimos

""You all live (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as vivís

""You all live (formal)"" becomes ustedes viven

""They live"" becomes ellos/ellas viven

These six verb endings will be the same for every regular ""-ir"" verb, such as abrir (to open), escribir (to write), insistir (to insist) and recibir (to receive).


Once you have mastered the present tense, you can move on to conjugating verbs in other tenses, such as the future tense, the preterite and imperfect past tenses and the conditional tense. The same basic method used to conjugate the present tense is also used for each of these tenses - you simply take the stem of the infinitive verb and add a particular set of endings, which vary depending on the subject pronoun.

, Once you get the hang of conjugating regular verbs, you are off to a very good start. However be aware that not all verbs can be conjugated using the normal rules - there are many irregular verbs, each with their own unique conjugations which follow no rhyme or reason. Unfortunately, some of the most common, everyday verbs - such as ser (to be), estar (to be), ir (to go) and haber (to have (done)) - are irregular. The best thing to do is simply to learn them by heart:Ser. The verb ""ser"" is one of two verbs in Spanish which can be translated as ""to be"". ""Ser"" is used to describe the essential characteristics of something - for example, it is used for physical descriptions, for time and dates and for describing characters and personalities, amongst other things. It is used to describe what something is.The present tense of the verb is conjugated as follows:

""I am"" becomes yo soy

""You are (informal)"" becomes tú eres

""You are (formal)"" becomes usted es

""He/she is"" becomes él/ella es

""We are"" becomes nosotros/as somos

""You all are (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as sois

""You all are (formal)"" becomes ustedes son

""They are"" becomes ellos/ellas sonEstar. The verb ""estar"" also means ""to be"" but is used in a different context from ""ser"". ""Estar"" is used for states of being - for example, it is used to describe conditional states such as feelings, moods and emotions, as well as a person or thing's location, amongst other things. It is used to describe how something is.The present tense of the verb is conjugated as follows:

""I am"" becomes yo estoy

""You are (informal)"" becomes tú estás

""You are (formal)"" becomes usted está

""He/she is"" becomes él/ella está

""We are"" becomes nosotros/as estamos

""You all are (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as estáis

""You all are (formal)"" becomes ustedes están

""They are"" becomes ellos/ellas estánIr. The verb ""ir"" means ""to go"". It is conjugated in the present tense as follows:

""I go"" becomes yo voy

""You go (informal)"" becomes tú vas

""You go (formal)"" becomes usted va

""He/she goes"" becomes él/ella va

""We go"" becomes nosotros/as vamos

""You all go (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as vais

""You all go (formal)"" becomes ustedes van

""They go"" becomes ellos/ellas vanHaber. The verb ""haber"" can be translated as either ""I have"" or ""I have done"", depending on context. The present tense of the verb is conjugated as follows:

""I have (done)"" becomes yo he

""You have (done)(informal)"" becomes tú has

""You have (done) (formal)"" becomes usted ha

""He/she has (done)"" becomes él/ella ha

""We have (done)"" becomes nosotros/as hemos

""You all have (done) (informal)"" becomes vosotros/as habéis

""You all have (done) (formal)"" becomes ustedes han

""They have (done)"" becomes ellos/ellas han, In Spanish, like many other languages, every noun is assigned a gender, either masculine or feminine. There is no surefire way to tell whether a noun is masculine or feminine from sound or spelling, so it's necessary to learn the genders as you learn the words.


For people it is possible to make an educated guess as to whether a noun is masculine or feminine. For instance, the word for ""girl"" is feminine, la chica, while the word for ""boy"" is masculine, el chico. This is called natural gender.

Very few words for people have a grammatical gender. For example, el bebé (the baby) is masculine and la visita (the visitor) is feminine. This is also valid for female babies and male visitors.
In addition, nouns that end in the letter ""o"", like el libro (book), are usually masculine and words that end in the letter ""a"", like la revista (magazine) are usually feminine. However, there are many nouns that do not end in either ""a"" or ""o"", so this is not always helpful.Any adjectives used to describe nouns must also agree with the gender of the noun, so adjectives will change their form depending on whether a noun is masculine or feminine.

, In English, there is only one definite article ""the"", and three indefinite articles ""a"", ""an"" or ""some"". In Spanish, however, there are four of each. Which one a speaker uses depends on whether the noun they are referring to is masculine or feminine, plural or singular.


For example, to refer to ""the male cat"" in Spanish, you would need to use the definite article ""el"" - ""el gato"". When referring to ""the male cats"", the definite article changes to ""los"" - ""los gatos"".
The definite article changes again when referring to the feminine form of cat. ""The female cat"" uses the definite article ""la"" - ""la gata"", while ""the female cats"" uses the definite article ""las"" - ""las gatas"".
The four forms of indefinite article are used in the same way - ""un"" is is used for the masculine singular, ""unos"" is used for the masculine plural, ""una"" is used for the feminine singular and ""unas"" is used for the feminine plural.

Find a native speaker.,
Consider signing up for a language course.,
Watch Spanish films and cartoons.,
Listen to Spanish music and radio.,
Learn about the Spanish cultures.,
Consider taking a trip to a Spanish speaking country.,
Don't be discouraged!",How to Learn to Speak Spanish3," One of the best ways to improve your new language skills is to practice speaking with a native speaker. They will easily be able to correct any grammar or pronunciation mistakes you make and can introduce you to more informal or colloquial forms of speech that you won't find in a textbook.


If you have a Spanish-speaking friend who is willing to help, that's great! Otherwise, you can place an ad in the local paper or online or investigate whether there are any pre-existing Spanish conversation groups in the area.
If you can't locate any Spanish-speakers nearby, try finding someone on Skype. They might be willing to exchange 15 minutes of Spanish conversation for 15 minutes of English.

, If you need some extra motivation or feel you would learn better in a more formal setting, try signing up for a Spanish language course.


Look out for language courses advertised at local colleges, schools or community centers.
If you're nervous about signing up for a class by yourself, drag a friend along. You'll have more fun and also someone to practice with between classes!

, Get your hands on some Spanish DVDs (with subtitles) or watch Spanish cartoons online. This is an easy, entertaining way to get a feel for the sound and structure of the Spanish language.


If you're feeling particularly proactive, try pausing the video after a simple sentence and repeat what has just been said. This will lend your Spanish accent an air of authenticity!
If you can't find any Spanish films to buy, try renting them from a movie rental store, which often have foreign language sections. Alternatively, see if your local library has any Spanish films or ask if they would be able to source some for you.

, Listening to Spanish music and/or radio is another good way to surround yourself in the language. Even if you can't understand everything, try to pick out keywords to help you get the gist of what's being said.


Get a Spanish radio app on your phone, so you can listen on the go.
Try downloading Spanish podcasts to listen to while exercising or doing housework.
Alejandro Sanz, Shakira and Enrique Iglesias are some good Spanish singers.

, Languages exist in a dialogue with culture, so certain expressions and mentalities are inextricably tied to cultural origins. The study of culture may also help prevent social misunderstandings.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Spanish speech, consider taking a trip a Spanish speaking country. There's no better way to immerse yourself in a language than to hang-out and chat with the locals!


Be aware that every Spanish-speaking country has a different accent, different slang, and sometimes even different vocabulary. For example, Chilean Spanish is extremely different from Mexican Spanish, from the Spanish of Spain, and even Argentine Spanish.
In fact, as you advance in your Spanish proficiency, you may find it helpful to focus on one particular flavor of Spanish. It could be confusing if your lessons continually shift among word meanings and pronunciations for each country. However only about 2% of Spanish vocabulary is different in each country. You must concentrate in the remaining 98%.

, If you're serious about learning to speak Spanish, keep at it - the satisfaction you'll get from mastering a second language will far outweigh the difficulties you encounter along the way. Learning a new language takes time and practice, it won't happen overnight. If you still need some extra motivation, here are some things that make Spanish easier to learn than other languages:


Spanish uses the Subject-Object-Verb word order, just like English. This means that it's easier to translate directly from English to Spanish, without having to worry about rearranging the structure of the sentence.Spanish spelling is very phonetic, so it's usually quite easy to pronounce a word correctly, just by saying it like it's spelled. This is not the case in English, so Spanish learners of English have a much harder time pronouncing words correctly when reading!As mentioned before, about 30% to 40 % of words in Spanish have an English cognate. This is because of their shared Latin roots. As a result, you already have an extensive Spanish vocabulary before you even get started - all it needs is a few tweaks and a Spanish twang!

, Just as British, Americans, and Australians speak different variations of English, Mexicans speak different Spanish than Puerto Ricans.

If you don't know where to start, iTunes offers a Spanish single-of-the-week that you can download for free, or try a music-streaming website like Pandora; just enter one artist and the website will do the rest for you.

, They will know the correct way to pronounce words and will have a better grasp of the language than a non-native speaker.

, As you get a bit better at speaking, get together with a native Spanish speaker and offer to help him/her with English a bit in return. You'll both learn from trying to speak each other's languages. It's easy to find a pen-pal or Skype partner online, so if you really want to, you could get your Spanish lessons from Spain, Peru, or any other country that interests you. You'll almost certainly learn some interesting things about each other's cultures this way, too.

, You should use coarse language sparingly if at all, especially if you're not yet sure about speaking the language, but these parts of a language are both colorful and real.

While there are definitely some popular software, and more expensive software, brand and price are not always indicative of the program itself. Your best bet is to look at program websites and read about each, then look up reviews, and ultimately decide which program will best meet your learning needs and goals.


There are excellent free programs available, which you should not overlook.
Many programs now have free trial periods or even complementary apps that work in tandem with programs that you can download and try before you purchase the software.;
, Podcasts are a great and free way to learn Spanish with audio tools and are readily available on almost any modern phone, tablet, or computer. You’ll find, with a simple search, an overwhelming number of instructional podcasts designed to help you learn or improve your Spanish speaking, reading, and writing abilities., Your local library likely has excellent audio learning resources available for you to borrow. Because CDs, cassettes, and other language-learning materials are likely kept in different areas of the library, you would probably do best to ask your librarian for assistance in finding exactly what you need.


If your library branch doesn’t carry what you want, ask your librarian if the materials can be transferred from another library in the county to your branch.

, Bookstores are a great place to find a variety of Spanish-instruction materials, including audio lessons, software, and books. Bookstores offer several titles in one place, and also give you an opportunity to look at packages before you buy. Additionally, because you’re buying the materials, you can keep them as long as you want, rather than have to return them.


You have a lot of options when choosing a bookstore: national chain bookstores, locally-owned stores, new and used stores, and even online new and used booksellers.

, Deciding if you’ll be a casual learner or a serious language learner has nothing to do with aptitude or ability, or even how good of a student you are. Instead, it means figuring out how fluent you’d realistically like to be. If you’re interested in casually learning Spanish, say, as a tourist, then learning from tapes are a great choice. If you want a little more fluency, you might consider another method.If you’re planning on taking a trip to a Spanish-speaking country, and are primarily interested in conversational Spanish, instructional audio materials, such as Duolingo, might be a great choice for you.
Or if you’re interested in fluency, you might consider language-learning software, like Rosetta Stone, Fluenz, or Pimsular.And if you really want to learn the fundamental building blocks, Babbel might be good options for you.
You may not be in a position to spend a lot of (or any) money on a program, and will find excellent free programs available, such as Duolingo and BBC Languages.

, Make learning Spanish part of your everyday life and play your lessons as often as you can. Incorporate Spanish in every way that you can, which is especially easy because audio lessons are so portable. This means that you can take work with them when you’re on the go, such as on your daily commute to and from work, cleaning the house, on an airplane, or even while grocery shopping., When learning a language, regardless of instructional method, you will need to respond and repeat words or phrases when prompted to do so. Typically you will hear a voice say the word or phrase correctly, and then you will be given time to repeat what you’ve heard. Respond with confidence. Speak loudly, clearly, and give it your best shot. You will improve your pronunciation and retention when you respond this way.


Don’t feel awkward if you’re having difficulty sounding exactly like the voice on the program and might be inclined to mumble. Speak clearly, with confidence, and your pronunciation will improve with practice.

, As with anything, sometimes we start a project enthusiastically and then our enthusiasm can start to lessen a bit. Using tapes or CDs to learn Spanish is a great method, but you might not see immediate, tangible results. Don’t let that deter you. Learning a language is a complex effort. Set goals or milestones for yourself so that you can keep track of your progress and stay enthusiastic about your lessons.For example, you might reward yourself when you master a new verb tense, or you might reward yourself when you’ve learned 25 vocabulary words.

, You may find that you outgrow the program that you’re working with, as you master the basic lessons and need to move on to more advanced lessons. Don’t force yourself to stick with a program that doesn’t meet your needs; instead, research advanced Spanish-language programs, again looking at manufacturer websites and reviews, to determine what’s right for you.


You may be hesitant to invest in another program if you’ve already spent money on the basic lessons, and that’s understandable. Consider selling your basic language program to supplement the cost of a new, advanced program.

, Learning any new skill takes time and practice, and learning Spanish is certainly no exception. Setting goals will help you make note of your progress, but in between those goals, don’t get impatient or frustrated. Keep with it, knowing that you’ll likely have setbacks (just like you did when you learned your first language), and keep practicing.You might have difficulty rolling your Rs, known as trilling. That’s normal and understandable. Keep trying – be patient, practice, and it might just happen for you.
You may get frustrated that you forget verb how to conjugate irregular verbs.
Think back on what you’ve accomplished, give yourself the time that you need, and get back to your lessons.

, Consider supplementing your audio lessons with real-world resources that expose you to Spanish as it is spoken every day. Spanish-speaking television shows, especially telenovelas, “slow Spanish” news downloads, music, and Spanish-speaking radio stations will expose you to a variety of vocabulary, dialects, and rapid speech that you might not encounter in your audio lessons. Also, the internet is full of podcasts and videos that are meant to supplement your audio instruction., The best place to use your newly acquired language is in a country where Spanish is the native language. Plan a vacation in a Spanish-speaking country, if you can, and try out your newly-acquired language skills.

, You can also sign up with international pen-pal websites (don’t worry, you don’t have to give any personal information at all), in which you correspond over the computer with people who speak Spanish and want to learn your native language. You’ll write to them in Spanish, and they will offer feedback, and potentially great conversation, in your native language.Penpal relationships can be educational and rewarding. If you’re not comfortable with this route, though, consider signing on to foreign-language message boards.

, Join a meeting website or even ask at your library to find a local language group. These groups are made up of people that are native speakers, as well as students like yourself. Here, everyone can meet up with the shared goal of speaking Spanish, allowing you to fine-tune what you’ve learned from your tapes."

Take out sources that are not appropriate for your project.",How to Do a Literature Search," To start your literature review, you'll need to narrow down your topic. You probably already have a broad topic in mind. Take some time to figure out what aspect of that topic you want to focus on in your search.If you're doing a literature search for a class, you may have a broad topic to explore in that class. For example, it may be a literature course focusing on Shakespeare. The topic Shakespeare, however, is far too broad.
You'll have to find a field of literary theory, as well as a subject within Shakespeare, through which to explore the topic. For example, maybe you want to focus on the play Hamlet. You may want to look into the philosophies of relativism and existentialism in the play. Your topic could be something like, ""relativism and existentialism in Hamlet"" instead of just ""Shakespeare."";
, From here, you'll need to choose your key search words. These are the words you'll be typing into search engines and library databases. These words can help you find relevant sources for your project.You'll want to use as many different search words as possible to find an extensive list of sources. It can help to break down your topic and think of synonyms for each relevant word. For example, say your topic is, ""Changing portrayals of women in independent film in American culture."" Keywords that pop out are ""women,"" ""independent film,"" and ""American culture.""
Think of synonyms for each these terms you can use to search. Synonyms for ""American culture,"" for example, may include things like ""United States culture"" or ""US culture."" Synonyms for ""independent film"" could include something like, ""mumblecore film"" or ""indie film.""
You should also think about the kinds of topics that may be addressed within your topic. For example, you could search something like, ""female archetypes"" or ""female tropes."" You could also search a particular trope or archetype that's been critiqued by film critics. You may want to search for something like, ""mother figure"" or ""manic pixie dream girl.""

, In order to conduct your search appropriately, some background reading is necessary. Read some other literature reviews of projects related to your topic. See what kind of sources were used. Pay attention to how these reviews were organized. Do they go in chronological order? Are they organized by topic? You should read a few peer-reviewed research papers, which you can find at most academic libraries, on your subject. Keep track of what names and authors crop up again and again in these sources so you get a sense of the big names in your field., You want to make sure the sources you use in a literature review are appropriate for the project. Think about what kind of sources are typically used when researching a given field.You'll need a combination of sources for any research project, so be open to a wide variety of material. Usually, for academic research, academic journals published through universities are a good place to start. There are general academic journals, and also journals specific to a single field.
You should also be open to some less academic sources, if it feels appropriate. For example, topical articles on film written by journalists may help supplement academic research if your topic is women in independent film. This can help showcase how attitudes towards female characters are changing, and how the voices of critics shape the trajectory of the film industry.

, There is no set number of sources that is considered the norm, but you can use the length of a project to help you determine how many sources you may need. For example, a 10 page paper might require around 10 to 15 sources, while a 300 page dissertation may require 100 or more sources.


Keep in mind that you will have to consult more sources than you will end up using.For example, you may find around 40 good sources in a database search, but you may only be able to access 20 of those sources in the time frame you need. Then of those 20 sources, you may only find that 12 of them really suit your topic.
Check with your instructor as well. Some college writing assignments will have a minimum source requirement. If the guidelines for your paper are unclear, then just ask.

, The best place to start is usually a library. If you have access to an online library database, use it. You can search your keywords and identify sources that may help you. You may be able to access certain documents online, or reserve a copy that you can pick up at the library later. This can save you the time of researching at the library.Many online libraries have the advantage of pointing you to texts that exists in libraries outside of your region. Depending on library policy, you may be able to order these books from faraway libraries.
In the event you cannot order a book from a remote library, see if you can take out an electronic copy from an online library or find the source at another nearby library.

, It's always a good idea to go to a physical library to find sources. While an online library can help you get started, you'll need to go to many individual libraries to form as comprehensive an overview as possible.Bring your list of keywords to an online library. You can enter your search terms into the computers at the library, which will link to an electronic card system that shows where you can find relevant resources in that location.
You can ask a librarian for help. Librarians are valuable resources and may be able to offer you search tips that will be helpful to your research.

, Online sources can be helpful. However, doing a random search into a generic engine like Google may yield untrustworthy results. Use discretion when seeking out resources online.Instead of using a generic google search, use something like Google Scholar which will link you to academic citations.
You may also be able to find databases online that contain many academic sources. Online databases like JSTOR and Academic One File, for example, can be good places. Keep in mind, however, you need a subscription for a lot of these types of sources. If you're currently a student, you may have access through your college or university., Once you've read through your sources, read carefully and take notes as you go. Actively reading your sources will help you down the road as you begin to analyze them and incorporate them into your literature search.As you read, pay attention to the authors' main ideas. Jot down the central themes of each work, as well as the evidence the author uses to support those themes.
Look for any flaws in the work. Does the author seem to have any biases that are cropping up? Is the author examining the issue from every possible angle? If you notice any flaws, write them down.
If you see a particular article or author mentioned across several works, you may want to read a bit by this author. When doing a literature search, you want to incorporate as many influential texts on the subject as possible.

, You can check the sources that other authors have used to support their claims and doing this may lead you to some helpful sources for your topic.As you read your sources, note any information that came from another source and identify the source that it came from.


Depending on the documentation style that the author used, the source may be provided within the text, at the bottom or the page, or at the end of the book or article.
When you find a source you would like to use, take a moment to write down relevant information about the source, such as the author’s name, the title, and the date it was published.
Keep in mind that it is important to locate the original text and read it yourself before you decide to quote it. Quoting a source within a source is not a good idea because you will not have the full context behind the information.

, You do not want to have to write down all your citations at once when you finish the project. As you go, write down the citations for the works you're using. Have a document on your computer with all your sources listed and cited.


Follow the citation style recommended by your instructor or commonly used in your field. You'll typically be using either MLA citations or APA citations.
If you're unsure how to cite a source, you can use resources like EasyBib to cite the source for you. However, you should double check when you're done to make sure the source was cited corrected.

, Once your materials are ready to go, you can begin assembling and writing your literature search. Your instructor may have specified a method of organization for your search. However, if no method was specified, there are several ways to organize your search.You could order the review in chronological order, placing the earliest sources first. This may be helpful if you're tracking the history of a subject and how it's changed over time.
You could also organize the review by trend or topic. This is particularly helpful if you're examining several schools of thought. Returning to the Shakespeare example, you could group writings on relativism in one section, writings on existentialism in another, and so on.
For more scientific research, you could organize by method. This means splitting up sources by the methods in which research was conducted. For example, one section focuses on double-blind studies while the other focuses on blind studies.

, From here, you'll want to write a brief paragraph summarizing each source for the reader. Write a brief few sentences summarizing what the author of the source is arguing.Be careful not to use too many quotes. In literature searches, extensive quoting is uncommon.
Make sure to use your own voice. You want to avoid sounding like you're plagiarizing or imitating a source.

, In addition to summarizing the source, talk about how it is relevant to your project. You're likely making a central claim or series of claims in your research project. Make it clear how your sources support or do not support the claim. If your sources provides a counterargument, briefly explain how you plan to refute this argument.Explain how a source is important to the ideas you're trying to express. You should not just summarize the sources. Synthesize them into your work as well.
If one source is supplemental to another, link them in the review. For example, you may include a film review blasting the manic pixie dream girl trop.
Explain how this review conveys an argument made in an academic paper about viewers craving more realistic female characters.

, You may find your literature search is too long. You may have incorporated sources that do not speak to your project. Try to cut out sources that are only tangentially related to your topic. If there is a limit to how many sources you can include, make sure to stay within that limit., You may find you need more information in certain fields. If you feel one area of interest is under-researched upon completing your review, find a few more sources in that area and add them. For example, you may find you have a lot of information about films from the early 2000's, but late 90's films are neglected. Return to a library or online database to fill in these gaps., Make sure all your sources are academic in nature, or tie in to an existing academic source. Cut out sources that are from pop magazines and non-peer reviewed journals.You can make sure to avoid bad sources by limiting searching to journal database, online libraries, and physical libraries.
If you do use an online source, sources that end in .edu or .ac tend to be more academic in nature.

Use block quotes for four or more lines of verse.,
Preserve the line breaks of the original verse in a block quote.,
Format dialogue between two characters correctly.,
Include the publications or books that you used.,
Follow a consistent format.,
Include the works cited page as the final page of your paper.",How to Cite Shakespeare," Parenthetical citations are citations that appear inside regular parentheses within the body of your paper. No matter which citation style you’re using, Shakespeare works are unique in how they are cited. They are always cited with parenthetical citations that appear in the text of your paper. They are not indicated by a footnote or endnote., When you quote a passage, wait until the very end of the section that you’re quoting before including your citation. Sometimes, the passage might be lengthy, such as a dialogue between two characters. The citation comes at the very end of this entire passage., If you’re not including the original passage in your paper and instead you’re paraphrasing a passage, you still need to indicate where this passage comes from. Include a citation formatted just the same as you’d use for a quotation.


Don’t use quotation marks for paraphrased material.

, You may find a quote from a Shakespearean work in another piece of writing, such as a critique of the play you’re writing about. The quoted Shakespeare text might be exactly what you want to use. But in order to quote and cite it properly, you should go back to the original play or sonnet. This will help you read the quote in its proper context.


Cite this quote as it appears in the original source, such as: Much Ado About Nothing (2.3.217–24).

, Plays are broken down into acts, scenes and lines. When citing Shakespeare, you’re giving the reader a roadmap of where to find the quoted material. Separate each of these numbers with a period.

, When giving the play’s act and scene number, you can write these in Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3, and so on) or Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.).Choose one format and be consistent with using it. The line numbers are always written with Arabic numbers.


Most modern scholars prefer using Arabic numbers, but both formats are acceptable.Write upper-case Roman numerals (I, II, III, etc.) for the play’s act number. Use lower-case Roman numerals for the scene number (i, ii, iii, etc.). For example, (IV.ii.56–57).

, Quoted material corresponds to certain lines within the work. When you have text that comes from more than one line, you need to include a range of line numbers.If the range of line numbers is under 100, write: 66–84.
If the range of line numbers is over 100, write: 122–34.
If the range of line numbers extends from under 100 to over 100, write: 90–104.
Put an en dash between the line numbers. This dash is slightly longer than a hyphen but not as long as a dash.

, While most other citations require page numbers, Shakespeare works are an exception. Because the plays have been reproduced in so many different formats and publications, there is no consistency on page numbers. Therefore, never refer to page numbers when you are citing text from a Shakespeare play., Generally, if your paper is only discussing Shakespeare’s works, you don’t need to write Shakespeare in the parenthetical citation. But if you are comparing with another author, you should differentiate each one by indicating the author in the parenthetical citation.


In MLA format, write: (Shakespeare 3.4.40)

, You may need to differentiate frequently between two different plays in your parenthetical citations. Instead of writing the name out entirely every time, you can abbreviate the title. For example, you can write JC for Julius Caesar, Mac. For Macbeth, Rom. for Romeo and Juliet, etc. These would appear like this in your paper: (Mac. 1.3.15-20).,, If you are citing the stage directions that are given in a play, you need to tell the reader where you’re drawing them from. Indicate stage directions by giving the line number at the end of your citation.


For example, the citation for a stage direction would read: 3.4.40.1. This means that the stage direction is at Line 1 after Line 40. , The amount of text you’re quoting will determine the placement of the punctuation at the end of a passage.When citing fewer than four lines of verse, you will use quotation marks around the quoted material. Then write the parenthetical citation, and follow that with punctuation (a period, for example).
When citing four or more lines, you will use a block quote. There are no quotation marks, and the ending punctuation (a period, for example) will go at the end of the last line. Then include the parenthetical citation.

, When quoting a passage, you need to indicate which character is talking (unless the verse is from a sonnet). You can introduce the speaker in your own writing, or you can include the character’s name in capital letters at the beginning of the verse. For example, choose one of these two options:Othello recalls, ""Upon this hint I spake: / She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd, / And I lov'd her that she did pity them"" (I.iii.166–168). In this option, you need to include quotation marks where the spoken passage begins.
”OTHELLO: Upon this hint I spake: / She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd, / And I lov'd her that she did pity them” (I.iii.166–168). In this option, include quotation marks before you name the character, since this is how the name appears in the text.

, Citing verse in linear form means that the quotation from the text will not be in block form. This is reserved for passages that are fewer than four lines. If you have two or three lines of verse, separate these with a space, forward slash, space.For example, write: “OTHELLO: Upon this hint I spake: / She lov'd me for the dangers I had pass'd, / And I lov'd her that she did pity them” (I.iii.166–168).If you are quoting prose, then omit the slash and instead use a comma.

, Lengthier passages are set apart in the body of your paper in a block quote.This appears as an indented set of lines when you have four or more lines of verse that you’re quoting.Indent one inch from the left margin. The entire block quote will be set apart from the rest of your paper. Indent every line of the block quote one inch from the left-hand margin.
Omit quotation marks. Block quotes are set apart from the rest of your text. Therefore, you do not need to set them apart by using quotation marks.For example:
Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
But I will wed thee in another key,
With pomp, with triumph and with revelling. (1.1.19–22)

, Break each line at the same place as it is broken in the original.If you are quoting prose, then you don’t need to preserve the line breaks. These will differ depending on the publication in which the work appears.

, When you want to quote dialogue between two or more characters, format it this segment as a block quote.Indent one inch on the first line and include the first character’s name in capital letters. Follow the name with a period. Then add a space and start the character’s dialogue. When you need to start a new line, indent an additional ¼ inch (putting this line one and ¼ inches from the left margin).
Start a new line when another character speaks. Again, put this character’s name in capital letters and follow it with a period. Add a space and start the character’s dialogue.
Include the parenthetical citation at the very end of the dialogue block.
For example:
HAMLET. No, by the rood, not so:
You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife:
And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
QUEEN. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. (3.4.14-17)

, You need to include a “works cited” page with your paper. This page lists the published material that you’ve used to write your paper. This might include a collection of Shakespeare’s works, a single volume with one play, or an anthology of several different authors’ works.Depending on the citation style, the works cited page may be called a “bibliography” or a “references” page.
Don’t just list the play that you’re citing. You need to indicate the publication in which the play appears.
Alphabetize the works cited page.
Sample entry for an anthology:

Shakespeare, William. “The Comedy of Errors.” The Oxford Anthology of Tudor Drama. Ed. Greg Walker. Oxford, UK: Oxford U P, 2014. 682-722. Print.


Sample entry for a collection of a single author’s works:

Shakespeare, William. Love Poems and Sonnets of William Shakespeare. New York: Doubleday, 1991. Print.


Sample entry for a single work:

Shakespeare, William. Romeo and Juliet. Ed. Jill L. Levenson. New York: Oxford U P, 2000.


Sample entry for a live play:

Hamlet. By William Shakespeare. Dir. Dominic Dromgoole and Bill Buckhurs. Shakespeare's Globe, London. 25 April 2014. Performance.



, Depending on your preference and the requirements of your class, you may choose to use one of several formats, including MLA, APA, or Chicago.


Each style is slightly different in terms of format. Follow one style for your entire paper.

, The works cited page starts on a new page after your essay. Title this page “Works Cited” with the words centered and bolded at the top of the page.

Decipher Spanish sites.",How to Learn Spanish Online," Each person has a different learning style, especially when it comes to something as individual and personal as language. Also consider your price range when choosing sites; some sites are free, such as duolingo, but others cost money. You'll find as you investigate Spanish teaching websites that some naturally suit you better than others. Trust your instincts, but always try to challenge yourself. Some potential sites to consider include:


Babbel
Conjugemos
Duolingo
Fluencia
Spanish YouTube channels
Rosetta Stone Online
Some teachers allow lessons over Skype;
, Without activating each of the four language learning areas and applying concentrated study, you will never gain fluent ability. Some learning areas will come more easily, or you may prioritize one area over another, but all four are necessary components of any and every language.The four areas you'll need to activate in the course of your studies are: Speaking, listening, reading, and writing.


Though there is no wrong way to learn language, recent research has indicated that focusing on the audio component first and cultivating your listening ability may be the best way to study a foreign language.

, Some websites, like those focused on language learning for a business environment, might focus mainly on one skill, like reading. This is usually to prepare an individual for a business situation in which memos, business emails, contracts, etc., take priority; don't let this fool you. All four language areas are necessary for true fluency.

, This will provide motivation for your continued study, even when the going is tough due to difficult vocabulary or the impositions of your level.Some common areas that might motivate you in your study of Spanish:


Sports
Current events
Spanish literature
History

, You can either do this on your own or take an online test to gauge your level of ability. Chances are you likely have some inclinations about Spanish already, as there are many cognates (similar sounding words) shared between the two languages. Be aware that online tests might use widely different criteria to evaluate your language ability, which might lead to very different results for your ""level"" depending on the test. Self examination can be attempted by:


Listening to several native Spanish broadcasts (various topics).
Rating yourself in terms of percentage understood.
Averaging the percentages to get a cumulative listening percentage.
Looking through online textbooks.
Finding a level you feel you mostly understand.
Establishing a base level off the textbook level and listening comprehension percentage.

, Try setting a goal, or several goals, before you begin studying. Try to be reasonable with yourself. A good goal for beginners might be making polite greetings and simple requests. Whatever goal(s) you choose to help direct your study, write these down, and as you accomplish them, re-evaluate and set even more challenging goals for the future., This depends on your personal preference, schedule, and daily habits, but consistency is important for your language learning.Set a time of day when you can guarantee an uninterrupted block of study, and stick to it.Some Spanish-learning websites allow you to set a daily goal for the site.

, Various studies have validated the importance of immersion in learning a second language.Using Spanish radio, Spanish language podcasts, Spanish music, and whatever other resources at your disposal, try to expose yourself to as much Spanish as possible as you continue in your studies.


Especially with listening activities (like online radio or podcasts), you don't need a perfect understanding of what you are listening to for you to benefit from it.
Many popular websites such as buzzfeed and youtube have articles/videos that are made for Spanish speakers. Simply hearing the flow and distribution of Spanish will help speed your learning along.

, Many free sites have comprehensive information on beginner level Spanish grammar and mechanics. Make sure you have a firm grasp of these before attempting more difficult level exercises.

, It is impossible to become fluent in Spanish without having proficiency with the various forms that verbs take when tense or context is applied.You will also have to learn how pronouns change according to part of speech or verb pairing.


Tenses and moods can be be very tricky. Try to come up with a personalized way of remembering these, like mnemonics devices.
Online verb conjugation sites can be a great supplement to an online learning strategy.
Print out conjugation guides to help with irregular verbs and irregular constructions.

, Take part in Spanish speaking online communities, become involved in popular Spanish online forums, and search online for Spanish email pen pals with whom you can practice your Spanish. Set a regular schedule for your participation; regularity will make it easier for you to get into this habit.

, There are many free and pay-to-use flash card apps and programs that are specifically intended to help you learn vocabulary. These are ideal for building your knowledge of Spanish words.


Try to find a flash card app that tracks your statistics so that words you struggle with appear at higher frequency. These programs can help you isolate problem words and formations.
Don't just use flash card apps for vocabulary; include common conjugations with the English equivalent in your flash card pool. This way you are studying both vocab and grammar.

, If you're visiting a Spanish country as a tourist, chances are you won't need to engage in a Spanish conversation on economics. Be discerning with the vocabulary on which you focus. It can help if you compile a list of words you believe will be useful to you in your daily Spanish conversations.


You should also think about making a list of words and phrases you find yourself using frequently in English. Look these up in an online Spanish dictionary or through another site, and begin trying to integrate them in your usage.

, Language learning is a lifetime pursuit, and there will even be words and topics in your native language that you are unfamiliar with. As your skill increases, you should adjust your goals and move on to higher level, more difficult material.

, School language is very standard, so it can be boring or unchallenging. Take notes on difficult words and look them up or ask a native or a language instructor if you have the chance. This may include:


Literature (ebook format)
Online Comic books
Fashion blogs
Current events forums

, These are especially valuable for learning everyday Spanish. Remember to keep your Spanish notebook on hand so you can write down anything worth remembering, or any troublesome grammar that clicks after hearing/seeing it used.

, Most word processors come pre-installed with software that you can use to help improve, or check, your Spanish. This software is very useful for checking your verb conjugations, and allows you to learn at your own pace.

, This is an excellent way to practice for intermediate to advanced students of Spanish. Skim through sites written entirely in Spanish and see how much you can comprehend. Keep a notebook handy and jot down words that are unfamiliar. You can look these up later and add them to your flash card pool.

Explain the concept of the wiki to students before you begin.,
Ask students to choose two wikiHow articles to critique.,
Once the class has established what makes a good wikiHow article, it's time for students to start brainstorming possible topics for their own article.,
Once possible topics have been approved, students need to test their topics for originality.,
To begin, each student should create an account on the wikiHow web site; the instructions are very easy to follow.,
When students have established an approved topic, they will type in the title for their wikiHow article.",How to Use wikiHow in the Classroom1," Have students enter the site, then let them spend about 15 to 20 minutes browsing some of the articles. You may want to make a class list of some of the more interesting or esoteric titles the students find in their searches so they understand that there is a lot of latitude for subject matter.;
, Give students two ""wikiHow Evaluation Worksheets"" to fill out, one for each article they've chosen. The wikiHow site offers a very helpful primer which can be reached at www.wikihow.com/Writer's-Guide; the criteria for evaluation of an exemplary wikiHow article are all there; simply use these to set up your evaluation sheets. (They're also helpful for creating a final evaluation rubric for your students' postings.)

, Encourage students to write about something they are really interested in; this is a big factor in successful completion of the assignment.

, They should conduct a search on wikiHow to make sure that there is not already an article on wikiHow that is written on that particular topic. If they find an article on their topic, they can come up with a different topic or they can be encouraged to improve the existing article based on the critiquing skills developed in previous steps.


It's very important that the originality of the topic is verified before the student writes the article because it can be very disappointing to see their article get merged or deleted as a result.

, Simply click on the ""create an account"" option. Tell underage students to create a username code that protects student identity -- for instance, use their first name and a class code -- and record this and their password for future reference and access to their articles.

, It's important to know that the title cannot easily be edited later, so have students proofread this carefully for typos and spelling errors.

"
"
Once the topics have been established, students will begin their research.",How to Use wikiHow in the Classroom2," Because some of the topics may be a bit unusual, students may have some challenges finding relevant or reliable sources, but this can be used to advantage. Stipulate how many sources you expect students to have, and give them a ""Resource Log"" sheet for each of those sources. The log sheet will contain bibliographical information for the sources, a checklist for the reliability of the source (try the Ontario School Library Association's web site or other library associations for ideas)and room to record jot notes on the subject. Even if the source is virtually useless, at least you're raising student consciousness regarding criteria for reliable sources.

"
"
Now that students have all their info, suggest ways for them to organize their information.,
Once information has been categorized, students can begin their first draft for their wikiHow.,
Since wikiHow already has pre-set headings, it makes sense that students use these headings to guide their writing.",How to Use wikiHow in the Classroom3," Providing them with graphic organizers may be helpful here. This is a good time for students to start separating information which might best be communicated under the wikiHow ""Steps"" category from information which belongs in the ""Tips"" and ""Warnings"" sections.

, Most teachers don't have students compose directly on the wikiHow page at first. There are a couple of reasons for this: 1) this is a valuable opportunity to promote writing and editing skills, and 2) once the wikiHow article is posted, anyone can edit it before you have a chance to evaluate it.

, Students should write their instructions in block paragraph format; the reason for this will become evident in the next section. This draft form of the article must be carefully proofread before students are ready to post on the wikiHow site.

"
"
When students are ready to post their information, they should take the ""wikiHow tour"" provided on the site.,
When students are ready to post their article, they simply cut and paste the instructions into the appropriate section.,
wikiHow offers a section to record sources, and this provides an opportunity to have students practice their bibliographic skills.,
When students are finished the copy and paste, they should choose the ""Save page"" option at the bottom of the template before choosing the ""Preview"" option.,
Print the page immediately.,
Give students an opportunity to reflect on the assignment and its process.",How to Use wikiHow in the Classroom4," This will give students information regarding formatting techniques and how to add images if they wish to do so. You may want to print out copies of the ""Advanced Formatting Techniques"" section so the students have it handy as they cut and paste their information.

, This is the time to incorporate the ""Advanced Formatting Techniques"", such as bold or italicized text, etc.

, Since wikiHow doesn't offer an underline option, it's best to use APA bibliographic style, rather than MLA.

, (Once you leave the template page, you can't return via the ""back"" button on your toolbar.)

, You'll need a copy of the untouched assignment for evaluation purposes. The student can always fix minor mistakes in the immediate future and hand in the revised copy.

, It will help you make improvements in the future, and it raises student consciousness regarding the research and writing processes.

Identify websites made for teachers.,
Find web resources for a particular lesson or curriculum.,
Track down additional support materials online.",How to Use Web Resources for Teaching1," Become familiar with the various types of websites that are specifically designed to support classroom teachers and instruction. Do an online search for things such as lesson plans, exercises, quizzes, handouts, or posters to check out the variety of sites and support materials available. Bookmark and use the ones that seem most useful.


There are some teaching websites dedicated to specific subjects, like the National Science Teachers Association website for science or The National Writing Project for writing.Other websites, like Teachers First or Education World, offer hubs for teaching on all subjects and to any level. Use the site search functions to find appropriate resources for your field.Not all web resources for teachers are created equal. Be sure to evaluate the accurateness and appropriateness of the content as well as the credentials of the author or organization behind the site before you use it in your teaching.;
, The internet is overly rich in both resources and distractions, so it’s often best to gear your online searches towards a specific lesson plan. If you’re about to start To Kill a Mockingbird with your class, begin by searching for “To Kill a Mockingbird lesson plans.” If you’re gearing up for a unit on trigonometry, try a “teaching trigonometry” search.

, Once you have an idea of what you’d like to cover, try searching non-teaching-related websites for any additional materials that could contribute to your lesson. Public and education-oriented organizations like museums, libraries, universities, nonprofits, and government agencies will often have impressive online archives with photos, video, sound files, copies of original documents, maps, and such to support your teaching.


For example, if you’re covering the Harlem Renaissance, take advantage of The Smithsonian’s online exhibition of African American Art. Or, if you’re teaching about astronomy, use NASA’s archive of images from the Hubble Space Telescope.

Create a class home page.,
Bring authoritative websites into the classroom.,
Enhance lectures with multimedia web resources.,
Use a collaborative platform as part of your class.,
Incorporate online tools into your lessons or assignments.",How to Use Web Resources for Teaching2," It helps to give students an online touchpoint for your course where they can check in and find everything they need for it. It offers a centralized place where you can upload readings, assignments, notes, calendars, announcements, and other materials for your class.


Many schools offer secure, in-house software like CourseWeb that makes it easy to put together a class home page.
If you don’t have access to CourseWeb and don’t have any programming know-how, it’s easy to create your own website for free with user-friendly platforms like Wix or WordPress. This is also a good idea if you’d like your course materials to be available to the public.
Many free web page hosts also offer a blog function that allows for multiple contributors so that your students can also use the course home page as a communication hub where they can interact with each other and post reflections, questions, and comments. If you make contributing to blog part of the course requirements, it can foster discussion and collaboration outside the classroom.

, If you approve of a particular site or find that it has useful supporting materials for your lesson, have your students interact with it. Besides giving your students access to excellent resources, information, and primary source materials, this will help them identify what makes an online resources valuable and legitimate sources for research.You can have students visit the official sites for museums, libraries, universities, government agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and reputable print media to do the readings for a lesson or track down sources for assignments.
For example, if you’re doing a lesson on scientific breakthroughs, you could use the related biographies, speeches, and videos available on the Nobel Organization’s website.

, Add interest to traditional lectures by sharing visuals, video clips, or audio files. Doing so can provide great support and illustrations for your points while keeping students engaged in your argument through visual and audio stimuli.


If you’re discussing a particular poem, share an audio clip of the poet reading it aloud. If you’re talking about the Vietnam War, find a video clip that provides a glimpse of the media coverage associated with the conflict.
Try Vimeo, YouTube, and news media sites for video clips. A Google Image search is great for photos and graphics. If you’re looking for material that you can download or that’s in the public domain, try searchable collections like the Library of Congress or Archive.org.

, This could be anything from a blog to a wiki to a shared web page. The only requirement is that your students get to actively participate in it as authors. Working together online helps to extend lessons and foster community beyond the classroom while giving students a sense of ownership over their own learning.For instance, create a blog for your class where students can share their assignments, respond to other students’ work, ask questions, and/or post on topics related to the class.
Sometimes students feel more able to express themselves online than in person. This gives those individuals a chance to participate and contribute even if they’re shy about speaking up in the classroom setting.
If you make your blog, wiki, or web page into a resource that’s available to the public, it can help motivate students to do their best work and feel like they’ve accomplished something meaningful through doing an assignment.

, Introduce students to apps that advance their studies while building 21st-century skills like digital literacy. That way, they can get hands-on knowledge of a specific subject and general preparation for their future at the same time.


For instance, if you’re teaching geography, why not use Google Earth? Or, search for the latest educational apps, such as Glogster, a multimedia tool that helps students learn about communications and design while completing their assignments.Using online and multimedia tools can also help accommodate a wide range of learning styles, giving students who might be more attuned to visual or auditory learning a chance to thrive.

"
"
Record yourself giving a lesson.,
Post your original lesson plans and/or course materials online.,
Join a teaching listserv or forum.",How to Use Web Resources for Teaching3," Use the audio or video recording capabilities of your computer or electronic device to document your teaching. Save the file with the title of your lesson and upload it to a web host. This will make your lesson available to fellow teachers and curious web-browsers. It also offers a convenient resource for students who are looking to review course materials or catch up on material they missed due to absence.


Free audio recording software is available at http://audacity.sourceforge.net/

If you would only like this material to be available to a limited audience (such as your enrolled students), encrypt your recording with a password.

, You’ve benefited from web resources, now it’s time to pay it forward. If you have a lesson plan or handout that worked well, make it publicly available on a personal website or teaching forum.


If you’re comfortable with people adapting and/or adding to your lesson, post it on a site like Reading International Wiki. This will turn your materials into a collaborative writing project and put them in the public domain.

, Pick one that’s related to your field, and join the conversation. It’s a great way to hear about how other teachers have used online resources in their real-life classrooms. Share your findings and bounce ideas off colleagues. It could even lead to an exciting collaboration!


Most websites and organizations dedicated to teaching have their own associated forums and/or listservs. If you have go-to teaching website or a group that you’re already affiliated with, that’s a good first place to look.

Consider your current knowledge of the literature.,
Review the cover.,
Survey each chapter before reading.,
Analyze any visual clues provided.",How to Actively Read a Piece of Literature1," Analyzing what you already know about the literature and the author could provide key clues towards better active reading. Knowing the basic concept of the literature or the author may shape your perception about what the author is actually intending to relate.Is the author from a specific region of the world?
Does the author hold a position or stance on a subject that may shape his or her views?
Is the book a likely response to a current event or related tension?
Be careful not to make brash connections between the author’s background and the work.A book titled ""Uncertain Future"" written in 1942 is probably about WWII.;
, If the piece of literature you are reading is a book, or has a cover with an illustrated title, take a minute to review it. What does the title mean to you? Before continuing, make an inference on what the book will be about. If the book's title is ""Richard III,"" you're in the clear; it's about Richard III. What if, however, the title of the book was ""Much Ado About Nothing?"" That would not be too clear.Analyze the title and subtitle word choice. Could a synonym have been used? If so, why did the author choose that specific title?
If a character is fiercely displayed on the cover, try to determine the action being taken.
For a series or sequel, look at the progression from one cover or title to another, and ask yourself what has occurred from book one to two.

, When beginning your actual text reading, make sure to focus on the chapter title/name. Carefully analyze typeface choices like bold and italic words or passages. Ask yourself why these word and design choices would be made in this specific chapter. Asking different levels of questions will help you understand core concepts throughout the text.Create questions or guesses about the oncoming chapter’s purpose or perspective.

""Willy Loman battles the devil,"" may be about a character's battle versus evil or inner demons.
A chapter titled, ""Cancelled business trip,"" could be literal, or about a tragic event while traveling.


Modify the titles into thoughts or questions related to what may follow.

""Willy Loman laments that his son discovered his infidelity""
""Willy Loman returns home, disappointed.""



, Being able to use your visual literacy, or the ability to turn a visual representation, like a chart, graph, or illustration, into something meaningful, can be a massive benefit to active reading. It’s important to analyze and interpret any images, and being able to communicate why they are significant. Consider one of the following approaches to glean pertinent information.Look at maps, and attempt to determine where specific people may live, or with whom they may align or feud.
Is the technique used an indicator of the time period or target audience?
Aesthetically speaking, is the work pleasing or harsh to the eyes? Does that convey meaning?

"
"
React physically and emotionally to key moments.,
Be a critical reader.,
Examine how the author proves their point.,
Make notes while reading.,
Create an annotation system.,
Write in the margins.",How to Actively Read a Piece of Literature2," Actively engage physical reactions to critical portions of the book as you would when listening to a friend tell you a face-to-face story. If there is a surprising plot-twist, raise your eyebrows or mouth the word “wow.” The key is to absorb and ingrain the a portion of the story, so the entire tale is memorable. When a villain gains the upper hand, furl your brow in disdain.
Laugh out loud when something comical occurs.
Tense your muscles during action, battles, or fights.

, Avoid passive discovery of concepts and story subplots.Engage the literature and analyze underlying intentions. Being a critical reader means you understand the words being read, their meanings, and then you anticipate a likely future.


Carefully read seemingly insignificant monologues for hints at future revelations.
Gather clues about characters to determine their potential outcome. If a character constantly drones on about impending doom or death, is the author attempting to hint at their demise?
When making connections about the future of the literature, ensure your connections are based on content rather than supposition., While identifying major concepts and themes may be a clear objective, noting how the author proves these points is also important. Once you know the main arguments, look in the text for smaller claims that either support or contradict the primary thesis.Does the author make assumptions to prove his or her point?
Are credible characters in the literature providing the evidence? If a doctor declares something a medical emergency, it likely is. If a bystander says the same thing, it could be to mislead a reader.
Is thesis-supporting data based on reason or emotion?

, Writing notes about specific sections can be an all-encompassing way for you to summarize all your thoughts and questions related to the topic. It could also help you keep complicated details clear in large pieces of literature. Use a variety of techniques so your notes doesn’t get confusing.Dog ear pages that have details difficult to remember.
Use sticky notes or plastic tabs to reference key plot points.
Make your own spreadsheet of the various characters, families, allies, and enemies.
Draw flow-charts, pictures, diagrams, and other visual aids to help with learning.

, Make sure to focus on important selections, creating your own system, or legend, to identify the reason for the annotation. Being able to quickly focus on the portions you’d like to isolate will help you maintain focus throughout your review. For instance, if you only want to flip through pages and look for unfamiliar words, you could quickly find the words you’ve circled or underlined. Use asterisks to mark curious or interesting selections.
Use arrows to connect ideas that appear to be related.
Circling words you don't know, or underlining creative language by the author, can be beneficial to your linguistic and grammatical skills.

, Connect to what is going in the selection, or summarize the key point. Ensure you identify what the section means to you, what you believe it portends, and any overarching themes with which it aligns or contradicts. Use a few key marks in the margins to quickly convey your methods. A large question mark could be your way of identifying a section you didn’t understand.
Mark particularly moving sections, ones which moved you emotionally, with an heart.
Exclamation points are attention-getters, for those selections that appear contradictory.

"
"
Read the first and last sentences or paragraphs of each chapters again.,
Review everything a second time.,
Recite key details.",How to Actively Read a Piece of Literature3," Examine how the book opens and how it closes. Look how each chapter starts, ends, and begins anew. Is there a connection? Is there a pattern? Does the story come to a complete resolution? Do characters grow? Look for the setup and resolution to problems.Improve the process by creating a simply summary at the end of each chapter. Write a few sentences based on what you understood from the reading.
Don’t try to speed through. Comprehension is lost the faster you read.Look for critical words that imply additional attention. If you see “however” or “conversely,” you know the content is about to change slightly.
Identify emphasizing words like “always,” “paramount,” and “above all else.” These words signify something critical to the story or the current dialogue., The literature and your notes should be reviewed as frequently as possible. The first time you read, it’s about familiarization with the story. Subsequent readings should focus on simpler concepts, meanings behind subtle details. Some larger texts may be difficult to read completely a second time, but a thorough review is beneficial.Reviewing helps keep the text and your notes fresh in memory.
Regular review may bring about new thoughts as you progress through a work of literature. Something you believe or think early on, may change as you move through chapters.Create exam questions for yourself based upon whether you gained new insight from the subsequent reading.

, As often as you can, attempt to lock down important details by reciting them consistently. Whether verbal or written, recitation helps commit facts to memory so that the more complicated or subtle details can be grasped. Once you have these details firmly in hand, everything else plays out as a result.Reciting the sequence of events can help with understanding timeline-based tales.
Complicated literature can be recited on a cause and effect basis. For instance, Romeo attends a ball and falls in love with Juliet. Lord Capulet stops potential bloodshed, and Romeo overhears Juliet’s shared love for him.
Don’t forget to recite your notes as well as the original content. Translating and converting your notes as you read will help form greater understanding."

Have the students choose words out of an assigned book.,

Have your students create metaphors or similes for the word.,
Discuss the word in groups.,
Give them reading that includes the new words.,
Incorporate the words into your own vocabulary.,
Create a print-rich classroom environment.",How to Teach Vocabulary Words," As your students read a chapter in an assigned book, have each student write down the words they don’t know and bring the list to class at the end of the week.With this technique, your students won’t know what words to look out for ahead of time. However, it’s a more efficient technique since you’re relying on your own students’ vocabulary to decide which words to focus on.;
, If you’re having the entire class read a specific book, go through each chapter before you assign it and pick out words that you think students won’t know.If in doubt about what words students don’t know, check a list of Common Core State Standards. It will include vocabulary words that students should be learning at each grade level.This approach works best if you want to frontload your students’ knowledge of important vocabulary words. However, it’s probably not the most efficient technique since you may find that your students know many of the words you selected already, or that they don’t know words that you thought they knew.

, Go through the lists of words each student submits (or that you pick yourself) and combine them into a master list.Include three columns on the list: “Yes,” for words your students know, “No,” for words your students don’t know, and “Maybe,” for words your students aren’t sure if they know or not.
Print out worksheet copies of the list for each student in your class.

, Ask your students to write an X next to “Yes,” “No,” or “Maybe” for each word. This will give you an idea of what words your class, as a whole, has the most trouble with.For example, if all of your students put an X next to “No” for the word “suspicious,” (and that word is at or near their grade-level) you’ll know to focus on teaching them that word.

, Create three columns on a piece of paper and write “Basic,” “High Frequency,” and “Specialized” at the top of each column, respectively. Find the most frequently checked “No” and “Maybe” words from your students’ worksheets and classify them into one of the three columns.”Basic” words are common, known words like “door,” “shoe,” and “television.”
”High Frequency” words are words that occur across a variety of domains and are important for students to know if they’re going to engage in intelligent discussion. For example, “analysis,” “significant,” and “articulate” are high frequency words.
”Specialized” words are low-frequency words that are largely restricted to specific domains. For example, “isomer,” “cumulus,” and “entomology” are examples of specialized words.

, You should have whittled down your list quite a bit by now. “High Frequency” words are the ones you should focus on in your vocabulary lessons since they represent the most important words your students need to learn.If you have more than ten words left at this point, use your judgment to select ten words from the list. You can’t go wrong at this point since all of the words in your list will be important for your students to learn.

, Write each vocabulary word in a sentence that gives contextual clues to the word’s meaning. Contextual clues are words and phrases around an unknown word that point to the word’s meaning.For example, if the vocabulary word is “succinct,” you might write, “Julia gave a succinct presentation and the meeting was over in no time.”
Remember that contextual clues can be misleading. For example, the sentence “As he rushed out the door, Chris felt reluctant to meet his friend,” could imply that “reluctant” means Chris was rushing to see his friend because he was excited or rushing because he was nervous and apprehensive.

, Using the contextual clues you’ve provided, let your students brainstorm each word’s meaning. Letting your students brainstorm will get their mental juices flowing and they’ll be more primed to remember the meaning of the words later on.

, Once they’ve had a chance to think about the word on their own, you should tell them what it really means. You can read them the dictionary definition, but it’s more important to present the word in a way that your students will connect with.Use your students’ experience of the world to explain the word. For example, if the word is “hodgepodge,” pull out a plastic crate of different colored markers and “this is a hodgepodge of markers. A hodgepodge is a confusing mix of different things all thrown together.”

, Students learn words more quickly if they can connect them to images. Come up with different ways to represent a word using imagery.For example, if the word is “interstellar,” talk to them about the vast space between the stars and explain, “’interstellar’ is the word for that space.”
If the word is something more abstract, like “repercussions,” show them pictures of children who were sent to their rooms without supper or pictures of people in jail.

, Your students will learn a word more quickly and more deeply if they’re able to understand it on their own terms. Ask your students to raise their hands and give their own definitions of the words.For example, if the word is “concept” and you’ve given the definition as “an abstract idea,” your students will likely be able to come up with their own definitions of “concept” that still get the overall meaning right. If they’re way off in their definitions—for example, if a student says that “concept” means “something that I built”—correct them. For example, you might say, “actually, a concept is more like the idea of the thing you want to build in your mind before you actually build it.”

, Images help students associate words with their meanings. Have your students think of a way to draw the word you’re teaching them.For example, if the word is “enthusiastic,” you might ask your students to draw a person with an enthusiastic expression.
If the word is more abstract, like “intention,” explain what the word means and have your students draw whatever comes to their minds. Even if it’s just an arrow pointing forward, that will reinforce the true meaning of the word.

, Ask your students to come up with synonyms and antonyms for the word. This will help the place the word in a broader context.You can also have them come up with rhyming words or put the word in a song.

, This will really push your students to think about the deeper meaning of the word and how it relates to things in the real world.For example, if the word is “migraine,” you might ask them what a migraine feels like. If a student says “a migraine is like a chisel in your brain,” they’re on the right track!
Be careful using this method since sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between a creative metaphor and a misunderstanding of the word. For example, if the word is “antidote” and a student says, “an antidote is like a sip of cool water,” make sure the student knows the difference between an antidote and a sip of cool water.

, Break your students into groups and have them give examples of the word in a sentence to one another. This will get their creative centers working.You’ll likely have to walk around and supervise the groups since some of them will get off track and others will start using the word incorrectly. If you notice someone in a group misusing the word, give them a good sentence with the word in it and ask them to restate it back to you. For example, if the word is “erratically,” you might say, “the driver was distracted and drove erratically down the road,” and your student might then say, “there were lots of potholes so the bus drove erratically this morning.”

, Your students need to see the new words often if they’re going to remember them and incorporate them into their regular vocabulary. Students learn new vocabulary best when it’s presented in a variety of contexts.Assign readings that contain the new words. These readings can be books, newspaper articles, websites, or any other print source. The key is to get them used to seeing the new words in everyday contexts.

, If you use the new words on a regular basis, your students will get used to hearing them and soon they’ll become second nature.For example, if one of your vocabulary words is “substantial,” try to use it to describe things throughout the school day. You might say, “we had a substantial amount of snow today,” or “learning how to divide is a substantial achievement.”

, Put up posters containing vocabulary words. Make a “word wall” that contains each week’s new words, along with their definitions. Most importantly, keep a well-stocked classroom library with books containing the words you want your students to learn."

If you are tutoring or homeschooling, you are likely working within a more flexible structure. Plan to teach place value shortly after students have learned to count by ones and perform simple addition and subtraction operations – generally around first or second grade.An understanding of place value will lay the foundation for these kids to dive into more complex mathematical concepts.;
, Most young students have only learned to count numbers by ones: one... two... three... four. This is sufficient for basic addition and subtraction, but it is too basic to give students a strong foundation for understanding more complex functions. Before you teach the kids how to break down large numbers into place values, it may be helpful to teach them how to chunk groups of small numbers together into big numbers.Teach your class how to skip-count by twos, threes, fives, and tens. This is an essential concept for students to understand before they learn place value.Especially try to establish a strong ""sense of ten."" Modern western mathematics uses the number ten as a base, so it will be much easier for kids to learn more complex systems if they are used to thinking in this way. Teach your pupils to group numbers instinctively into sets of ten., Give yourself a refresher. Make sure that you fully understand the concept yourself before you try to teach it to a group of young students. Place value, simply put, is the idea that the value of a digit (0-9) depends on its ""place"" or position in a number., The digits are the basic ten number symbols that make up every number: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. We combine these digits to form every single other number. A digit can be a number (e.g. the number 7), but only if it is not grouped with another digit. When two or more digits are grouped together, the order of those digits form a larger number.


Demonstrate that on their own, ""1"" is the number one and ""7"" is the number seven. When you put them together, as ""17,"" they form the number seventeen. Similarly, ""3"" and 5"" together make the number thirty-five. Draw several other examples to bring the point home.

, Use 30-40 small, countable, and fairly homogeneous objects: pebbles, marbles, erasers Scatter the on a table in front of your students. Explain that in modern math, we use the number 10 as a base. Arrange the objects into several groups of then, and count them for the class. Show the students that four groups of 10 pebbles equals 40., Sketch out the concept on a whiteboard. First, draw a basic T-chart, Write the number 1 in the top-right corner of the T-chart. Then, write a 10 in the top-left compartment. Write a 0 in the (right-hand) column labeled ""1,"" and write a 4 in the (left-hand) column labeled ""10."" Now, explain to the class that each number you made with the pebbles has its own ""place."", Make or print out a ""number board"" that lays out all of the numbers sequentially from 1-100. Show your students how the numbers from 0 to 9 interact with the numbers from 10 to 100. Explain that every number from 10 to 99 is really made up of two numbers, with one number in the ""ones"" place and a modifying number in the ""tens"" place. Show how the number ""4"" signifies ""four"" when it is in the ""ones"" place, but acts as a prefix for the set of ""40"" when it is located in the ""tens"" place.Illustrate the ""ones"" place. Direct the class mark or cover up every number that has a ""3"" in the ""ones"" place: 3, 13, 23, 33, 43, 53, 63, 73, 83, 93.
Explain the ""tens"" place. Have the class point out every number with a ""2"" in the ""tens"" place: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Explain that the ""3"" in ""23"" is stacked on top of the ""20"" that is signified by the ""2."" Teach your kids to read the ""tens"" place as a trigger.

, You can arrange physical objects or draw on a whiteboard. You can explain place value using increments of money, which students have likely already learned to associate with scaled numerical values. For a fun and interactive exercise, try using the students themselves as the ""groups"" of values.Memory is predominantly visual, and the concept of place value can be abstract until you put it into visual terms.For that matter, numerical symbols themselves can be abstract for young kids! Look for ways to frame group counting and place value so that they come across as simple, tangible, and intuitive.

, Try using differently-colored chalks or markers to visually demonstrate place value. For instance, write out various numbers using a black marker for the ""ones"" place and a blue marker for the ""tens."" Thus, you would write the number 40 with a blue ""4"" and a black ""0."" Repeat this trick with a wide range of numbers to show that place value applies across the board.

, First, distribute poker chips to each student. Tell the class that the white poker chips stand for the ""ones"" place, the blue chips stand for the ""tens,"" and the red poker chips stand for the ""hundreds."" Then, show the class how to create numbers using place value with your chips. Give them a number (e.g. 7) and place a white chip on the right side of your work table.


Say another number – for instance, 30. Lay down three blue chips to represent the 3 (in the ""tens"" place) and zero white chips to represent the 0 (in the ""ones"" place.)
You don't strictly need to use poker chips. You can use almost set of objects to represent the three basic value ""places,"" as long as each group (color of chips, etc.) is standard, homogeneous, and easy to recognize.

, This is a way to illustrate the way that lower place values make up higher place vales. Once the students demonstrate a solid understanding of place value: teach your class how to trade the white ""ones"" chips for blue ""tens"" chips, and ""tens"" chips for red ""hundreds"" chips. Ask the class, ""How many blue chips can I get if I trade 16 white chips? If I trade three blue chips, how many white chips can I get?""

, You should only approach this concept once the students have mastered the trading of poker chips. It may help to first draw the example of


For a basic addition problem, direct your students to put three blue chips (tens) and six white chips (ones) together. Ask the class what number this makes. (It's 36!)
Keep riffing off of the same number. Have your students add five white chips to their number 36. Ask your students what number they now have. (It's 41!) Then, take away one blue chip and ask the students what number they have. (It's 31!)

Learn the framework of Singapore Math.,
Understand the mathematical concepts.,
Develop the mathematical skills.,
Comprehend the mathematical processes.,
Shape mathematical attitudes.,
Provide a metacognitive experience.,
Apply the approach in stages.",How to Teach Singapore Math1," Before you can effectively teach Singapore Math, you need to understand not only how it works, but the philosophy behind its development. Singapore Math probably isn’t like the math education you grew up with, so it may take a little getting used to. The general philosophy of Singapore Math is best explained using its framework, which has 5 components: Concepts, Skills, Processes, Attitudes, and Metacognition. These 5 components are key to the development of mathematical problem solving abilities.Concepts refers to numerical, algebraic, geometrical, statistical, probabilistic, and analytical concepts.

Skills refers to numerical calculation, algebraic manipulation, spatial visualization, data analysis, measurement, use of mathematical tools, and estimation.

Processes refers to reasoning, communication and connections, thinking skills and heuristics, and application and modelling.

Attitudes refers to beliefs, interest, appreciation, confidence, and perseverance.

Metacognition refers to monitoring of one’s own thinking and self-regulation of learning.;
, Students need to learn each of these mathematical concepts — numerical, algebraic, geometrical, statistical, probabilistic, and analytical — as individual ideas, but more importantly, they need to learn how they are connected together. Students need to be given a selection of materials and examples in order to grasp these concepts and understand how they are all connected. They also need to be able to apply these concepts in active mathematical problem solving in order to be more confident with their mathematical skills., Students need to learn a variety of mathematical skills, including: numerical calculation, algebraic manipulation, spatial visualization, data analysis, measurement, the use of math tools, and estimation. They need these skills in order to learn and use the mathematical concepts they’re being taught. They key to Singapore Math, however, is not to over-emphasize the “how” and under-emphasize the “why.” It is vital that students understand why a mathematical principle works, not just how to solve a mathematical problem., Mathematical processes, sometimes also referred to as knowledge skills, include such abilities as: reasoning, communication and connections, thinking skills and heuristics, and application and modelling. All of these knowledge skills are needed and used to better understand a mathematical problem and the process that is used to solve it.Reasoning — is the ability to analyze a specific mathematical problem and develop logical arguments about the problem. Students learn these skills by applying the same reasoning to different mathematical problems in different contexts.

Communication — is the language of mathematics. A student needs to be able to understand the mathematical language of a problem, and express concepts, ideas, and arguments in that same language.

Connections — is the ability to connect mathematical concepts together. It is also the ability to link mathematical ideas to non-mathematical subjects and the real world. Being able to make these connections allows the student to actually make sense of what is being taught in the context of their day-to-day lives.

Thinking Skills — are skills that can help a student think the way through a mathematical problem, and may include: classifying, comparing, sequencing, analyzing parts or wholes, identifying patterns and relationships, induction, deduction, and spatial visualization.

Heuristics — are similar to thinking skills and are divided into four categories: the ability to provide a representation of the problem (e.g. diagram, list, etc.); the ability to make a calculated guess; the ability to work through the process in various ways; and the ability to alter the problem in order to better understand it.

Application — means using the mathematical problem solving skills a student develops for a variety of reasons, including every day problems and situations.

Mathematical Modelling — is being able to apply representations of data to a specific problem and then determine which methods and tools should be used to solve the problem.

, For some reason math always gets a bad rep in school. However, this reputation doesn’t necessarily develop because math is hard. It partly develops because math can be boring. What kid wants to spend hours learning their times tables!? Mathematical attitudes is the concept of making math fun and exciting so a child’s experiences with learning math are positive ones.In addition to fun and exciting, mathematical attitudes also refers to the ability for a student to take a math concept, method, or tool they’ve learned and use it in their actual day-to-day lives. This type of application happens when a student understands why a concept works and realizes what other situations that concept can be applied to.

, Metacognition is an odd concept — it relates to being able to think about how you’re thinking, and proactively control that thinking. It is used to better teach students problem solving skills without overwhelming them. Some ways in which metacognition is used to teach Singapore Math are:Teaching general (non-mathematical) problem solving and thinking skills and demonstrating how these skills can be used to solve problems (both mathematical and non-mathematical).
Having students think through a problem out loud, so their minds are focused only on the problem at hand.
Giving students problems to solve that require the student to plan how they’re going to solve the problem, and then evaluate how they solved the problem.
Having students solve the same problem using more than one method or concept.
Allowing students to work together to solve a problem by discussing various methods that could be applied.

, Singapore Math does not attempt to teach a student all concepts and methods all at once. Instead these concepts are introduced in stages over a period of time. First a student is taught a concrete concept that is very specific, such as manipulating numbers by counting. Then the student is taught the concept using pictures instead of actual numbers. Finally the student is taught the concept using an abstract approach where a number often represents something else.

Select a play.,
Choose a good edition.,
Familiarize yourself with the most frequent “Shakespearisms.” Language is always evolving, and some of the words in Shakespeare's plays have a different meaning today than when the plays were written, or they are no longer in use.,
Understand Shakespeare’s use of grammar.,
Enjoy Shakespeare’s wordplay.,
Gather other resources you might need.,
Read carefully and slowly.,
Take notes as you read.,
Reread the text.,
Keep reading.,
Take more notes after each section.,
Discuss the text with friends.,
Perform or speak the play.,
Watch a play, a movie, or listen to audio recordings of Shakespeare’s work.,
Read a plot synopsis.",How to Read Shakespeare for Beginners," If you are able to choose your own play, pick something easy and something you might already be familiar with to start. Most editions will have a brief synopsis printed on the back cover. If the play sounds intriguing, it might make for a good selection.


Romeo and Juliet is often a good starting point because many of us are familiar with the “star-crossed lovers” plot.
Consider a comedy, like Taming of the Shrew, a play which has been adapted to film for modern audiences.
Macbeth is another popular Shakespearean tragedy, and if you are interested in political intrigue, this might be the play for you.;
, There are two major choices to make. The first choice is between texts that have been modernized to smooth over the differences in language use from Shakespeare’s time to our own time, or texts that have not been modernized. The second choice is between texts that are annotated or non-annotated. Annotated texts may provide definitions, context, and value-added information that will help you to form a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play.


The ""No Fear Shakespeare"" series is a good option that offers the original text side-by-side with modernized text. Remember that modernized text should support understanding, and not replace the original.
Popular annotated versions are available by Arden and Oxford. Non-annotated texts will provide just the text as it was originally written.

, When in doubt, use the context of the sentence to figure out the meaning or reference an online Shakespearean glossary. Here are some examples:


”Thee” as “you.” For example: “When will I see thee next?”
”Thou” as “you.” For example: “Thou art a villain.”
”Thy as “your.” For example: “Thy name is more hateful than thy face.”
”Hath” as “has.” For example: “He hath killed many a man.” OR “He hath a horse., In Shakespeare’s writing, parts of speech are frequently switched and ""normal"" sentence order is often varied, often for the sake of rhyme or meter (which is like rhythm). Shakespeare often played with standard language; some common features include:


Nouns or adjectives used as verbs
Verbs and subjects which don't agree
Omitted or implied words
Word endings such as ""-ly"" applied inconsistently
Tricky sentence construction.

For instance, where we say ""John caught the ball,"" Shakespeare might write ""John the ball caught,"" or even ""The ball John caught."", In Shakespeare’s writing, metaphors and similes may make some passages more difficult to understand. Shakespeare also heavily used puns, double meanings, and malapropisms for comedic effect.


An example of a Shakespearean metaphor compares life to the theatre stage: ""All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players. They have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts.""
An example of a Shakespearean pun: after Hamlet has killed Polonius and hidden his body, the king asks him where Polonius is. Hamlet tells him he is at supper – “not where he eats, but where he is eaten,” meaning that Polonius is the supper – for worms.
An example of a Shakespearean malapropism: officer Dogberry said, ""Our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two auspicious persons"" (apprehended two suspicious persons)., Gather reference resources that you can refer to if you have a question about something you have just read. Here are a few examples of potential resources.


A dictionary
A tablet to easily access internet reference material
Links to websites that will help you understand the language. For example: Early English Grammar Sheets (http://homepages.wmich.edu/~cooneys/tchg/lit/adv/shak.gram.html), Shakespeare’s Language (http://www.bardweb.net/language.html), and Pronunciation (http://www.renfaire.com/Language/pronunciation.html)., Before you start, set aside some time in a quiet area. Move through the text slowly, and don’t be afraid to use your dictionary or reference materials if you are lost or confused.

, You can make your notes on a separate sheet of paper, where you can write general thoughts, questions, or important ideas or plot points. If you own the text, you might want to consider highlighting key phrases or writing notes in pencil in the book. Also, consider the following questions.


What are the important main events?
Which characters are involved in the sub-plot and how does the sub-plot relate to the chief plot?
What is the relationship of characters to each other?
What motivates the characters?
What is the central point or lesson of the play?, Do not be discouraged if you must re-read passages several times. Even literary scholars often return to key lines. Each time you read a passage you will gain a deeper understanding of what is going on in the play., Remember that reading the play you’ve chosen should be fun. Push on through and keep reading. Don’t let outdated language or references stop you from enjoying the play.

, When you are finished with a section, take out a fresh sheet of paper and take some more notes.


Write a summary of each scene or act.
Record questions or thoughts you may have about the scene.
Record any new words, phrases, and their definitions that you looked up during reading. , Discuss the text or an individual scene with your friends. If you are reading on your own, make use of internet discussion boards for feedback. Feel free to ask your friends or people on the discussion board the questions that you wrote down in your notes.

, Shakespeare's plays were written as dramatic literature and were meant to be performed and heard aloud. As a result, reading the play outloud or performing scenes with friends might give you insight that you would have otherwise missed during a quiet reading., Do this after you’ve read the play on your own. If you have finished reading one of Shakespeare's more popular plays, there is a very good chance it has been produced into a film. There are also a wide variety of Shakespeare’s plays on audiobook that you can download to your iPod or another device. But remember, modern plays or film adaptations might give different meaning or be shown in a different context than the original play. Think about the below questions when you watch the play or film.


How does the performance compare with your perceptions of the play?
Was there something the actor provided that you did not consider?
Was there something you would have done differently?, After you are done reading, find a plot summary or synopsis. Try to find a synopsis that incorporates passages from the play directly into the discussion. These summaries and synopsis will help correct any misunderstanding that you might have after reading the play. Alternately, you can read the synopsis before you’ve read the text. "

Explain the concept of number bonding.,
Decompose numbers by using branching.,

Multiply using the area model.,
Try the FOIL method for multiplication.,
Divide using distributive properties.,
Estimate the answer with rounding.,
Use compensation to make a problem easier.,
Draw a model to solve word problems.,
Understand how to solve a word problem with modelling.",How to Teach Singapore Math2," Number bonds are similar to fact families. Fact families are groups of numbers that are somehow related to each other, or in the same family. For example, can be considered a fact family because the three numbers are somehow related to each other. By using addition and subtraction, you can bond any two numbers to the third. In this case, 3 + 4 = 7, or 7 - 3 = 4.


A great starting point is using fact families that add up to 10, because 10 is considered an easier (or friendlier) number to deal with. Plus, once you learn 10, you can apply the same concepts to multiples of 10.
Number bonds are not limited to addition and subtraction, you can also use multiplication and division. For example, where 2 x 4 = 8, or 8 / 4 = 2.

, Decomposing is breaking numbers into small, easier components. In this case branching diagrams are used to explain and understand the concept. For example, decomposing 15 into smaller components of 10 and 5. A branching diagram would have the number 15 with two lines pointing downwards from it, pointing towards a 10 and a 5 (similar to a family tree).


Students should be taught to decompose larger numbers into smaller, friendlier numbers. In the above example, both 10 and 5 are considered friendly numbers. If we wanted to decompose the number 24 into friendly numbers, we’d use 20 and 4.
An example of a full problem would be: what is 15 plus 24? Mentally, adding the number 15 to 24 may be a little daunting. Instead of trying to add those two big numbers, we decompose them into smaller, friendlier and more manageable numbers — 15 is decomposed into 10 and 5, 24 is decomposed into 20 and 4. Now, instead of 15 + 24 we have 10 + 5 + 20 + 4. Mentally, adding 10 and 20 together and 4 and 5 together is much easier. Now we have 30 + 9, which is very easy to add together to get 39.
The above example would use branching diagrams drawn on paper to work through the problem, which would eventually lead the student to be able to decompose numbers mentally in order to solve a problem.

, Singapore Math does eventually teach addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using numbers in columns and moving from right-to-left, but first the concept of adding from left-to-right is taught. Left-to-right addition helps teach and enforce the concept of place values. Left-to-right addition uses the idea of decomposing a number in order to make it easier to solve the problem. This decomposition is also known as expanded notation and would look like this: 7,524 could be expanded and written as . The order of the numbers in the expanded notation follows the place value concept.


At the risk of confusing the situation, a place value is how we view a number from right-to-left. For example, the number 1,234 can be broken down into place values where 4 is in the “ones” place, 3 is in the “tens” place, 2 is in the “hundreds” place, and 1 is in the “thousands” place.
For example, if we wanted to add 723 and 192 together, using left-to-right addition and expanded notation would result in + . The student can now add numbers with similar place values from left-to-right like this: 700 + 100 = 800, 20 + 90 = 110, and 3 + 2 = 5. The final step would be to add the numbers from all place values together like this: 800 + 110 + 5 = 915.

, The area model for multiplication is a mathematical model that uses both place values and tables (or boxes or matrices) to make multiplication easier. When two numbers are being multiplied together, they are first decomposed into their expanded notation.


If the numbers being multiplied are both double-digits, then a 2x2 matrix is drawn. The matrix itself will have 4 blank boxes.
The expanded numbers being multiplied are then written on the outside of the matrix — 2 numbers above the matrix, one in each column; and 2 numbers to the right of the matrix, one in each row.
Each box is then filled with the multiplication of the number directly above it in the column, and directly to the right of it in the row.
Once all 4 boxes are filled, those 4 numbers are added together to obtain the final result.
Example: 14 x 3 would be expanded to be + . The 10 and 4 would be written above the 2x2 matrix, one number in each of the two columns. The 0 and 3 would be written to the right of the 2x2 matrix, one number in each of the two rows. Then the 4 blank boxes would be filled with the products of the following numbers: 10x0=0, 4x0=0, 10x3=30, and 4x3=12. Then the 4 products are added together as 0 + 0 + 30 + 12 which would then equal 42.

, The FOIL method for multiplication uses a horizontal method instead of the matrix used in the area model. FOIL stands for: F = multiply FIRST term, O = multiple OUTSIDE terms, I = multiply INNER terms, and L = multiply LAST terms. Once each of these four sets of terms are multiplied to each other, the four resulting products can be added together to obtain the final result.


Example: To use the FOIL method to multiply 35 by 27 you would first multiply the FIRST terms (30 x 20), then you would multiply the OUTSIDE terms (30 x 7), then you would multiply the INNER terms (5 x 20), and finally you would multiply the LAST terms (7 x 5). Then you would add the four results together = 600 + 210 + 100 + 35 which equals 945.

, This method of division uses the concept of branching to break a problem down into more manageable pieces. A division problem is made up of a dividend and a divisor (i.e. dividend / divisor). The dividend is decomposed using a branching diagram. Then each of the decomposed branches are divided by the divisor, and then those two terms get added together to obtain the final result.


Example: To use this method to divide 52 by 4 you would start by decomposing 52 into 40 and 12 using a branching diagram. Then both 40 and 12 are divided by 4. The results would be: 40 / 4 = 10 and 12 / 4 = 3. The final result would be 10 + 3 = 13, which means 52 / 4 = 13.

, As a student learns more complicated math problems, it is important to ask them to forego solving the problem precisely but instead estimate the answer by rounding some of the numbers. This is an important skill that is helpful to perfect the ability to do mental math. The rounding is based on place values, and both rounding up and down should be considered.


Example: To determine 498 divided by 5 without writing down any calculations, it’s easier to round 498 up to 500 and then divide 500 by 5, which is 100. Since 498 is only a little smaller than 500, the actual answer is 99 with a remainder.

, Compensation is something you probably at some point when trying to figure out a math problem, you just never had a name for it before! Compensation is where convert a problem to something much easier by changing how the numbers in the problem are displayed. The actual problem itself isn’t changed, but by moving the numbers around it makes it easier to calculate the answer in your head.


Example: If you want to add 34 to 99 it might take a bit of figuring. By changing the problem to something easier to handle, it can be solved mentally much faster. In this case we might move the value of 1 from the 34 to the 99, making the new problem 100 + 33. Suddenly the answer is exceptionally obviously, 133.

, Mathematical word problems, by their very nature, are not always as intuitive as mathematical problems with numbers. One way to solve a complicated word problem is to approach it using a systematic process that includes drawing a visual representation of the problem so it can easily be solved. The steps to solving a word problem using modelling are:


Step 1: Read the full question without paying too much attention to the numbers that are mentioned. The first time the problem is read, the student should try to visualize what the problem is saying. Then read the problem a second time and take note of the actual numbers involved.
Step 2: Decide what the problem is actually about and write down the “who” and “what” the problem is about.
Step 3: Draw unit bars of equal length to eventually help with the modelling and visualization of the problem. A unit bar is literally a rectangular bar drawn on the paper.
Step 4: Reread the whole problem, one phrase at a time. Use the unit bars you’ve drawn (draw more if needed) to visually represent the information in the problem.
Step 5: Determine the exact problem being solved and add a question mark to the unit bars to represent the final answer you’re looking for.
Step 6: Using the visualizations you’ve drawn, plus mathematical concepts and skills you’ve already learned, solve the problem and determine what the question mark should be. It is important at this stage to write down whatever calculations you made so you can go back and check your answer if needed.
Step 7: Solve the problem completely by writing the answer in full sentences. Since it’s a word problem, your final answer should also be in words.

, In order to better understand how modelling works to solve a word problem, review the following example. You should also consider using your students’ textbook or materials to practice the process on your own.


Example: The word problem is, Helen has 14 breadsticks. Her friend has 17. How many do they have altogether? The resulting steps are noted below:
Step 1: Read the problem the first time and note that there are two people in the problem, and the problem in general is about breadsticks.
Step 2: Note there are two people who each have a certain amount of breadsticks. We want to determine the total number of breadsticks both people have.
Step 3: Draw one big unit bar to represent the TOTAL amount of breadsticks between both people.
Step 4: Draw a line through the unit bar. The bar to the left of the line represents the 14 breadsticks that Helen has. The bar to the right of the line represents the 17 breadsticks her friend has.
Step 5: The question mark (i.e. the final answer) is the number represented the entire unit bar.
Step 6: Based on everything we’ve learned and know, we want to add 14 and 17 together to get the answer. We might use left-to-right addition to solve the problem by breaking the numbers into expanded notation, such as: + = {10 + 10] + = 20 + 11 = 31.
Step 7: The final written answer could be: Both Helen and her friend have a total of 31 breadsticks between them.

Know it is different from what you learned in school.,
Allow a child to use the Singapore method while doing homework.,
Recognize a child's need to be able to explain the answer.,
Use Singapore Math materials at home.,
Play games that include a math component.",How to Teach Singapore Math3," Singapore Math was only introduced in the United States in the 1990s. Anyone who went to elementary school before the 1990s would not have had Singapore Math in their curriculum. Instead you likely needed to do a lot of memorization and drilling (like the times tables). Singapore Math teaches children the actual mathematic concepts in such a way that they can apply those concepts to any problem., While you watch a child do math homework, you probably won’t recognize the methods they’re using. But do not let this discourage you, or them. Support the child’s math skills development by learning the concept of the Singapore method yourself.You may be really tempted to have a child learn some of the drills you learned, but try to steer yourself away from this. It may only end up confusing the child at school.

, In previous math curriculum the correct answer to any math problem was the goal — regardless of how you got there. In Singapore Math the child needs to be able to explain their thought process from start to end, and explain how they got the answer they did.You may find that a child’s final answer is incorrect, but that they used all the correct concepts to develop that answer. It might be that there was a simple summation error in the process that created the wrong final answer, but the child actually understands what they’re doing.

, Regardless of whether a child is learning Singapore Math in school, they can still learn it at home. There are many Singapore Math materials available (like textbooks and workbooks) that you can use to help a child understand and learn math.If you find the process successful at home, you may even want to encourage your school board to consider changing curriculum (if they haven’t already).

, One of the best ways to teach a child math is to play games with them that include math concepts. You can do this regardless of what type of teaching method is used in school.Example — ask a child to identify shapes of various objects you pass while you're in the car.
Example — ask a child to help you calculate the amount of ingredients needed in a recipe that you want to cut in half, or double.
Example — ask a child to calculate how fast the car is travelling using facts other than the speedometer.

Show your students examples of persuasive writing.,
Ask your students what they found effective.,
Show your students what you want them to do.",How to Teach Persuasive Writing1," Some students learn best when they can look at a sample of what you’re trying to teach them, and it might be useful for them to have an example to fall back on later in the process. For elementary school age students, use examples that are more opinion-based. Focus on more academically based examples for middle and high school students.For example, you might show elementary school age students a piece of writing that argues that one brand of soda is better than the other. The best brand of soda is based on opinion, but your students will still see that they still have to give reasons or justification that supports their opinion.
For middle and high school age students, a good example might be an article that argues that older teens need more sleep than elementary age children. This article will likely use scientific research to support its claims, so your students will see that the reasons and justifications they give to support their position need to based on more than how they feel about a particular subject.;
, Once you’ve shown your students examples of persuasive writing, lead a discussion during which you ask your students to point out what they found effective about the writing and what they thought didn't work.


For example, if you've read a piece about the benefits of more sleep for older students, you could say ""Do you think older students need more sleep? Why?"" Your students therefore not only have to assess the article's argument, but how the author used evidence to support that argument., Once your students have evaluated a completed piece of persuasive writing, show them what the process of creating one looks like by talking through it with them.


For example, using an overhead projector, start drafting your own essay on a topic you’ve selected beforehand. Think out loud and write as you go so that your students can actually see what the writing process looks like.
This is an especially useful strategy when you’re working with students who don’t have a lot of experience with writing - elementary school students or perhaps students whose first language is not English. This method can also be useful for older students as the complexity of their assignments increases."
"
Set up a debate.,
Read your students a statement of opinion.,
Ask your students to support their position.,
Assess the debate.,
Ask your students to transfer their thoughts from the debate to paper.",How to Teach Persuasive Writing2," Letting your students argue in person – in the form of a debate – will demonstrate to them that they already know how to make a persuasive argument. This is a good strategy for teaching persuasive writing to students who learn best by doing something, rather than by watching or listening.


You can use an informal or formal debate, or both on successive days. The informal debate should be organized immediately after you tell your students what you'll be doing in class. The formal debate should take place after they've had some time to prepare., Ask your students to pick a side in response to your prompt. Then ask them to move to opposite sides of the room, depending on which side they agree with.


For example, read a statement like “Men and women have equal opportunities in life.” Then ask your students who agree with the statement to line up on one side of the room and those who disagree to line up on another side., Once your students have taken sides, ask them to – respectfully – explain why they support their position. They can also choose to respond to what classmates on the opposite side of the issue argue.If you're using a more formal debate set up, at this point you can pass out supporting material to each side of the debate and either ask them to read it then or be prepared to use it the next day. You can ask them to collect their own supporting material for a future debate., Once the debate is over, ask your students who they think won the debate, and then follow up by making them tell you why they think that side won. Once your students have assessed the debate on its surface, draw parallels between the debate and writing a persuasive argument.


For example, you could point out that when they made a statement of fact and then gave a reason for it - for example, if they said older students need more sleep because they are generally involved in more after school activities - they set up what could be the first paragraph of their essay. They made a statement, then backed it up with evidence.

, Once your students have finished discussing the debate, ask them to write down a summary of one argument they made during the debate and three pieces of evidence they used to support their position. This will help them to see how debating with evidence is similar to write a persuasive essay."
"
Brainstorm topics for persuasive writing.,
Don't assign topics.,
Ask your students to make a list of pros and cons.,
Ask your students to research.,
Schedule multiple writing days.",How to Teach Persuasive Writing3," Your students will be most invested in learning how to write persuasively if they are arguing for or against something they feel passionately about. Ask them if there are any issues they are interested in changing - they could be issues in their school or community or family. Then ask them to choose the topic they feel most strongly about.For example, your students might feel strongly that there is not enough recess time. Or they might feel they should be allowed to watch more TV at home.

, Even after you've brainstormed ideas, resist the temptation to assign one topic to the whole class or even a topic to each student. Having to write a persuasive essay about something that they are not generally interested in will make the assignment harder, and you want your students to focus on the task of writing the essay without getting hung up on what they have to write about., Once your students have selected their topic, ask them to list a few reasons why they support or oppose the issue. These will form the main points of their essay and also acts as a rough outline for their essay., Once your students have chosen a topic and listed the pros and cons associated with it, they'll need to find evidence that supports their argument. Emphasize to your students that they should look in a variety of places for a variety of types of evidence to use in support of their argument.Some examples of where to look for evidence might be the internet, the library, or interviews they conduct with people.
Some examples of the types of evidence you can encourage your students to look for are articles, charts, graphs, and interview transcripts., Once your students have collected their research, allow them a number of days – in class – to write their essays. This gives them time to work while you're there and can help them.


For example, on day 1, explain to them that they should start by reading through the research they collected to see what pieces of it they can use to support which pros or cons they listed at the beginning of the process.
Day 2 could be focused on addressing each pro or con in its own paragraph. Explain to them that they should first explain their point and then use their research to support it.
Day 3 could be dedicated to turning their separate paragraphs into a full piece and then doing some self-editing."
"
Walk around and read your students' work.,
Encourage your students to talk to fellow students.,
Edit your students’ work.,
Plan a small-group assessment.",How to Teach Persuasive Writing4," As your students work on their persuasive essays in class, walk among them, reading what they have so far and offering suggestions. This will help your students stay on track as they write, and prevents them from getting to the end of the writing process before they realize they might be doing something wrong., As your students are writing, have them swap their work with classmates for peer editing. Requiring your students to read one another's writing will give them a chance to view persuasive writing objectively. It also requires them to determine what is effective and what is not. They can apply what they learn from reading their classmates' work to their own writing., Once your students have finished drafting their essays, let them turn them in to you for review. Allowing your students to submit their essays to you once before they “officially” submit them gives them a chance to get written feedback from you and incorporate that feedback before their essays are graded., Once your students have formally submitted their assignments, schedule some time for them to meet in small groups with their classmates to discuss their assignment. They can tell their classmates what they wrote about, what they found difficult and easy about the assignment, and how they might improve next time."
,How to Make a Lesson Plan1,
"
Know your objective.,
Write your overview.,
Plan your timeline.,
Get to know your students.,
Use multiple student interaction patterns.,
Address a variety of learning styles.",How to Make a Lesson Plan2," At the beginning of every lesson, write your lesson plan goal at the top. It should be incredibly simple. Something like, ""Students will be able to identify different animal body structures that enable eating, breathing, moving, and thriving."" Basically, it's what your students can do after you're done with them! If you want to do a bit extra, add how they might do this (through video, games, flashcards, etc.).


If you're working with very young students, you may have more basic aims like ""Improving reading or writing skills."" It can be skill-based or conceptual. See the related wikiHow on how to write an educational objective for more specific information.

, Use broad strokes to outline the big ideas for the class. For example, if your class is about Shakespeare's Hamlet, your overview might include covering where in the Shakespearean canon ""Hamlet"" resides; how factual the history described might be; and how themes of desire and subterfuge might relate to current events.


This depends on the length of your class. We'll cover about half a dozen basic steps to any lesson, all of which should be included in your overview. You're welcome to have more, however.

, If there's a lot to cover in a fixed amount of time, break your plan into sections that you can speed up or slow down to accommodate changes as they happen. We'll use a 1-hour class as an example.


1:00-1:10: Warm up. Bring class into focus and recap yesterday's discussion on great tragedies; relate it to Hamlet.
1:10-1:25: Present information. Discuss Shakespearean history briefly, focusing on his creative period 2 years before and after Hamlet.
1:25-1:40: Guided practice. Class discussion regarding major themes in the play.
1:40-1:55: Freer practice. Class writes single paragraph describing current event in Shakespearean terms. Individually encourage bright students to write 2 paragraphs, and coach slower students.
1:55-2:00: Conclusion. Collect papers, assign homework, dismiss class.

, Identify clearly who you are going to educate. What is their learning style (visual, auditory, tactile or a combination)? What might they already know, and where might they be deficient? Focus your plan to fit the overall group of students you have in class, and then make modifications as necessary to account for students with disabilities, those who are struggling or unmotivated, and those who are gifted.


Odds are you'll be working with a pile of extroverts and introverts. Some students will benefit more from working alone while others will thrive in pair work or in groups. Knowing this will help you format activities to different interaction preferences.
You'll also wind up having a few students that know just about as much as you do on the topic (unfortunately!) and some that, while smart, look at you like you're speaking Neptunian. If you know who these kids are, you'll know how to pair them up and divide them (to conquer!).

, Some students do well on their own, others in pairs, and yet others in big groups. So long as you're letting them interact and build off each other, you're doing your job. But since each student is different, try to allow opportunities for all types of interactions. Your students (and the cohesion of the class) will be better for it!


Really, any activity can be manipulated to be done separately, in pairs, or in groups. If you have ideas already mapped out, see if you can revamp them at all to mix it up. It often just encompasses finding more pairs of scissors!

, You're bound to have some students that can't sit through a 25-minute video and others who can't be bothered to read a two-page excerpt from a book. Neither is dumber than the other, so do them a service by switching up your activities to utilize every student's abilities.


Every student learns differently. Some need to see the info, some need to hear it, and others need to literally get their hands on it. If you've spent a great while talking, stop and let them talk about it. If they've been reading, come up with a hands-on activity to put their knowledge to use. They'll get less bored, too!

"
"
Warm them up.,
Present the information.,
Do a guided practice.,
Check their work and assess their progress.,
Do a freer practice.,
Leave time for questions.,
Conclude the lesson concretely.",How to Make a Lesson Plan3," At the beginning of every class, the students' brains aren't primed yet for the content. If someone just started explaining open heart surgery, you'd probably be all, ""Woah, woah. Slow down. Go back to ""take the scalpel."""" Ease them into it. That's what the warm up is for -- it not only gauges their knowledge, but it gets them into your groove.


The warm up can be a simple game (possibly about vocab on the topic to see where their current knowledge lies (or what they remember from last week!) or it can be questions, a mingle, or pictures used to start a conversation. Whatever it is, get them talking. Get them thinking about the topic (even if you don't explicitly say it yet).

, That's just about as straightforward as it gets, huh? However your format, you need to start with the information presented. It could be a video, a song, text, or even a concept. It's the very core the entire lesson is based on. Without this, the students will go nowhere.


Depending on your students' levels, you may have to go pretty bare bones. Think about how far back you need to go. The sentence ""He put the coat on the rack"" makes no sense if you don't know what ""coat"" and ""rack"" mean. Give them the very basic concept and let the next lesson (or two) cultivate it.
You may find it useful to flat out tell the students what they'll be learning. That is, give them your objective. You can't make it any clearer than that! That way, they'll walk away knowing what they learned that day. No two ways around it!

, Now that the students have received the information, you need to devise an activity that allows them to put it into action. However, it's still new to them, so start off with an activity that has training wheels. Think worksheets, matching, or using pictures. You wouldn't write an essay before you do a fill-in-the-blank!


If you have time for two activities, all the better. It's a good idea to test their knowledge on two different levels -- for example, writing and speaking (two very different skills). Try to incorporate different activities for students that have different aptitudes.

, After the guided practice, assess your students. Do they seem to understand what you've presented so far? If so, great. You can move on, possibly adding more difficult elements of the concept or practicing harder skills. If they're not getting it, go back to the information. How do you need to present it differently?


If you've been teaching the same group for a while, odds are you know the students who might struggle with certain concepts. If that's the case, pair them with stronger students to keep the class going. You don't want certain students left behind, but you also don't want the class held up, waiting for everyone to get on the same level.

, Now that the students have the basics, allow them to exercise their knowledge on their own. That doesn't mean you leave the room! It just means they get to do a more creative endeavor that lets their minds really wrap around the information you've presented to them. How can you let their minds flourish?


It all depends on the subject at hand and the skills you want to use. It can be anything from a 20-minute puppet making project to a two-week long dalliance with the oversoul in a heated debate on transcendentalism.

, If you have a class with ample time to cover the subject matter, leave ten minutes or so at the end for questions. This could start out as a discussion and morph into more probing questions on the issue at hand. Or it could just be time for clarification -- both will benefit your students.


If you have a group full of kids that can't be paid to raise their hands, turn them amongst themselves. Give them an aspect of the topic to discuss and 5 minutes to converse about it. Then bring the focus to the front of the class and lead a group discussion. Interesting points are bound to pop up!

, In a sense, a lesson is like a conversation. If you just stop it, it seems like it's left hanging in mid-air. It's not bad...it's just sort of a strange, uncomfortable feeling. If time allots for it, sum up the day with the students. It's a good idea to literally show them they've learned something!


Take five minutes to go over concepts for the day. Ask them concept-checking questions (not introducing new information) to reiterate what the both of you have done and gained from the day. It's sort of a full-circle type of thing, book-ending your work!

"
"
If you're nervous, script it out.,
Allow for wiggle room.,
Over-plan the class.,
Make it so a substitute could understand.,
Form a back-up plan.",How to Make a Lesson Plan4," New teachers will find solace in scripting out a lesson. While this takes way more time than a lesson should, if it would help you, do it. It may ease your nerves if you know exactly what questions you want to ask and where you want the conversation to go.


As you teach, do this less and less. Eventually, you'll be able to go in with practically nothing at all. You shouldn't be spending more time planning and writing out than you are delivering! Just use this as an initial training device.

, You've written out your timeline to the minute, right? Fantastic -- but know that's only really for reference. You're not going to say, ""Kids! It's 1:15! STOP EVERYTHING YOU'RE DOING."" That's not really how teaching works. While you should try to stick to this plan within reason, you'll need to allow yourself some wiggle room.


If you find yourself running over, know what you can and cannot scratch. What must you cover in order for the children to learn most? What is just fluff and time killers? On the other side of the coin -- if you have time left over, have another activity in your sleeve to pull out if need be.

, Knowing that you have plenty to do is a much better problem than not having enough. Even though you have a timeline, plan on the underside. If something might take 20 minutes, allow it 15. You never know what your students will just whiz through!


The easiest thing to do is to come up with a quick concluding game or discussion. Throw the students together and have them discuss their opinions or ask questions.

, On the off chance something happens and you can't teach the lesson, you'll want to have a plan someone else could understand. The other side of this is if you write it in advance and forget, it'll be easier to jog your memory if it's clear.


There are many templates you can find online -- or ask other teachers what format they use. If you stick to one it'll be better for your brain, too. The more consistencies, the better!

, In your teaching career, you're going to have days where students whiz through your plan and leave you dumbfounded. You'll also have days where tests got moved, half the class showed up, or the video you had planned got eaten by the DVD player. When this day rears its ugly head, you gotta have a back-up plan.


Most veteran teachers have a handful of lesson plans under their belt that they can whip out at any time. If you had a particularly successful lesson on Punnett squares, keep that material for later. You can turn it into a different lesson with another class about evolution, natural selection, or genes depending on the next class' ability. Or you could have a lesson on Beyoncé up your sleeve (think the civil or women's rights movement, progression of pop music, or just a music lesson for a Friday afternoon). Whichever.

Do not grade too difficult.",How to Grade Book Reports," A good rule of thumb is a minimum of 20 pages per grade level. So a 6th grader must read a book of at least 20*6=120 pages. Have them write the number of pages down on the book report. If they fail to write down the number of pages, find out yourself and deduct 5 points from the score. When you create a subtotal for the book report, create a proportion for the grade. So if someone read a 119 page book, their score would be multiplied by 119/120. If they read a 200 page book, multiply their score by 200/120. This encourages students to read longer books.;

You want to avoid leaving out any team members because of schedule conflicts. Taking care to include all parties helps create a sense of teamwork.


In-person meetings help foster relationships in a way that Skype or conference calling often do not. Additionally, in-person meetings help you avoid technology snafus that might interrupt your discussion.
If an in-person meeting isn’t possible, then the next best alternative is a Skype meeting at a time that works for all parties. If circumstances prohibit a Skype or in-person meeting, then a phone meeting (while not ideal) is appropriate.;
, Depending on your particular group of participants, a meeting in a school conference room might be your best option. If your group of collaborators are already close, meeting in a member’s home or a local cafe or pub could be appropriate and cultivate a laid-back, open atmosphere for your meeting.


Reserve your meeting room in advance, especially if you would like to have a conference or meeting room in a public location like a school. Don’t assume the space will be open when you want to use it.
Regardless of your meeting’s venue or format, ensure that all meeting participants can hear and see each other. Adjust lighting, microphones, and seating to ensure seamless conversation and exchange of ideas.

, By using Google Docs, you ensure that your notes and lesson plans will autosave and not be lost to technological hiccups. Everyone can edit and access these documents from anywhere using a Google account.


If any group members are unfamiliar with Google Docs, it might be helpful to dedicate some meeting time or a separate meeting on how to use Google Docs. See how to Use Google Docs for Collaboration for more information on incorporating this technology into your meeting.

, Many people are visual learners, so if possible, use visual aids at your meeting to supplement your discussion. The visual component of your meeting doesn't need to be complex or time-consuming to create. Images on an overhead or a brief PowerPoint presentation with relevant data will involve the audience more in the discussion.

, Your collaboration will go much more smoothly if each member attends the meeting having already considered what they might contribute to the meeting’s agenda. Even asking others to bring questions will help facilitate the discussion. The collaboration will have a springboard if you can begin the meeting knowing your group's ideas, questions, and concerns.


Don’t assume everyone in the room knows everyone else’s name or is familiar with everyone’s work or areas of expertise. Even though it might seem unnecessary, go around the room and have all attendees introduce themselves and speak for a moment or two about their lesson planning goals.

, Avoid going blindly into the collaboration. Prepare at least a minimal outline of the meeting and what you hope to accomplish. Even if your collaborating goal is somewhat vague, such as “incorporate technology into the humanities classroom,” this will at minimum give your meeting a general direction. Have handouts ready to give to the group.

, Don’t be afraid of delegating tasks. Be sure to have at least two people taking notes in case one person loses them. If time is a concern, ask someone to keep an eye on the time for the meeting. Ensure that all attendees participate and contribute ideas, suggestions, and concerns. If quieter group members aren’t participating, specifically ask for their input on an area of their particular expertise or interest.


Take particular care not to dictate the meeting. While there needs to be a definitive meeting facilitator, group members will become resentful if you are condescending or inflexible. Keep a professional yet open atmosphere.

, Sometimes even the most professional educators cannot find common ground on particular issues. Senior faculty might resent taking suggestions on how to revamp their classes from new teachers. Differences in departmental funding might create unforeseen tension. Some people can simply be abrasive with their words. It’s vital to troubleshoot these issues effectively to keep your meetings positive and running smoothly.


Acknowledge the conflict without making the parties involved uncomfortable. If possible, do not address the problem publicly and risk embarrassing colleagues or making the situation worse. Wait until you have privacy to directly address the issue.
If the situation is escalating and cannot wait, announce a short restroom break and request to speak quietly with the dissenting parties. Even if you cannot reach a conclusion to the conflict during the break, this will provide some space and time for the dissenting parties to reflect on the situation and cool down.

, Approaches to student learning will vary widely across disciplines. You can choose to group teachers by subject or department, or you can purposely group teachers from a range of unrelated subjects to encourage more unconventional approaches to the lessons. The wider the variety of teacher backgrounds, the more well-rounded your collaborative lesson planning will be.

, It might be obvious that schools need more technologies in classrooms, for example, but specifically dig into how each subject area might approach it. Implementing these changes will look vastly different in English, music, and calculus classes, respectively. Unpack the specifics and develop concrete steps for each teacher to take.

, It is important to decide who will be included in your collaborations. This will help focus both your meetings and the actual lesson planning. Will you include administrators and support staff or limit your collaborations to teachers only? Some schools might even find it useful to include the school board or bring in a guest speaker for their planning.


For instance, do you picture asking teachers from related disciplines, such as American history and American government to pair off and chat informally about lessons they might incorporate? Perhaps you picture grouping together teachers from totally unrelated departments like music and physics to see what unconventional methods they might develop. This is known as horizontal collaboration, meaning employees of equal position get together to brainstorm ideas and develop lesson plans.
Conversely, does your team envision inviting administrators like the school’s business manager to the meeting, for example, to discuss how to remain within budget on any new projects generated by the lesson planning collaboration? This is known as vertical collaboration, and it refers to a vertical hierarchy within a group setting. In this example, the business manager (a school administrator) would be collaborating with the teaching staff to find budget-friendly ways in which to incorporate their interdisciplinary lesson plans.

, Large class sizes, school budget cuts, and staffing can all impact the logistics of incorporating your collaborative lesson plans. Anticipate these issues and proactively address possible solutions to potential problems that might arise. This will make it far easier for your colleagues to apply these new lessons in their classrooms.

, This is important so there is a concrete goal in mind for your lesson. Know what you want students to take away from the lesson. What is the overall theme or subject for the lesson? What are the main points students should know at the conclusion of the lesson? Your objective should directly address these points. Your objective should begin with the directive “students will.” For example, “Students will understand the events that led up to the Battle of Waterloo.”
Your objective should be broad enough that it encompasses all of the points you want to make to your students. Think of it as the umbrella under which the rest of the lesson rests.
A collaborative lesson plan between an American history teacher and an economics teacher, for instance, might touch on topics like the Great Depression or the history of Social Security in the U.S. From there, the rest of the lesson plan will develop as you collaborate on the topic and delve into more specific events and people.

, Once you identify your objective, you can begin developing your lesson plan. Work backward from what you identified as the main points your students should know by the end of the lesson. Think of your lesson’s end goal and then work back to outline the steps necessary for students to reach that endpoint. See this article on how to Make a Lesson Plan for lesson plan development strategies to incorporate into your collaborative planning.


Pay particular attention to time management when creating your lesson plan. Make sure that your lesson will fit within the allotted timeframe.Keep in mind student learning differences. Some students learn visually, while others learn best from hands-on lessons. Incorporate as many learning strategies as possible in order to reach as many students as possible.

, Rather than using a straight lecture format, it’s important to incorporate learning activities into the lesson planning. This keeps students from becoming bored with the lesson and losing interest. Examples of active learning activities include group work, role play, debates, think-pair-share, concept maps, and student presentations., To measure the success of your lesson plan objectives, it’s important to utilize assessment strategies to determine student retention. Using Prior Knowledge Tests or Classroom Assessment Techniques (or CATs) will help you gauge student comprehension. You can choose to assess the class as a whole or individual students.Prior Knowledge Tests help instructors measure an individual student’s understanding of the class material. It is helpful to administer these tests both before and after the lesson to gauge student comprehension. Comparing the prior knowledge test with its matching post-test is an excellent indicator of student retention.Classroom Assessment Techniques measure broader understanding of the class as a whole. Examples include asking students which points stood out to them the most in a class discussion or, conversely, which points were “muddiest” to them and might need more elaboration. , This can be as simple as sending an email to the group requesting that they provide feedback on the meeting itself. Depending on your discussion and timeline, you might also ask how their lesson planning has gone since the meeting. Following up is important because it shows commitment to the group’s agenda. It also shows support for anyone who might be struggling to implement the ideas from the meeting.

, Depending on the complexity of your lesson planning goals, you might require more than just an initial meeting. This does not mean that your initial collaboration was a failure. Instead, it indicates that your group is collaborating on a multi-dimensional issue that takes more time than one meeting can accommodate.

, Following the results of the collaborations long-term will help determine what components of the lesson plans worked well and which ones need to be omitted or improved upon. Once all committee members have executed their lesson plans, schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss the outcome of the collaborative lesson plans. This meeting might be months after the initial meeting in order to give all parties time to conduct their particular lessons.

Explain to the audience that this will be an interactive presentation.,
Open with an ice breaker.,
Start by asking a question.,
Poll the audience.,
Pose a problem.",How to Create Interactive Presentations to Impress Students1," One of the most effective ways to encourage the audience to participate and to make sure your presentation is an interactive one is to explain this to the audience at the beginning of the presentation. When you tell people that you expect them to participate, ask questions, and engage with the material, they will be more likely to follow through.Make sure you are clear about how and when you would like audience members to interact. For example, will you have a designated time for questions at the end of the presentation? Is it okay if people stop you in the middle of the presentation? Is there a specific group activity you have planned? If you provide this specific information at the beginning, your presentation will flow more smoothly and the audience will follow your instructions.;
, Starting your presentation with an ice breaker will help engage your audience, and it will demonstrate that your presentation will be an interactive one. Here are a few ideas for simple icebreakers that will capture students’ attention and make sure they are focusing on your presentation:Request that people introduce themselves to audience members seated nearby.
Invite audience members to share why they are attending the presentation.
Ask audience members to share specific questions they would like you to address during your presentation. They will feel more invested in the presentation and pay closer attention to see how you answer their questions. As the person giving the presentation, you’ll also have a better idea of how to tailor it to the specific interests and needs of your audience.

, Many of us have sat through presentations that were more like lectures, where people talked at us rather than to us. To prevent this from happening and show your audience that you want and need their interaction, try opening the presentation with a question.Select a question that is related to the topic of your presentation and that you think the audience will find interesting or engaging. Instead of asking a very specific question that the audience may have a hard time answering correctly, ask them a question that is more broad and allows them to draw on their opinions or experiences since people like to talk about themselves. For example, if your presentation is on mental illness, you could start out by asking your audience how they think our society and culture portrays people dealing with mental illnesses.
When you ask the question, don’t be afraid to be silent for a few minutes to give people time to think. Look at your audience in an encouraging manner while waiting for a response. You can also give them a few minutes to write down their response, and then invite audience members to share. Some individuals are more comfortable when they can write out their responses or thoughts.

, If you are worried that people won’t respond directly to a question at the beginning of your presentation, try to poll the audience instead. Ask audience members to raise their hands or stand to demonstrate their response.This tactic should yield a good response rate, and people will feel less intimidated.
This poll will also offer you insight into what your audience is thinking. You can then emphasize certain aspects of your presentation to reinforce specific points.

, Another great way to set the tone for an interactive presentation that will impress students is to identify a problem at the beginning of the presentation. If you explain to students that you want them to think about this problem and brainstorm together about potential answers or solutions at the end of the presentation, they will be more committed and invested in the presentation.For example, if you are giving a presentation that deals with the history of immigration, ask students about potential solutions to modern-day questions about immigration. Then, revisit the problem or topic at the end of the presentation and discuss potential solutions.

Read up on Uyghur history and culture.,
Obtain phrasebooks or Teach Yourself courses on Modern Turkish as well as Mandarin Chinese.,
Research Uyghur language resources.,
Learn the Uyghur alphabet.,
Immerse yourself in Uyghur.",How to Learn Uyghur," While learning any language, one must learn about the people behind the language. Conduct internet searches, check out your local library, book shops, and see what you can dig up. If you have trouble finding books specifically on the Uyghur, try books of a broader scope, such as China, the Silk Road, Central Asia, Turkic peoples, Turkic languages, etc.;
, Turkish is a linguistic cousin of Uyghur, it shares much of its base vocabulary as well as grammar with Uyghur, and Turkish is also the most widely published-on Turkic language in the English-speaking world, Uyghur is not. Mandarin Chinese is China's inter-ethnic language as well the second most-spoken and written language in Xinjiang. Knowing bits and pieces of both languages will better ease you into Uyghur as well as smooth out communication problems should they arise.


The Lonely Planet travel collection has two excellent phrasebooks titled Central Asia and China that both have sections devoted to Uyghur in them. They also provide wonderful cultural notes as well as guides on how to wisely travel through the Silk Road.
The closest Turkic language to Uygur is in fact Uzbek; however, like most other Turkic languages, resources on Uzbek, in English, are few and far between.

, Uyghur works are not widely available nor is it studied as a language in the English-speaking world, and resources are thus scarce. If you can read in Turkish, Chinese, or Russian, the number of resources available to you will increase signficantly. If serious language study is your goal, two books and a dictionary you may want to start with include:


Spoken Uyghur by Reinhard Hahn, University of Washington Press
Modern Uyghur Grammar (Morphology) by Hämot Tömür and Anne Lee, Yıldız Teknik Üniversitesi
An Uyghur-English Dictionary by Henry G. Schwarz

, Literacy is key to learning and easing your way through any language. Within Xinjiang, Uyghur is written using an Arabic-based alphabet modified to meet Uyghur's needs. Fortunately, unlike Arabic, Persian, or most notably Ottoman Turkish, the Uyghur-Arabic alphabet indicates vowels and vowel harmony in all instances, spanning books to street signage.


Outside Xinjiang, Uyghur is written in either a modified form of the cyrillic alphabet, modelling Kyrgyz, Kazakh, and Tatar, or a variant of the latin alphabet, modelling Turkish, Uzbek, and Azeri. 

, Finding Uyghur language courses and Uyghur tutors outside of select Near Eastern and Turkic Studies departments at certain universities may prove difficult, if not impossible. If you live in a city with a strong Chinese or strong Islamic/Muslim community, you may find a handful of Uyghur living among them to learn from and practice with. YouTube and the internet, as a whole, have a variety of Uyghur-language media for you to listen to and watch; just do it and do it often. Another wise move would be to travel to Xinjiang itself and live among the Uyghur.

Don’t be critical of your audience.,
Create a comfortable atmosphere that encourages interaction.,
Make eye contact with your audience.,
Present different points of view or perspectives.",How to Create Interactive Presentations to Impress Students2," If you want students to participate in your presentation, being critical or dismissive of their questions and comments will not encourage them to participate. A hostile audience will not make for an effective and interactive presentation, so keep these guidelines in mind when responding to your audience:When students make a contribution to the presentation or attempt to answer a question, acknowledge their effort. Mention that they have raised an interesting point or asked a good question. If your audience feels that you have at least acknowledged their attempt, they will be more willing to put themselves out there again and participate.
Even if you don’t think a question or comment is an insightful one or particularly relevant, you can respond in a way that is tactful and diplomatic. For example, “This is a good starting point, but we also need to consider. . .” or “That’s an interesting question, but beyond the scope of what we can talk about today.”

, If you want students to feel comfortable participating and interacting, you need to create a welcoming environment in which they view you as approachable. Follow these tips to adopt a friendly demeanor that encourages interaction and impresses students.Relax your posture and try to un-tense your muscles so you don’t seem stiff or standoffish. This might deter students from participating.
Use a conversational tone instead of an overly formal one. If students see you as someone who is accessible, friendly, and approachable, they will be more willing to participate and interact with the material. This doesn’t mean you should use slang or inappropriate language, but you don't have to pretend you are a snobby aristocrat either.
Move closer to the students instead of standing behind a podium, lectern, or computer. This will help you connect better with the audience and make them feel like they are a part of your presentation rather than just passively watching it.

, If you would like your audience to interact and respond to your presentation, you need to make eye contact with them and signal that you welcome their participation.If you are reading your notes or powerpoint slides instead of looking at your audience, students will be distracted and less likely to engage with your presentation.

, To encourage student interaction and engagement, present different points of view or perspectives on a topic. If you only present one version, students will not have much to talk about or weigh in on.You can emphasize the perspective or view you think is most accurate and explain why, but you will create a stronger and more interactive presentation if you can acknowledge other views exist.

"
Tell a story.,
Include videos.,
Use other props.,
Don’t do it alone.,
Give your audience the opportunity to move around.,
Call on people.,
Invite other students to answer questions.,
Set aside time for interaction.",How to Create Interactive Presentations to Impress Students3," There’s a reason most of us enjoyed story time more than any other school activity, and you can use this appeal to create an awesome interactive presentation. Storytelling captures your audience’s attention, leaves them wondering what will happen next, and helps them retain the information. Apply these tips to tell a good story during your presentation:Public-speaking experts recommend opening your story by appealing to what people know or think they know about a specific topic. This helps establish rapport with your audience. Then, prompt the audience to reconsider what they thought they knew by questioning the status quo. For example, what if what we thought about something was wrong, or what if there was something else going on? Keep exploring this dichotomy during your presentation, which builds suspense and keeps students on the edge of their seats waiting for resolution to the question.
Make sure you have a powerful ending to your story that encourages or inspires your audience to continue thinking about the presentation and the questions you raised. Point out the benefits or possibilities of this new way of thinking, and suggest what still needs to be considered.

, Videos are an excellent way to make your presentation more interactive because you can use the video to encourage discussion, elicit a response from students, and set the right mood for your presentation.Look for a video or clip that emphasizes a point you would like to make or that you feel gets the audience in the right mindset to discuss a topic. Videos can also be helpful if there’s a feeling, emotion, or sentiment that’s difficult to convey while standing in front of a group of students.
Using a video during your presentation also gives you a few minutes to compose your thoughts, and takes away some of the pressure on you as the presenter.
Before playing the video, ask students to keep a few questions in mind or pay attention to something specific such as the language, scenery, or other aspect of the video so they are prepared for the discussion you want to have afterward.

, While videos can help you design a more interactive presentation that will impress students, don’t forget about other potential props you can use to engage with and maintain your audience’s focus. Although the props you will use depends on the subject of your presentation, here are a few general recommendations to help your audience visualize what you are discussing:Photographs.
Pieces of art or artifacts.
Advertisements.
3-D models or figures.
If you decide to make use of props, be sure to talk about these and refer to them during your presentation. For example, simply displaying a photograph on a slide won’t have the same impact as actually discussing the photograph. Try asking audience members questions about what they see and notice about the photograph.

, An easy way to make your presentation interactive is to invite other people to participate and demonstrate a point.Ask an audience member to come up on stage or to the front of the classroom and have them join you in an activity or assist you with some aspect of your presentation. Make sure you thank them in front of the audience and express your appreciation for their help.
It can be helpful to ask for a volunteer before the presentation starts so you aren’t putting people on the spot. This way, you will also have time to explain what you want the volunteer to do and make sure they aren’t surprised or uncomfortable. Selecting a volunteer before the presentation will save you time and make sure it flows smoothly.
Think about whether there might be a guest speaker or someone who could address a specific topic better than you or in a more engaging manner. If you are preparing this presentation for a class, it’s a good idea to check with your teacher first to make sure they are okay with you inviting a guest speaker or participant.

, We usually associate presentations with a watchful, quiet, and still audience, but research suggests that our minds quickly wander and we can be easily distracted while watching presentations. Keep this in mind, and give your audience the opportunity to move around under your direction.When you ask students a question, for example, request they show their hands to answer yes or no. You could also ask your audience to respond to a question by sitting or standing.
Design an activity that requires students to split into small groups or move around the room. This will help refocus their attention on the matter at hand and your presentation.

, If students will not volunteer to participate or you want their input and interaction at a specific point, don't be afraid to call on people and request their help.Calling on students by name helps establish a rapport with your audience and may make them more comfortable sharing. If you don’t know their names, you can start out by asking a student to identify themselves before answering the question. It can be effective to call on students who seem more extroverted at first, and then ask more reserved students later in your presentation.
Remember, even if their response is not what you expected or is incorrect, make sure you acknowledge their contribution and do not demean the student.

, If a student asks a question or makes a comment during a presentation, you can encourage further interaction by asking other students to answer the question or follow up on the comment.It can be helpful for the person giving the presentation to restate the question or comment when asking for audience input.
Remember, the audience will follow your lead, so make sure you are polite and not dismissive of any questions or comments. You don’t want students to be rude to one another.

, Instead of hoping that students will interact with you and the material during the presentation, set aside specific time for interaction. Here are some ideas for interactive opportunities:


Ask the audience to break up into small groups and briefly discuss a specific concept, topic, or question related to the presentation. Then, come back together and invite the groups to share their thoughts with the rest of the students.
If you are looking at an image, referring to a reading, or using a map, ask students what they see rather than telling them how to interpret the material. This will ensure there is more discussion and conversation.
Ask students to prepare a few discussion questions prior to the presentation. This makes sure everyone has thought about the material and is ready to take part in the presentation.

"
"
Provide your audience with additional resources.,
Leave time for questions.,
Ask students to complete a one-minute paper.,
Invite feedback from the audience.,
Compliment your audience.",How to Create Interactive Presentations to Impress Students4," While the presentation might be drawing to a close, your audience may still want additional information. Provide students with suggestions about how they can continue the conversation or pursue independent research.For example, are there articles, books, or websites you would recommend on a specific topic? Are there other presentations or lectures you could encourage them to attend?

, Although your time might be limited, be sure to set aside time at the end of your presentation to answer questions. Giving the floor to students will make them feel empowered and engaged, and your presentation will be a more interactive and impressive one.If you run out of time, you can always ask students to write down their questions and hand them to you or email them.

, When the presentation is over, ask students to take one minute and write down what they believe to be the main point of the presentation. Also, ask them to identify a question they still have about the presentation or material.Students will probably be more comfortable and honest if this is anonymous.
This exercise will give you invaluable information about what your audience understands or doesn’t understand about the material you presented. Then, you can make changes to improve and refine your next presentation.
If you will see the same group again in the near future, you can discuss these comments and questions next time.

, Although you might be finishing up your presentation, you can still provide students with an opportunity to interact by asking them to provide anonymous feedback on the presentation or material. This demonstrates that you are committed to making the presentation even better, and the students feel like their input matters.Distribute notecards or a survey that students can complete. You could also provide a link to an online survey.

, Although you might be completing one presentation, you will probably have to do another in the near future. It’s important to compliment your audience so they feel appreciated and will be more willing to participate and interact in future presentations.For example, thank the group for being a great audience and raising excellent questions.

Relax!",How to Learn to Speak Afrikaans," Afrikaans is a young Germanic language which has a much simpler grammar than English and Dutch. It is not only spoken by (77% of all) coloured and (58% of all) white people in South Africa, but also 11 different cultural groups speak Afrikaans as a home, second or third language. Today, the Flemish, Dutch, Germans, Anglophonic peoples, Swedes and even Polish and Russians are rather keen to get in touch with what is known as the simplest Germanic language in the world.;
, Because Afrikaans sounds quite guttural, it is also the perfect language to swear in! Lots of South Africans use it for this purpose only! Which is kind of sad, but it is certainly a very expressive language in other words. However, if the user are interested in learning Dutch, Afrikaans makes an excellent basic stepping stone.

, Which means ""good morning"". Nobody says that anymore. It is old-fashioned. When we greet someone we just say ""Hallo"" or ""Hi"" or something similar like ""môre"" which means ""morning"". Afrikaans has been influenced a lot by English.

, The ""Hoe"" is pronounced like ""who"" in English and means ""how"". The 'g' sound in the beginning of ""gaan"" is made in the back of the throat. That is the hardest sound in Afrikaans. In order to pronounce this letter, make like a car that suddenly hits the brakes on a gravel road. A scratchy sound, like if you've got something stuck in your throat and want to get it out. after you think you've got it try the whole word: ""gaan"". The 'aan' part is pronounced like ""on"" in English. ""gaan"" means ""goes"" and can be used in all tenses which will often require a prefix or suffix. Finally the word ""dit"" which means ""it"" in English. ""dit"" is pronounced like the first syllable in the urban word ""ditto"" so it's ""dit""//""to"" but only the first part. Also the 'i' is pronounced ""uh"". Finally say the three words in sequence: Hoe Gaan Dit? Which if directly translated into english would basically mean ""How Goes It?"" there you have it.

, The thicker the volume, the better. English-Afrikaans, Nederlands-Afrikaans (better known as ANNA) and Deutsch-Afrikaans bilingual dictionaries are already available. Trilingual dictionaries for African languages-Afrikaans are also available, though not very extensive.

, It is important to know idiomatic expressions, otherwise you won’t grasp the humor. Luckily though, if you know Dutch, or know a few Dutch expressions, most idiomatic expressions will be comprehensible. Also, especially nowadays, people directly translate English proverbs.

, You should listen to Afrikaans more often. To give you some idea how an Afrikaans accent sounds like, visit http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoofstad on the Afrikaans Wikipedia, click on the speaker and read along . In this way, you can read and listen to the article simultaneously. As you would listen to Radio Nederland Wereldomroep just to get familiar with the Algemeenbeschaafde Dutch accent – use Radio Sonder Grense (RSG) for Afrikaans. At the homepage, place the cursor on Luister, and then Luister Weer. Click Luister Weer. You may select any program that you think you will like (e.g. Die tale wat ons praat), ignore Sleutelwoord and Datums; click on and click LAAI AF at any particular day’s topic you want. After the sound file has been downloaded, you may listen for ± half an hour, at your own leisure, how Afrikaans words are pronounced. Afrikaans is a fast language, which is why you should be able to replay the podcast.

, The Afrikaans community is fueled by humor. Most of it are puns (using Afrikaans idiomatic expressions and words), irony, rhyme, similes, metaphors, exaggerations, understatements and innuendos. If the Afrikaans speaking people start giggling or laughing when you speak Afrikaans, don’t take it personally or seriously at all – if you are a male, your voice tone might sound rather feminine (many don’t articulate deep and raspy enough from the throat, but speak softly from the front of their mouths) or very awkward. If you are female, you probably used the wrong expressions. You’ll get the hang of it. Just keep on practicing.

, South Africa and Namibia are sunny countries. Biometeorology and psychology has the theory that the amount of sun exposure has an influence on human behaviour. In parallel with other sunny Mediterranean South European and South American peoples, Afrikaans speaking people are much, much less reserved and much more talkative, emotional and interactive than Northern Europeans. If they are happy, shocked, sad, frustrated, passionate or overjoyed, the facial expression, voice tone, body language and hand gestures tells it all. To show emotion is not a weakness, it shows you are human – and is therefore a virtue. They’re not living in the science-fiction film, Equilibrium.

, When it comes to gender, Afrikaans and the Afrikaans culture (like most other African cultures) has always been patriarchal. Some argue that the Afrikaans culture is fundamentally based on religion, while others argue that the lack of First World infrastructure and education cannot sustain acculturation to First World countries; which also includes social equality. Men have their traditional gender roles, and so do women. Respect it. In modern South Africa, there are but a few Afrikaans speaking feminists who want to change the image of Afrikaans culture, though most Afrikaans speaking women (especially those inside a marriage) complain: Vandag se mans is regtig pap! Waarom moet ’n vrou altyd die broek in die huis dra? (Today’s men are utterly sloppy and pathetic! Why should a woman always wear the trousers at home? .) Keep this in mind when speaking.
Afrikaans doesn’t have any gender for a neutral object, such as a table, ship or car; just like English. Die/ dit is used: Die motor wil nie vat nie. Dit werk nie. .
However, if a gender must be added towards, say, a ship, car or table, it is always masculine. Jy moet die tafel vernis / motor was / skip laat nasien, hy lyk verwaarloos. (You must varnish the table / wash the car / service the ship, he looks dilapidated.)
Any animal of which the sex is unknown, is always masculine; an animal is not an “it”. “Daardie hond daar oorkant– het hy hondsdolheid?” Don’t ever call someone on their first name, unless permitted to do so.
If a minor calls you oom or tannie , accept it with gratitude. It is a form of respect. This title is usually given to someone who is 10 years older + than they are.
In a business environment, the title comes first, followed by the surname. If you don’t know a woman’s marital status, just use dame (Madam). The register is formal at the first meeting, but may become more informal as the business partners build a better working relationship.
Important – Don’t use jy en jou (informal you) to someone much older than you are. It is very disrespectful and the person will most likely take it as an offensive gesture, for the two of you are not from the same age group(Note1). In this case, try not to use any pronouns at all, or use u (formal you).
(Note1) In Europe and other First World Continents, there are less youth than elderly people. Therefore age egalitarianism is being utilized (as the youth are the odd ones out). In South Africa and other Third World Countries, there are less elderly people than youth. Therefore, the hierarchal pyramid persists (as the elderly people are the odd ones out).

,, In this way, you will also get in contact with the different Afrikaans dialects.

,, Latinized words also sound long (having too much syllables) and dreary. Rather use short Germanic words and short sentences instead. Words that the typical man on the street will understand. For example, don’t use offisieel (official) instead of amptelik, like in Afrikaans is ’n amptelike taal van Suid-Afrika. (Afrikaans is an official language of South Africa). For a list for some of these words, go to: http://af.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lys_van_minder_suiwer_Afrikaanse_woorde . Difficult for the English and Romance language speaker? Sure do. But wait, there’s another way out…

, What?! Yes! After all, you’re probably not going to be a news reader or television personality. Perhaps an Afrikaans rock star... Afrikaans people use English words to lubricate a sentence (make it speak more fluently and faster), or if an Afrikaans equivalent term doesn’t pop up that quickly. There is a difference between formal office/document language and the informal conversation language (diglossia). So, feel free. Most Afrikaans speakers will notice you are not familiar with their language and won’t bite your head off. There are only a few cases of purists-extremists; but they are only one in every ten thousand.

, If the Afrikaans speakers notice that you are struggling with Afrikaans, they will automatically switch to English (or maybe an African language you might know) – they are only trying to accommodate you. But you have to put your foot down and demand Afrikaans. Otherwise, you’ll never learn through trial and error. They’ll gladly help you.

, A large number of lyrics of popular songs are available on the Net and some of the contemporary artists’ music videos are played on YouTube. On the sites you can also search for Kurt Darren, Snotkop, Steve Hofmeyr, Juanita du Plessis, Nicholis Louw, Sorina Erasmus, Chrizaan, Bobby van Jaarsveld, Chris Chameleon, Ray Dylan, Bok van Blerk, Emo Adams, Arno Jordaan, Gerhard Steyn and Robbie Wessels, Jay, Eden etc. Some of the other modern individuals and groups are Jack Parow, Fokofpolisiekar, Die Antwoord, Die Heuwels Fantasties, Glaskas, Die Tuindwergies etc. Since the early 2000s it seems as though everyone has literally jumped on the bandwagon. Every week a new Afrikaans artist arrives on the scene; and the Afrikaans music industry caters for almost every genre, but most prominently the rock genre. The reason for this fertile ground is because Internet piracy of Afrikaans music is particularly very low, and, therefore, gives the artists the chance of making money.

, Before television in 1976, the World Wide Web in 1995, MXit in 2005 (a cellular phone chat application) and especially Facebook, people either went to the theatres, cinemas (alias bioskoop) participate in sports or read books. There was a boom of books especially from the 1950s – 1970s, but interest declined onwards as time progressed. The best sellers today are recipe books and Christian literature, followed by romantic fiction, detective stories, autobiographies and poetry. Schools are the major stimulators of the children’s literature book market, mainly because prescribed books for the curriculum are being purchased. Because it is rather pricey (and risky) today being an author in Afrikaans, most aspirant authors test their skills on Woes.co.za. Have a look over there.

, http://afrikaans.news24.com/; Die Burger.com (for Cape Provinces); Volksblad.com (for Free State) and Beeld.com (covers the earlier Transvaal) has all the latest South African and international news in Afrikaans. Republikeinonline.com.na has all the latest Namibian and international news in Afrikaans. Though it should be added that newspapers tend to be bugged by language errors, clichés, jargon and Anglicism, it’s a good way of picking up neologisms and to get in closer contact with the Afrikaans speaking community.

,, From January 2010 Roepman, Jakhalsdans, Ek lief jou, Ek joke net, Die Ongelooflike Avonture van Hanna Hoekom, Liefling, Getroud met Rugby and Platteland has been released. English subtitles included. Important: Though most of the films’ setting are in rural places (such a cliché!), don't be fooled: the Afrikaans community are well urbanized.

, Get streetwise at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_South_African_slang_words

, Other than the anti-egalitarianism issue, the Afrikaans community is not fastidious about choice of words and are constantly simplifying the rules. Enjoy!

If you live in Wales, there is a great chance that you are able to visit a Learn Welsh class, as the Welsh Government is trying to promote Welsh as a language.,
For distance learners, there is a great deal of resources available to purchase online - from the inexpensive to the very costly.,
If you wish to do a Welsh course, the Open University have recently begun a Welsh language program, though this may be too costly at £400 for some learners who wish to learn solely for interest.,
Many Welsh words are similar to English, but the pronunciation is a little different.,
The Welsh alphabet is also slightly different- there is no j, k, q, v, x or z.,
Don't forget- there are very few Welsh people who don't speak English, so don't be afraid to ask for help on pronunciation or vocabulary!",How to Learn Welsh," Try listening online to the BBC's Radio Cymru available online (only to UK users due to license funding) to the people talking.;
, Visit them at the site listed below for more information on this.

, Start trying for free on the BBC's Big Welsh Challenge which isn't restricted viewing, and progress to CD learning from companies such as Talk Now!, World Talk and languages for Beginners. All of these are available on Amazon by searching simply ""Learn Welsh"". You may also want to consider a new approach to language learning through a programs such as Cadw Swn who use music to stimulate the brain whilst listening to the language.

, It is unlikely that there are other courses available elsewhere in the world, though Wales does provide numerous courses.

, For example, to say hello, the Welsh is 'Helo' ., Instead there are letters like ch, dd, ll, ng, etc. To pick up the pronunciation of these, it is best to listen to Welsh speakers., Welsh people like it when people make an effort to learn the language.

If living in Wales try starting conversations with helo (hello). Try saying os gwelwch yn dda (please), diolch (Thank you) and hwyl fawr (goodbye).

Develop specific scales for language competence.,
Attach skills to points of the established scale.,
Test all of the relevant skills for language acquisition or competence.,
Document the results of tests that measure these core areas.",How to Measure Language Competence," Because the idea of developing language skills in a certain language is so subjective, it's usually necessary for the instructor or other person who is measuring language skill to set up an arbitrary, but very important, quantitative scale.


Attach numbers to your language competence scale. Many individuals will start with a simple scale from 1 to 10. This is a starting point for identifying and using the kinds of criteria you need to measure language competence in a person or group of people.;
, Those who will be assessing language skills can attach specific language goals or points of language technique to each number in the scale.


Approach issues of basic to advanced syntax and language structure. For example, at the low end of the scale might be ""rote phrases"" that beginners learn first, usually consisting of salutations, basic information utilizing simple verb tenses and more. Higher up on the scale might be advanced verb tenses and conjugations, along with other syntactical structures like question and response.
Attach vocabulary to specific scale points. Vocabulary is also something that provides an important variable for language competence. Higher points on the scale might correspond to certain vocabulary acquisition.

, Most of the established language tests assess 4 areas of accomplishment: reading, listening, speaking and writing. All of these have their own goals and objectives, as well as their own skills and challenges. Make sure the test that measures language competence is weighted to include all 4 appropriately.

, Instructors will need to know how to score each test in order to apply it to the scale mentioned above.

Differentiate between goals and objectives.,
Familiarize yourself with Bloom's Taxonomy.,
Learn the characteristics that communicate your intent.,
Write stem statements.,
Select the proper verb.,
Determine the outcome.,
Put it all together.,
Make sure your objectives are SMART.,
Evaluate whether objectives are being met.,
Revise your objectives if necessary.",How to Write an Educational Objective," Objectives and goals are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably, but there is a distinct difference between educational objectives and educational goals. Make sure you understand this difference before attempting to write your objective.


Goals are broad and often difficult to measure in an objective sense. They tend to focus on big picture issues. For example, in a college class on child psychology, a goal might be ""Students will learn to appreciate the need for clinical training when dealing with small children."" While such a goal would obviously inform the more specific educational objectives, it is not specific enough to be an objective itself.Educational objectives are much more specific. They include measurable verbs and criteria for acceptable performance or proficiency regarding a particular subject. For example, ""By the end of this unit, students will be able to identify three theorists whose work on child psychology influenced teaching practices in the US."" This is a more specific educational objective, based on the educational for the same hypothetical course.;
, In 1956, educational psychologist Benjamin Bloom created a framework to classify different types of learning, as well as a hierarchy illustrating different levels of learning. Bloom's Taxonomy is usually used when writing educational objectives.Bloom identified three domains of learning. The cognitive domain is the domain given the most focus in the world of higher education. Cognitive is the domain used for guidance when writing educational objectives. The cognitive domain focuses on intellectual, scholarly learning and is divided into a hierarchy consisting of six levels.The first level is knowledge, which is the ability to memorize, recite, and recall previously learned materials.Example: Memorizing multiplication tables.
Example: Recalling when the Battle of Hastings occured.


The second level is comprehension. This means taking the facts you know and demonstrating your understanding through organizing, interpreting, translating, or comparing said facts.Example: Translating a Japanese sentence into German.
Example: Explaining why nuclear technology affected President Reagan's political policies.


The third level is application. This means solving problems by applying your knowledge to a variety of situations.Example: Using pi to solve various mathematical problems.
Example: Using ""please"" to ask for things politely not just with Mom, but other people.


The fourth level is analysis. This means taking the facts you learned and reexamining them so you are able to understand why they are true. You are also expected to find evidence to support new claims or inferences you make during your education.Example: Understanding the concept of ""fate"" as a predetermined destiny.
Example: A ball thrown on the ground falls, a rock thrown on the ground falls...but what happens if they are thrown into water?


The fifth level is synthesis. This means organizing information in a new way and discovering new patterns or alternative ideas, solutions, or theories.Example: Creating a painting.
Example: Putting forth a new idea about subatomic particles.


The sixth level is evaluation. This means gaining the ability to present and defend information and make informed judgments about the opinions of others on a given subject.Example: Creating a short film humanizing immigrants in your community with commentary on why you believe they deserve respect.
Example: Writing an essay on why you believe Hamlet really did not love Ophelia.



, When writing an educational objective, there are three characteristics that you need to focus on. These help you effectively communicate the intent of your class and teaching style.


Performance is the first characteristic. An object should always state what your students are expected to be able to do by the end of a unit or class.Condition is the second characteristic. A good educational objective will outline the conditions under which a student is supposed to perform said task.Criterion, the third characteristic, outlines how well a student must perform. That is, the specific expectations that need to be met for their performance to be passing.For example, say you are teaching a nursing class. A good educational objective would be ""By the end of this course, students will be able to draw blood, in typical hospital settings, within a 2 to 3 minute timeframe."" This outlines the performance, drawing blood, the conditions, typical hospital settings, and the criterion, the task being performed in 2 to 3 minutes.

, A stem statement should outline the performance expected of a student. You should use measurable verbs to form your stem statement.


Your stem statement should begin by referencing the class or lesson. For example, ""After this course, students will..."" ""After completing this lesson, students are expected to...""

Example: After completing this lesson, students are expected to be able to write a paragraph using a topic sentence.
Example: After completing this lesson, students are expected to be able to identify three farm animals.


Your stem statement outlines the duration of time your students need to have mastered a certain skill. If you're writing an educational objective for a particular lesson, specify that lesson in the objective rather than writing something like ""By the end of this course..."" Instead, opt for, ""By the end of today's lecture...""

Example: By midterm, all students should be able to count to 20.
Example: At the end of the workshop, students should produce a haiku.



, The verbs you use are contingent on which level of learning in Bloom's taxonomy you're conveying. You should write a variety of educational objectives that all speak to differing levels of Bloom's Taxonomy.


For knowledge, go for words like list, recite, define, and name.For comprehension, words like describe, explain, paraphrase, and restate are ideal.Application objectives should include verbs like calculate, predict, illustrate, and apply.For analysis, go for terms like categorize, analyze, diagram, and illustrate.For synthesis, use words like design, formulate, build, invent, and create.For evaluation, try terms like choose, relate, contrast, argue, and support., The outcome is where you really get to the performance, condition, and criterion. You are expressing what the students are expected to do at the end of a course or lesson.


What performance do you expect? Do students simply need to list or name something? Should they understand how to perform a task?
Where and when will they carry out this performance? Is this for a classroom setting alone or do they need to perform in a clinical, real world environment?
What are the criteria you're using to evaluate your student? What would be considered a passing grade or an appropriate performance?

, Once you've laid out the stem statement, chosen your verb, and identified the outcome, put it all together to form an educational objective.


Say you're teaching a high school English class and, for one lesson, you're teaching symbolism. A good educational objective would be, ""By the end of this lesson, students should be able to analyze the symbolism in a given passage of literature and interpret the work's meaning in their own words.""
The stem statement identifies that the objective should be met by the end of the lesson.
The verbs used are comprehension verbs, indicating this task falls under the second level of Bloom's hierarchy of learning.
The expected performance is literary analysis. The condition is, presumably, that the reading be done alone. The expected outcome is that the student will be able to read a work, analyze it, and explain it in her own words.

, You can make sure your objectives work by measuring them against the criteria outlined in the acrostic SMART.


S stands for specific. Do your learning objectives outline skills that you are able to measure? If they're too broad, you might want to revamp them.M stands for measurable. Your objectives should be able to be measured in classroom setting, through testing or observed performances.A stands for action-oriented. All educational objectives should include action verbs that call for the performance of a specific task.R stands for reasonable. Make sure your learning objectives reflect realistic expectations of your students given the timeframe of your course. For example, you can't expect students to learn something like CPR by the end of a week-long unit.T stands for time-bound. All educational objectives should outline a specific timeframe they need to be met by., Solid educational objectives can help you stay on task as a teacher. Periodically review your course to make sure your students are meeting your objectives.


Obviously, tests, papers, exams, and quizzes throughout the semester effectively measure if educational objectives are being met. If one students seem to be struggling with an objective, it might be an issue of that individual's performance. If every student seems to struggle, however, you may not be effectively relaying the information.
Give your students questionnaires and surveys in class, asking them how they feel about their own knowledge of a given subject. Tell them to be honest about what you're doing right and wrong as a teacher., Educational objectives are important. Many educators return to them during a semester if students seem to be slipping. If you're having any issues with teaching, return to your objects and review them carefully. See how they might be revised in a way that would allow you to be a better teacher.

Learn the phonological basics: Due to the fact that Sistanian is a phonetic language, its phonological system is significantly different from Persian and Arabic languages and mostly shares many features with the historic Indo-European languages.,
Understand the Sistanian writing system: Based on Latin or Arabic alphabet, there are two main writing systems which are considered for writing in Sistanian.,
Learn the basic conversational phrases: Learning the basics of common conversational phrases in Sistanian, enables us to interact with Sistanian-speakers on a simple level .,
Enlarge your Sistanian vocabulary: Memorizing most common words is crucial for learning any new language.",How to Learn the Sistanian Language,"


Non-Persian learners may consider this language like a dialect of Italian language when listening to it. Note that like Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese) in Sistanian the “h” sound is not pronounced.
The “zh” sound (ʒ in International Phonetic Alphabet) is rare and “r” is commonly thrilled. This language is also rich in consonant doubling.;
,


Although the Arabic is strongly recommended by the Foundation for Sistanian Orthography Development, it would be confusing for learners unfamiliar with this writing system, as a result the Latin alphabet is preferred here.
Doubling consonants shows the stress and putting apostrophe after vowels indicates long sounds. “aa” illustrates /ʌ/. Consider the following examples:

Aunt = Khla’ka /xla:ka/
Sister = da’da /da:da/
Worn (clothing) = latta /latta/
Overcrowded = me’da /me:da/
Gipsy = challi /tʃallɪ/
Skinny = chi’laask /tʃɪ:lʌsk/



,


Hello = salaam
How you doing? = shtori?
Feel alright? = vakashi? / zabri? / tiaari?
O, yea! = o, jo!
You serious? = se’ ko? / tra vallaa?
Never mind! = va balaa’e to!
Never ever! = araam sho!
What’s the news? = chekhvar?
All fine = var qaraar
Watch out! = orma’t!
Thanks a lot = nadreto / khe’raatto
Get up! = vakhe!
Hurry up! = bijji! / ala!
What is going on here? = chkaara?
I love you = delme baale’ tra
Leave me off! = mna sa’r de!
You're welcome in my house: khone-me pow-andaaze shma
Don't forget!: osh nakni!
I want to... : va nzare mna ke...

Be aware that, like for any other language, Sesotho requires you to hear it in order to learn it.,
Realize early on that Sesotho is probably not like any language you've learned before.,
Use the Internet to listen to model sentences and to do quizzes (see links below).

,
Use a dictionary as often as possible.,
Find a Mosotho who would like to learn your language, and exchange with them through chat, email and telephoning.

,
There's a large body of written Sesotho on the Internet.,
Use flash cards or a phrase book to revise recently acquired phrases and words.,
Remember new words by means of mnemonics, jokes and genuine emotions.,
Wherever you may be, there is probably a Lesotho or South African embassy nearby.",How to Learn Sesotho," Visit the country or listen to Radio Lesotho as often as possible;
, Never try to compare a language you're learning with one you already speak.

,, There are at least three good ones online.

,, Find it and read as much as possible. You won't understand much at the beginning, but it's the little that you will understand that counts. Build on it. You're not trying to learn the grammar of Sesotho, you're trying to learn how to speak Sesotho. Remember that.

, Revision is very important, especially if you're learning Sesotho outside Lesotho or South Africa.

, Do not memorise words out of their context. For example, do not memorise ""ho rata"" as the verb ""to love;"" rather learn ""ho rata"" by practising with the sentence, ""Ke rata Odile,"" or ""I love Odile,"" or Jack, or Jill.

, Visit them and ask them what help they can give you in your noble endeavour. If they haven't got help, ask them why they aren't interested in people learning Sesotho.

Practice.,
Divide the words into parts.,
Pronounce hard: Basically in Tamil letters are pronounced hard.

,
Twist your tongue: In order learn Tamil letters and words you must be able twist the tongue according to the sound of some hard letter like ழ-zha,ங-inga and ஞ-gna.

,
Keep in mind that there are no exactly sounding letters in English for Tamil.,
Know similar sounding words: Some letters in Tamil have similar sounds but one soft and the other is hard.,
Try learning from a Tamil teacher: It is better practice to learn difficult letters.,
Don't give up.",How to Learn Tamil Alphabets," You may find that some other people speak the language perfectly, but nothing ever comes easy. Practice whenever you can! On your way to work, at school, when you're on wikiHow...;
, For example, if you want to say 'hello', the word is வணக்கம், or vanakkam. To get the pronunciation correctly, try saying the word like this: vann-ak-kum

,,, For example, the sound of 'ழ' is not found in any language.

, For example,letters ர்-ற் has the sound 'ir' but the ‘ர்’ is pronounced soft while the letter 'ற்’ is pronounced hard.

, But you can also learn from Tamil learning CDs and DVDs too.

, It would be difficult to master the language, but that doesn't mean you should give up! Progress slowly. Practice for a certain amount of time each day (i.e., 15 minutes), increasing the amount of time each day.

Read Leo Rosten's The Joys of Yiddish.,
Read about Yiddish.,
Learn the Hebrew alphabet.,
Inquire about Yiddish classes at your local Jewish Community Centre.,
Study basic German, Hebrew, and Aramaic.,
Subscribe to the Yiddish Book Center.,
Immerse yourself in Yiddish and Jewish culture.",How to Learn Yiddish," This book is widely available at book shops across Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom and from online retailers. It introduces the reader to the Yiddish language through a rich collection of words, expressions, and concepts that have become commonplace in the speech of native American English speakers, giving wonderful insight into the biology and indentity of Yiddish and being Yiddish.


Salt and pepper your daily English with the Yiddish you've learned from Rosten's book. This won't guarantee you fluency, but it will get the language running through your veins.;
, In addition to Rosten's book, there are a diverse array of books in English written by linguists, anthropologists, scholars, travel writers, translators, biographers, and laypersons (among others) about Yiddish language and Yiddish culture. Some titles include:



Outwitting History: The Adventures of a Man Who Rescued a Million Yiddish Books, by Aaron Lansky

Born to Kvetch, by Michael Wex

Adventures in Yiddishland: Postvernacular Language & Culture, by Jeffrey Shandler

Yiddish with Dick and Jane, by Ellis Weiner

, Yiddish, like other Jewish languages, is written using the Hebrew alphabet. Learning how to distinguish your Alephs from your Bets will open you into the realm of Yiddish writing, an ocean as infinite as the Pacific.

, In the face of a long and painful period of decline, Yiddish is experiencing a resurgence in interest from both Jews and non-Jews alike. Many Jewish Community Centres are thus offering seasonal Yiddish language courses and intensive programs as well as an array of Yiddish-related cultural projects such as Yiddish drama and theatre camps. Hunt around, do your homework, and find what suits you.


A handful of universities and colleges worldwide also offer Yiddish programs through their Jewish Studies and Hebrew departments. Take a look.

, As mentioned above, Yiddish is a Germanic language with heavy Semitic overtones. If your goal is fluency, you will need to understand the nature of German, Hebrew, and Aramaic at one point or another to grasp the finer points of Yiddish.


Check your local libraries and book shops for materials on those languages or even consider a Rosetta Stone Set.

, Yiddish at one point lived and breathed through books---a thriving literary and intellectual culture that was almost completely silenced at the hands of the Holocaust. Works of philosophy, literary criticism, technical manuals, novels, poetry, translations of Western literature and popular pulp fiction, dictionaries, you name it. However, beginning in the 1980s, Aaron Lansky (the author of Outwitting History) set out to collect the world's Yiddish books, catalogue them, house them, study them, and translate them, thus leading to founding The Yiddish Book Center. By subscribing to the Yiddish Book Centre, you are supporting, preserving, and promoting Yiddish.

, Although Yiddish is not as widely spoken a language as say English, French, Arabic, or Chinese, the language does still live and breathe in the nooks and crannies of Jewish communities around the world. If you have access to such, embrace it! Attend Jewish and Yiddish events, check out Jewish community libraries, watch old Yiddish films on YouTube, and explore what's out there---adpot Yiddish and become part of Yiddish.

Learn essential vocabulary.,
Learn the Serbian alphabet.,
Keep it relevant.,
Learn the phrase for “How do you say_____ in Serbian?” This is a crucial phrase to learn when you begin practicing Serbian.,
Be patient with yourself.",How to Learn Serbian1," The very first step to learning any new language is practicing some key words. This you will introduce you to Serbian pronunciation, and give you the ability to make basic small talk in Serbian.Here are some key words to start with:


Hello - Zdravo.
Goodbye - Dovidjenja.
Yes - Da.
No - Ne.
Thank you - Hvala.
Sorry - Pardon.
Please - Molim.;
, The Serbian alphabet is quite different from the English one. Familiarize yourself with this alphabet and the way each letter is pronounced. Once you have a grasp on the alphabet, you will be able to sound out new Serbian words.Some letters, such as Č,Š,Ć,Ž,Đ,Lj, may be tricky for you.
The letter Č is similar to CH (chair, chain, chocolate).
The letter Š is similar to SH (shampoo, shower, shop).

, After you have a handle on some key words, begin learning relevant phrases and sentences. In the beginning, limit your study to phrases that you will actually need to use in conversation.How are you? - Kako ste?
What is your name? - Kako se zoveš?
How old are you? - Koliko imaš godina?
Where are you from? - Odakle si?
I am from _____ - Ja sam iz _____.
Good morning. - Dobro jutro.

Make flashcards.,
Think like a baby.,
Practice with someone.,
Talk to someone via the internet.,
Talk to yourself.,
Keep a journal.",How to Learn Serbian2," In order to build up a Serbian vocabulary, you need to do more than merely encounter Serbian words. You will need to memorize them. Create flashcards of common words. Practice with your flashcards until you have a strong grasp on the terms.Begin with 10 common words.
It may help to include a phonetic pronunciation guide for yourself on each card.

, Babies are excellent at learning new languages because they are not too embarrassed to babble and verbalize new sounds. You can also sharpen your basic Serbian skills by using the same resources a baby would use.Practice short, simple words.
Look for baby books or baby toys that help Serbian kids learn to speak.
Don’t worry about perfect pronunciation or grammar. These skills will come in time.

, The absolute best way to learn Serbian is to speak with someone who speaks the language. Ideally, your conversation partner will be a native speaker, but anybody with a decent grasp on the language will do. Practicing out loud will reinforce the skills you have already learned, while encouraging you to build new sentences out of the words you know., If you can’t find an in-person partner to practice Serbian with, find someone online. You can use foreign language forums, or social media to find friends who speak Serbian. Then use a video chatting platform to meet up virtually., If you still can’t find anybody to talk to, you can always speak to yourself! Speaking out loud has a profound effect on your memory, so practice your Serbian any time you can. Speaking to yourself can keep Serbian words and phrases fresh in your mind, and this practice can build up your skills for the next time you can speak with someone else., Start a notebook for your new language journey. This is an excellent place to record new vocabulary words and phrases, and to keep track of your progress. But most importantly, this is a great place to practice your growing Serbian language skills. By writing in Serbian by hand, you will be accessing a different part of the brain, thereby solidifying your understanding and memorization of the Serbian language."

Watch Television in Serbian.,
Read.,
Listen to Serbian music with lyrics.,
Find an immersive environment.,
Watch people talk.",How to Learn Serbian3," Watching television or movies in Serbian can be a good way to encounter new terms and familiarize yourself with the sound of the Serbian language. Look for movies with English subtitles so that you can passively absorb new Serbian vocabulary., Try to get your hands on Serbian books or a Serbian newspaper. Just as with television, this will expose you to a whole host of new words and phrases. But unlike watching TV, reading is not passive. By trying to read in Serbian you will engage deeply with this new language and fortify your skills., Another more passive form of language exposure is to listen to Serbian music with lyrics. Listening to particularly catchy or repetitive songs can help you to memorize words or phrases. Seek out popular Serbian music or even songs intended for kids., The most effective way to learn a new language is total immersion. An immersive Serbian environment will force you to leave English behind for a little while and rely on what Serbian you know. Are there any Serbian clubs or meet-ups in your area? (College campuses can be good places for such things). A Serbian restaurant can also suffice., Speaking Serbian requires you to use your tongue and mouth in different ways than you may be used to. When someone speaks to you in Serbian, pay close attention to their mouth. This will give you a visual sense of how to pronounce new words."

Find a Romanian teacher with a fluent level of English or of your native language.,
Get accustomed to the Romanian alphabet and pronunciation.,
Get accustomed to the Romanian specific characters: ""ă""; ""î"" or ""â"" (both sound the same), ""ş"", and ""ţ"".,
Buy a Romanian course-book, that provides you with some texts and lists of words and their translation.,
Learn some basic words and sentences in Romanian.,
Move on to simple sentences, like saying your name, age, and nationality.,
Using the dictionaries, learn 20 new Romanian words a week.,
Learn Romanian grammar.",How to Learn Romanian," The other way round (someone who speaks your native language as a mother tongue and has a high level of Romanian) is pretty unlikely (unless you are Hungarian, maybe), as Romanian is not spoken worldwide; besides, a teacher is a must, because Romanian grammar is very difficult to grasp, even for native speakers.;
, In Romanian, words are spelled just like they're written. Check the table at Wikipedia for more info.


Careful how you place the stress on syllables. It's quite tricky. Getting a English-to-Romanian dictionary and looking up some words just to see how the stress falls on syllables is very helpful.

, Practice reading them properly in texts.


""ă"" is pronounced /ə/, like the ending of flower, pronounced with a British accent;
""î"" or ""â"" both correspond to the sound /ɨ/. There is no equivalent sound in English phonetics;
""ş"" is pronounced ""sh"" in ""sheep"" (sound /ʃ/);
""ţ"" is pronounced /ʦ/

, Also buy an English-to-Romanian and a Romanian-to-English dictionary, since there are a lot of words you will not know.

, They're useful even if you don't want to study the language and are just going on a trip to Romania.


""Da""=""Yes""
""Nu""=""No""
""Bună!""=""Hello!""
""Bună ziua!""=""Good afternoon!""
""Bună seara!""=""Good evening!""
""La revedere!""=""Goodbye!""
""Mulţumesc!""=""Thank You!""
""Vă rog/Te rog""=""Please""; note that ""Vă rog"" is the plural form, more polite and formal, while ""Te rog"" is informal.
""Îmi pare rău!""=""I'm sorry""

, Learn a few basic verbs, like ""a fi"" (""to be""), ""a avea"" (""to have""), ""a merge"" (""to go""), ""a face"" (""to do"") etc. Also learn the numbers from 0 to 100, as you have to know them to tell your age. Here are a few examples:


""Mă numesc John""=""My name is John""
""Am douăzeci de ani""=""I'm twenty years old""- Careful! The verb used in Romanian to express age is ""a avea"" (""to have""), not ""a fi"" (""to be"").
""Sunt american""=""I'm American""

, Write them in a list in your notebook and say them aloud until you memorize them. This will help expanding your vocabulary.

, That's the most difficult part. It is very difficult even for native speakers to learn all the rules (and the hundreds of exceptions), but it's not impossible. Here are a few basic rules:


The indefinite articles are ""un"" (masculine, singular), ""o"" (feminine, singular) and ""nişte"" (both genders, plural); definite articles are formed by adding certain endings to words (such as -(u)l, -a, -ua, -le), according to certain rules.
There are 3 genders in Romanian grammar: masculine, feminine and neuter. Neuter nouns are those that act as masculine nouns in the singular, and as feminine nouns in the plural.
There are 5 cases in Romanian: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative and vocative. Nouns have different forms for each case (they inflect), according to the gender and number of the noun. The genitive and dative form are identical, and so are the nominative and accusative form. The vocative case is used when calling someone/addressing someone directly (for example calling somebody's name to catch their attention).
There are 3 voices in Romanian: the active voice, the passive voice and the reflexive voice. The reflexive voice is used when the subject and the direct object of the verb are one and the same; Example: ""Mă îmbrac""=""I'm getting dressed"". The passive voice is used only when the subject becomes the object of the action and the subject of the verb is someone else. Example: ""Hoţul a fost arestat de către poliţie""=""The thief was arrested by the police"".
There are 9 verbal moods in Romanian: infinitive, indicative, subjunctive, conditional, presumptive, imperative, supine, participle, and gerund. The indicative, subjunctive, conditional, presumptive, and imperative moods are ""personal"", in the sense that they can inflect (to express time, person) and act as a predicative verb in a sentence, while the other four moods, called non-personal (infinitive, supine, participle, and gerund), are used as adjectives or adverbs.

The indicative mood has 8 tenses: present, imperfect, perfect simple, compound perfect, pluperfect, future, popular future, and future in the past. Present corresponds to both present simple and present continuous; imperfect corresponds to past continuous; the simple perfect tense, corresponding to the past simple, is old-fashioned and used only in some regions of Romania; it has been largely replaced with the compound perfect tense, which also corresponds to past simple and present perfect; and pluperfect corresponds to past perfect.
The subjunctive mood has 2 tenses: past and present. It corresponds to a certain use of infinitive in English (for example, ""Vreau să plec"" meaning ""I want to leave"").
The conditional mood also has 2 tenses (past and present). It is used under the same circumstances as in English.
The presumptive mood has 3 tenses- past, present and present progressive (the correspondent to the continuous tense in English); it is used to express a possible action (the usage of the modal ""might"" in English).
The imperative mood has only 1 tense -present- and it is used under the same circumstances as in English.

Learn the Marshallese alphabet.,
Learn to pronounce words.,
Learn to count.,
Memorize simple vocabulary.,
Learn some basic conversational phrases.",How to Learn Marshallese1," Although the Marshallese alphabet is almost identical to Spanish or English in terms of some of the letters used, the pronunciation of each letter is significantly different. As correct pronunciation is one of the most difficult skills for English learners of Marshallese to grasp, learning how to perfectly pronounce the letters of the alphabet is a great place to start your Marshallese-speaking adventure! Once you can pronounce all of the individual letters, learning how to pronounce entire words and phrases will be a lot easier. Below is a list of the letters and what they are called. Notice that some of the letters have a macron (bar on top) or a dot/cedille (squigilly or dot underneath). These symbols give these letters a different sound that is sometimes imperceptible for non-native speakers but that make a difference in Marshallese.


A a = ah

Ā ā = aeh

B b = bee

D d = dree

E e = eh

I i = ee

J j = jay, say, shay, chay

K k = kee

L l = lee

Ḷ ḷ = lee (like 'L' but with the toungue touching the ridge behind the teeth)
M m = mee

Ṃ ṃ = mwee

N n = nee

Ṇ ṇ = nee (like 'N' but with the toungue pulled back)
Ñ ñ = ngee

O o = oh

Ọ ọ = oa (like 'oa' in 'boat')
Ō ō = oo (like 'oo' in 'book')
P p = pea

R r = ree (rolled like in Spanish)
T t = tee

U u = oo (like 'oo' in 'boo')
Ū ū = oo (like 'oo' in 'book')
W w = wee
;
, Once you learn to pronunce the letters of the Marshallese alphabet, you'll be able to pronunce any word you see in the Marshallese-English Online Dictionary and you'll be on your way to instinctively knowing how to spell words you hear.Practice the special pronunciation of letters with macrons and cedillas


ā is pronounced like you're trying to say the 'e' in 'pet and the 'a' in 'pat' at the same time
ō sounds like the 'oo' in 'book'
ọ sounds like the 'o' in 'pot'
ū is pronounced halfway between the 'ea' in 'beat' and the 'oo' in 'boot'
ḷ sounds like 'L' but is pronounced with the toungue touching the ridge behind the teeth
ṃ sounds like the 'M' but with the lips rounded
ñ sounds like the 'ng' in 'singer'
ṇ sounds like 'N' but with the toungue pulled back

, Knowing how to count is an essential skill in any language. Learning to count in Marshallese is not too tricky. Numbers one through ten are listed below:


1 = Juon

2 = Ruo

3 = Jilu

4 = Emān

5 = Ḷalem

6 = Jijino

7 = Jimjuon

8 = Ralitōk

9 = Ratimjuon

10 = Joñoul


, The wider the vocabulary you have at your disposal, the easier it is to speak a language fluently. Familiarize yourself with as many simple, everyday Marshallese words as possible - you'll be surprised at how quickly they build up!


One of the easiest ways to do this is to use cognates - these are words that share a similar meaning, vary slightly spelling and pronunciation in both languages. Learning Marshallese cognates of English words is a great way to rapidly increase your vocabulary, but you must be careful since the pronunciation of these words may be different in Marshallese and it may be hard to pick them out in a sentence.
For words without cognates, try using one of the following memorization methods: When you hear a word in English, think about how you would say it in Marshallese. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you at all times for this purpose. Alternatively, try attaching little Marshallese labels to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it!
It is important to learn a word or phrase from ‘Marshallese to English’ as well as ‘English to Marshallese.’ That way you will remember how to say it, not just recognize it when you hear it.

, By learning the basics of polite conversation, you'll very quickly be able to interact with Marshallese-speakers on a simple level. Jot down some everyday Marshallese phrases in a notebook and make a point of learning between five and ten of them each day. Here's a few to get you started:


Hello! = Iakwe

Yes = Aet

No = Jab

Thank you! = Koṃṃool!

Please = Jouj

What is your name? = Etaṃ?

My name is... = Eta in...

How are you? = Ejjet mour?

Good. = Eṃṃan.

See you later! = Bar loe eok!

, Practice counting aloud. Listen to recordings of native speakers pronouncing the numbers so that you learn the right sound., The Persian alphabet is 32 letters long. These characters are written right to left, as are all the words. The


Practice writing and reciting the alphabet.
Listen to recordings of native speakers reciting the Alphabet. Try to learn the intonation.Make flashcards with the Persian script and Romanization on one side, and the English letter on the other. Quiz yourself in idle moments.
Numerals are written as they are in Arabic, except for 4, 5, and 6.
Unlike letters, numerals are written left-to-right.
If you plan to study or live in Tajikstan, learn to write in Cyrillic script instead.

, When you write in Persian, link most of the letters. Persian script is a semi-cursive script. There are, however, exceptions. These letters "" و, ژ, ﺯ, ﺭ, ﺫ, ﺩ, ﺍ"" link to the letter that precedes them, but not to the letter that follows.Most letters in Persian have four forms: initial, medial, final, and detached. The form they take depends on their position in a word.
""Initial"" letters are the first letter of a word, and they connect to the letter that follows.
""Medial"" letters are attached on both sides to the letters in a word that come before or after them.
""Final"" letters are those at the end of a word. They tend to take on a tail, or be written slightly larger than the letters preceding them.
""Detached"" letters are letters that stand alone, as in the alphabet.
The seven letters that do not link take only two forms, ""final"" and ""detached.""

, In written Persian script, ""short vowels"" (a, e, o) are omitted. ""Long vowels"" (ā, ī, ū) are included. This makes many words appear identical when written. When you read Persian, you will have to decipher such words from their context.


When vowels are indicated in writing, they are usually written with diacritics or combined consonants., Search online for local classes. Check the listings at your local community colleges, language schools, tutoring centers, and community centers. Look for ""Farsi"" classes as well as ""Persian,"" as the older name is still common in the United States.


It may be easier to locate classes if you live in a city. If you live somewhere rural, your best bet may be to take classes online.

, When you are learning a language that is not commonly studied in your area, it can be easier to find a tutor than a class. Look up language schools and tutoring services in your area. Put up ads on craigslist and tutoring websites offering to pay for tutoring sessions. Check to see what other potential students are offering, as well as what local tutors of other languages are asking, and have that amount in mind if you get any offers.


Try putting up flyers in places that Persian-speaking people might be, such as mosques and neighborhoods with Iranian, Tajik, Iraqi, Afghan, and Uzbek residents.
If you know anyone who speaks Persian, ask if they or someone they know could tutor you. A Persian speaker who has teaching experience in other subjects might be excited to combine their skills.
Ask a friend who speaks Persian to make a standing date with you to chat in Persian. Offer to pay.
Consider taking calligraphy lessons.

, Consider paying for online classes if you can't find any in your neighborhood. Check the MOOC list,, search language learning sites for free online tutorials, or locate a small online class or tutor who will speak to you over Skype or chat. A simple search should land you with multiple options, so be selective.


Make sure you take a class with plenty of multimedia and audio components, as your listening comprehension is vital to your learning Persian.
Opt for classes taught by native speakers with years of teaching experience.

, Be cautious and strategic when going abroad to study Persian. Sadly, you run a risk traveling to any country where Persian is a primary language. If you are traveling to a country plagued by terrorism, violence, or the after effects of civil and international war, make sure you are traveling to a city or town that is considered lower risk. Consider the areas that you must pass through, however, to get there.The organization that you travel with should discuss safety with you extensively.
Consider a critical language scholarship. If you are an undergraduate or graduate student and a citizen of the United States, you might qualify for a CLS, an all-expenses paid intensive summer class run by the United States government. For Persian, you'll need to have studied for at least a year before this program will accept you.Visit a website like goabroad.com to find out about vetted study abroad opportunities.
Check that any program you choose is run by legitimate organizations, such as certified colleges and universities.
Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq are all considered high risk by various governments for terrorism, armed conflict, and violence.The borders and many areas of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan are considered high risk for terrorism, armed conflict, and land mines.Consider signing up for a Persian class in a country where Persian is not the primary language, but where there are cities with Persian-speaking neighborhoods.

, Find Persian television shows and movies online. Watch with subtitles on if there is a an option to do so. Pick a regular podcast and follow it regularly. Look to prominent online book retailers to find Persian-language books, children's books, and comic books.Study poetry and learn famous verses. Poetry is a popular art in Persian-speaking countries, and famous poets such as Ferdowsi, Hafez, Rumi and Sa'di are quoted in everyday conversation.When buying books of Persian poetry, locate translated volumes with facing editions. That way, even as a new reader, you can read in English and refer back and forth with the original script.
As with your classes, be sure to search for ""Farsi"" as well as ""Persian.""
Consider taking calligraphy lessons. Sign up for classes online to learn a Persian art and practice your writing skills at the same time.

Generally, words are pronounced as written, and most Lithuanian letters are pronounced similarly to English letters.Ą is a long “a,” as in “father”
C is pronounced “ts”
Č is pronounced “ch” as in “check”
E is a long “e,” as in “eat”
Ę is pronounced like the “a” in “man”
Ė is pronounced like the “ai” in “chair”
Į is pronounced like a long “e”

Š is pronounced “sh,” as in “sheep”
Ų is pronounced like the “oo” in “loot”
Ū is pronounced like the “oo” in “moon”
Ž is pronounced like the “s” in “pleasure”;
, If you meet any Lithuanian speakers in person or online, you can impress them with your ability to say things like:


“Labas” = hello
“Iki” or “ate” = “Goodbye”
“Labas rytas!” = “Good morning!”
“Laba diena!” = “Good day!”
“Labas vakaras!” = “Good evening!”
“Labanakt!” = = “Good night!”

“Ne” = “No”
“Aš esu” ____” = “My name is _____”
“Mano vardas Jonas. O kaip tavo?” = “My name is Jonas. And you?”

Usually, female names will end in -a, -ė or –ia (for example, Milda, Dovilė, or Dalia).

, As soon as you are ready, you can start acquiring some Lithuanian vocabulary in areas that you are interested in or find necessary. For instance, you can study the vocabulary of a topic you are interested in, such as music or architecture, or business vocabulary if you will be trading in Lithuania.

, Use study guides, books, and online exercises to learn about the rules of Lithuanian grammar.As a non-native speaker of the language, this will help you to use the language more extensively than you could just from studying vocabulary.

, A dictionary can also help you expand your vocabulary, by explaining the meaning of words to you. You can purchase a Lithuanian-English dictionary, or use one of several available online.Resist the urge to look up every word you don’t know. Try to guess the meaning of new words from context clues. This will help you gain skills in Lithuanian more quickly, and learn to think “in” the language.
Be cautious with using dictionaries. The form of a word as listed in the dictionary may not be the form you need for a particular phrase or usage. Lithuanian is an inflected language, meaning that words change their endings and/or beginnings based on how they are used. To really learn Lithuanian, you must also learn to use its grammar.

Even if you are far away from Lithuania, there are several websites that stream radio stations broadcasting in its language., Watching Lithuanian television can also give you a good sense of how the language is used in everyday life, and increase your knowledge of the culture. Viewing images while you listen will make it easier to pick up new words and phrases from context. If you cannot subscribe to a Lithuanian TV channel, you can still watch streaming channels online., There are a number of Lithuanian podcasts you can listen to as a way of learning more of the language.Some of these are specifically designed for language learners, while others are on a variety of topics of interest to Lithuanian speakers. You can find Lithuanian podcasts by searching online or through your media player’s podcasting service, if it has one.

, A number of apps have been developed for Lithuanian learners. These provide lessons, quizzes, games, and other activities to increase your knowledge of the language.Some have a fee, but many are free to use. Some are web-based, while others can be used from a smartphone or tablet device.

Familiarize yourself with the contents of speech in more than one language.,
Learn language interpretation with an interpreter with ample amount of experience in both the domain as well as the language.,
Become highly proficient in the chosen languages.,
Get a certificate in the field.,
Get experience.",How to Learn Language Interpretation," It should be understood that there are three different parties involved in the process:


The speaker, who speaks in a foreign language
The Interpreter, who converts the foreign language speech into local language which is understood by the third party/audience and
The audience, who does not understand the speech;
, It is always preferable to hand over the text of the speech to the interpreter before hand, so that necessary preparations are made in advance. The delivery of interpretation should be professional and the formation of the sentences has to be simple and accurate.

, Once you have chosen language interpretation as your career, you have to build a very strong base, in the source language, target language and professional subjects. In order to take up interpretation as your career, one should know at least two languages thoroughly. One of the languages will be the source language and another will be the target language. An in-depth knowledge of both the languages is very essential. It is important to take advanced courses in at least one second language. You should also take specific courses in interpretation techniques as well as public speaking to help you in facing large public gatherings.

, This is the most common path. You receive your certificate in addition to getting a degree in another field. There are many programs which allow you to specialize in interpretation as part of studying for a second language degree, for which certificates are offered at both undergraduate and graduate levels. A few colleges and universities offer Bachelors and Masters Degrees in language interpretation. Some two-year colleges offer the first two years of study. Students can often transfer these credits to a four-year school. Independent language schools also offer training in language interpretation and translation. Their program requirements often vary with the language skills of each student. Native speakers with strong second-language skills may be able to work in interpreting without long-term formal training.

, While training is of paramount importance, there is no teacher like experience! So, you should strive to get as many assignments as you can take. This would help you in honing your skills and excelling as an interpreter.

Begin class with a brief question and answer session.,
Integrate discussion into lectures.,
Give impromptu writing assignments throughout the class period.,
Connect subjects and topics to the real world.,
Take field trips.",How to Encourage Students to Learn1," Come to class with a list of questions that will introduce students to the topic of the day. Based on their answers, you will have an idea of how much students already know. The information garnered from student answers will help shape the following lecture to what students already do and do not know, which will cut down on repetitive information., After covering a topic in lecture, break students into smaller groups to discuss among themselves or facilitate a larger group discussion to emphasize the students’ ideas and assess comprehension.


Facilitate, don’t dominate discussion. This is a time for students to process material and interact. Instead of falling back into lecture, direct questions to the students and encourage them to respond and listen to each other.For smaller group discussion, give students a few minutes to brainstorm questions about the lecture on their own. Then put them into pairs to share their questions and to collectively generate a list of things they learned and would like to know more about., This strategy makes sure students are paying attention. More importantly, it gives students a chance to process what they just learned to ensure more retention, and it gives the teacher a chance to assess comprehension.


Impromptu writing assignments should be low-stakes. Count these assignments as participation grades or make them a small percentage of their overall grade.The emphasis should be on students’ learning comprehension, not just their grades.
If you are asking students to participate through these assignments, it is important to participate with them by answering any questions they may bring up or guiding them if they want to explore a topic further.

, Sometimes topics and subjects can seem abstract, and students have a hard time understanding why they should care. If you can show how the class subject matter relates to the real world in a concrete way, students will be more invested in the class material.Something newsworthy happens every day, and these events can be a great way to demonstrate to students how what they learn in school plays out in real life. For example, a breakthrough in science or technology can relate to the basic building blocks of science education or a current political event may be related to a historical event.
Take time find out what students already know about a subject or what interests them about particular topics. This information can help you find places to connect lesson plans and academic subjects with activities and materials that students are already prone to enjoy., Field trips allow students to experience learning in a less structured environment than the classroom, which can stimulate students’ curiosity. While textbooks and regular class lessons present material in an abstract way, field trips help students envision textbook material in a more comprehensive, concrete way.Each museum has a different theme ranging from science to art to different periods of history. Find out what museums are available in your area as you plan your curriculum in order to make sure your field trips relate to topics as you cover them.
To make it an immersive educational experience, coordinate with museum staff, inquire about tour packages, and clearly lay out goals and expectations for student learning ahead of time.
After the field trip, facilitate a question and answer session, hold a classroom discussion, or give students a low-stakes writing prompt asking them to explain what they learned and liked about the the trip.

Lay out the classroom in a way that encourages participation.,
Cultivate relationships with students.,
Make teaching material accessible to the demographic makeup of the class.,
Decorate the room with student-centered materials.,
Allow opportunities for students to shape the class content.",How to Encourage Students to Learn2," Instead of arranging desks facing forward, try some different arrangements to encourage discussion, like a U-shape or clusters of four desks with the students facing each other.

, It is important for teachers to show an interest in students beyond academic performance. To understand what motivates students, ask them about their hopes for the future, their hobbies, and their other interests. In return, share some of your own hobbies and interests to cultivate a two-way relationship.Learn student names and their proper pronunciation. If students believe that you see them as an individual, not just another member in the group, they will be much more engaged.
Ask students how they are feeling about the class and their progress, or how they are doing on a personal level as a periodic reminder to students that you care about them. If students feel more comfortable expressing themselves in writing, turn this into a weekly or monthly writing assignment.

, Students engage in class material more deeply if they can make a connection with it. This means knowing the unique demographic makeup of a class and adjusting class material accordingly.Integrate texts written by people of different genders and ethnic backgrounds.
Decorate the room with a variety of historical or inspirational significance of different genders and ethnic backgrounds.
Make sure the classroom and its materials are accessible to all students, including disabled students.
Allow students the opportunity to share their different perspectives and ideas with you and with fellow students.

, Though appropriateness of decorations may depend on the age group, students should be able to see themselves represented in the classroom environment.


Include pictures of the students, inspirational quotes written by students and their peers, or individual or group projects.

, If students feel like they have a hand in shaping their education, they are likely to invest more time and interest into assignments and classroom discussion. Try these strategies for encouraging students to take control of the learning process:Ask for students develop their for homework assignments around a specific topic.
Ask students (or groups of students if it is a group project) to share with the class how they solved particular problems, approached a project, or researched a topic. This allows students to feel that they are contributing in a meaningful way to the class, and it invites different perspectives and ideas to problems and topics.
Divide the class up into small groups and give them problems to solve together. Problem-based learning encourages students to think critically and creatively, while engaging with each other’s different perspectives.

"
"
Set realistic goals and expectations.,
Provide positive feedback.,
Don’t give up.",How to Encourage Students to Learn3," Let students create their own learning expectations for the semester or year, but guide them in their goal setting to make sure they are realistic for the individual, since progress will be different for each student. Try these strategies when helping students set and reach goals:Frame expectations in a positive statement. For example, “To improve in mathematics, I will…” or “By Spring Break, I will have completed…”
In order for students to track their progress, goals need to be assessed and measured. Measurable goals also help students know where they went wrong or how they failed to meet an expectation, which makes it easier to adjust goals to be more achievable.
Students should be in control of their own goals. This will teach students independence and responsibility, but it can also be frustrating for students when they fail to reach a goal because of someone else or for reasons beyond their control.

, If students never or rarely receive positive feedback, they may stop exhibiting positive behaviors or lose self-confidence. From academic achievement to good behavior, there are many opportunities to deliver positive feedback to students.Display good work in the classroom, write positive affirmations on student work, and/or tell the students’ parents when they achieve a goal or surpasses an expectation.
Beyond just praising students, point out specific things they have done well in their work, or even better, places where they have improved in their work.
Even if students don’t perform well on assignments or exams, there are other opportunities to praise students, like being on time for class, listening and contributing during discussions, asking questions, or helping out a classmate., Even if you don’t feel like the student is doing their best work, don’t give up on them. Dig deeper, check-in, and let the student know that you care by asking him/her questions about what may be affecting their academic performance. If they aren’t meeting expectations, be flexible and adjust expectations and goals if necessary.

Make your classroom rules clear.,
Give students one-on-one attention.,
Keep communication open.,
Understand a child may express needs through problem behaviors.",How to Deal With Students With Behavior Issues," Some behaviors are disruptive, but not dangerous. A student may, for example, talk during class or refuse to participate. These behaviors can be dealt with more gently than dangerous behaviors. Dangerous behaviors should be dealt with directly and immediately.If a student is hurting another student or him or herself, intervene immediately.
If a student is making a threat, intervene. Even if a student is unlikely to follow through with a threat, it is better to be safe than sorry.;
, If a student is becoming dangerous, you may need to separate him or her for the safety of others. If a student is physically lashing out, you need to keep the other students safe.It's best to have another adult escort your students out of the classroom. This may be easier than removing the violent student. If you have a teaching assistant, have him or her take other students to a safe area.
You can also move the violent student to the hallway and escort him or her to the principal's office, the nurses's office, or the guidance counselor's office. Make sure someone can supervise your class as you do so.

, You may be able to prevent an angry student from becoming violent via distraction. Students, especially young students, may not know how to appropriately deal with emotion. Distracting them from their anger may prevent an outburst.Acknowledge the student is feeling mad, while talking to him or her softly. For example, ""James, I understand you're upset that Jane took the toy you wanted.""
Then, try to change the subject. Distract the student by directing his or her interests elsewhere. For example, ""James, you like to paint, right? Maybe you could play with the fingerprints with Mason while you let Jane have a turn with the Legos.""

, When a student acts out, immediately refer him or her to the rules. You want to make sure the student understands the rules in your classroom will be enforced.If you don't already, have a list of basic classroom rules pinned up somewhere on your wall. This way, you will have something to refer to right there when a student acts out.
As soon as a behavior occurs, remind the student of the rules. For example, ""Mason, remember rule number four? You're not supposed to talk out of turn.""

, Students often act out for attention. It may be a good idea to simply ignore problem behaviors if they're not dangerous.Try not to react if a student does something like doodle during a lecture, talk out of turn, or other behaviors that can easily be ignored. A student may learn to behave better if he or she is not getting attention for acting out.
However, never ignore dangerous behaviors. If a student is doing something that could hurt his or herself, or another student, it needs to be addressed right away.

, A student should understand what will happen if he or she continues a problem behavior. You want to state the consequences while the student is acting out. If he or she continues to act out, reinforce the consequences.For example, say something like, ""If you don't do your in-class activity now, you will have to do it during free period."" This may cause the student to stop the problem behavior and follow the rules.
However, not all students will respond to consequences. Some students may continue to act out. If this happens, make sure you enforce the punishment. Students need to make a connection between negative actions and consequences.

, An apology can help repair any conflict caused by a negative behavior. After a student acts out, make him or her apologize.Who the student apologizes to depends on the behavior. If a student hit another student, for example, he or she should apologize to that student. If a student disrupted class, he or she should apologize to the class. If a student disrespected you, you should require him or her to offer you an apology.

, Physical restraint can be risky. You do not want to accidentally harm a student. You should only use physical restraint if a student is hurting another student or his or herself. Always use the least amount of force possible when using physical restraint., Recording behaviors as they occur can help you see a pattern. You can see when a student is most likely to misbehave. You can identify any triggers that may be causing the difficult behavior.Keep a notebook to record difficult behaviors. Note all the details of the behavior, when it occurred, and any circumstances surrounding the incident.
Look for patterns. Does the student seem to act out at a particular time during the day? Maybe a student acts out just before recess. This could be because the student is anxious to get out of the classroom. This student may need help regulating his or her energy.

, Once you know when problem behaviors occur, increase supervision during this time. This can help you eliminate behavior issues.You can monitor your class more closely during certain times of the day. Group work just before recess, for example, may require additional supervision.
If you have any classroom assistants, ask for their help here. Have them monitor students closely when they're likely to act out.

, Students often respond better to positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement. Instead of always scolding students for poor behavior, work on praising students for positive behavior.Always praise students for following rules. Do so immediately after the good behaviors occur. A lot of students crave praise and approval from their teacher. Students with behavior issues may be more likely to change if they see they gain favor by following rules.
For example, you can say something like, ""Harper, I really like how you waited for me to finish explaining before asking a question. It makes the classroom run smoother when everyone takes turns talking.""

, More often than not, students are acting out for a reason. You want to make sure you identify underlying problems so they can be dealt with appropriately.

A student who is behaving poorly may have a health problem, an issue at home, a mental health issue, or may be acting out due to academic difficulties. If a student's behavior does not improve with regular intervention, there may be something else going on.
You may have to have a sit down talk with a student whose behavior is not improving. Ask him or her open-ended questions, like, ""Is there a reason you're having trouble concentrating."" This gives the student the opportunity to open up on what is preventing him or her from achieving academic success.

, This can help encourage good behavior from the first day of class. You do not want to start off the school year with your students confused about appropriate behavior.

Go over your rules on the first day of class. Take time to explain everything clearly. Give students a chance to ask questions later on.
Hand out a syllabus that includes a list of classroom rules. This way, students can review the rules on their own.

, If an atmosphere is depersonalized, students may feel more comfortable engaging in problem behaviors. Work on making sure every students feels they have a one-on-one relationship with you. This will make students more likely to respect you and follow your rules.

Make sure you know all your students' names. You can use a photo roster if necessary until you have all the names down.
Make small talk with students as they come into your classroom. Ask students about their weekends or their plans for after school.
Have office hours. Encourage students to come in and talk if they need help with a homework assignment or want to talk over another issue.

, Students often act out when they're confused or angry. Fostering a system of open communication allows students to tell you about their issues directly.Be kind to all your students. Greet them as they enter the classroom and say goodbye at the end of the day.
Be courteous and kind to your students. If your students feel comfortable with you, they may be more comfortable opening up about issues they're having.

, Try not to get angry or frustrated by troublesome behaviors. Often, a student engaging in problem behaviors is struggling with something. A student may be struggling at home, or unable to keep up academically. Students who act out are rarely trying to be malicious, so stay empathetic. You want to make sure students get the attention they need to thrive."

Decide on basic classroom rules.,
Share these rules and expectations with the class on the first day of school.,
Discuss the negative consequences and positive consequences of the rules.,
Give a copy of the rules to parents during the first week of school.,
Review the rules on a regular basis.,
Put the rules into action.",How to Discipline Children in the Classroom1," Choose at least four to five simple rules for the classroom and write them down. You will use these rules to manage the classroom and establish boundaries among your students.Your rules may include: all students must come to class on time and ready to learn, all students must be prepared to listen and ask questions by raising their hand, and all students must be aware of the consequences of missing class or turning in assignments late.
You may also have a rule about playing fair with others in the classroom and listening respectfully to others when they speak. Make sure you have at least one to two rules that directly address discipline and behavior towards others in the classroom.;
, Start the school year on the right foot by printing out the rules and handing them out to all students. You can also post them on the blackboard or put them on the class’ online message board so they are readily available throughout the year. Explain to your students that you expect them to all follow these four to five rules and to enforce these rules among themselves., You should be clear about the negative consequences of disruptive behavior in class. If a student talks over another student when she is speaking, for example, this could be considered disruptive and the consequence could be a reprimand from you. As well, if one student refuses to share an item with another student, this could be considered a violation of the rules and could lead to points deducted from her participation grade. Explain possible situations that may be considered disruptive or against the rules of the classroom.You should also discuss the positive consequences of following the classroom rules, such as verbal praise, or entering a class raffle for a prize. You may also use the star system, where a student who follows the rules receives a gold star beside her name or a check mark. Group rewards can be effective, where you put a marble in a jar every time the group interacts well and follows the rules, and when the marbles reach a certain height in the jar, the entire class is allowed to go on a special field trip or event.
Once you explain the rules and expectations of the classroom, you should have the class verbally agree to the rules or raise their hands to show they understand the rules. This will act as a commitment to the class rules by everyone in the room.

, Doing this will ensure parents are aware of your classroom rules and understand how you will discipline your students. Parents may need to be involved in classroom issues if they get out of control, so it will be useful to share the classroom rules in the first week of class.You can also ask parents to go over the rules with their children at home so the rules are clear. This will also signal to children that their parents approve of the classroom rules.

, Children respond to fair, consistent behavior, and will often lead by example. Make sure you review the rules and expectations for the classroom at least once a week so your students can remember them.It is also important that you ask your students if they have any questions or concerns about the rules. Some students may feel a certain rule needs to be more specific or to be adjusted. Be open to a discussion about the classroom rules and allow your students to voice their opinions. Though you may decide not to shift or adjust any rules, this will show students that you respect their opinion and indicate they are thinking critically about the rules.

, In the event of an issue or problem in the classroom, draw on the established rules and expectations for the students. Do not be afraid to be strict about the rules, as this is the only way they will be enforced in the classroom. Be prepared to give out appropriate punishments, but avoid yelling or getting angry at students. Instead, use punishments that encourage self awareness and discussion, rather than humiliation or embarrassment.You should also try to maintain positive consequences throughout the school year when a student or the class follow the rules. This will remind the class that the rules are made to reward, as well as to discipline.

"
"
Understand the difference between punishment and positive discipline.,
Note the seven principles of positive discipline.,
Follow the four steps of positive discipline.,
Apply positive discipline in your classroom.",How to Discipline Children in the Classroom2," Positive discipline is a type of discipline that uses positive alternatives and non-violent methods to respect and reward children when they behave well and to correct any negative behavior. Unlike punishment, positive discipline does not advocate the use of shame, ridicule, aggression or violence to correct student behavior. This type of discipline argues that students respond better to positive approaches, like choice, negotiation, discussion, and a system of rewards.As a teacher, you will also have more control over your classroom using positive discipline, as you will be advocating the students to make choices and decisions for themselves, rather than try to force them to act correctly. This type of discipline can also lead to long term peace in the classroom, as students will learn how to self correct and how to come up with solutions or issues among themselves.

, Positive discipline is based on seven key principles, which can act as classroom rules for you in your role as the teacher or leader. The seven principles are:To respect the child’s dignity.
To develop pro-social behavior and encourage self-discipline.
To maximize the child’s participation in class discussion.
To respect the child’s developmental needs and quality of life.
To respect the child’s motivation and life views.
To assure fairness and justice through equality and non-discrimination.
To promote solidarity among students in the classroom.

, Positive discipline is based on a four-step process that recognized appropriate behavior in the classroom and rewards the behavior. You can apply these steps to an individual student or to the classroom as a whole.First, describe the appropriate behavior you are expecting from the individual or the class. For example, if you are trying to get the class to settle down, you may say: “Class, please quiet down now.”
Then, provide reasons why this behavior is appropriate. For example: “We are going to start our English lesson and it is important that you all listen closely to me.”
Ask for acknowledgement from the class about the appropriate behavior. For example:“Do you all see why quieting down is so important?”
Reinforce the correct behavior with eye contact, a nod or a smile. You can also reinforce the class’ good behavior with five extra minutes of play time or another marble in the reward jar. If you are reinforcing individual behavior, you may give extra credit points to the student or put a star by her name.
Always provide a reward for good behavior immediately and clearly. You want to make the students feel they are on the winning team and to praise individual students for being a good team member.

, When using positive disciple, follow the 4:1 ratio. This means you should try to catch a student or the class doing something correctly four time for every one time you find them doing something inappropriate. Be consistent with this ratio, as this will show your students you are more interested in rewards and acknowledging appropriate actions rather than punishment.Keep in mind positive discipline can fail is the student or the class is not rewarded quickly enough and clearly enough. Make sure you always follow through with a reward for appropriate behavior.
Always emphasize the task, rather than the behavior. Focus on positive tasks like quieting down and being considerate of others, rather than behaviors like no talking or no shouting. For example, you may use an acknowledgment comment like, “It’s important that we quiet down so we can be considerate of what others have to say,” rather than an acknowledgement comment like, “It’s important that you stop talking and focus.”

"
"
Create an agenda book and a solutions book.,
Explain the purpose of the agenda to the class on the first day of school.,
Have the class help you come up with solutions to an example issue.,
Analyze the possible solutions.,
Use the agenda book and the solutions book throughout the school year.",How to Discipline Children in the Classroom3," Get two blank notebooks and label one the agenda book and one the solutions book. The agenda book will be for any issues or problems in the classroom and the solutions book will be for any solutions or answers to the issues or problems. You will collaborate with the class to address any issues noted in the agenda and work together to write down possible solutions in the solutions book.This form of discipline, known as democratic discipline, will help to reinforce critical thinking in the classroom and get your students actively involved in finding solutions to issues or problems. As the teacher, you will facilitate these discussions and make suggestions, but you will also rely on the students to provide ideas and feedback.

, On the first day of school, present the two books to the class. Start by explaining that the classroom is going to be a space where all students are respected and their opinions are heard. You can also reinforce that you will be depending on the class to come up with solutions to issues or problems that arise during the school year. You will help to guide these discussions, but you also want the students to feel they can discuss and create solutions on their own.You can then show the class an issue or problem from last year that you wrote down in the agenda book. For example, you may discuss issues that came up during the line up for lunch. In the line up, some students got annoyed or hurt when other students cut them off or pushed them as they tried to get in line.

, Ask the class for suggestions on how to line up in a respectful way. As students start to provide possible solutions, write them on the board. Write down every student’s solution, even solutions that seem silly or improbable.For example, you may have solutions like calling the students in alphabetical order to line up, allowing boys to line up first, having students run as fast as they can to the front of the line, or calling each table in random order to line up.

, You will then tell the class that because this is your problem, you will analyze the pros and cons of each solution and choose one to try out for a week. Explain to the class that: “whoever has the problem gets to choose the solution.” Analyze each solution out loud so the class can listen to your reasoning.For example, you might begin with: “If I choose the boys before the girls, then the girls will be left out and we don’t want that. But if I call the names in alphabetical order, the A’s will always be first. Running fast to the line up could lead to injuries or more students getting hurt. So, I think I’ll choose the calling each table in random order option.”
Use the solution for the following week when the students line up for lunch and ask the class before they line up, “Who remembers our solution for lining up for lunch?” or “Raise your hand if you remember how we decided to line up.” This will reinforce the decision and show the students that you are willing to put the chosen solution into practice.

, Now that you have established how to use the agenda book and the solution book to the students, encourage them to use the books to record any issues and to discuss possible solutions with the class. Check the agenda book every day and address any issues in the book.Ask the student who wrote down the issue to ask the class for possible solutions for the issue. Once the student has three to four possible solutions, guide her as she decides which solution to try for a week. Acknowledge the solution by asking the class to tell you the agreed upon solution throughout the week and refer to the student who choose the solution by name.
At the end of the week, check in with the student and ask her to tell the class how well or not so well the solution worked. If she discovers the solution works well, you may ask her to decide if that is the solution she is going to use from now on. If the solution did not work so well, work with her to come up with a better solution or to adjust the solution to make it better.
This will allow students to create their own solutions and to work through issues using critical thinking and self awareness. It will also allow you to discipline students in an open and productive way, and to get students to see each issue as having several potential solutions.

Check the placement of your desk.,
Move the student desks around.,
Get rid of window blinds.,
See if you can get the chalkboard in a better place.,
If you use room dividers, be sure they are safely stored when not in use.,
Use closets to store student's personal items, such as coats, book bags, and lunch boxes.,
Plan an exit strategy.,
Mark the evacuation route.,
Designate a hiding spot.","How to Create a Safe, Yet Functional, Classroom"," The teacher's desk should be placed in such a way that the view of all access points (doors) are clearly visible to him or her while at seated or standing behind the desk.


To avoid any confusion while selecting this ideal location, position the teacher's chair in the necessary position, facing the doorways, then place the desk in front of the chair. The teacher at his or her desk should be the one who is most likely to notice a person entering, exiting, or peering into a classroom.
This also makes it easier for administrative and security staff to communicate with a teacher, quickly and efficiently, without entering a classroom and interrupting or alarming students.;
, Student desks and/or tables should be placed as far away from the doors as possible. When positioning student desks, place the greatest emphasis on creating an open and unobstructed area between the desks and the doorway.


Leave adequate space between desks for the students to stand between desks, all the way around.
Rows of desks, spaced in this manner, will create clear and unobstructed pathways leading to access points, should they be forced to evacuate.
It is not necessary for student desks to face the teacher's desk; most in-class instruction is not conducted while the teacher is seated there.

, Window blinds have no place in a classroom. Windows and window sills should be free of obstructions at all times. Ensure that they are free of decorations and artwork, and kept windows clean. Blinds, if present, should be removed.


In cases of emergency, clear visibility into a classroom from the outside will be necessary.

, Chalkboards should be affixed to the wall(s) that allow the best view (from the teacher's visual perspective) of the access points to the room.


If a chalkboard is not in an ideal location, and cannot be relocated, the teacher must decide whether to alter their use of the board (write class notes on it prior to the beginning of class), train themselves to stand and use the board in a manner which allows them to keep an eye on the door, or not use the board at all.
Some alternatives to using the chalk board include a portable dry erase board or, large blank-sheet tablets on a portable stand.

, Portable room dividers should be folded and stored flat, well away from classroom access points, or placed in a storage closet, when not in use. Fixed room dividers should be sturdy, in usable condition, and left ajar at all times to ensure the safety of the room occupants.


A door kept shut is an escape exit blocked, should smoke or fumes fill one side of the room.

, Store excess classroom supplies in a locker or in storage bins. Creating a space for proper storage will negate the potential for unintended obstructions to walk space between desks during class times.

, Even if the school has an exit procedure, examine the room after laying it out and determine two viable evacuation strategies.


Relocate any item or group of items that obstruct the quickest route to the access points in the room.
If the new exit strategy differs from the policy, address concerns with the school administration and request advice or changes to the current policy.

, Based on the approved evacuation route, determine the best way to mark the route to prevent confusion in an emergency.


Use reflective tape on the floor for students to follow by sight, or touch, should a smoke-filled room obstruct their view of the exit route.

, In writing, designate a location in the classroom where the teacher will instruct the students to hide, should a menacing intruder be spotted in the room or hallway. Mark this spot so others will readily identify it as a hiding spot.


Ensure that the path to the hiding spot, from the student desks, is clear of obstructions to facilitate ease of access. A hiding spot can be a closet, or an open area behind the student desks that provides some protection from an intruder. The closer the hiding spot is to the windows, the better, but if there are no windows, the ideal location is near an access door.

Always be positive.,
Model good social skills.,
Use strong role models.",How to Create a Positive Classroom Atmosphere1," The most important tool in creating a positive classroom atmosphere is for the teacher to be a positive role model. Being positive doesn’t mean being happy all of the time. Rather, being positive means approaching every issue with a positive, constructive attitude.There are little ways to be positive, such as smiling in the morning when your students arrive.
You should also be positive when difficult issues arise. For example, if a scary news story comes up in class, talk about things the students can do to help. Or discuss how it’s okay to be sad and no one should be looked down upon for expressing their emotions in a healthy way.;
, Your students will mimic the behavior that you display. If you react with anger when a student misbehaves, your students will think this is the right way to respond to frustration and they will do the same. On the other hand, if you display self-control in the face of frustration, your students will do the same.Important positive social skills include empathy, tolerance, patience, and effective communication.
As an example of good communication and patience, if a student is disrupting the class, don’t ignore the student and then suddenly lash out with anger. Instead, calmly ask the student to respect the class’s time. If the student continues to be disruptive, tell them that you need to send them to the office and you’ll be down later so the two of you can discuss the problem.
You can also praise students when they display good social skills and point out their behavior as a model for the rest of the class.

, Integrate role models from the community into your classroom. The more role models from different walks of life your students see, the more they will feel that a good attitude can apply to any situation.For example, bring in a policewoman or fireman from the community and have them discuss how they approach the difficult aspects of their jobs with a positive attitude.

"
"
Acknowledge positive behaviors.,
Praise positive behaviors.,
Avoid negative reinforcement.",How to Create a Positive Classroom Atmosphere2," If you point out good examples of positive behavior, your students will learn to recognize these behaviors and seek to emulate them. Without acknowledgement, your students won’t know which behaviors to aspire to.


When a student engages in a positive behavior such as helping another student or peacefully resolving a conflict, acknowledge the behavior by either bringing it to the individual student’s attention or to the attention of the entire class.
For example, if a student steps in to support a student who is being bullied, you might acknowledge the student later and say, “this is the kind of positive behavior that helps make everyone feel happier and more comfortable.”

, Praising your students when they engage in positive behaviors provides a positive reinforcement for the behavior beyond simple recognition. It lets the student know that they’ve done a good job and helped the class move in a positive direction.In order to be effective, praise should be specific, sincere, and culturally-appropriate.
For example, if a student writes a good paper, praise the student’s specific use of lesson material (“Excellent job segueing from the introduction to the body of your paper”), make sure the praise is sincere, and don’t praise the student in front of the class if it will make them feel uncomfortable.
It’s important to praise effort as well as outcomes. If a student is trying hard to accomplish a task, praise their efforts and encourage them to keep trying.

, Negative reinforcement involves punishing undesirable behaviors instead of praising desirable behaviors. Negative reinforcement, used alone, tends to build resentment and distrust between the student and teacher, and lowers students’ self-esteem. Substitute positive reinforcement for negative reinforcement whenever possible.For example, if you have an unruly student, make a concerted effort to use positive reinforcement techniques when the student behaves well instead of only calling them out when they behave badly.
If you do need to discipline a student, do so privately so as to avoid embarrassing them. This will let the student know you respect them as a person even though you’re upset with them at that moment.

"
"
Get to know your students.,
Share your life with your students.,
Use humor.,
Hold class meetings.,
Teach and enforce rules.,
Give every student responsibility.,
Keep your classroom organized.",How to Create a Positive Classroom Atmosphere3," Your students will be more inclined to act in positive ways if they feel like their teacher cares about them as individuals. To build relationships with your students, interact with them in informal situations such as before and after class, and use instructional methods that encourage them to share their personal views and experiences with the class.For example, before class, stand by the door and greet each of your students by name as they arrive. On Monday mornings, ask them to share something fun they did over the weekend.

, Building relationships is a two-way street. In addition to showing an interest in your students’ lives, you should share aspects of your life with your students as well. This will help your students feel like they know you as a person and not just as an authority figure.You should share details of your life but avoid over sharing. For example, if you return from a vacation with friends you might talk about the places you visited, but avoid talking about drinking or partying.

, Humor is essential for building a positive classroom atmosphere. Humor helps your students feel comfortable and at-ease in your classroom. Incorporate humor into your lesson-plans and use it everyday.One good way to include humor in your lessons is to preface each lesson with a cartoon. If you look through comics like the Far Side or Calvin & Hobbes you can find scenarios that match almost any lesson plan!
Make sure to keep your humor positive and avoid sarcasm.

, Class meetings give students a sense of ownership over their situation. Make time for a weekly class meeting where students can freely discuss what it means to have a positive classroom atmosphere.Begin the meeting with a discussion question like “Why is it important to respect other people’s cultures?”
Use your authority as a teacher to moderate discussions. Encourage positive, constructive discussion.

, Your students will feel more secure, positive, and trusting if they know what is expected of them in your classroom.Make the rules easy to understand. For example, instead of having a rule that says “maintain an orderly atmosphere,” have a rule that says “stay in your seat when the teacher is talking.”
Allowing your students to help craft the rules is a good way to give them a sense of ownership and responsibility for the classroom.

, When your students have responsibilities in the classroom they will feel more personally invested in maintaining a positive atmosphere. Make sure every student has responsibility for some aspect of the classroom.


For example, if you have a class pet, you could have one student responsible for feeding it and another students responsible for keeping the cage clean.Be careful not to give a few students a lot of responsibility and other students very little responsibility. If there aren’t enough tasks to go around, rotate what students are responsible for what tasks on a weekly basis.

, Students tend to feel more positive, productive, and trusting in clean, organized environments. Taking a few minutes every day to straighten up can go a long way to maintaining a positive environment in your classroom.Store supplies in easy-to-find bins with labels. For example, you might keep all of the coloring supplies in a purple bin and all of the construction toys in a yellow box.
Let your students help organize the classroom. This will give them an extra sense of ownership over their environment and they’ll feel invested in keeping it in order.

, Stimulate them to challenge these routines, change it or participate actively in these procedures.

, Encourage active participation in family activities, household budgeting, home improvements, décor etc. Give children the opportunity to buy commodities, groceries or any item, in terms of a tight budget. Provide them with finances and mentor or guide them towards effective spending and thriftiness.

, Make these types of preferable reading material easily available in your home, office, car etc. This will help stimulate their interest, hence also improving their learning abilities.

, Be there to guide and motivate them. Always bear in mind that each person is unique. Their attitude and approach to learning may differ from yours.

, Let this be constant and ongoing. When things are becoming stagnant, notice and take action.

, Laborious and boring educational activities will only hinder the learning process. One can read a story to children in a favorite picnic spot. Introduce games like solving riddles. This can be very effective in educating and also provides a form of entertainment.

, These may include time, money, trainers etc. The amount of resources will determine the quality and quantity of learning. This means that one has to support the learning process.

, Always bear in mind that there will be no end to this attitude of continuous training. Create an awareness amongst others, specifying the importance of and the need for this change to take place.

Always be in control of the classroom.,
Arrange the testing environment.,
Use multiple proctors.,
Greet students as they come into the classroom.",How to Catch Students Cheating1," Being vigilant in the classroom is the best way to catch students cheating and to prevent cheating from happening in the first place. State your expectations at the beginning of the class and before the exam.


Make sure your students know the penalties for academic dishonesty.;
, Arrange desks in the room to spread out students if possible. Alternately, assign seats to students so that they do not sit at their usual desk. Students will not be able to sit next to a friend with whom they plan to cheat.


Ask students to store backpacks, books, or binders under their chairs.

, If your test environment is a large space, such as an auditorium, consider having an assistant or two help you monitor the students during the exam. These individuals can roam around the room and cover more ground than a single person can.

, Look at each student as he or she comes through the door and say hello. Keep an eye on students who look fidgety or nervous.


Glance at their arms, hands and hats to make sure there aren’t any notes written on those areas. Be wary of students who are constantly pulling their long sleeves down to cover more of their arms.
Keep in mind that many students are anxious when they come into an exam. Don’t automatically assume that someone is cheating because he looks nervous.

"
"
Be vigilant in auditorium settings.,
Carefully monitor students during tests.,
Don’t let a student distract you.,
Beware of students sending signals.,
Do not allow any whispering during an exam.,
Watch for students writing large letters on their exams.,
Look for writing on the student’s body.,
Look out for notes stored in or on objects.,
Be wary of students who use the bathroom during an exam.",How to Catch Students Cheating2," If your class is in a large auditorium, it can be very easy for students to see exams of people around them. If there is enough room, have students space themselves out so that there are empty seats in between students.


Monitor the students carefully by walking around the classroom throughout the exam.
Use at least two different versions of the exam so that people sitting next to each other do not have the same version., Keep your eyes on the students for the entire exam. Watch for signs of cheating. Someone might look up at the ceiling pretending to work out an answer, but they are really trying to see a classmate’s paper. Others might look down at their lap constantly, either trying to see their notes poking out of their bag, or at their phone in their lap.

, A student might come up to the front of the class with a question, which will take your attention away from your classroom monitoring. This gives the other students a few moments to pass notes, look at their phones or otherwise engage in cheating behavior., If you notice a student continuously coughing, tapping the bench or their foot, or whispering, they may be cheating.


Students might have different signs for different answers; for example, on a multiple choice test, if the answer is A, they might tap their pencil. If the answer is B, they might shuffle their test around, and so on.

, Whispering to another student is usually a pretty clear sign that someone is cheating or trying to cheat. Tell students that there is no talking allowed during the exam.

, On a multiple choice test, some students might write a large letter A (or whatever the answer is) next to a question, so that their answer is easy to read from the vantage point of another student. You can prevent this if you use different versions of the test, for example, and make questions 4 and 5 multiple choice on one test and questions 2 and 3 multiple choice on the other version.

, One of the most longstanding methods of cheating is to write answers on a student’s hand or arm, in between fingers, or on another body part.


Many students are quite savvy about this strategy, bringing alcohol wipes to remove pen ink from their skin before turning in their test.
Students, especially females, might try writing notes on their legs. They will then wear a skirt of a particular length that covers the writing but that can be inched upward to reveal the notes. Teachers should be wary of challenging a student who has writing on their legs; a female student might cite harassment if you are looking at her legs.Look for writing on clothing. Many students will wear hats to an exam and will write notes on the bill of the hat. Ask students to remove hats or turn them around so that you foil their attempts at reading their notes. Other articles of clothing are often used in cheating, such as scarves, sweaters, coats, sunglasses, and so on.

, Some students have used rubber bands to store notes. They will stretch out the rubber band and write notes so they are just barely legible. When the rubber band is unstretched, it will look like it has black lines on it. During an exam, the student will stretch and unstretch the rubber band to get the answers.Other students have been known to write notes on very small pieces of paper and store them rolled up in a pen with a clear body.

, A student may ask to leave the class to use the bathroom. This person might be using that time to check their phone for notes or otherwise look at notes. Before allowing a student to go to the bathroom, have him or her leave his phone in the testing room (make sure you see with your own eyes that it was left in the room).

"
"
Establish a no-phone policy.,
Be vigilant with calculators.,
Prohibit headphones during class.,
Use a small cell phone detection device.",How to Catch Students Cheating3," Mobile phones are capable of storing a lot of information that is easily accessible to the user. They can also be hard to monitor. Establish a policy stating that mobile phones are not allowed in the classroom. Strictly enforce the policy so that students are not tempted to use this method.

, Many calculators, especially more advanced ones, are easily programmable. Students can store formulas and equations that enable them to cheat on exams. Carefully monitor use of calculators or prohibit use of them altogether.


Another option is to ask your department to buy simple calculators that can be used for exams. This way, students will not need to bring their own.
If it is prohibitively expensive to buy calculators for students, you can instruct students to ""clear"" their calculators, and check if they have done so. , Some students might load an audio file of themselves reading notes and listen to this during an exam. Prohibit the use of headphones and watch for mp3 players or other devices that might be used to transmit information.

, This device is usually small enough to fit discreetly in your pocket and will vibrate when it detects any nearby cellular use.


Some cell phone detectors are sensitive enough to allow teachers to walk around the classroom and identify active cell phone use based on proximity.

"
"
Know your students' writing styles.,
Use an anti-plagiarism checker.,
Invite the student to your office to discuss the paper.",How to Catch Students Cheating4," As a teacher, you will likely be able to recognize the student’s writing style. Watch for changes in writing ability, tone, and overall quality. Trust your instinct when reading student work. If something looks inauthentic, it probably is.


Search online for suspect passages from your student’s paper. Oftentimes, you’ll find the exact same passage in Wikipedia or another website.

, There are several programs that will detect plagiarism in written work by comparing the paper with other papers in the database and on the internet. Ask students to submit papers to online programs such as Turnitin.com or SafeAssign.

, A student’s paper, written excellently and eloquently, might raise your suspicions if that student does not typically perform so well in class. Invite your student to visit your office hours to talk about the paper. If the student wrote the paper, he should be able to talk intelligently about the topic. If he didn’t write it, there will likely be less confident discussion of the subject.You still may not have proof of cheating, however, but the student might recognize that you’re aware of their scheme.


Many students buy papers from “paper mills” or “essay mills,” which are websites and other services which sell essays for a fee. If your student’s paper is phenomenal, he might have purchased the essay from one of these services. It is difficult to prove this, however, so proceed with caution.

"
"
Listen to hallway conversations.,
Sign up for the class social media group under an assumed name.,
Be cautious with favorite students.,
Protect your physical and digital spaces.",How to Catch Students Cheating5," Students generally talk to their friends about tests and even about the answers to tests.


For example, keep an eye on students who leave your first period class after a test. If they walk a little with a second period student, they may be sharing answers or passing cheat sheets.

, Some students will create a private group on Facebook or Google for the class, using it to exchange notes. If the class is large enough, you might be able to sign up for the class posing as a student, using an assumed name.Some course management systems, such as Blackboard, have an option of letting students email each other without the instructor seeing the emails. Change the preferences so that you also see the emails that students send out through the system.

, Often, students might pretend that they are interested in the class, visiting you in office hours and engaging with the class material. These students might butter you up so that you don’t suspect them of cheating because you perceive them to be good students., Do not allow students to be in your classroom when you are not there. Lock filing cabinets and desk drawers to prevent students from looking at tests, and watch for this behavior when you are in the classroom as well.


Create and memorize complex passwords for computer and grade book log-ins; do not write this information on paper.

Announce academic dishonesty policies for online courses.,
Try webcam monitoring.,
Try signature tracking.,
Administer exams at testing centres.,
Use an anti-plagiarism checker.",How to Catch Students Cheating6," For many students, the online course environment may be less clear in terms of what constitutes academic dishonesty. Make sure you establish academic dishonesty policies for your students and give clear examples about what constitutes cheating in an online class., Some online courses will require that students use a webcam when they take an exam. This ensures that the right person is taking the test, and that students are not collaborating with each other on an exam. This might also reduce the chance of cheating.

, Signature tracking is another way to monitor online course participation. This requires a student to verify his identity with photo identification and his unique typing pattern., Some online courses might require students to take exams at a testing centre so that they are monitored and restricted from cheating., There are several programs that will detect plagiarism in written work by comparing the paper with other papers in the database and on the internet. Ask students to submit papers to online programs such as Turnitin.com or SafeAssign.

"
"
Have proof of the cheating.,
Confiscate notes or other material.,
Ask a student to reproduce test answers in your office.,
Be familiar with your school’s academic dishonesty policies.",How to Catch Students Cheating7," It can be difficult to provide concrete evidence of cheating, but it is important to make sure you have proof before you make any allegations.


If you found plagiarism in your student’s paper, try to locate the original passage by searching online.
Photocopy a random sample of exams or major assignments before returning them to students. A common temptation for cheaters is submitting a modified exam for a regrade, especially if they are close and want to be moved across a grade boundary.

, If you catch a student using notes to cheat on a test, gather these as soon as you discover it. Do so discreetly so as to not disrupt your other students., When you suspect someone of cheating, confront him after the exam. If he is not forthcoming about cheating, ask him to reproduce the answers for the exam. If he is unable to do so, he may have cheated.

, Check with your school before applying penalties for cheating. Doing so without following established procedures can put you at risk for legal action.

Create two or more versions of the exam.,
Ask for outlines and rough drafts.,
Allow students to bring in a cheat sheet.,
Design collaborative assignments.,
Change assessments to emphasize subject mastery.",How to Catch Students Cheating8," To prevent students from looking at each other’s papers during an exam, create two versions of the test. Pass them out so that the first student in the row has Test A, the next student has Test B, the third student has Test A, and so on.


Alternately, use the same version of the exam but photocopy them on different coloured paper and tell the students that there are two versions.

, Students might try to download entire essays or research papers from the internet, or they might have friends who’ve completed the assignment in a different term. If you ask for outlines and rough drafts of their papers, they will need to demonstrate their process of writing, which helps curb some plagiarism and cheating., Nip cheating in the bud by allowing them to cheat, at least by bringing an index card sized cheat sheet to the exam. This may not entirely eliminate cheating, but it will likely reduce some cheating, keep in mind that when using this method you must monitor your students sharply, as two or more index cards can be disguised as one.

, Students often prefer doing team-oriented projects and other assignments, collaborating with each other, instead of working individually. If your assignments emphasize collaboration, students may be less prone to cheating., Many students claim that they cheat because they worry about their grade. Learning the subject is the lesser concern. If you emphasize that mastering the subject is the important part, not the grade, students may be less inclined to cheat.Portfolios are often a good way for students to demonstrate mastery, as they can show how they have grasped concepts and improved over time.

Prevention is better than cure.,
Remind the students of the rules and the penalties for cheating.

,
Separate the students or seat them in such a way that they cannot easily look onto one another's papers.,
Watch out for students who are glancing at their lap, their pencil case or another potential hiding place.,
Maintain complete silence in the exam so whispering can be easily detected.

,
If the student wasn't paying attention during class and you had to call his/her name, he/she was probably cheating.,
If the student acts a little abnormal when you award him/her a pass, he/she might have been copying someone else's paper.,
Always let students practice before a test so they can get the idea of what they are doing.,
If you are given a paper or project from a student which seems beyond their usual ability, a quick oral test will usually determine if they know the information or if they were cheating.,
If a student did abnormally well and there is no evidence of cheating, you should congratulate them and tell them you expect the standard to be maintained.",How to Catch a Student Cheating on a Written Test," Before the exam begins, ask for all mobile phones, electronic devices and textbooks to be placed on the teacher's desk. Have the students clear their desk of everything but their pencil case before you hand out the papers.;
,, If the desk are designed so two students sit side by side, sit on student at the edge of the desk, at a 90 degree angle to their usual position.

, They may be leaning in such a way that doesn't seem necessary for completing the paper. Observe them for a few minutes and, if you suspect cheating, walk down to them and stand behind them. You might see what they are cheating off, giving you enough evidence to cancel their test, and if you can't, it will still give them a strong warning.

,, He/she might think that they can do whatever they want, but don't attempt to accuse anyone of cheating when behaving this way.

, Try to pay extra attention to students who talk a lot.

, Give them some papers to practice for homework.

, It could be basic questions on the topic. Be aware that shy students may seize up if you use this method and that, if it was a project, they are unlikely to remember exact details.

Before the educator can develop a strategy to reduce, substitute or eliminate a problem behavior, the antecedents need to be determined.,
Noticing the behavioral disorders and recognizing before they occur is beneficial in preventing and reducing misbehaving.,
Basic Outline of steps in reducing problem behaviors:


Identify the specifics of the problem behavior and the conditions that prompt and reinforce it.,
When trying to boost students rates of on-task behavior:


Capture students attention before giving directions, such as direct eye contact
Keep students guessing through class participation
Proximity control
Give opportunities for choice

",How to Address a Student's Problem Behavior," For example, a child who is mismatched with the instruction (the material is too difficult or too easy), the lesson is planned poorly and disorganized, or there are adverse influential factors in the classroom setting. All of these situations can cause the child to react in an inappropriate manner. It is the teacher's responsibility to be prepared and make sure that there are no poor transitions or opportunities for the students to be off task. Another influence that might cause misbehaving are cognitive disorders, such as Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder (ADHD). All of these symptoms or reasons as to why students can get off topic is the teacher's responsibility to address and prevent them from happening. (School-wide Strategies for Managing Off-task/Inattention).;
, They become apparent when the student displays a repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior that results in the significant disruption in other students. Such disturbances may cause significant impairments in academic and/or social functioning. When adjusting and recognizing inappropriate behaviors early on, students can learn strategies to cope with adverse situations that result in problem behaviors since such a behavior pattern is consistent throughout the individuals life.


The characteristics of a behavioral disorder among children and adolescents are: Initiation of aggressive behavior and reacting aggressively towards others, a display of bullying, threatening, or intimidating behavior, being physically abusive of others, deliberate destruction of someone else's property, showing little empathy and concern for the feelings, wishes, and well being of others, showing callous behavior towards others and lack of feelings of guilt or remorse, they may readily inform on their companions and tend to blame others for their own misdeeds.
(Strategies for teaching students with behavioral disorders).

, Monitor in which conditions does the problem behavior occur and not occur. Find effective and efficient intervention strategies that respond to the needs of the individual student within the classroom.
Modify the classroom environment to decrease problem behavior by rearranging environment, schedule or learning activities to meet the students needs. Also, individually adapt instruction to promote high rates of student engagement and on-task behavior.
Teach and reinforce new skills to increase appropriate behavior and preserve a positive classroom climate. Actively teach students socially and behaviorally, appropriate skills to replace problem behaviors using strategies focused on both individual students and the whole classroom.
Draw on relationships with professional colleagues and students’ families for continued guidance and support.
Assess whether school wide behavior problems warrant adopting schoolwide strategies or programs, and if so, implement ones shown to reduce negative and foster positive interactions.

, Japanese kanji were first adopted over a thousand years ago from Chinese characters for use with the Japanese language.Since then, two simplified writing systems, hiragana and katana, have descended from Chinese characters. However, kanji is used with them in conjunction. Nouns and stems of adjectives and verbs are written with kanji, and there is often more than one reading of the same character.

, Each character can be broken up into a set of radicals which are basically simpler, smaller characters.The radicals are simplified from standalone characters, so sometimes you may have already learned some of the radicals.
Each radical has its own meaning.
These make complicated looking kanji easier to digest in simpler chunks.

, An effective strategy in studying is ""telling a story"" with the radicals, or coming up with a logical story between the radicals that creates the meaning of the whole kanji.


For example, the character above 男 (male), is made up of 田 (rice paddy) and 力 (power). An example story: a powerful male worker works in the rice paddy.
Mnemonics with kanji readings are also helpful.

, Repeating the character over and over again feels repetitive, but will build muscle memory and comfort writing kanji in general.


Many kanji share radicals, so practicing one kanji can help you write other kanji.

, The cheapest, quickest way to review kanji is with flashcards. A common way is to have the kanji on one side, and meaning and reading on the back.


Study often instead of longer. Your brain benefits more from reviewing a little each day instead of marathon sessions.
Study kanji you aren't familiar with more often, but also studying familiar ones every once and awhile -- this is part of the proven spaced repetition system., Find others also learning kanji to offer you tips and tricks for remembering them. Also, you can hold each other accountable while you study.

, Make sure to keep up your studies to put the kanji in your long term memory.

, These can offer guided kanji practice and learning that go along with relevant vocabulary and grammar. Putting kanji into practice is an excellent way to remember them, so working through a textbook can be very helpful. Popular textbooks include:

, This makes studying seem less like studying and is a more natural absorption of kanji. Start with Japanese children's books (that usually have furigana), and eventually work your way up to something more challenging like a newspaper or website. Anything that gets you using kanji will help!

Count the number of strokes.,
Analyze how hiragana is written.,
Take a look at how katakana is written.,
Check for lots of strokes and detail.,
Look for spaces.","How to Tell Katakana, Hiragana and Kanji Apart"," The amount of strokes used in a hiragana or katakana character is limited to four. If you see more than four strokes, the character is almost certainly a kanji symbol. However, some kanji use less than four strokes, such as 人 or 大.
, Compared to kanji and katakana, characters are typically round and curvy. If you look at the character ""い"" (which is ""i""), you can see that both strokes are curved. Similarly, ""さ"" (""sa""), ""か"" (""ka""), and other hiragana characters are rounded or curved compared to their katakana counterparts.

, Katakana tends to use mainly straight strokes, and looks rather sharp compared to hiragana. For example, ""イ"", which is ""i"" in katakana, is only slightly curved. ""サ"" (""sa"") and ""カ"" (""ka"") have minimal curves compared to their hiragana writings.

, Looking at kanji characters, you can see that most of them are intricate and detailed, usually using many lines and standing out from the simpler katakana and hiragana characters. For example, ""面"" uses nine strokes, and ""愛"" uses thirteen.

, Unlike languages using the Roman alphabet, spaces typically aren't used to tell words apart in Japanese. If something written in Japanese is using spaces, it's likely written in hiragana, as kanji is used to separate words instead of spaces."

",How to Speak in a Japanese Accent," The 'R' actually sounds a bit strange - a mix between an 'R' and an 'L' but it is tricky for non-Japanese to pronounce this sound so you can initially just say 'Lu'. So 'Far' would be 'Falu' (very light 'u')., So 'A' in 'Are' would be soft 'Airu' (very light 'u')., So 'D' in 'Cold' would be very soft 'Do', instead of the very soft 'Duh' in English., So 'Cold' would be 'Corudo' (very soft 'u' and ending 'o'), instead of 'Col-duh' in English., So the word 'Think' would be pronounced 'Sink'.

, So 'The' becomes 'Ze'

, So 'Is' would be 'Izu' or 'Isu', and 'Smith' would be 'Sumisu'. For example:


""Hello, my name is John Smith"" would be ""Haruro, my naimu izu John Sumisu""., So 'Very' is pronounced 'Bery'.

,, So 'Fish' would be 'Hish'.

, Instead of thinking of pronouncing character as 'Carikter', try focusing on pronouncing each syllable 'Cah-lic-tel'.

, Think about ""ittsu beri korudo in hiaa.""

,, For example, you could talk about what you did/are going to do today.

, This could be on a video or in real life, if you know anyone who is Japanese.

, The more the better! Sou desu yo ne! Well, sometimes. No one wants to listen to ""blah blah blah right. blah blah blah eh."" Use them sparingly. Like, if you use them in one sentence, don't use them again till 2 sentences later.

,, Instead of Kore wa use the proper name--it's more polite and natural. With your buddies you can refer to others as koitsu or aitsu but keep in mind these words are so informal so as to be rude in some situations.

, Use their name instead. People usually refer to their friends as omae or kimi, but don't do that unless you're really good friends.

, You may find yourself saying ""Taberaru ma!"" instead of ""Tabenasai."" People will be more comfortable around you.

, Warning: this will make you sound like you're from the countryside, but people from the more rural areas might get sentimental at the way you speak.

, Actually pronounce that long oo or chisai tsu. Say Toukyo the way the Japanese do. This is a little advanced, but learn about devoiced vowels and pronounce the words correctly. For example, 'kishi' (coast) is pronounced 'kshi'--ever notice that? And 'suki' (like) is pronounced ski. Most U sounds are either barely pronounced or silent.

, These translate to the equivalent of ""um"", ""uh"", and ""well then"". Throw 'nanka' in anywhere you please, but beware, too many nankas sounds like a teenagerish ""like...like...like"" in English.

, While Japanese does not place stress and accents on words like English does, it does have a pitch accent, making homophones like hashi (bridge) and hashi (chopsticks) sound different."

Learn Hiragana.,
Learn some Katakana.,
Learn Kanji.,
Avoid relying on Romaji.,
Practice grammar.,
Learn some key phrases.",How to Start Learning Japanese1," Hiragana is the Japanese alphabet. It is comprised of 51 phonetic characters, and each character stands for exactly one sound. (This is different from English in which one letter may sound different in different contexts). Once you know Hiragana, you will know how to pronounce any word in Japanese. Begin your Japanese journey by studying and memorizing these characters., Katakana is a series of characters used to stand for non-Japanese words (such as hot dog or internet). You will want to learn the Katakana terms for English words you are likely to use., Kanji are Chinese symbols that are used to stand for basic words and phrases in Japanese. Whereas Hiragana symbols are more like English letters (depicting simple sounds), Kanji symbols are used to depict complete words. Knowing some basic Kanji will enable you to understand and speak basic Japanese., Romaji is a system of using English letters to spell Japanese words. Romaji can be useful for learning initial key phrases, or for online communications. If you rely too much on Romaji, however, you will never move on to a genuine grasp of the language. Focus your study on Hiragana, Katakana, and some Kanji., In order to learn Japanese grammar, you’ll need to try to forget everything you already know about grammar. Don’t apply the rules and concepts of your native language to Japanese. Instead, try to take the rules of Japanese grammar at face value.Obtain a Japanese grammar workbook and begin following the lessons. Some good choices include ""Practice Makes Perfect: Basic Japanese"" and ""A Guide to Japanese Grammar"" by Tae Kim.
Locate free online resources (such as Duolingo) to study Japanese grammar.

, Learning a few key phrases will allow you to begin practicing, and may allow you to enjoy some casual conversation with a Japanese speaker. Although Romaji should not be relied upon, using Romaji to learn these basic phrases can work as a good jumping off point.Hello - Kon'nichiwa
Goodbye - Sayonara
I'm fine, thanks - Watashiwa genki desu. Arigato.
Thank you very much - Domo arigato gozaimasu
Nice to meet you - Hajime mash'te

Make mistakes!,
Enroll in a class.",How to Start Learning Japanese2," You can purchase Japanese language flashcards, or make them yourself at home. You can then practice with them in a variety of ways. Flashcard can be a great way to strengthen your vocabulary in all three language systems (Hiragana, Kanji, or Katakana).Post the flashcards around your house to label items with their Japanese names.
You can have a friend quiz you with flashcards to practice your memorization of Hiragana letters, Kanji words, or words in Katakana.
You can use the flashcards to quiz yourself.

, Small children are fantastic at learning new languages because they are not afraid to mimic sounds. They are not embarrassed. Tap into that childlike shamelessness, and practice repeating Japanese sounds, words, and phrases, even if you you’re not pronouncing them quite right., The very best way to strengthen what you have learned and fine-tune your grammar is to practice your Japanese with another person. If you have a friend that is a native speaker, make a date and chat with them!If you don’t know any native speakers, you can search for international meet-ups or language exchange groups in your area.

, Another great option is to video-chat with a native speaker. There are numerous online resources that pair language partners together. Seek out a new friend who speaks Japanese and speak to them using your computer., Making mistakes and getting corrected by native speakers is probably the most effective way to learn the nuances of Japanese. Don’t avoid words that you are aren’t sure about or skip over phrases that you may mispronounce. Making mistakes means that you are genuinely trying to learn.Move outside your comfort zone.
Get feedback from others.
Some Japanese speakers may not want to correct you out of respect, so make it clear that you’d appreciate some guidance.

, One of the most effective ways to learn a new language is enroll in a class. With the guidance of an instructor, lesson plans, workbooks, and best of all, lots of other people to practice with, enrolling in a Japanese language class can be an excellent use of your time. In addition to helping you learn the language, a class like this can help you meet new people.

Watch Japanese movies.,
Read.,
Listen to Japanese radio.,
Immerse yourself.,
Watch people talk.,
Use electronic dictionaries.",How to Start Learning Japanese3," In order to learn Japanese, you’ll want to expose yourself to as much of the language as you can. Spend your down time watching films or television shows in Japanese. This will expose you to a wider range of terms (including slang) and provide you with another avenue to sharpen your understanding skills., Try to get your hands on Japanese books or a Japanese newspaper. This will expose you to a whole host of new words and phrases, and reading is a very active way to learn. By trying to read in Japanese you will engage deeply with this new language., Like television and films, listening to Japanese radio can be a great resource for encountering new words and practice listening. Seek out Japanese music with lyrics and try to sing along. Or look for Japanese talk radio.Japanese podcasts or language learning podcasts can be great resources as well.

, Placing yourself in a completely immersive environment is the most effective way to learn a foreign language. If you have the opportunity to go to Japan, or even to spend time with a Japanese family in America, take it. If you have any Japanese friends, see if it is possible for you to spend a bit of time at their home., Speaking Japanese will require you use your mouth in a different way than you are used to. In order to produce the proper sounds, you may need to make new shapes with your lips and tongue. Watch the mouth of a Japanese-speaker to get a visual understanding of how to produce these sounds in your mouth., Trying to find Kanji words in a paper dictionary can be tedious. Instead, use electronic dictionaries to expand your vocabulary, fill in gaps in conversation, and aid in your understanding of new terms. You may use a free online dictionary, download an app for your phone, or invest in a pocket translator."

More informally, you can say ""gomen"" (ごめん) or ""gomen ne/na"" (ごめんね/ごめんな), which are pronounced the same way as the ""gomen"" in ""gomen nasai"". ""Gomen na"" is a casual way for a man or boy to apologize to his friends and is never used by women.;
, This is more often used as something more similar to ""excuse me"", but is still classed as an apology - for example, if you bump into someone on the street. Pronounce it as ""sue-me-MAH-sen""., This is often translated as ""pardon me"", but it actually would literally mean ""allow me to bother you"", and is a step up from ""sumimasen"".

",How to Say Sister in Japanese," Each one is set out as a separate part below.

, It is ""oneesama."" It translates to ""elder sister."" However, oneesama isn't really a word you would use on a day-to-day basis. Perhaps if you were apologizing to your sister for a huge offense, in awe of her, or just a super-polite person in all situations, you would use it.;
, There are some elements of the word you might want to consider. In Japanese, honorifics (suffixes that indicate status and respect) are very important. It's best to understand them.


""O-"" This prefix indicates respect. On other forms of sister, it's optional, but if you dropped it from ""oneesama,"" because...
""-sama"" is the most respectful honorific in mainstream Japanese. It emphasizes that the speaker is lower in status than the person they're talking about. In Japanese-to-English translations, this is often translated as ""Lord,"" ""Lady,"" or ""Sir."" (It is used for either gender.)
Dropping ""o-"" while using ""-sama"" would be something like saying ""his Highness, the illustrious buddy of mine.""
""Ne"" or ""nee"" can be found in every Japanese word for ""elder sister.""

, However, you need to make it a ""pure"" o-sound. Notice how in ""oh"" your voice blurs into a ""w"" sound. That never happens in Japanese.

, Your first instinct might be to say ""knee,"" but the pronunciation is closer to ""neigh."" Only ""i"" makes the long e sound in Japanese. Again, you need to keep a pure ""e"" sound. Don't let it blur into a ""y"" sound. Note that ""nee"" is actually made up of two syllables. This is a difficult thing to pronounce for an English speaker; try clapping for each syllable while saying them slowly to get a sense of it.

, It's probably almost identical to what you pronounced it as in your head. The Japanese ""a"" is pronounced like the a in ""father."" Again, don't let it drift into another sound. Keep it short and clipped. ""Sa-ma.'

, Japanese is spoken with minimal inflection, so try not to emphasize any syllable. You should sound monotonous, if anything.

,


""Oneesan"" is more polite, due to the ""o-"".
""-san"" is respectful. You would use it with people socially equal to you or with someone you don't know very well.

,, The ""-sa-"" in ""-san"" is pronounced the same as in ""-sama"". This is one great thing about Japanese: sounds are consistent and don't vary between words, with a few exceptions. The Japanese ""n"" sounds like the English ""n"". If anything, it sounds a little like the English ""m"", depending on the speaker.

,,


""-chan"" is an honorific used almost exclusively on females. This is a casual, friendly, even endearing honorific that you might use talking to a small child, or a schoolgirl might use for her good friends.
The respectful ""o-"" combined with the friendly ""-chan"" gives the formal a feeling of adoration.

, The pronunciation is the same as above for ""o-"", ""-nee-"", ""n"", and ""a"". The ""ch"" sounds just like it does in English.

,, This word is a bit different. The forms gone over so far are used to address your sister. ""Ane"" is used when talking about your older sister.


Note the ""-ne-"" common to ""older sister"" words.

,, It's also slang for a female member of your street gang, but that's another story.


""Ane"" is pronounced as above.
""ki"" sounds like key. Don't drag out the ""ey"" sound, though. Keep it short, as demonstrated before.

, Say Aneki.

, Typically, older siblings address younger ones by name, so there's not a big need for ""liitle sister"" words.


Don't add honorifics ""-chan"" or ""-kun"" to the end. These are only used with ""imouto"" when you're being rude and condescending to your little sister.
Add ""-san"" when talking about someone else's little sister.
""-ou-"" means you double the ""o"" sound, as before with the ""e"" sound in ""nee.""
""i"" and ""o"" are pronounced as above. The ""m"" and ""t"" sound as they do in English.

,"
"
Say ""damare"" as a good all-around ""shut up."",
To speak from a position of authority, say ""damarinasai."",
Say ""yakamashī"" for a semi-rude form of ""you're being too loud."",
Alternatively, say ""urusai."",
Say ""shizuka ni shiro yo!"",
Use ""yarou"" at the end to emphasize your anger or contempt.",How to Say Shut up in Japanese1," Try this easy phrase for your everyday ""shut up"" usage. It's pronounced ""dah-mah-ray."" ""Dah"" and ""mah"" both more or less rhyme with ""raw"". Note that the r sound used here is light and fast like a Spanish r. The r is pronounced with a light flick of the tongue, almost like an English d or the two ts in the word ""butter.""In Japanese, this phrase is written ""黙れ"".
If you really want to make an impression, try rolling the r sound at the end of the word. This can be used in Japanese to give great emotion or emphasis to a word. This, too resembles the Spanish rolled r sound.;
, If you want to tell someone to shut up as if you are someone with power over them (like a boss or a policeman), use this option. It's pronounced ""dah-mah-ree-nah-sigh."" The the first three syllables are just like ""damare,"" only with a long e sound (as in ""tea"") at the end. ""Nah"" also rhymes with ""raw"" and the final ""sigh"" is pronounced like the English word. The approximate meaning here is ""silence!""


This phrase is written ""黙りなさい"".

, This phrase literally means ""noisy,"" but implies that the person you're talking about should shut up. It's pronounced ""yah-kah-mah-shee"" (basically how its English form is spelled). The one thing to watch out for is the ""shee"" at the end — in Japanese, these long vowels at the ends of words are held about twice as long as normal vowels. This can give this phrase an almost ""whining"" quality to an English ear as the final syllable is held out for something like ""yakamasheeee.""This phrase is written ""やかましい"".

, This phrase is very similar in meaning to yakamashī. It's pronounced ""ooh-roo-sigh."" Note that, in Japanese, the lips don't move forward for the long u sound.Thus, the vowel sounds in ""ooh"" and ""roo"" should sound about halfway between the ""oo"" in ""root"" and the u in ""rut."" This can take a little practice.


This phrase is written ""うるさい"".
Don't forget to use the light, quick r sound by flicking your tongue against the top of your mouth.

, for an angry ""be quiet!"" This phrase is basically an abrupt, rude way to ask for quiet. It's a good choice if you've already asked someone nicely to be quiet and gotten no response. Pronounce this phrase ""shee-zoo-kah knee shee-roh yo."" Remember again that the Japanese u sound is made without moving the lips forward.


This phrase is written ""静か に 白 よ"".

, Japanese doesn't have true ""swear words"" the way that other languages do, but it does have insults you can add to your phrases to express how upset you are with someone. ""Yarou"" is one of these insults — its meaning is somewhat similar to ""bastard"" or ""unpleasant person"" in English.""Yarou"" is pronounced roughly like ""yeah-row"". Use the short a sound (as in ""apple"") for the first syllable — the second is similar to the English word ""row.


To use this word, add it after you say an adjective like ""urusai"" or ""yakamashi."" For instance, ""urusai yarou"" means, basically, ""shut up, you noisy, annoying person.""
""Yarou"" is written ""野郎"".

"
"
Say ""shizukani"" for ""be quiet."",
Say ""shizukani shite kudasai"" for ""please be quiet."",
Respond with ""arigatō"" when you get what you ask for.",How to Say Shut up in Japanese2," This fairly standard phrase is a neutral way to ask someone to be quiet without any insulting connotations. You may, for instance, hear teachers use this to quiet students during study time. ""Shizukani"" is pronounced ""shih-zoo-kah-knee."" The first syllable uses the short i sound (as in ""pit""), while the last syllable uses the long e sound (as in ""tea""). Note that the last syllable here doesn't have the extra-long emphasis used in ""yakamashī.""


This phrase is written ""静かに"".
This option is still a little abrupt and forceful to use with strangers, so you'll probably want to opt for the phrase below if you want to be extra-delicate.

, This is one of the most polite ways you can ask someone else to be quiet — for instance, it's perfect for hushing noisy people around you in a movie theater. ""Shizukani"" is pronounced exactly as in the step above. ""Shite"" is pronounced ""she-tay"" (use the long e sound as in tea for the first syllable). ""Kudusai is pronounced ""koo-dah-sigh."" Once again, the u sound is made without moving the lips forward.


This phrase is written ""静か に して ください"".
Remember the word ""kudasai"" — it's Japanese for ""please,"" so you'll end up using it a lot if you learn more common Japanese phrases.

, If you ask someone to be quiet politely and they do quiet down, don't forget to say thanks! ""Arigatō"" is an all-purpose Japanese way to say ""thank you."" It's pronounced ""ah-ree-gah-toe."" Use the delicate Japanese r sound made with a flick of your tongue described above. You'll also want to hold the final o sound a little longer than normal (just like you did for the ī in ""yakamashī"")


This phrase is written ""ありがとう"".
For ""thank you very much,"" you can say ""arigatou gozaimasu."" ""Gozaimasu"" is pronounced ""go-zye-moss."" Note that the second syllable rhymes with ""eye"" and the u at the end is not pronounced. This phrase is written ""ありがとう ございます"".

Know the word for ""scary"".,
Pronounce the word properly.,
Be aware of a similar word.,
Learn a few sentences with the word ""kowai"".",How to Say Scary in Japanese," In Japanese, the word for scary is kowai, pronounced as ""ko-why"". The word can be rendered in two ways: hiragana (こわい) and kanji (怖い). However, they're both read the same way.


The term ""kowai"" literally translates to ""frightening"", as Japanese is much more formal than English. However, the meaning still comes off as the same.;
, Japanese words often rely on which part of the word is emphasized to show what word it is. When speaking Japanese, pronounce ""kowai"" as ""koh-WHY"", with the emphasis on the ""why""., In Japanese, the term ""kowai"" can be mistaken for ""kawaii"", pronounced as ""KA-why-ee"". However, these are two completely different words; the term ""kawaii"", written as かわいい (or less commonly, 可愛い), describes the concept of something being cute. It's also pronounced with more emphasis on the beginning of the word, rather than the end. Be careful not to mix these two up.

, To learn how the word ""kowai"" is integrated into Japanese sentences, you may want to learn a few sentences. However, this may be a bit easier if you learn Japanese grammar and sentence structure all at once, rather than just focusing on one word.


The most common phrase you'll probably hear in Japanese media is 「怖いです！」(kowai des!). It's a simple version of Scary! or That's scary!

Fidgeting (known as ""stimming"" in the autistic community) can help autistic children concentrate and stay calm.Try giving them an object to manipulate in one hand as they work, such as a squishy stress ball, a tangle, a little beanbag, or whatever they prefer.,
Make sure the child knows how to express basic needs.,
Make sure the learning environment is well-stocked with objects that can help you to teach the child math.",How to Teach Math Facts to an Autistic Child," They may not tell you that they do not understand, or they may not be following your explanation at all. If they do not understand, they will more than likely not ask the appropriate questions.


If the child is partially verbal or nonverbal, give them time to communicate with alternative communication. This may be typing, sign language, or something else.
If the child cannot use AAC, teaching basic communication should take priority over teaching math.;
, They may have trouble with auditory processing, or translating sounds into words inside their head. If this is the case, written/visual aids can be helpful.


Many concepts can be shown through visual examples, but they are generally paired with verbal instructions. This is where the difficulty lies. Try to use visual cues as often as possible when teaching your child.

, Autistic children may display little interest in subjects outside their special interests. In order to get them to pay attention and learn, you'll have to make it especially interactive and fun.

, Math is often associated with pencils and paper. Fine motor skills are generally affected, and this can create a challenge in terms of mathematics.Learning to write numerals, while manipulating them onto paper can be very overwhelming.


Technology can be utilized to overcome this issue to an extent—the child may find it easier to push buttons and touch screens than to physically grasp a pen.

, It is great to incorporate their interests into math problems. For example, if your daughter loves horses, use toy horses to demonstrate math facts.


If possible, try to find a horse workbook. This may peak interest regarding the work that needs to be completed.

, Although they may seem detached sometimes, autistic children are eager learners. Give them constant reassurance—this is very essential when learning to keep them motivated.


It will also keep them happier and associate learning time with positivity. Instead of dreading it, they may recognize it as a time they get positive attention.

, In terms of language, if your child or student has low verbal skills do not use responses that call for a 'yes' or a 'no'. The confusion associated with the language barrier may interfere with learning math concepts. Using multiple-choice based questions makes this barrier a bit easier to handle.

, Having children replicate your actions is highly successful. For example, you collect four blocks, then they collect four blocks. Show them how you're left with three books, once one is put somewhere else.


In essence, you are training the child to mirror you. She'll slowly see the conclusions of your actions and be able to draw conclusions herself when you're not around.

, Be conscious of their skill level and go from there. Your child may not be at their appropriate grade level, so focus on their skill level instead. Certain areas of math may come easier to them than others. This means that you may need to approach certain math topics at a different skill level than the next.


Just because a child is developmentally behind in terms of speaking does not mean they will be behind in math.
Sometimes, disinterest indicates that the work is not challenging enough. If this happens, try giving them harder work, or leaving a more difficult workbook out and seeing if they interact with it.

, Autistic children struggle with remembering sequences. If the child is able to read, write each instruction down. If the child struggles responding to the first set of instructions, do not confuse them by trying a second set.


Try narrating the steps one at a time as the child completes them. For example, ""First, you add two to both sides. Then, you divide both sides by 5. Now you have your answer, x = 7.""
Think of them as a foreign language learner. They need a bit more time to process what you're saying, so keep the instructions short and snappy. The easier they are to recall, the better.

, If your child has visual processing difficulties, many children find that black font is easier to process when it is on colored paper (reducing contrast).


A light blue, or tan is a great place to start. These are neutrals that the eye finds easy to process, too.

, Games have always been a light way to learn math as a lot of constructive games have been designed which centers the improvement of math skills of a child. The difficulty level also varies based on the age of the child.


Games are colorful and fun, making them grab children's attention. It is something that today’s kids are very fond of and would do without any resistant. This is like teaching them without even telling that they are being taught.
For instance, famous games like Candy Crush Saga have been working on improving segmentation logic and if we go a little higher on the difficulty level then we have 2048, a game which involves all math skills and facts.

, This makes it a pleasing sensory environment, especially for hypersensitive children. Try to sit near a wall or corner, so sensory input comes from fewer directions.

, The child will feel more comfortable in a familiar place, and will be less likely to be distracted by all the new elements.


For instance, while teaching addition and subtraction, you can take your child to your staircase, give a number to each stair with 0 in the middle, going upward towards +5 and coming downwards towards -5. He is to stand on 0 and asked to add 2 for which he can jump upstairs and if asked to subtract 3, he can come 3 steps down.

, Autistic children learn better if they're in a one-on-one environment.This helps them build self-esteem and confidence. You can focus specifically on their needs. There are also fewer distractions if they're the only ones in the room with you.


It's easier for you, too. Concentrating on one child is difficult enough—to concentrate on more would spread your attention thin.

, Keep the work space clear of various distractions. Visual distractions are very common, and may interfere with the learning process. Only put necessary items on the desk.


Keep all of the child’s work organized and in the same place, too. Keep all resources in one secure location. This way, the child can go back and review their lessons in detail. Lay out each concept clearly, isolating that specific example. That way, each concept is kept separate from other concepts.

, If they are very fidgety, try seating them on an exercise ball, so they can bounce as they work.


To make it fun, try keeping a sensory bin of colorful fidgets, and tell the child to pick one out before the lesson begins.
Their stimming may look unusual to you (e.g. rocking or bouncing). Even if it does, assume that it serves an important purpose. Only intervene if it's unsanitary (e.g. putting objects in their mouth) or harmful (hitting themselves), in which case you can suggest a different stim to them (chewing gum, hitting a pillow).
Excessive fidgeting (i.e., fidgeting to the point that they cannot do any work) indicates that they are stressed, or they are not getting enough exercise.

, If the child cannot do this, they may be unable to tell you when something is wrong, and you will wonder why they aren't focusing like usual. The child should know how to say...


""I need a break, please."" (A five-minute break for stimming can calm an overwhelmed child.)
""I'm hungry/thirsty.""
""I need to go potty.""
""_____ is bothering me.""
""I don't understand.""
The child also needs to know that you will honor their requests. When they try to advocate their needs, immediately pay attention.

, Math has always been a subject which is learned better if taught with the help of a lot activities. Be it an autistic child or a neurotypical child, activities always help.


One of the most common tools that are used by almost all kids while learning basic addition and subtraction is the abacus. The abacus provides a visual representation that helps them understand the concepts behind basic math.
For instance, a pizza of 8 slices can be used to teach the basics of fractions. A full pizza is 8/8 but if 2 slices are taken out then the fraction becomes 6/8 which means 2 slices are missing. After the class, eat the pizza together. The child will always remember the pizza while doing fractions and put and take imaginary slices out of the imaginary box whenever she is doing a question.

Look into hiring a speech-language pathologist to assist in the development of communication skills.,
Understand that a speech-language pathologist can provide pragmatic language instruction.,
Get the child cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) to provide step-by-step instruction on social skills.,
Try social skills training to improve your child's non-verbal communication.",How to Teach Autistic Children to Start a Conversation1," Speech and language therapies can help identify alleviate the communication difficulties faced by an autistic child, especially in respect to striking a chord and starting a conversation with others.


Speech-language pathologists have the knack and expertise to help the child understand the nuances involved in starting a conversation and keeping it alive.
They can help the child acquire social skills and the ability to start a conversation.;
, Pragmatic communication is about using language in a way that satisfies the situation and abides by the conversation's unspoken rules. Because many autistic children do not know and understand the basics of starting a conversation, it can be hard for them to acquire nuanced conversational skills of their own.


Autistic children may not know how to maintain adequate distance from the other person, make eye contact, display facial expressions consistent with their feelings, vary their tone, modify their speech based on their conversation partner (e.g. using simpler words when talking to their little brother), and more.
Speech language therapists can assist the child in pragmatic language instruction, bolstering their ability to make particular speech sounds and modify their speech and tone according to the situation and audience.

, This is a type of therapy in which social skills can be taught in a step-wise manner. CBT uses a step-by-step approach where autistic children are exposed to highly structured activities to encourage the assimilation of social and adaptive skills.


These skills are imparted through highly structured activities in a step-wise manner for the children to assimilate and pick up.
CBT can also help children handle or overcome anxiety and depression, which are common issues for autistic children. This can make them less afraid to initiate conversation, as well as improving general quality of life.
This prevents them from committing mistakes and exposing himself to as many people as possible out of fear of embarrassment.

, Teaching, training, and practice structured by a skilled therapist can improve the way a child interacts with others. Therapists can used techniques such as social stories, role playing, and other visual techniques to teach and prepare the child to open up and communicate better in various social situations. RDI is one therapy that helps with this.


The therapy can include ways to help the child understand tone, eye contact, sarcasm, humor, hand gestures, and non-verbal cues.
These therapies can increase the confidence levels of your child.

Show your child how non-verbal language works.,
Talk about eye contact.,
Teach your child how to gauge the appropriate distance to maintain while having a conversation.,
Discuss the benefits of varying conversation topics.,
Assist your child in picking up non-verbal cues.,
Talk about how to deal with hostile people.,
Protect their self esteem, and don't let them believe that they're defective.",How to Teach Autistic Children to Start a Conversation2," Autistic children are mostly verbal communicators. However, communication and conversation are not limited to words.


Being able to strike the right conversation in the right manner involves non-verbal cues such as body language, tone of voice, facial expression, and eye contact.
Let your child know that proper conversation involves staying on track, choosing a good topic, taking the conversation in a direction that is interesting to all parties, and being able to sense others' feelings and steer the conversation accordingly.

, Autistic people often have trouble with eye contact, and may find it distracting or upsetting to make.Explain to them that non-autistic people usually like eye contact, and teach them some ways to fake it. Let them experiment and find what works best for them.


Ask if they are comfortable making eye contact. If they aren't sure, ask them to look you in the eye. A few autistic people can handle eye contact (but for most it is painful or counterproductive).
Discuss potential places they could look to feign eye contact: at the person's nose, mouth, eyebrows, or chin. They may want to practice on you, or in the mirror.

, Maintaining a good distance helps the other person feel comfortable. Autistic children may have a problem doing this, and tend to move too close to the other person. This can make the other person quite uncomfortable and does not serve as a good way to break the ice.


The ideal conversational distance with an acquaintance would be about an arm's length.

, Autistic children tend to be focused and are able to talk about their passions for great lengths, while non-autistic children get bored with this. Explain to your child how to accommodate non-autistic people's need for varying topics.


Using pictures, photos, cards, videos and computer apps, show them what a good conversation would look like and what the essential elements are.
Teach them how to ask questions to make the other person keep talking. Sometimes autistic people have an easier time letting the other person lead the conversation, because it is less exhausting.

, Autistic kids might not understand the significance of emotional or non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and eye contact. Try teaching these as a game, just as you'd teach math or science.


To assist them in picking up non-verbal cues, there are computer programs available that can be used to learn which non-verbal cues convey which messages and which emotions.
This may also help them become more aware of their own emotions.

, Many autistic children are bullied or antagonized, and while you can't make the bullies disappear from the face of the earth, you can help your child know how to recognize them and handle them.


Talk about turning it into a game (e.g. pretending to not hear or mishear, responding to insults with ""Thank you!"" and a sweet smile). Explain that this can confuse bullies. Try role-playing some scenarios and helping them select a few favorite strategies.
Discuss how to tell a grown-up, and what to do if the grown-up doesn't believe them or try to help.
Teach the phrase ""I'm okay, you're mean."" They can say this to the bullies, and use it to remind themselves that the bullies are wrong.

, Many autism groups and resources are based on the deficit model, one which emphasizes everything that is wrong with an autistic person. This can hurt their self esteem. Instead, tell them that they are different, that it's okay to be different, and they face unique challenges.


Try phrasing it as accommodating non-autistic people, rather than stating that autistic ways of communication are wrong or inferior.
You can even joke how non-autistic people are ""weird""—it sounds odd, but it can really help them feel like they aren't broken.

Instruct your child on the use of conversation starters.,
Use examples of conversation starters to build your child's confidence.,
Encourage your child to find topics that all parties enjoy.,
Talk about strategies for discussing their special interests.,
Use the conversation clock to assist your child in following the rules of conversation.,
Keep conversations fun.,
Allow your child to explore information and learn on the internet.,
Encourage budding friendships.",How to Teach Autistic Children to Start a Conversation3," Conversation starters are strategies that can be employed to strike up a conversation and maintain it. A conversation starter is like a practice kit equipping the child with all the tools necessary for them to initiate a conversation comfortably.


These conversation starters can be designed to include all the ""do’s, don’ts and how’s"" of initiating a conversation.
They can include what to address before starting a conversation, what to say to break the ice, what kind of topics to talk about depending on the age (what to talk about with peers, what to talk about with adults), how to start, how the conversation should go, what to avoid (as in interruption, monologuing, etc.), understanding the non-verbal cues, how to participate in the conversation, and how best to engage others.
Conversation starters can serve as practice tools/material. A conversation map is one such conversation starter., Preparation helps autistic children feel less worried about conversations (which can be a very daunting task to them). Try role-playing some sample conversations. When the autistic child is supposed to start a conversation with a peer or adult:


Identify the partner with whom the child has to interact.
Identify the reasons behind their intention to interact with the child (is it to play, is it to discuss a subject, etc.).
Identify the other child’s interests (meaningful interaction and conversation are possible only when the autistic child identifies what the other child’s interests are. Based on that, he can strike a conversation and keep it alive without boring the partner.).

, Oftentimes, autistic children don't realize that their favorite topic is not everyone's favorite topic. (For example, just because she loves to hold caterpillars and discuss their habits doesn't mean her classmates will share her delight).


Identify some topics that hold general appeal.
Encourage them to pay attention to how the other person feels about the topic, and to change the topic (e.g. ""So, how have you been?"") if the other person seems disinterested.
They can even try initiating a conversation or breaking the ice with questions such as ""What music do you like to listen to?"", ""Who is your favorite singer?"", ""Who is your favorite actor?"", ""What are the interesting places you have been to so far?""
Encourage them to join clubs or activities with children who share their topics of interest, so they can talk about what they love. Remind them that it is okay to want to share your favorite things with others.

, Make it clear that wanting to share your favorite things is always okay, and it's good to make sure that their conversation partner is interested. Teach them to read cues of disinterest so they can change the subject if the other person isn't interested.


Make sure they know that they don't have to hide their special interest, and that if something really excites them, they can tell you about it. This lets them know that you care about their happiness.
Find parts of their special interests that you like. For example, if they like dogs and you like to draw, maybe you could draw dogs together., A ‘Conversation clock’ is an assistive tool that helps autistic kids follow the rules of typical conversation. The conversation clock works by coding the conversation into images that indicate who is speaking, at what pitch and tone, who is being interrupted, by whom and for how long, among other indicators.


This serves to provide visual feedback, providing your child with an additional set of guidelines for conversation.
The conversation is coded in varying colors to indicate the speaker.
The size of the color grows when the voice of the speaker grows and overlaps with another color to indicate when a particular speaker is interrupting another speaker.
This conversation clock acts like a mirror and puts everything in front of their eyes in a clear and understandable manner.

, Learning how to make conversation should not be frightening or boring to an autistic child. Respect their boundaries and find topics that interest both of you. (You need to accommodate them just as much as they need to accommodate you!) Keep things casual, lighthearted, and enjoyable for all parties.


Always respect a child's boundaries. If they aren't ready to go talk to a group of kids, or are afraid of walking up to a teacher after school, don't push it.Most likely, they'll feel scared, and associate conversations with bad feelings instead of good ones.
Respect their ability to make their own choices. Your child doesn't need to be ""normal."" It's more important that they can choose what makes them happy.
Avoid over-teaching. If socializing becomes a long list of rules, unsolicited advice, and criticisms, your child will only feel more alone., Autistic people are often quite good at many skills that are related to computer use. Encourage them to explore the world and its people through the internet.


They may find it easier to talk to people via text chats online. This is great—they can still learn about conversation that way, in a more nonthreatening setting.
When they are equipped with good information and knowledge, they will feel confident to venture out and initiate conversations on their own.

, Most autistic children want friends but may not know how. Take time each day to listen to your child, and offer tips and gentle encouragement. For example, if she mentions a sweet boy who would be a good playmate, suggest that she sit next to him at lunch. Talk to your child about potential playdates, and make it clear they can invite friends over (or they can ask you to call their friend's parents to arrange the playdate).


Talk with your child about any playdates beforehand, so that they aren't alarmed.
Sometimes autistic children are not interested in making friends. This is okay. They can still be happy. Focus on other things for the time being,and if they one day change their minds, you'll be able to offer your help.

Respect your student's privacy through confidentiality.,
Support a ""least restrictive environment."",
Evaluate approaches and interventions on an individualized basis.",How to Teach Autistic Children," All autistic children are capable of learning.They simply need to find a strategy for proper information absorption.


Learn to accept that autistic children may always have differences, and should not be evaluated on the same basis as their neurotypical classmates. Autistic children should be evaluated in relation to their own grown and learning over time.;
, These can be confusing, as autistic children often have trouble processing sequences, particularly spoken ones.Give them extra time to process what you say as some autistics have problems processing what they hear.


If the child can read, write down the instructions. If the child is still learning, written instructions with pictures might help.
Give instructions in small steps.

, This can help both those who can and cannot yet read.


Children who cannot read yet will associate printed words with spoken words. Furthermore, autistic children sometimes have difficulty processing spoken words, especially those from TVs, and children who can read may benefit from being able to see the words as well as hear them.
If a child has a favorite television show, record the show with the closed captions and incorporate the show as part of the reading lesson.

, Many autistic children are more motivated by their special interests,than other things and this passion can be used as an advantage when teaching.


For example, if a child loves cars, use toy cars to teach geography on a map by ""driving"" the car to different states.

, Many autistic children have difficulties being attuned to emotion, motivations, and other social cues that are instinctive among non-autistic children. They care about others' feelings,but don't always understand why people feel how they do.Explicitly and clearly explaining social nuances can be helpful as they can be confusing to many autistics.


Many autistic children are capable of learning how to interact appropriately. They may simply need to be told techniques explicitly, instead of picking them up only through observation.
Very young children in preschool and kindergarten can learn simple tasks like color discrimination, letter discrimination, or answering ""yes"" or ""no"" to simple questions by observing their neurotypical peers engaging in these tasks. During centers or group work, consider pairing an autistic child who struggles in a certain area with a neurotypical child who excels in that area. For instance, if an autistic student struggles with color discrimination, pair that child with a neurotypical child who excels in color discrimination. By observing a peer perform the task correctly, an autistic child can learn to mimic the targeted behavior.Neurotypical children who are first grade through high school and who exhibit developmentally appropriate social skills can be trained to serve as peer models for their autistic classmates, modeling social skills for interaction such as eye contact, pleasant greetings, sharing ideas, recommending changes nicely, and talking in a pleasant voice, among other things.

, For example, read a story about a child who is sad and point out a frown or tears as examples of sadness to help an autistic child learn how to pick up on emotions. The child can learn by memorization.


Some autistic children benefit from a technique known as ""social stories"", very brief narratives that describe social situations. These stories help them by providing behaviors to model in various situations.

, Many autistic children thrive on a predictable schedule, so giving them the security to know what to expect each day is beneficial. If there is not enough structure autistic children may be overwhelmed.


Place a clearly-visible analog clock on the wall and tape images that represent the day's activities and the times they occur. Refer to this clock while mentioning the time that activities are to take place. If the child has difficulty reading analog clocks (as a lot of autistic children do), invest in a digital clock that is equally visible.
Picture schedules are also useful.

, This is crucial as autistic children often have trouble coping with different environments or chaotic spaces.


Construct your teaching area with separate and defined stations such as toys, crafts, and dress up.
Place physical indications of defined areas on the floor, such as mats for each child to play upon, a taped square outline for a reading area, etc.

, In some cases this will involve particular objects, behaviors, or rituals that support learning or memory. This can vary by child.


Do they need to walk to list the alphabet? Does holding a blanket help them to read aloud? Whatever it may be, allow the children to learn within their own framework.

, ""Stimming"" is a term that refers to self-stimulatory behavior such as flapping hands or fidgeting, frequently observed among autistic people.


Stimming is crucial to autistic children's concentrationand sense of well-being.Teach the child's peers to be respectful of stimming, rather than teaching the autistic child to suppress it.
Occasionally, an autistic will seek stimulation from biting, hitting, or otherwise harming themselves or others. In this case, it is best to speak with the special education coordinator to figure out how to help the child use a replacement stim that does not cause harm.Avoid telling an autistic child not to stim. This can make them feel bad or ashamed of themselves.

, For example, if a child panics every time someone touches their head, it may be because it is painful to them (many autistic individuals have a low pain threshold).


You may want to explain to other class members that the autistic student is not reacting just to make others laugh, and that they do not like whatever the stimulus is. Autistic children are often bullied unintentionally, as neurotypical children can find their reactions amusing, and do not understand when something is negatively affecting an autistic student.

, In the United States, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA, enacted in 1975) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (enacted in 1990) are federal laws that require public schools to provide a free and accessible education for all individuals.The laws cover children who meet eligibility requirements in one of thirteen areas, whose disability negatively affects his or her educational performance, and who requires special educational services as a result of their disability. Autism spectrum disorder is a qualifying diagnosis.Not only must the state provide a free education for all individuals, but that education must meet his or her unique individual needs, which can differ from neurotypical children (that is, children who do not have a neurological diagnosis such as ASD).
Every child who qualifies for special education services must have an Individualized Education Plan (IEP), which specifies what accommodations a student requires because of his or her diagnosis.Reasonable accommodations for a child receiving special educational services can vary widely. Some students may only need extra time to take tests or assistive technology like a laptop, while others may require a paraprofessional, small group instruction, or curriculum modification., It is a teacher's responsibility to accommodate a student's IEP without singling out the child or disclosing his or her diagnosis to the rest of the class without permission.


Students with special needs often have medical diagnoses, treatment plans, and medications included in their educational records, which are all protected under their right to privacy under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. This makes you legally liable if you disclose their private information without the consent of their parents.Generally, the student's right to privacy is limited by a ""need to know"" basis. Faculty and staff (coaches, playground monitors, cafeteria staff, etc.) might need to know about an autistic child's condition in order to understand their communication skills, limitations, fixations, outbursts, or other manifestations of their condition.
If you are unsure about your district's confidentiality procedures, talk with the district special education coordinator. Consider arranging a topical workshop for teachers to learn about these procedures.
If you need to initiate a class- or school-wide policy to protect the interests of a child with special needs (for instance, instituting a peanut-free policy at a school where a child is allergic), notify the families of the policy and indicate that it is to protect a student with a special need. However, do not mention the affected child by name.
Autistic students and their classmates all benefit if the other students understand an autistic classmate's diagnosis, but for privacy reasons the teacher cannot disclose that diagnosis to the class. Many proactive parents will take it upon themselves to discuss their child's autism with the class; plan a meeting with the parents early in the school year to let them know that your classroom doors are open to them if they want to do this., IDEA mandates that students with disabilities are entitled to the ""least restrictive environment"" in education, which means their learning environment should be as similar to their non-disabled peers as possible.The least restrictive environment for a given student will vary, and is determined and written into the IEP by a team of people including the parents, medical team, and the school district's special education department. The IEP will generally be re-evaluated annually, which means the least restrictive environment for a given student may change.
In many cases, this means that autistic children should be educated in regular classrooms rather than in a special education classroom. This can vary depending on the student's diagnosis and IEP, but in general, autistic students are placed in regular classrooms as much as possible. This practice is called ""mainstreaming"" or ""inclusion"".In these situations, it is the responsibility of the teacher to make accommodations in the classroom for autistic children. Many of these accommodations will be specified on the student's IEP. But educated teachers can also adapt their teaching strategies in ways that will support the learning processes unique to autism, while simultaneously respecting the learning needs of the remaining neurotypical students.

, In addition to a student's IEP, adaptations that are made for autistic students should be evaluated and implemented based on the individual student's needs.


Get to know the student as an individual. While stereotypes are common, every autistic person is unique, and will have different needs. As a teacher, you must become aware of each student's ability in each discrete educational area by assessing their current standing.
Knowing a student's current strengths and weaknesses will help you develop a plan to develop practical interventions. This is true in academic subject areas, as well as social and communication skills.

Help the children understand how to deal with sadness properly.,
Explain the importance of telling people what they want.,
Encourage to tell an adult (you or someone else) if they become overwhelmed, or if they encounter a problem they can't solve by themselves.",How to Teach Autistic Students to Communicate Feelings," The room should be relaxing, with activities available for children who have extra energy to expend.


Paint the walls a soft, calming color, such as pink, light blue, lavender, or light green.
Try a fuzzy carpet for children who sit on the ground.
Keep distractions such as posters to a minimum.;
, Teach children that there is a time for shouting and making noise, but that it's not courteous to do it in the classroom. This helps avoid sensory overload in easily-overwhelmed children.

, If someone is upsetting the autistic child, don't sit back and allow it to continue, and never blame the autistic child for someone mistreating them.

, Children feel more comfortable around you when they feel that you accept them for who they are. Don't try to force them into compliance, stop them from doing something because it ""doesn't look normal,"" or respond violently to meltdowns.

, Children won't open up if they don't feel like you're going to listen. When they talk to you, or attempt to communicate nonverbally, don't brush them off. Look at them, validate their feelings, and ask for clarification if need be. Once they realize that you're a good listener, they'll start telling you things.

, Autistic children may confuse a feeling (e.g. anxiety) with sickness (e.g. a stomachache). Here are some strategies they can use to understand their feelings:


They can go to a mirror and see their facial expression.
They can stop for a minute and reflect on what just happened to them. Could this sensation be due to something they don't like?
They can monitor their stims. (Are they stimming more, or using a stim that they only use when stressed?)

, Try creating flash cards, or making a poster chart of various facial expressions. When a child isn't sure how they're feeling, ask them to point to a picture on the poster, along with monitoring physical symptoms.

, My Little Pony and The Berenstain Bears are examples of media that explains how the characters feel about different events.


As you read or watch, ask ""How do you think (s)he feels about that?"" If the child isn't sure, throw out a few suggestions.

, For example, there's a difference between ""cheerful"" and ""overjoyed."" Try rating emotions from 1 to 5, and discussing how you might act based on that emotion.

, Some autistic children are afraid to express anger because they think it is bad. Talk about how it's a normal reaction to seeing something that you think is wrong, and that there are ways to deal with it.


Counting
Taking a break
Telling an adult
Taking deep breaths

, Autistic children may not understand their own sadness, and may not realize that they are sad. Encourage them to take a break when they're feeling down, to seek solace in their friends or special interests, and talk about it with an adult if they need to.

, Autistic children may be afraid of asserting their needs, because they are used to being told that they are burdens. Assure them that their needs are reasonable and worth your attention.

, Self-calming techniques alone do not usually solve a problem. Teach them to reach out and get help when they aren't sure they can handle something by themselves.

Give autistic students positive reinforcement.",How to Teach an Autistic Student," When talking to an autistic student, speak clearly with active speech. For example, instead of saying ""It's a nice day. Let's continue this lesson outside,"" you might say ""Put your pencils down and close your workbooks. Line up at the door. We're going to work outside today.""Keep in mind that you don't want to ""dumb down"" your language or talk to an autistic teenager or adult like you would talk to a toddler.
Use age-appropriate language for the student. In other words, if you're teaching high schoolers, use the same language with autistic students that you would use with any other students.
Keep in mind that you may have to repeat yourself or clarify your statements sometimes. However, this is preferable to causing an autistic student to feel you think they are stupid or that you are treating them like a baby.
Use a calm, reassuring tone and be patient with the student rather than being harsh. If you are patient and maintain your composure, the autistic student will likely respect you more.;
, Many autistic people interpret language literally, which can make metaphors and idioms confusing. Be aware of phrases you may use frequently in the classroom, and try to speak as literally as possible.For example, you may be fond of telling your students it's time to ""put their thinking caps on."" However, an autistic student may be puzzled by this expression and wonder why they weren't given a physical ""thinking"" cap to put on their head for this exercise.
Instead, you can simply say ""It's time to think about this subject so we can figure out this problem.""
You can start introducing idioms gradually once you know the individual's skill level and how they understand language.

, If an autistic student doesn't understand your lesson the first time, try to figure out what part of your presentation was confusing. The student is capable of grasping the lesson, but may think or process information differently from their peers.Many autistic people are visual thinkers who think in pictures rather than words and concepts. If you're teaching a visual thinker, use pictures rather than words to communicate the information.
Some autistic people are pattern thinkers, and need to understand how everything fits together before they can understand your lesson.
This can be difficult if the things they want to relate together have little to nothing in common, or if they're focused on an irrelevant detail.
If you're having difficulty relating a concept so that an autistic student can understand it, consider getting other students involved. They may be able to reach the student using a method you hadn't thought of.

, Many autistic students have difficulty with abstract thought, particularly visual thinkers. Using a concrete, visual example can bring these abstractions to life for those students.For example, if you're teaching fractions, use a piece of fruit or other food as a visual aid. Cut the food in half to demonstrate halves, then in thirds or quarters and so on.
Pancakes and waffles can serve as good visual aids. Waffles are especially good because the grid can represent fractions of the whole.
In addition to being inexpensive, a benefit to using food as a visual aid is that the class gets a snack after your presentation.

, Most autistic students don't do well with open-ended questions, because there are too many options available and they can become overwhelmed. When presenting a multiple choice question to autistic students, limit the options to two or three choices.This applies not just with questions related to school work, but also with meals, snacks, or free time.
If your students have a half hour for recess in which they can do any number of activities, ask your autistic student directly what they would like to do.
For example, you might say ""For the next half hour, would you like to draw a picture or throw this ball on the playground?""

, If you make a general statement to the entire class, autistic students may not understand that they are expected to listen or participate. By addressing them by name, you let them know that what you are saying applies to them.You can work the student's name into your regular speech as you introduce a new lesson or topic.
Just take care to make it seem conversational, and not as though you are calling them out for doing something wrong.
For example, you might say ""Students, Alex, Sarah, pay attention to the problem I'm writing on the board. I want you to figure out the answer.""

, Many autistic people have particularly sensitive hearing. This means loud sounds, such as the bell that marks the end of class, may be disturbing or even painful for them.If you have no control over the source of the sound, give autistic students a warning well in advance of when the sound will occur.
Allow them to cover their ears or use headphones to muffle the sound.
Common classroom noises may prove distracting to autistic students because they are unable to filter them out. Noise-canceling headphones may help.
Autistic students also may have difficulty focusing in some situations, such as if you have students working in small groups.

, Classrooms, particularly in public schools, often are illuminated with harsh, fluorescent lighting that can overstimulate the senses of autistic students. If possible, turn these lights off and illuminate your classroom with lamps or natural light.If turning off the overhead lights is difficult or impossible, you may be able to move the autistic student's desk closer to the window, so they can rely on natural light to help them focus.
Try replacing older fluorescent bulbs with newer ones, which don't flicker as much and may not disturb autistic students to the same extent.
Take care with shiny or reflective surfaces as well, which can bounce back light and distract or cause pain for autistic students who have light sensitivities.

, Some autistic students' brains are wired in such a way that they literally cannot process auditory and visual input at the same time. This isn't a matter of paying attention, and can't be consciously controlled.Understand the neurological challenges of the autistic students in your classroom. You may have to adjust your lesson plans accordingly, or allow autistic students more time to process the lesson.
For example, if you're showing a video, an autistic student with this sort of processing difficulty may have to watch the video, then listen to the audio separately with the video turned off.
The student may benefit from descriptive audio tracks that describe what's happening in the video for people with sight impairments.
Similarly, you may want to turn on closed-captioning if you're playing a video in which dialogue is important.

, All autistic students can potentially get overstimulated or overwhelmed in a busy classroom. This can happen for some more quickly than for others. However, if you have autistic students in your classroom, create a place they can go to take a break and get out of an overstimulating environment.You can use a room divider to section off a corner from the rest of the classroom. Include bean bags and weighted blankets, as well as a number of stim toys.
Your autistic students can help design this space in a way that will suit them, and may want to bring objects from home.
If autistic students are overwhelmed or overstimulated and need to take a break, allow them to do so.
However, make sure when they're ready they return to the same task rather than moving on to something different. This way you can make sure they're not taking a break simply to avoid doing something they don't want to do.

, Particularly if you teach younger children, be alert for other students who may tease or bully your autistic students. Because autistic children are different and may have ""weird"" behaviors or mannerisms, they often are a target for bullies.Additionally, autistic children can be susceptible to others' lies because they may think and interpret things very literally. This personality trait makes them vulnerable to other students who may take advantage of them.
As the teacher and authority figure, it is your responsibility to protect your autistic students from these types of abusive behavior.
If you suspect your autistic students are being bullied or harassed, identify the culprits and act swiftly to put an end to the behavior.
Educate all of your students on appreciating diversity and respecting each other's differences.

, If the student stims, such as by flapping their hands, assume that the stimming is important to their coping and learning skills. Rather than trying to force them to be ""normal,"" value your student's differences and make it clear that you accept them for who they are.Each autistic person is different, and will stim for different reasons. As you get to know your autistic students, you will come to recognize when they are stimming because they are thinking or concentrating.
You also should recognize when your autistic students are stimming because they are frustrated or upset. When you see this, try to find out and eliminate the source of their frustration.
Some autistic people, particularly young children, may engage in stimming behavior that is harmful to themselves or others, such as banging their head on the desk or the wall.
If your autistic student is engaging in destructive stemming, do what you can to divert the behavior towards something else that won't hurt them or other people.

, Visual calendars can be beneficial for all students, but are a particular benefit for autistic students because they can see the structure of the day and exactly what they are expected to do.For younger students, use shorter blocks of 15 to 20 minutes. Older students can handle a single task for a longer duration, such as 30 to 45 minutes.
Don't place similar tasks on the schedule one after another – try to split these up so that the students are doing different things throughout the day.
The calendar should be posted in a place where all of your students can easily see it and access it. Encourage your autistic students to check it regularly.
Once you've implemented this schedule, try to stay within its bounds as much as possible. If a lesson runs over time or you have to deviate from the schedule, give your autistic students advance warning.

, An autistic student often will not be able to follow directions that have more than two or three steps. If you write out the steps, the student will have something to which they can refer as they complete the task.Written instructions ensure that the student will remember all the steps of an assignment and complete it correctly.
Written instructions also allow your autistic students to complete more complex assignments on their own without having to repeatedly ask for help.
This can give them a tremendous sense of accomplishment and build their confidence in their abilities.

, Autistic people often have poor executive functioning skills, which means they have difficulty spontaneously understanding a sequence of steps that is required to complete a task.If an autistic student can't recall the steps to do something, they can feel frustrated or become confused.
For example, you may assume that if you tell your students to turn in their homework each morning, they will understand that they are to take the work home with them, complete it, and turn it in the next day.
However, an autistic student may have problems with this basic statement. They may not be able to identify the assignment you gave as ""homework,"" understand how they are supposed to complete it, or know exactly what they're supposed to give to you, how they're supposed to turn it in, and when.
Break it down by specifically identifying the assignment as homework, telling the student to take it home, complete the assignment that evening (including instructions on how to complete the assignment), put it in their backpack, bring it to school, take it out of their backpack, then place their paper on your desk when they come into the classroom.
With some autistic students this may be overkill, particularly if they are older. Talk to your students and rely on them to tell you what they need or if your instructions are confusing.

, Make an effort to learn your autistic students' special interests and incorporate them into classroom lessons and assignments. Your students will be excited about the opportunity to share their special interests with others.For example, special interests can provide subject matter for word problems that can help your autistic students understand more complex or attract math concepts.
If you're teaching English or history, figure out how you can work your autistic students' special interests into their studies.
For example, if you have an autistic student who is interested in Paris, you could have them read novels set in Paris, or write a research paper on aspects of Parisian life that are relevant to the subjects you're studying in the classroom.

, Autistic students may need additional time to prepare before to transition from one task to another. Giving advance warning allows them to wrap up their work and get ready for the next thing.A simple reminder of the time and what is next on the schedule should suffice. Make sure your autistic students hear and are aware to prepare for the transition.
You may have better results going to your autistic students specifically about 5 or 10 minutes before you move to a new task or subject to let them know that it's time to start transitioning to something else.
Make sure your autistic students understand where you are in the daily schedule so they can follow the day properly.

, Rewarding and reinforcing positive behavior encourages autistic students to behave appropriately in the classroom, and teaches them which types of behavior are accepted.A simple ""good job"" when the student has finished a step towards completing a task can make a big difference in terms of increasing that student's confidence in their abilities.
Make sure autistic students know when they have completed assignments correctly, and provide continual reinforcement when your autistic students are behaving appropriately in the classroom.
Allowing autistic students time to participate in their social interests or do something else they enjoy can serve as a good reward for completing a task, especially if they're working on a subject that gives them difficulty.

If they made it to college, they are probably quite intelligent, and capable of handling a classroom.
Don't expect them to ""look autistic""—with some people, you can't even tell.
Even the students who ""look autistic"" can still be eager learners who are a pleasure to have in class.;
, Your student may squirm, sit oddly, or move in ways that seem casual. This allows them to feel comfortable and focused. You may see...


Rocking
Wandering eyes (floor, ceiling, window, wall)
Changing positions
Stimming

, They may play with a stress ball or chew gum in class. Planned ignoring, or not calling attention to the stimming, will help the other students become accustomed to it.


Assume that any repetitive movements are important.If you don't ordinarily allow gum or candy, make an exception for them. This is often a substitute for placing unsanitary objects in their mouths (pencils, jewelry, etc.).
If they are disrupting class, talk with them about finding a comfortable alternative stim.

, Autistic people may use words differently, and may be unaware of their tone of voice and unable to control it. Keep in mind that the way they speak is not necessarily indicative of their intelligence.


Monotone, singsong, or ""inappropriate"" voice, potentially unusual in pitch (e.g. high-pitched) or volume
Repeating words or scripted phrases
Using big words or ""talking like a textbook"", or very simplistic language
Odd phrasing (especially if they learned sign language first)
A disability accent, such as a lisp or childlike-sounding speech
Long pauses, sometimes or always being unable to speak, This has a medical basis: sensory processing disorder, which changes the way the brain perceives sensory input. Here are some examples of things they may do...


Cover their ears in ordinary situations
Be afraid of certain objects
Refuse to touch slimy, sticky, or scratchy things
Become ill at the smell of chemicals such as formaldehyde
Cry easily when injured
Wear earplugs (If they wear earplugs during lecture, don't worry—they can still hear you!)

, Executive dysfunction is the technical term for the trouble autistic people have with time management and keeping track of tasks (among other things).This may range from mild to severe, depending on their inborn capability and coping skills.


This may be especially tough for first-year students who are still getting used to the unstructured environment of college.

, Autistic people don't usually understand social rules well, and each autistic person will act differently.


They may not want to make friends because it is too hard. This is okay.
To compensate for uncertainty or anxiety, they may constantly ask questions.
They may constantly raise their hands or blurt answers, like Hermione from Harry Potter.

They might hug you. (This simply means that they like hugs and they like you.)

, Depression and anxiety are extremely common among autistic people, as well as epilepsy and stomach issues. If there is a problem, ask if they have discussed it with a doctor, and refer them to student health services if not. Here are issues you may notice:


Perfectionism, too eager to please (anxiety)
Shy, doesn't raise hand (social anxiety)
Constantly ill (could be a number of conditions)
Sick, tired, missing deadlines (depression)
Submissive, afraid of making own choices (PTSD or effects of compliance therapy)
Do not ask them to disclose their medical diagnoses, as this is very personal.

, A vague assignment is confusing to all students, but especially autistic students. Even if the assignment is fairly open-ended, make it clear what goals it needs to fulfill, and don't expect students to ""read between the lines"" to understand the instructions.For projects, consider showing a few examples from students in previous years, so they can envision the type of thing you want.
Set a clear length. ""As long as it needs to be"" is not helpful. ""Around 3-5 pages"" is much clearer.
Autistic students may lapse into perfectionism when it is unclear, working until their physical or mental health suffers.

, Autistic people often have trouble remembering spoken directions. They may do poorly if they don't have a written copy for reference.


Provide clear assignment sheets and rubrics so autistic people can go through them sentence by sentence.
Write in-class activity directions on the board or on the power point slide. Keep them there until the activity is done.
When asking for the class to turn to a certain page, write the page number on the board, or repeat it once or twice in case anyone didn't catch it.

, Many colleges use class websites such as Blackboard for students to access grades and assignments. Here are good things to keep online:


Digital copies of the syllabus and assignment instructions
The latest homework (e.g. ""Thursday: Read Textbook Chapter 8 and prepare for Tuesday's quiz"")
A gradebook where students can view their overall and assignment grades (so they can monitor their own progress)
Examples of previous student projects

, This will help with organizational problems, and keep students from being overwhelmed by the size of a task. Choose a number of steps that seems reasonable to you.


This does not necessarily mean a lot of grading. Try making individual steps (like the rough draft) a completion grade.

, Autistic students may need a little extra guidance in figuring out what to do if they need help.


Write your office hours on the syllabus, on the class website, or wherever else it is easily found. Encourage students to attend them.
Tell students how to access a tutoring center, or whatever the school provides for help in your subject area.
Consider supplementing these with maps of the campus showing how to get there.

, Autistic people may need extra clarification on directions.


Be available to answer quick questions after class ends.

, You may even do this before the lecture, so students with laptops can follow along.


Autistic students can make sure they didn't miss anything.
Absent students can use the notes to catch up.
All students can use them to study for exams.

, This way, you can discuss accommodations., If you assign seating, talk with the autistic student about where they prefer to sit. Let them keep the same seat all semester.


Some like to sit front and center, so they can focus on what's in front of them with minimal distraction, and they can hear you better.
Some want to avoid distractions like doors and windows.
Some prefer to sit in corners, so that there is only movement on two sides of them.
Each autistic person is different, so let them choose the seat that works best for them.

, If the student has a hard time sitting in a regular chair, ask the school's disability services for an exercise ball, seat wedge, or other form of seating. These will provide extra sensory input, allowing them to sit better.

, Autistic students often thrive on routine, and surprises (pop quiz, notes not available online) can throw them off. Remind the class about the following:


Upcoming field trips
Test, quiz, and exam dates
Due dates for big assignments
Changes in schedule (e.g. a cancelled class)

, Some professors may call on random students to ensure that everyone pays attention. This can backfire for autistic students, who may fumble with turning thoughts into words, and may become anxious or flustered under pressure. The anxiety of constantly trying to be prepared to be called on can detract from their focus.

, Turning complex thoughts into sounds and initiating public speech can be hard. Here are some ways autistic students can participate nonverbally:


Type messages in online discussions
Write a brief paragraph of their thoughts and show it to you at the end of class
Do an alternate project connecting the material to an interest of theirs

, Autistic students tend to have more health issues and forgotten assignments (due to executive dysfunction). Encourage them to tell you in person or via email as soon as they notice a problem, and be understanding when they do so.

, Autistic people don't always know how to act in certain situations. Be clear and kind, because they probably don't understand. Let them know why it's a problem, and help them find a different thing to do to fulfill the same need or desire.


""I like you and am glad we're friends, but it feels weird for a young woman like you to hug an old guy like me. Maybe next time you want a hug, you could ask your friend Tiana instead.""

, Registered students can request accommodations through the disability center. Your student may need...


Extra time on tests
A separate room for test-taking (The Disability Service Center will provide a room.)
A note-taker
Use of laptop instead of handwriting
Ability to audio record lecture
The ability to turn in assignments a day late
Other accommodations

, This relieves the stress of needing to find one's own group, and makes it easier for the autistic person to speak up within the group.If you notice that the autistic person has a friend in the class, put them with their friend.
Have each group member have a role (secretary, spokesperson, editor, etc.). A concrete role will help them know how to contribute even when social skills are hard.

, Working independently can be more efficient for them.

, Some autistic people are sensitive to sound, and constant noise will prevent them from focusing. Remind students to use their indoor voices and get their attention if the noise level is getting too high.


Seat the autistic person's group near a corner of the room, farther away from the main activity.
Some autistic students may work better with earplugs.

, Autistic people struggle with social interaction, so they might not realize when there is a problem, or not know how to solve it. Since self-esteem issues are common, they may lack the assertiveness skills to speak up.


Talk to individual team members who are not behaving well: being rude, slacking off, etc.
Encourage all group members to be patient with each other.
Do not allow team members to bully or ostracize the autistic student.

, Since autistic people may not know how to speak up for themselves, they may end up doing a large portion of the work, or be assigned work that they don't understand. Help the group divide up work if need be.

, Autistic people can learn social skills if they are taught. Giving clear directions helps them know how to handle problems that confuse them. This can be done during office hours, or briefly after class.


Try if-then statements: ""If he tries to make you do all the work, then ask him 'What would you like to do?' If he doesn't pick something, then suggest a few things for him to do.""
""If your classmates are talking over you, try taking a deep breath and clearly saying 'I have something to add.' If that keeps failing, tell me.""
Intervene if the autistic person cannot solve the problem on their own.

, Distressed autistic students may look a little different from distressed neurotypical students. Here are things you may see:


Crying
Agitated stimming

Decreasing self-control (for example, using a louder stim when they usually try to be as non-disruptive as possible)
Change in body language
Getting ""stuck"" on an ideaUnhappy facial expression, or hiding the face
Saying negative things

, Ask if they are okay, if you can help, and if they would like to leave. If they seem unable to speak, give them a pencil and paper, or suggest that they type a response on their laptop.


Sometimes autistic people may stay longer than they should in a misguided attempt to ""stick it out."" You can counteract this by checking on them right away.
Quietly asking about leaving lets them know that you will not be mad at them if they have to leave.

, Self-injury means that something is seriously wrong. If you can eliminate the thing that is causing them stress, then they will stop hitting, biting, or otherwise harming themselves.


If they cannot tell you what is wrong (through spoken or written words), ask them to leave the room. If the stressor is something in the room, it will remove them from it. If not, they will still be able to calm down in a less public place.
Use a compassionate tone of voice to make it clear that this is not a punishment.

, Since their brains are structured differently, a situation that feels harmless to you could be very upsetting or threatening to them.


If you can get rid of the cause, do so. Quiet the classroom, give them an alternate assignment (e.g. dissecting a model frog instead of a real one), or have them leave the room.If they mention a psychological issue (e.g. an anxious student worrying that she is a ""bad student"" because she missed the homework), briefly and gently offer a dose of realism. ""Every student makes mistakes sometimes. You are not a bad student. Please stop worrying about it."" Sometimes reassurance from an authority figure will break the cycle of perseveration.

, They may need to take a few minutes in the bathroom to cool down, take some medication, or go back to their dorm to rest.


""Sticking it out"" only makes oncoming meltdowns worse. The best way to avoid them is to catch them early.Some autistic people have trouble recognizing when they are stressed. You mentioning it will help them realize that they are not doing well.

, Sometimes crises result from sensory input (e.g. an especially noisy lab or a startlingly loud noise). If it was something in your control, see if you could avoid it next time.


Try giving warnings for unavoidable things: ""I'm going to roll down the projector, and it's going to be loud, so cover your ears if you need to!""
If you can't figure out what caused it, it is probably not your fault. Don't feel bad. This happens sometimes.

, This is new and alarming to you, but the autistic student has dealt with it thousands of times, and knows how to take care of themselves. It feels terrible while it lasts, but it will pass and they will go back to normal.


Right now, the best thing you can do is continue teaching.
If you are worried, ask your TA to go out with them and help them with whatever they need.

, Most autistic people get completely better by the next morning. Tell them what they missed (if anything), and ask if there's anything you could do to help them in the future. Then leave it at that.


If you want to ask what caused it, consider doing so via email, so they have time to think carefully about it.

, Autistic people usually have intense special interests, or an area in which they are incredibly knowledgeable and skilled. They will enjoy learning much more if they can connect the material to their passion, and they will perform better too.


This will help all students enjoy the class, not just the autistic student(s).

, Autistic people tend to be good at sequencing and understanding sequences. Providing a pattern can be a huge help.

, Many autistic students are visual learners, and they benefit from diagrams, illustrations, and other images. Try using color coding and flowcharts to explain complex concepts.

, This does not mean extolling their virtues in front of the entire class—just an encouraging comment during office hours or a small affirmation when they ask you a question after class. Many autistic students grew up with others focusing on their deficits, and struggle with invisible issues such as sensory processing disorder and anxiety. A little reminder that they did well can make their day.


To encourage resilience, try calling them a hard worker.
When grading papers, point out a few positive aspects, such as ""Great organization"" or ""Love the wording here!"" This offsets the pain of seeing errors.
Avoid jokingly criticizing them. While non-autistic students can usually tell you aren't serious, an autistic student might become confused and distressed.

, If they have enough motivation, autistic people can access incredible amounts of energy for learning. Create a friendly environment and positive expectations, and watch them rise to the opportunity.

, This article is based on generalizations, which will sometimes or often (but not always!) apply. Some students need little accommodation and others need a lot. Some are mathematically oriented, others are great artists, and others are both. Get to know your student as a person, and you will learn how to build a great teaching relationship.

Avoid making assumptions.,
Speak directly to the student.,
Coordinate with the interpreter.,
Use visual aids.,
Make sure videos are captioned.,
Provide prompts and explanations.,
Avoid creating unique signs for words or concepts.",How to Teach a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Student1," Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing can communicate in several ways. Some will wear amplification devices and communicate through speech, while others may use sign language, an interpreter, or speechreading/lipreading. Many individuals choose to communicate in a variety of methods.Ask the student how they want to communicate with you.
Consider that the student may prefer different communication modes under different circumstances. For example, they may like to use an interpreter during whole class instruction but speechreading/lipreading while speaking one-on-one.;
, Face the student so that the sound of your voice is not muffled. Students who have difficulty hearing can hear better in a lower register than a higher one, so lower the tone of your voice. Enunciate and make your lip movement noticeable.Don’t stand in front of a light source because it will make it hard to see your lips.Trim facial hair.
Don’t cover your mouth.

, If the student has one, the interpreter will help the student understand what is being said in class. You should act as though the interpreter is not there when speaking to the student. Always look at the student when speaking to them, and address any questions to the student. Additionally, allow time for the interpreter to finish translating what you’ve said before you begin calling on students.

Never ask an interpreter to do anything other than interpret.
Expect the interpreter to stand near you so that the student can see both of you at the same time.
Don’t say anything in front of the interpreter and student that you don’t want interpreted., Visual aids will support the student’s understanding and provide some relief from keeping up with signing or speechreading, if applicable. Aids can include anything from PowerPoint notes to a word wall. The type of aid used will vary depending on the lesson and the grade level., Before you show a video in class, check to make sure it’s captioned. You will need to order movies with captioning and ensure that your technology is able to show the captioning.Check your videos before class so that the student will not feel singled out if you can’t show the video because it isn’t captioned.

, Explain the parts of the lesson and classroom shifts to the class before they happen. This will help your deaf or hard of hearing student anticipate the change or activity, while also supporting the other students., Students need consistent signing that is universal in meaning. While it may be tempting to create a special sign for your student to allow for quicker communication about common topics, this will make it harder for the student to communicate with others. Additionally, everyone who works with the student should be using the same signs for the same words and concepts.

When students fingerspell words, they likely don’t understand that word and need more assistance with it."
"
Explain any visuals.,
Always give oral instructions.,
Ask students to clap to ask a questions.,
Provide tactile learning experiences.,
Address all students by name.,
Give visually impaired or blind students additional time to complete work.,
Treat all of your students equally.,
Consider the curriculum.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Student1," When you are teaching a visually impaired or blind student, it is important to clearly explain all visual materials. For example, if you are showing a picture to illustrate a point, you should describe the image. You could say something like “I have put a picture of Queen Elizabeth I on the board to illustrate the way she was depicted. She is wearing a large gown with a lot of detailed embroidery. This demonstrates her wealth and power.”You should also get in the habit of dictating what you are writing on the chalkboard or whiteboard. This way students who are unable to see the board can still follow along with the material and take notes.;
, Do not provide your students with a handout that contains assignment instructions. Visually impaired or blind students in your class may have difficulty seeing the words and learning what is expected. Instead, you should always give oral instructions for every assignment and activity., Many classrooms rely on visual cues in order to ask questions or get the teacher’s attention. It is very traditional for students to raise their hand if they want to speak during a lesson. Visually impaired or blind students may not notice when their peers raise their hands. Instead, you should replace visual cues with audio cues.

For example, you could have students clap twice if they want to ask a question.

, When you are teaching a class with visually impaired or blind students, you should try and incorporate tactile learning experiences whenever possible. For example, instead of talking about rocks and showing images of different types of rocks, you should actually have physical rocks available in the classroom for the students to touch and handle.This can also be done with different foods, shells, properties of matter, etc.
This will allow your students to explore and learn without relying solely on sight.

, Students who are visually impaired or blind may not always know who is talking. As a result you should always address students by their name when you call on them to answer or ask questions. This way the student who is visually impaired can learn to identify their peers based on the sound of their voice., In some instances visually impaired or blind students may need extra time to complete their assignments and tests. This is typically because reading braille or using some form of technological aide can take additional time.

Although you want to give an appropriate amount of time for visually impaired or blind students to complete their work, you do not want them use their vision as an excuse to hand in work late. Set deadlines and make sure they stick to them.

, Even though you will need to make certain modifications to your teaching style and classroom structure in order to accommodate students with visual impairments, you should still hold these students to the same standard as the rest of their peers. For example, all classroom rules and behavioural expectations should apply to all of the students in the class. Avoid giving special treatment to visually impaired students., When you are teaching visually impaired or blind students, you may need to modify the curriculum and the way you teach the curriculum in order the meet the students needs. For example, when teaching art, you will want to rely more on tactile experiences. Try sculpting and working with clay, instead of drawing or colouring.

Avoid singling the student out.,
Meet with the child’s parents and previous teachers.,
Partner the student with someone they can communicate with.,
Encourage the student to communicate to the larger group.,
Schedule check-in times.,
Don’t talk while the students are reading.",How to Teach a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Student2," Provide the student with any accommodation that helps them learn, but don’t separate them from the rest of the class. They should feel like one of the group, so treat them equally to your other students. For example, don’t repeatedly ask them if they need assistance in front of the other students., You can learn a lot about how the student prefers to learn by talking to those who have experience. The more information you have about your student, the easier it will be to help them be successful.Ask questions about the classroom climate, accommodations that have worked in the past, and the student’s learning style.
If the student has worked with any specialists, contact them as well.

, The student will benefit from having someone that they can talk to throughout the day. Their partner can also help reinforce the everyday language and concepts that the student may struggle with because of limited hearing., It's best for the student to be comfortable communicating with others and sharing ideas. Speaking in class helps all students learn better, and it prepares them for their post-school lives.

Assign presentations to the entire class, including the student who is deaf or hard of hearing.
Include group assignments and partner work that requires working with others to complete the assignment.
Some students may not be able to speak with a hearing class, but they can communicate through an interpreter who is able to translate aloud to the class what the student is signing.
If the student is giving a formal presentation through an interpreter, make sure that the student has time to work with their interpreter in advance so that the interpreter understands the presentation material.

, Deaf and hard of hearing students will need assistance and mental breaks from the stresses of constantly deciphering language, though they may not always request help. To make sure that your student has opportunities for your help, designate regular check-in times., Your deaf or hard of hearing student will need to watch either you, the interpreter, or both of you. If you begin speaking while they are reading, then the student will be left out of instruction. Instead, work out a system with your student so that they can let you know when they are finished reading and are ready to continue.The signal to continue the lesson can be as simple as the student looking up at you.
If you are concerned about the student taking more time to read than the rest of the class, plan differentiated questions for the students to begin working on in their notebooks so that class time is not wasted. Each student can begin work as their own pace. Later, have all of the students review their answers and fill in gaps with a partner.

Monitor noise levels.,
Know how to help with hearing aids.,
Use a microphone.,
Repeat questions from other students.,
Check to make sure that technology is compatible.",How to Teach a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Student3," The devices pick up noise from throughout the room, which can make it difficult to understand what you are saying. Help them hear you by minimizing other classroom noises, such as fans, classroom technology, student conversations, and music., Some students who are hard of hearing will wear a hearing aid that allows them to hear most of what is said, though they may still mishear pronunciations. Be prepared to help them with their amplification device and have any necessary supplies, such as extra batteries.If the student hears well with their assistive device, then you should teach them as you would a hearing child., Many assistive listening devices transmit your voice directly to the student through a microphone you wear near your mouth. This can help them pick your voice out from the competing classroom sounds., If you are using an assistive listening device, then your student will likely not hear speech from anyone but you. Make sure that they know what you’re talking about by repeating the questions you’re asked before you answer them., If you are using technology in class, make sure that it is Hearing Aid Compatible (HAC) before using it, particularly if it is handheld or something the student must use with their device, such as a tablet or headphones. If it isn’t, then the technology could interfere with the hearing aid."
"
Connect the student with a deaf mentor.,
Know how to cue your student.,
Vary how loudly you speak.,
Break down words into syllables.,
Address the differences between sign language and written language.,
Use the bilingual method.,
Pre-teach vocabulary.",How to Teach a Deaf or Hard of Hearing Student4," Students need to frequently sign with a person who is fluent in sign language. Younger children also benefit from storytime in sign language because they are able see how the words are signed while also looking at the printed words in the storybook.Mentors are especially important if the student’s parents are not fluent in sign language.
Parents who are fluent in sign language can act as mentors to their children.

, Cued Speech and visual cues are both useful in helping deaf or hard of hearing students understand how letters sound. Cues should be used as you speak to the student or show them the corresponding letter or word.

Cued Speech is a communication system that uses 8 hand shapes and 4 indicators near the mouth to represent the 45 phonemes of English.
Grapheme cues visually represent sound, showing what it looks like.
Hand cues mimic the sound that a letter might make so that students can see it.
Speechreading/lipreading cues help students understand how the mouth looks when saying a sound., Emphasize the sounds you want students to pick up on by saying the sound louder or whispering it, depending on the type of sound.Whispering works when you have a silent consonant sound because it creates an emphasis on the consonant sound.
You can also stress a syllable.

, Called syllabication, breaking words into syllables can help students understand how sounds blend together. You can convey syllables using rhythm, mouth movements, and finger signing.

To finger sign syllables, break the word into syllables and sign each letter of the syllable. Teach the students to wait in between syllables so that they can connect the letters as one sound., Sign language presents words and ideas differently than written language. For example, signs can represent a concept, or words may be presented in a different order than they are written. Because of these differences, students who sign can struggle with reading because the words are arranged and presented differently.Be aware of this difference and discuss it with the student.
Make sure that the student understands the text the class is reading.
Ask the student to highlight areas that they’re having trouble reading. Discuss how those sentences would be communicated through signing, then compare it to how they look on paper.

, The bilingual method is a great option for helping students who sign better understand written language. The goal is to help them master both sign language and written language, which are considered two different languages. The method works by having a teacher or mentor sign with the student as they read a printed text. The student is able to see both the sign that corresponds with the word and how it looks on paper.

Incorporate Cued Speech and fingerspelling into your teaching sessions that use texts.
Act out the text with younger children to boost understanding.
Reread the text multiple times so that the student is exposed to the material several times, allowing them to learn it., Provide students with different types of exposure to new vocabulary, such as repetition, word maps, and classroom discussion. Deaf and hard of hearing students may require pre-teaching of words that other students have encountered via overhearing conversations or participating in activities that are inaccessible to individuals who have reduced hearing."

Record lessons.,
Provide braille textbooks and handouts.,
Allow the use of smart scanners and readers.,
Encourage the use of page magnifiers.,
Write with dark colours on the whiteboard.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Student2," The easiest and cheapest way to improve the learning environment for students who are visually impaired or blind is to record all lessons. This way students can listen to the instructions or lesson multiple times in order to make sure they completely understand what is expected.

Students can record lessons using smartphone apps that can be easily downloaded for free.
For better sound quality the school could invest in a microphone and recorder that could then upload the audio file to the student’s personal computer.

, As soon as you discover that you will have a visually impaired or blind student in your class, you should order all class textbooks in braille. You can also have all of your course materials and handouts transferred into braille by using braille translation software.This software can be purchased online and costs approximately $600.
This process can take quite some time, so be sure to plan well in advance.

, Students who are visually impaired or blind can benefit from the use of smart scanners and readers. These technological devices will easily convert documents such as books and handouts into speech. This way students who can not see the material presented on a written document can still access the information. The machine will actually read aloud the materials.These devices range in price from approximately $150 to $1000 and can be ordered online.
You can also download a reader application such as the KNFB Reader which will convert printed text into speech. This app costs around $100., Page magnifiers can be used by students with visual impairments, to help enlarge images and text presented in any book or handout. This will assist students with visual impairments in reading all course material. These devices are relatively easy to use and range in cost and effectiveness.Handheld magnifying glasses enlarge the image approximately 2.5 times the regular size and cost approximately $10 to $20.
Electronic page magnifiers can enlarge an image 10-15 times the regular size and range in price from $200 to $1000

, Many students who are visually impaired will need written material to be presented in high contrast in order for them to read. It is best to write using a dark black marker on a whiteboard. Always write using large images and letters to help assist with reading. If your classroom has a blackboard, you should always use white chalk.Avoid using colours. Colour should only be used sparingly for large images, such as titles.

"
"
Seat visually impaired students close to the front.,
Consider lighting and glare.,
Ensure there are large walkways between furniture.,
Maintain a consistent classroom arrangement.,
Clearly explain where classroom supplies are located.",How to Teach a Blind or Visually Impaired Student3," In order to give visually impaired or blind students an equal opportunity to succeed in the classroom, seat them near the front of the room close to the board. While teaching you should stand near the visually impaired child. This will allow them to hear you better., Visually impaired students often experience light sensitivity issues, so seating them away from the window and other glaring light is beneficial. Try and control the glare in the classroom by using blinds and curtains. Light should be distributed evenly throughout the room for optimal visual effect., You should also leave ample space between desks, chairs, cabinets, and shelves. This will make it easier for visually impaired and blind students to navigate through the classroom without bumping into objects.Make sure the cupboard doors and drawers are always closed and that chairs are neatly tucked under desks. If things are left slightly askew this can cause problems for visually impaired and blind students.

, Once you have created the classroom layout at the beginning of the school year, leave the furniture in the same place. Visually impaired and blind students will learn the layout and be able to navigate their way around the classroom without bumping into any objects. If you rearrange the furniture and seating assignments this can cause confusion for these students and will add unnecessary stress to their learning environment., You will also need to give added directional instructions when explaining where classroom supplies are located. For example, if the pencil sharpener is located next to the whiteboard at the front of the classroom, you should provide visually impaired students with clear directions from their seat.You could say “the pencil sharpener is straight in front of your desk and then two steps left of the whiteboard.”
These added instructions will help a visually impaired or blind student navigate the classroom.

"
Before the program, meet with both the child and the parent(s).,
Talk to the parents about meltdowns and other behavioral challenges.,
Find ways to accommodate the child's sensory needs.,
Develop a support plan based on the child's unique challenges and desires.,
Implement the support plan:


Be consistent with techniques to motivate the child
Gently encourage peer interactions (without pushing).

,
If need be, talk with the children.,
Intervene immediately if you see bullying.,
Don't try to force the child into compliance.,
Talk with the child about how to take a break.,
Talk with all support staff about the importance of kindness and patience.",How to Support Autistic Children in Recreation Programs," With the parent(s), discuss the child's strengths, interests, and barriers for participation. With the child, ask about what they want to achieve, and how you can make it more fun with them.;
, If you recognize warning signs and know how to defuse the situation, you can be prepared to handle whatever might happen.


Remember that odd-looking behavior is not a ""behavioral challenge."" Assume that any repetitive movements are important.

, Sensory overload can lead to meltdowns (which happen when the child releases bottled-up stress in a fit of distress) or shutdowns (when the child becomes passive, pained, and unable to interact).


What are the child's triggers?
How can you minimize unnecessary noise and commotion?
How can the child communicate with you if she is becoming overloaded or stressed?
How can you tell if the child is going into overload?

, Write it down, and share it with all the staff.


Provide the least amount of support as possible, but adding a support staff may be appropriate

,, Depending on how severe various symptoms are, the autistic child's challenges may be very obvious. Some may be curious, and some may be mean to the child. Teach the children about autism, using a tone of acceptance and respect. You may want to discuss:


How to politely invite people to play with them
That everyone is different in their own ways, and that's okay (This applies to disability, and disability symptoms such as stimming and atypical communication, just as much as skin color or nationality)
How to be polite and patient with others who are different
That autism comes with strengths as well as struggles (memory, systematizing, special interests)
That bullying is never acceptable, and to tell you right away if they see it happening

, Autistic children may be targets for bullies, and they often don't know how to respond to it. It's important that you stop the bully right away and let them know that their actions are not acceptable.


Don't force an autistic child to play with children who are bullying or being rude to them.
If another child reports bullying to you, thank them for doing a good job telling you, and go over to intervene.

, Some aides don't understand how to handle an autistic child, so they decide to simply force them to do things because it's easy. However, this is damaging to the child's emotional development.


Children should never be forced to do things against their will—disability is not an excuse for taking control of someone else's body.
If you say no, tell them why. For example, ""No, you can't put that in your mouth, because it's not food, and it's germy. If you need to put things in your mouth, why don't you use this lollipop instead?""
Encourage them to speak up if they have a problem.

, Sensory overload, distress, or anxiety can cause overwhelming feelings and make participation difficult. When ignored, it can lead to an outburst. If they start feeling upset, they should know how to ask you for a break to calm down.


Consider making a special corner for this purpose.
If they are not able to communicate their feelings, keep an eye on them and help them take a break if they look distressed.

, Autistic children face difficulties that neurotypical children do not, and when the child acts upset, they may be experiencing something you can't see. Responding with compassion will help them feel supported.

Meet with parents to find out more about the child's condition.,
Find out about medications.,

Don't ignore bad behavior.,
Use the three step procedure for bad behavior.,
ADHD teens will respond to time out very well too.,
Break bigger tasks into smaller portions.,
Use lots of stimulation in your classroom - visuals, diagrams, intonation is your voice, ask questions, use real life examples.

,
Avoid giving food.,
Keep active, ADHD kids brains work better when they do more sports and activities.",How to Teach a Student With ADHD," Is it mild or severe? Do they take medication? What do they best respond to? Do they have and special strengths? Which areas do they struggle with the most?;
, Is the child on any and when do they take it. Are they expected to take it while at school and if so when? Make sure it is never missed.

, Put the week's schedule on the board. ADHD kids thrive when there is a clear routine. Their behavior gets worse when things change a lot. Try to follow a particular routine each day at the beginning of the day, before and after breaks, at the end of each day and so on.

, How do they line up? Where do they put their bags? Where are the class rules? and so on.

, They need more eye contact and one on one attention than the average child to succeed.

, ADHD kids respond to it brilliantly. Praise for small achievements not just big ones.

, Don't wait till the end of the day or the end of the week to reward good behavior. ADHD kids live in the moment and a day is like a lifetime.

, Perhaps give the child an awards book and award points for good behavior like sitting quietly at desk for 10 minutes, getting started on tasks, staying on tasks, completing tasks, sharing well with others and so on. Points can then be exchanged for small privileges.

, ADHD kids don't just want attention, they need it. They will do what ever gets it the fastest. make good attention easy to earn.

, It will get worse, act quickly when it starts to avoid it getting out of control.

, use the same procedure every time. If the procedure changes every time then the ADHD child will test it every time to see what will happen. They have no internal boundaries so they don't trust external boundaries and have to constantly test them.


Step 1 is awareness, correct the behavior. As soon as the child starts to play up correct their behavior. eg ""Johnny, hands to yourself"". Avoid saying too much, the less you say the more they hear.
Step 2 if the behavior continues give 1 warning of what will happen if they continue.
Step 3 - take action. The most effective discipline for ADHD is time out. They hate to be still and not get attention. A 5 minute time out works wonders.

, A 15 minute time out will work wonders with ADHD teens even though normal teens would see it as a joke. To give you an idea one ADHD teen misbehaved badly on two occasions. One one occasion he was suspended from school and the teen actually said ""It was cool I only got suspended it was like I didn't get in trouble at all"" on another occasion the same teen got a long time out for doing the same thing and the teen actually said ""that was the worst punishment ever"". What works for normal teens is not the same as for ADHD teens.

, ADHD kids and teens get overwhelmed with big tasks they feel they will never complete them and give up. break it down and have them tick off as they complete steps so they can see their progress.

,, ADHD kids become uncontrollable when they have lollies or junk food, but even healthy food like fruit juice can set them off. Avoid giving food to kids for rewards or special days, be careful with class parties and birthday cakes.

, Try to get them out for at least 30 minutes per day.

Over time, you will be able to find and understand the student's temperament and understand the body language of the student. This will be unique to each student and is not something that can be rushed.


Their typical movements may be jerky or forceful, causing them to be misread as ""angry"" even though they are not mad.Watch for anxiety. Many disabled children are also anxious and afraid of criticism.;
, This stage is difficult because the parents and or guardians tend to give little information about their special needs child. The parent may have concerns because if the child is aggressive, they don't want the teacher to know that. However, building a relationship with the parent or guardian can be beneficial because both parties can work on the same goal and objectives.


Be very careful if a caregiver describes a child as ""manipulative.""This may mean that the caregiver is behaving destructively towards the child.

, This is where you can start teaching objectives and learning components for the non-verbal student. The use of objects, visuals, and teacher-generated resources that the student can touch should be used. This is also the stage where comprehension will become evident and you can use this to build on old activities and introduce new ones.

, Routines help the student to know what to expect; surprises are not helpful in this environment. Be patient about progress and comprehension; bear in mind how difficult it would be to not be able to speak or express your feelings, ideas and reasoning.

, It may not be possible for the child to speak yet, but that doesn't mean the child won't be able to communicate. Focus on teaching the child to express basic needs, and then move on to more advanced subjects. Here are some methods that the child may be able to use:


Picture exchange systems

Baby Sign (which can later turn into more advanced sign language)
Typing

, Flopping on the floor means something. Crying means something. If you work with the child, and try to figure out what they need, it will encourage them to communicate with you. Once they know you'll listen, they'll start working harder to open up. Here are some useful phrases:


""You look stressed—your face is all scrunched up and you're frowning. Is something wrong?""
""Do you need a break?""
""Can you point to the thing you want?""
""I know it's frustrating trying to communicate. I'm frustrated too. I still don't understand, but I care about what you have to say."", For example, if the child points to a banana, hold it up and say ""banana."" Encourage the child to do so. If they cannot, try encouraging them to make the ""b"" or ""ba"" sound. Let them try, and then give it to them.


If the child can't do it, or doesn't have the energy, don't push it. You can try again later.
Praise their efforts, successful or not.

, Some disabled children (especially autistic children) will ""stim,"" or stimulate their senses through repetitive or other behavior. This can help them calm down, express their emotions, handle difficulty, or maintain a sense of well-being.


Recognize that they can pay attention to you while stimming—in fact, it may be the only way they can do so.
Sometimes stimming will give you a clue regarding how they are feeling.
Never say ""quiet hands"" to them, grab them against their will, or attempt to make them indistinguishable from their peers.

, Special needs children may melt down in frustration or act out. Help them use calming strategies and figure out what the problem is.Self-talk
Chewing gum
Deep breaths
Counting
Talking through the problem (validating their feelings)

, Nonverbal children may be targeted for bullying. Model respectful behavior as a teacher/aide, and intervene firmly if you see any bullying happening.


If a girl takes the child's toy and he hits her, then both his and her behavior need to be addressed.
Don't make the child follow rules that other children can get away with bending or breaking.
Don't force the child to interact with other children. Having no friends may be preferable to having friends who bully them when your back is turned. Let them make their own choices about friendships.

, The child probably already knows they are different, but they may not understand why. Teaching them the basics of disability will help them understand what they're going through, so that as they age they can seek resources from disabled adults.


""You have a disability called autism, which means you think differently. It's why you stim a lot, and why loud noises hurt you so much. It's also why you know so much about cats.""
""You go to Special Ed because you are disabled. This means you think a little differently, and some things are harder for you. It's okay to be disabled.""

, Remember, you are working with the child, not against them. Be their ally, encourage skills and independence, and enjoy your time together.

Reteach, retry, and revise.",How to Socially Integrate Students with Special Needs1,"  Knowing begins with reviewing their educational file.  In many schools these files are monitored and kept under lock and key to protect individual privacy.  Ask the special needs coordinator for access, or arrange to review the file with the Special Education teacher assigned to that student. Asking around about them helps you to know more about their personality and habits: are they active or calm, clever or struggling, conscientious or careless, obedient or mischievous?;
,  In modern educational systems, professional learning communities are utilized to assure every student is afforded every opportunity. Meet regularly with all professionals tasked with that child's education. Document these meetings.


A thorough record will be useful for tracking strategies used. Integrating special needs people of any age into social contexts means meeting with those who care about that person.

, Individual Education Plans address weaknesses as well as strengths. Thoroughly reviewing the IEP assures that the child gets what is needed.  If it is on the IEP, experts have decided the best course of action for the child is identified. Don't ignore anything on an IEP.


Often, IEPs suggest processes that might help within social contexts outside the classroom. The primary concern in a social context is assuring the individual's needs are met with no violation of that individual's rights.

,  Every learner, even those not identified as having special needs, have rights to an unrestricted education. By not following an IEP, many educators violate these learners' rights.

 

If a situation arises that prevents adherence to the IEP, notify administrators immediately.  Email is best because it creates a record of your attempt to resolve the problem.
Outside the classroom, an IEP may not be available, so follow those practices and procedures which are most familiar to the individual. Don't impose on them a social context without the support of members who care.

,  While lesson plans, attendance records, and homework files create a regular record of activities, keeping a register of actions for each special needs accommodation is extremely helpful.


Use shorthand or abbreviations.  The idea behind record keeping is not to inundate educators with excessive documentation tasks.  Brief is best.
Often personal letters and diary entries can document the social interactions of special needs people in contexts outside the classroom.

, Inclusion is a community effort, and the student's team can work together to help make it happen. Consider aides, tutors, therapists, and paraprofessionals.


Talk to other content area professionals.  Collaborate on projects together.
Visit the resource room during plan time.  Often you can reinforce an idea just by visiting the child in a different environment.
In the absence of the school context, use community resources. Most communities have a disabilities services association. They provide valuable insight as well as opportunities for social interaction for persons with special needs.

,  Ask them what they are learning, what they are struggling with, and how you can help. This encourages the student to trust and open up to you. It also gives you a sense of their priorities.


What are the student's goals? How badly do they want to make friends, and are there any particular people whom they would like to make friends with?
Some students are okay with one or two close friends, while others want a wide circle of friends. A few are okay with having no friends. Find out how much

, They know the child well, so they can offer advice on what helps and doesn't help the student as an individual. They can also share concerns, ideas, and feedback.

,  Multiple intelligences, project learning, and cooperative learning structures all provide strategies for delivering content to different learners. These strategies work outside the classroom too. Introducing special needs persons to social expectations should be taught the same way.

,  When possible, videotape, photograph, and write about experiences and review them before dropping a strategy.


Keep a log or diary of what works and doesn't work.  Remember that none of the strategies you employ will work for all individuals, so be ready to reteach.

,  Every new concept should be revisited at least twice.  Research shows that students can't retain information that hasn't been presented to them at least three times.  The strength of understanding is increased when it is presented more than that and in a variety of ways. This is also true in social contexts.

Reward good behaviors with positive reinforcements.,
Be firm and assertive with your child.,
Spend time with your child and help them with their schoolwork.,
Help your child to associate school with positive emotions.",How to Relieve School Anxiety for Special Needs Children," ""Special needs"" is a broad term that can refer to a vast array of mental and behavioral conditions. The type of school-related anxieties experienced by a child with intellectual disabilities may be very different from those experienced by an autistic child.Therefore, it's very important that you take your child's specific condition into account when you try to tackle the issue.



Children with intellectual disabilities: Children with intellectual disabilities usually have an IQ between 50 to 75 (the average IQ is 100). This means that they often have difficulty learning and communicating. They have to work much harder at learning than their peers, which can result in feelings of frustration and low self-worth, leading to anxiety.

Children with ADHD: Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder have difficulty in concentrating, focusing on specific tasks and sitting still. As a result, they often engage in disruptive behaviors that gets them in trouble with their teachers. This can cause them to feel unhappy and anxious about school.

Children with learning disorders: Children who have difficulty with reading, mathematics or written expressions are often unable to process information in the same way as others, but this sometimes goes unrecognized. When this occurs, the child is not given the additional support he/she needs and falls behind as a result, leading to feelings of anxiety and low self-worth.

Autistic children: Autistic children often have difficulty communicating with other people and with understanding social norms. They may be overwhelmed by noisy classrooms, struggling to keep track of assignments, and bullied by peers or even teachers. This can make school frustrating and frightening.

Children with conduct disorder: Children with conduct disorder tend to behave in an antisocial manner, acting aggressively towards others and refusing to follow the rules. These children have a lot of difficulty in school and are almost constantly in trouble, causing anxiety which exacerbates the bad behavior.;
, Dealing with your child's school-related anxiety will require you to fully understand what causes these negative emotions in your child, and to recognize how he/she expresses them. It can be very easy to mistake your child's anxiety for bad behavior, which is not helpful for either of you. Some common expressions of anxiety include:


Complaining about feeling sick or having a pain in their stomach on a Sunday night or Monday morning before school.
Crying and temper tantrums before or during school.
Being in a bad mood or constantly insisting that they don't want to go to school.
Bad behavior becoming progressively worse as school time approaches.
Clingy behavior — refusing to let go of the parents hand, leg or waist.
Manipulative behavior, such as crying, extreme tantrums, acting aggressively or hurting themselves in order to get out of going to school.

, Speaking to your child's teachers and observing how they interact with your child in the classroom is a good idea. It's very important that there is good communication between parent and teacher when dealing with a special needs child.


Teachers may be able to provide insights into your child's everyday behavior that you would never have known otherwise. They may have noticed patterns when it comes to the child's anxious behaviors and provide constructive advice on how you can support the child's learning at home.
On the other hand, the teacher will benefit from your insight, as you may be able to fill them in on the specifics of your child's condition and make them aware of the issues he/she has been having.
It may also be a good idea idea to speak to the principal and other teachers in the school so everyone that your child comes in contact with is aware of the issue and knows how to handle any problems with your child in an appropriate way.

, It may be a good idea to ask the teacher if they would allow you to sit it on a lesson and observe how the child behaves. This may help you to understand the source of your child's anxiety.


Keep in mind that your child may behave differently than he/she normally would if they know you are in the classroom. Therefore, it's best if you are able to sit at the back of the classroom or behind a screen, where your child is unaware of your presence.
Pay attention to how the child responds to the teacher's questions or requests, look at how he/she interacts with other children (if at all) and try to identify the times when your child is focused and when they become distracted.
Watching how they act in the school yard at playtime is also a good idea, as the school anxiety may not be related to their schoolwork, but rather to the social aspect of school and their interactions with other children.

, One of the main reasons behind school anxiety in special needs children is frustration and feelings of low self-worth when they have difficulty understanding the material and keeping up with their peers. Therefore, it is essential that you find a learning speed and technique that is appropriate for your child, which allows them to learn without feeling pressurized.


Engaging in school work that they can fully understand will boost your child's self-esteem and help them to feel happier about going to school. This is particularly important for children with intellectual or learning disabilities, who perform much better when they can work at their own pace.
Although the teacher may be able to provide separate assignments for your child, in some cases it will be necessary to enlist the help of a special needs assistant who can sit with your child and walk them through their school work. This is often necessary for children with ADHD, who can benefit hugely from having someone to keep them focused and engaged in their work.
This will allow your child to receive the individual attention they deserve, without slowing down the rest of the classroom.

, Using positive reinforcements by praising or rewarding your child for good behavior will do wonders in alleviating their school anxiety. There are several reward methods you can try:


Using a star chart is a great way to reward good behavior, as it is simple and easily understood by children. For every day that your child goes to school without complaint, does all of their homework, or doesn't throw a tantrum at the school gate, they get a gold star. After a week of gold stars (or whatever goal you choose) you can give your child a more tangible reward, like an ice cream or a small toy.
You can also use positive reinforcements by verbally praising your child each time they exhibit good behavior or complete a task, no matter how small. Try telling your child that they did a great job, clap for them or give them a sticker. Hopefully, this will encourage the child to continue to behave well.
Praise can be particularly useful for autistic children, as it will help them to associate good behavior with a reward. It can be especially helpful to tell them why the behavior is so good.

, Although it can be very difficult, it's important to be firm and assertive with your child, without getting angry or being unkind. Children need boundaries and shouldn't be allowed to manipulate parents or teachers using bad behavior in order to get their own way.


Don't allow the child to stay home from school or avoid doing their homework just because they cry or have a tantrum. Instead, take a moment to get down to their level and figure out why they are being so resistant. Calmly explain why they need to go to school and tell them that it would make you very happy if they were good.
Giving in to tantrums or other bad behavior will signal to the child that it's okay to behave in that way and that it will allow them to get what they want. This will simply make matters worse.
This is particularly important for children with conduct disorders or ADHD, who often use destructive, aggressive behaviors to wear parents and teachers down and get their own way. A firm, assertive hand combined with positive reinforcements for good behavior is your best chance of getting through to these children.

, When dealing with school anxiety in special needs children, it's very important that you spend a lot of time with them and do your best to make school a safe, happy place for them.


You can do this by sitting down with your child when they are doing their homework and working through it with them. Try to make it fun for them — use rhymes or games to help them remember information and praise them each time they complete a task.
Spending time working with your child will also help you to identify the specific areas they struggle with, whether it's sounding out words, completing mathematical problems or simply staying focused. You can then work harder in that specific area by supplementing your child's schoolwork with additional practice at home.
This is particularly important for children with learning disabilities, who are often highly intelligent, but don't process information in the same way as others.

, One great way to help your child to associate school with good, happy feelings is through role playing games. Let your child pretend to be the teacher while you pretend to be the student, or use small toys or dolls to act out situations.


This kind of role playing can actually be very revealing when it comes identifying the causes of your child's anxiety. They may say or do something during a game that will draw attention to a specific worry or concern — whether it's sitting alone at lunch time or getting in trouble with the teacher.
If possible, get other children involved in the play pretend, whether it's your child's siblings or schoolmates. Ask them to act out good behavior, so your special needs child can observe, participate and learn from it. He or she can then try to model this behavior at home and at school.
Training your child to associate school with feelings of happiness is important for children with all kinds of disabilities, whose anxiety surrounding school may stem from the negative emotions they currently associate with it — such as fear at being separated from their parents, anger at being unable to understand schoolwork, frustration at being cooped up in an enclosed space, or feelings of loneliness due to their lack of identification with other children.

Crack down on bullying.,
Encourage your students to develop good character and good values.,
Encourage assertiveness skills.,
Teach students to respect the different needs of others.,
Try pairing the special needs student with other students who seem friendly.,
Relax.",How to Socially Integrate Students with Special Needs2," Students with disabilities are at risk for bullying, so it's important to send the message that you will not allow anyone to treat others with disrespect (whether the victim is disabled or not).


Explain that adults can be bullies too, and that bullying is the fault of the bully, not of the victim. Emphasize that bullying is wrong.
Don't push the disabled student into spending time with students that they don't want to be with. Being alone is better than being pushed to spend time with mean or indifferent children, and being told that these people are your friends.Let the student choose which people they are comfortable with (if any).

, You can help by being a good role model, and always treating your students with dignity. You can also talk about values and character in your classroom activities.


Treat the student with the same respect that you want other students to give them.
Be fair. Don't expect the special needs student to follow rules that other students are allowed to break., All students, disabled ones in particular, need to know life skills like saying ""no,"" respecting bodily autonomy, and so on.


You need to respect personal space too. For example, if a student is fidgeting with their hands, it is not okay to grab their hands and force them to stop.
If you're making a demand, phrase it as a demand. If you're making a request that doesn't have to be followed, phrase it as a question, and respect the student's choice., Some people don't make eye contact when talking, some people wear hearing aids, some people rock back and forth, some people have aides, et cetera. Teach your students that these things are normal and okay. If you treat it like it's a fact of life, your students will learn that it's not a big deal, and disabled children are people like anyone else.


Don't try to push the special needs student to become indistinguishable from their peers. Instead, focus on helping them build on their strengths and improve their weaknesses., For group projects, intentionally pair the disabled student with someone who seems like they might be a good friend. Sometimes, this is the only push they need to become friends.


It won't always lead to friendship, and that's okay.

, You don't have to orchestrate every single part of the student's social life. You're just one person, and the person need to be able to act independently too.


Avoid pushing unwilling children together. They're likely to resent the interference, and rebel by not becoming friends.
It's okay if the student is alone sometimes. It only becomes a problem if the student is often alone, and doesn't want to be.

Encourage assistance and cooperation.",How to Promote Classroom Inclusion," Get to know each student one-on-one. Your classroom may include students who have some disability and students who have none, and specific disabilities may vary among students who face them. To promote an inclusive environment, you'll need to know which needs exist and must be met.


Keep in mind that no two disabled students are the same. Some disabilities exist on a spectrum (such as varying degrees of low vision), and others are extremely complex (such as autism). Talking to the parents/guardians, and getting to know the child, will help you understand their unique needs.
Recognize that not all disabilities may be diagnosed yet. Sometimes, people close to the child haven't recognized that the child is different or struggling. You may have several students with unrecognized disabilities.
Don't assume that you can defeat or cure disability.Instead, work with the child at their level, and encourage them to gain skills one step at a time.;
, You'll need to use the right tools if you want to meet the needs of students in your classroom. A physical environment that is somehow “off limits” to some of your students will make it impossible for those students to learn or feel welcome.


The exact tools will vary based on students' needs. For instance, students with vision impairments may need materials in large print or Braille. Those with speech impairments may benefit from speech synthesizers. Those with hearing impairments may need a sign language interpreter and subtitled instructional videos.Some students will have needs that are not immediately obvious. For instance, some autistic students may have a sensitivity to light and sound, so rooms with soft light and minimal noise create a preferred learning environment.

, Unfortunately, even well-meaning individuals can end up labeling disabled students by their disabilities. Instead of fixating on the things your students cannot do, focus on your students' abilities and individual accomplishments.


Viewing disabled students with pity or guilt does not empower them. Instead, you may accidentally send the message that they are less capable or less whole.

, Mean-spirited assumptions aren't the only hazardous ones to watch out for. In fact, well-intended assumptions can be just as damaging and might be harder to prevent.


If one of your students appears to need help with something, ask instead of automatically jumping in to help. Some students may prefer to work through certain difficulties themselves. Others may appreciate your help, but may also want you to help using an approach you may not have thought of.

, Language is important when creating the right attitude. As a general rule, use language that affirms the identity of each student while avoiding language that is considered derogatory or language that otherwise focuses on the disability instead of the individual.Refer to disabilities in simple language free from emotional judgments. In other words, instead of saying that someone ""suffers from"" or ""is crippled by"" a given disability, it would be better to simply state that they are ""a person with"" that disability (or, in the case of deaf, blind, or autistic people, a ""_____ person"").
Over-sensitivity can actually be harmful, too. Awkwardness over common phrases can draw unwanted attention to an impairment and may make a student feel more left out. If such phrases come up, it is best to gloss over them without making a fuss about them.

For instance, if you or another student says ""see you later"" to a blind student, it is best not to point out the awkwardness of such a phrase unless the blind student indicates that they are upset by the remark.



, As the instructor, you must guide non-disabled students in your classroom as they interact with their disabled peers. Encourage a positive and cooperative attitude among all classmates under your care.


Pay attention to your own biases and preconceptions, then correct those errors as soon as possible. You will serve as a role model to your students, and poor behavior you demonstrate will be taught to them.
Set ground rules regarding discussion and classroom behavior. When someone violates these rules and behaves inappropriately to another student, point out the violation and issue an appropriate consequence. Follow through consistently regardless of whether or not disabled students are involved and, if so, regardless of which position they find themselves in (i.e., the attacker or the victim). Don't enforce rules with disabled students that non-disabled students can get away with breaking.Nip bullying in the bud. Make it clear that students need to respect others' boundaries, praise students for intervening if they see bullying, and take victims seriously if they report being bullied., In most cases, others will be actively involved in the care and education of the disabled students in your classroom. Work directly with these guardians, counselors, and advisers when addressing those students' needs.


Discuss your students' needs with their guardians. You may have insight to share with them, and they will almost certainly have insight to share with you.
Depending on the circumstances, students with disabilities may need therapy from an outside specialist. These specialists may work through the school or may come from another source. Either way, it can be to everyone's benefit to communicate with such specialists when determining the best way to arrange classroom activities and instruction.

, Good icebreaker activities will allow students to introduce themselves to one another in a non-threatening manner. Through these activities, students can relate to the similarities they share and appreciate the differences between them more effectively as a result.


For younger students, consider using a simple icebreaker that requires each student to compare and contrast favorites with others in the group. Ask everyone to write their favorite of something (color, animal, food, etc.). Each student must sign their name and hand in the paper. Read the answers to the whole group without revealing the name, and ask students to guess which of their peers wrote each answer.
For older students, form groups of three to five and instruct each group to find similarities shared by all members of the group. To encourage discussion amongst group members, these similarities should be fairly distinctive (e.g. each student has at least two siblings) instead of general (e.g. each student is a girl).
Don't force people to speak or remember long strings of information, as this may be an access barrier. Allow people to use alternative communication (e.g. writing), and avoid games that involve memorizing facts about people.

, When introducing new material to students, break it down into smaller pieces and teach the skill step-by-step. Doing so may make it seem less overwhelming and more accessible to everyone.


For instance, when teaching a new skill that builds off information or skills that were taught previously, you may need to spend time refreshing your students on those previous skills before introducing the new material. As you introduce the new material, demonstrate how it connects to the information your students already know.

, Build some of your lesson plans so that they include activities and techniques that specifically address the various needs of disabled students in your classroom.For students with speech delays, you may need to talk more while performing various activities and include activities that encourage children to develop their speech skills (singing, activities with verbal instructions, etc.). Let them use AAC if they can't do it.
For blind or visually impaired students, you might need to verbally describe what everyone is doing during an activity and play games that involve other the senses (touch, taste, hearing, smell).
For deaf or hard of hearing students, you may need to provide written instructions for each activity and include activities that rely on senses other than hearing.
For autistic students and those with ADHD, anxiety, or behavioral problems, build routines and wait until students are naturally rested or relaxed before introducing new skills and challenges.

, Make sure that the lessons you teach address all students in your classroom, including those who have disabilities and those who do not. A classroom that caters only to students with disabilities is not truly inclusive since it neglects the needs of those without.


Depending on the circumstances, this may mean that you'll need to set different standards and parameters for each student in your classroom. Involve all students in an activity or lesson when possible, but consider altering the way that lesson must be completed for students whose disabilities would prevent them from completing it in the same way the rest of the class must. In this way, you can adequately challenge and encourage all students based on their own abilities.

, Observe the results of each activity and lesson. Prepare yourself to make changes on an “as needed” basis. Make sure that you alter activities in ways that make them more effective while preserving the integrity of the overall lesson.Consider reducing the number of items each student must learn or complete during an assignment to better match students' abilities.
Another option under some circumstances might be to increase the amount of time students are allowed for a certain learning task or evaluation. You may need to develop an individual schedule for each student based on his or her needs.

, In some instances, you may need to change the way you approach instruction and evaluation within the classroom. This, too, should be done only on an “as needed” basis.


For students with learning disabilities, you may need to increase the amount of one-on-one instruction they receive from you and from classroom tutors. Make sure, however, that you are still available to other students in the classroom when they need you.
Consider changing the way that instruction is delivered during lessons. Try different visual aids, auditory aids, and hands-on activities.
Make accommodations easily available. If other students get jealous that a student gets to use manipulatives in math, let them use them too. This can de-stigmatize disability, and may be helpful for undiagnosed disabled students.Students who struggle with various forms of output may need the opportunity to express themselves in a non-standard way. For instance, students with speech impairments may need the opportunity to write a report rather than give an oral presentation.

, Include activities that encourage students with disabilities and those without disabilities to work together. Both groups of students should be able to help one another.


Consider working with other instructors and school administrators to set up peer-mentoring programs. Give older students without disabilities an opportunity to tutor or mentor younger students with disabilities. Similarly, give older students with disabilities the opportunity to mentor to younger students with and without disabilities. In all circumstances, make sure that all students involved are benefiting from the program.

Talk to the school as soon as you realize there is a problem, or as soon as they realize there is one.,
Have the school supply a beanbag for your child.,
Find a spot in the school for the beanbag.,
Ask about additional things that can be placed in the safe spot.,
Talk to teachers about symptoms of sensory overload and oncoming meltdowns.,
Emphasize the importance of the safe space.,
Talk to the child about how to use the safe space.,
Teach the safe space as one of several calming down strategies.,
Follow up with your child once the space has been implemented.",How to Set Up a Safe Spot for Your Autistic Child at School," If your child is having difficulty, set up a meeting right away with their teachers, the administration and anyone else necessary to take care of your child's needs.;
, Beanbags provide deep pressure to your child's nervous system, which helps them relax more quickly and become calmer. If the school refuses to purchase or provide one, offer to let any child who needs it use it so that they can justify the expense. If necessary, go to the school board. It is a very important part of your child's education and special needs, and the school is already getting additional funding for your child.

, The place should be quiet and peaceful, and the child should be able to access it by themselves. This allows your child to have a safe spot they can use throughout the year to help them deal with overwhelming stimuli. Here are some potential locations:


A corner of the room, partially closed off by furniture
An adjoining room
Next to the secretary's desk. Talk to the school secretary: some secretaries don't mind having the corner by their desk, and might even talk to your child as they calm down.
Consider whether your child needs adult supervision at all times.

, Stim toys, books, and coloring books are examples of things that can occupy the child as they calm down. (The article How to Make a Calming Down Corner has more ideas.)

, Once the teachers can recognize it, they can help your child recognize it, and they can bring the child to the safe spot before a meltdown can happen.

, Your child should be able to leave class whenever they feel that they are overwhelmed, and they should never be prevented or penalized because of it. The safe space not only helps avoid meltdowns, but helps your child learn how to monitor their feelings and make decisions about their needs.

, Explain it in a cause-and-effect manner: ""When you start to feel overwhelmed, you can tell a teacher that you need to use the safe space, and then you can go there until you feel better.""

, Leaving a stressful situation helps, but it's best to know other self-calming strategies to be used in addition to the safe space. Your child would benefit from knowing:


Strategies they can use in a classroom (deep breathing, counting in head, fiddling with a small stim toy)
How to access stim toys to calm them down
How and when to tell a teacher that they are overwhelmed
How to tell when they are overwhelmed (see How to Avoid Meltdowns for tips on this)

, Ask them about their day as usual, and if they mention being stressed, ask what happened and how they handled it. As you listen, take note of whether the faculty are being supportive, and whether the child finds the corner helpful.

"
"
Simplify written directions: If you give instructions in paragraph form, with chunks of information, it might be overwhelming for some students.,
Give a small amount of work: The amount of work to be done could overwhelm some students.,
Block out irrelevant stimuli: If a student is easily distracted by visuals on a worksheet or a page, try using a blank paper to cover up the sections not being worked on at the time.,
Provide additional practice exercises: Exercises such as peer teaching activities, self-correcting materials, instructional games and computer software could help.

,
Use assistive technology: You could use electronic readers, tablets, text-to- speech programs, etc.",How to Help Students with Dyslexia1," Underlining, highlighting and dividing the task in steps could help.;
, Tearing out pages would help students concentrate on the task at hand.

, You could use line markers, larger sized fonts and increased spacing to separate sections, in order to aid the reading process.

,, to enhance the learning process.

"
"
Repeat directions: Asking the students to repeat directions might help them understand better.,
Maintain a daily routine: When the students know what to expect from a particular class, they might not be overwhelmed.

,
Provide a copy of lesson notes: For students who have trouble taking down notes during a class, you can provide them with a copy of notes.

,
Use step-by-step instruction: Presenting information in small sequential steps would help students understand new and difficult topics easily.

,
Combine verbal and visual information: An overhead projector or a handout can be used to aid the learning process and make the lesson more interactive for the students.

,
Emphasize on the need for daily revision: Daily revisions of lessons would help students in connecting old information with the new.

",How to Help Students with Dyslexia2," Students can repeat directions to not only their teachers, but also to their peers.

"
Vary response mode: Students who have a hard time with motor responses, such as writing, can be allowed to respond via other methods.,
Provide a lesson plan: This would help students follow the lessons successfully and organize their schedules accordingly.

,
Make students sit closer to you: Students, who have a hard time concentrating or focusing could be seated in the first row for extra attention.

,
Use cues to pin-point important items: The use of bullets or asterisks help students divide their time efficiently on tests and assignments.

,
Display sample work: Samples of completed assignments would help students understand what is expected of them.

,
Flexible schedule: Students can be given a little extra time to master the skills and content.

,
Allow for assignment adjustment or substitution: Those students who are not comfortable with completing projects in oral form, they could be given the option of choosing a written project.

",How to Help Students with Dyslexia3," This could include multiple choice questions, underlining, marking or sorting. Giving them extra space for writing, or responding on individual chalkboards would also help.

You will need one cup of rice per color of your choice. You will also need


White vinegar – ½ a teaspoon per color. So if you're making five colors then that’s 2.5 tablespoons of vinegar.
Variety of food colors – red, green, blue, yellow and orange
Essential oils (lavender, eucalyptus or tea tree oil) to neutralize the scent of vinegar.
Reusable plastic containers – empty ice cream tubs or empty cookie containers with lids from the grocery store will do.
An empty, flat space in your house where you can spread the rice out for drying. You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.;
, Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of vinegar. Add the food coloring and vinegar to the rice, then add a couple of drops of the essential oil of your choice.


Alternatively, you could color the rice using Colorations Liquid Watercolors. Add these liquid watercolors directly to the rice and shake it well. You don't need to leave the rice to dry when using this product.

, Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.

, You will need a pack of white rice - ideally you would use one that is almost or at its expiration date, but otherwise you can just purchase the cheapest one you can find. You will need one cup of rice per color.


Rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer – ½ a teaspoon for every cup of rice. So if you want to make five colors then that’s 2.5 tablespoons of rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer.
Variety of food colors – red, green, blue, yellow and orange
Reusable plastic containers – empty ice cream tubs or empty cookie containers with lids from the grocery store will do.
An empty, flat space in your house where you can spread the rice out for drying. You can use shallow cardboard boxes, shoe boxes or empty baking trays.

, Put a couple of drops of food coloring in a small bowl then add ½ a teaspoon of rubbing alcohol. Pour the contents of the bowl onto the rice in the container. Since you’re using rubbing alcohol, there’s no need to use any essential oils.


Some parents shy away from using rubbing alcohol because kids may accidentally place the rice in their mouth.
Rubbing alcohol and hand sanitizers technically make the rice inedible as opposed to using vinegar.

, Then remove the lid and pour the rice onto an empty baking tray and leave in the open to dry for a day. Proceed to coloring your next batch of rice.

, Colored rice that's been made with rubbing alcohol usually lasts for 6 to 7 months, provided it's been stored in a sealed container without moisture seeping in. Colored rice made with vinegar usually lasts up to 4 months.

, You can scoop a handful of each of the different colors of rice into separate clear plastic bottles with screw caps on. Kids can then shake these bottles to stimulate their hearing as well as coordination of their hands and arm muscles.

, You can pour a few scoops of each color of rice into a box or bin and add different kinds of materials, from miniature toys, to felt shapes, to colored balls and fabric pompoms that you can find at most craft stores.


The idea is to bombard your child’s sense of sight and touch with colors, shapes and textures, with the colored rice serving as a backdrop.

, Place each color of rice in a separate container and give your child a shovel or a small scoop and her own container. Ask her to pour the colored rice from the main containers into her own, where she can mix the colors as she likes

, Place the different colored rice in small ziplock bags and label each bag with their corresponding color. This will teach the child about colors and at the same time, stimulate her sense of touch.

, For older kids, use the colored sensory rice as the backdrop for a little craft project. You can pour the colored rice into a shoebox and add some miniature things to make it look like a small beach or a small underwater “aquarium” with miniature plastic fish and corals.

, Listed below are some tried and tested containers for storing the colored rice:


A shallow container with lid
Cardboard box
Large plastic salad bowl
Foil roasting pan

, Storing rice in a container with a lid is preferable and recommended as it will prevent moisture in the air from spoiling the texture and color of the rice. By using the lid you can store the colored rice for a longer time as compared to storing without a lid.

, You don’t have to worry about coloring the rice over and over again, as colored rice will stay for as long as you need it. The color might fade a bit over time but it won't disappear completely.

Decide how to use the wiki format and how to evaluate the assignment.,
Instruct the students to learn about the way wikiHow works.,
Find a topic.,
Begin a draft process.,
Collect visuals.,
Begin editing and refining the article, once it is posted.,
Have students submit a link to the article once the assignment is completed.",How to Use wikiHow in a University Course," Wikis are collaborative, so if individual writing ability, grammar, syntax, etc. is required for assessment, evaluation can take place before posting. A draft submission process is helpful for this. If collaboration is a learning requirement or a desired exercise, then students can use the wikiHow platform to compose and post their instructions. Students can use their draft folder on wikiHow to write and edit their work before posting to the community.

Sylvia (2014)and Bosman & Zagenczyk (2011)suggest applying Bloom’s cognitive domain levels, such as remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating, when evaluating social media assignments.
Consider giving students the option to expand or rewrite an existing article. Since wikiHow has more than 180,000 articles, it can sometimes be challenging to come up with a unique topic for a new article. There is a lot of low-hanging fruit, particularly articles called ""stubs"" which have been flagged as being in dire need of editing. A list of stubs (filtered by category, if desired) can be provided specifically for the assignment (ask here).

Offer extra credit if the article is chosen as a Rising Star or featured on the home page. It's acceptable for students to ask for quick consideration for featuring.

;
, Understanding the community policies and guidelines before beginning is important.

Have them read the Writer's Guide. Suggest that they review featured articles on the wikiHow home page as examples of the level of quality they should strive for.
Have students create their own account in wikiHow. Encourage them to use their real names (or an obvious variant) for authentication purposes, but it's worth noting that as a wiki, recognition of sole authorship is counterintuitive.
Online privacy and the rules and responsibilities of contributing to the wikiHow community should be discussed. Real-world applications of wikis can also be integrated into this discussion, such as project management tools or open-source software development.

, Encourage students to choose a topic related to their program of study. The most effective instructions come from procedures that are familiar to students. Instructors may prefer to keep topic generation open to all subjects.

Students should also search wikiHow for existing topics (to avoid duplication) and the list of requested topics to help them decide. Naturally, unique topics are encouraged, and they seem to be the topics that draw the most attention. Brainstorming exercises can be used to generate topic ideas. Duplicate topics run the risk of getting merged or deleted, since on a wiki, collaboration to build a single high-quality page is encouraged over the creation of multiple pages on the same topic. If a student is unsure whether their desired topic is a duplicate of an existing article, they can always ask here.
Research for topic selection can be completed as an alternate assignment. You might ask students are asked to research two topic ideas, submit a proposal, and meet with the instructor to discuss their topics. In the meeting discussion, students are asked:
Whether there is an existing topic in wikiHow
Whether they have experience performing the task
How they plan to visualize their procedure
By the end of the meeting, the most suitable topic is chosen and the student can begin drafting their article.

,

Drafts are important for two reasons:

Instructors can focus on the mechanics of writing technical instructions, such as, grammar, syntax, mood, audience awareness, etc.
It helps to prevent plagiarism


To create a draft folder in wikiHow, click on Switch to Advanced Editing under the article title in the template. This opens to a separate text editor in which students can begin writing. This editor allows authors to track changes, submit links and references and also to save images.

Students should create a separate Word/OpenOffice/Pages document as back-up, which can also be used for editing and draft submissions.



, Visual communication is an essential component of technical instructions. Depending on the subject matter of the instructions, there are many different visuals that can accompany the text:

AutoCAD drawings, schematics, isometric drawings
Screen shots, code strips/packets Photos, images
Students are encouraged to use as much imagery as possible. Techniques to enhance the images, such as using arrow or circle overlays, can be incorporated into a visual communication lesson or exercise. Copyright laws around the use of images found online can also be part of a discussion. Students are encouraged to find and read policies on the use of proprietary images and Creative Commons licensing.

, The final stage of the assignment will be to pull together the final drafts of the text and incorporate the visuals in wikiHow.

This is also the opportunity to incorporate tips, notes, cautions, warnings or dangers associated with the topic. Warnings and tips are essential components of technical instructions, as there are usually dangers to equipment and personnel in a technical environment, as well as helpful tips which come from experience. This information can be as simple as a reminder to back up essential data, or life-threatening dangers. Also, there is a section to document references if secondary sources are used. Students should be encouraged to monitor their article after posting for comments from community members.

, An email introducing the topic and the link is usually sufficient. If you would like to see the final draft before it's edited by the community, have students submit their back-up draft at the same time. Another option is to look at the article's history (accessible when logged in) to find a the last revision made by the student (or have the student send you a link to that revision)."

Decide where you need videos in your lesson plan.,
Search for appropriate videos.,
Look for alignment with Common Core.",How to Use Videos in the Classroom in Common Core1,"  Videos are appropriate in some lessons, and not others.  


You may choose videos for a part of a lecture because you already know there is high quality, interesting content.  
You may find students not engaged in a part of a lesson because the material is dry; in this case, showing them videos could help.
Many teachers who are piloting Flipped Classrooms and/or Blended Learning find videos particularly appropriate.;
,  Check with your peers, or simply look online.  There is an abundance of videos, and the issue may be finding the right one. If you are looking for younger kids, you will find a lot of good material at PBS Learning Media.  National Geographic is good for science, and code.org for programming.


You may find it easier to look on a site that has videos from different publishers, like OpenEd or Edutopia.  They make it easier to browse if you don't know where to look.

,  Common Core encourages use of new material like videos, but you want to see if the video you chose is Common Core aligned to the class you are teaching.


Videos and other teaching material are labeled so you can easily find them. For example,if you are looking for Common Core, English Language Arts, Literacy for Kindergarten, you will see the resource labeled like this: CCSS.ELA-LITERACY.L.K.1

Decide if a subset of students in your class would benefit from video instruction.,
Decide how you will deliver the videos.,
Make sure the videos don't get in the way of other instruction.,
Supervise.",How to Use Videos in the Classroom in Common Core2,"


Any student can benefit from videos, but it is common to find videos to help students that are going faster or slower than the rest of the class.  Students with learning difficulties may benefit as well.
Ensure no jealousy from other students.  Some students may resent others looking at videos, so try to combat this from the get-go by providing some opportunities for all students to access engaging material. The time spent on videos does not have to be even from student to student, but giving everyone at least a little time with video instruction can help combat jealousy.

,  Ensure technology is not an issue.

If you borrow some devices, ensure they comply with school rules.   Most districts have policies about what websites are appropriate for students to use, and which are not.

, Ensure there is no distraction.  You may consider headphones to avoid excessive noise in the classroom. Some schools will let kids use computers in their library.

,  Giving students technology can be a double edged sword: Students may take advantage and end up playing a video game instead of doing the video assignment. Providing adequate supervision is key to success.


iPads and Chromebooks are cheaper than regular computers, but can disappear easily.

Without using the above guide, practice your skills by translating the following conversation between Roberto and Maria to English.",How to Have a Basic Spanish Conversation," This can be said in a number of ways. The most basic is ""Hola!"" (OH-lah), which you probably learned from Dora as a kid.


Although this is short and simple, longer words may be used to spice it up and make you seem more educated. Try using, ""Buenos días!""(BWEH-nos-DEE-as), which means ""Good morning!"". Also, you could use, ""Buenas tardes!"" (BWEH-nas-tard-ehs), which means ""Good afternoon!"", depending on the time of the day.;
, (COH-MOH-teh-jam-as).

, To say, ""my name is _____"", say ""me llamo _____"" (m-eh-JAH-moh_____). The blank below is for your name, such as ""me llamo Teresa"".

, Say ""Mucho gusto"" (moo-choh-goos-toh) for ""nice to meet you"", literally meaning ""much pleasure"". Someone could then respond either ""Igualmente!"" (IG-wall-men-teh), or ""El gusto es mío"" (EL-goos-toh-es-MEE-oh). The former means ""Nice to meet you, too"" (literally ""likewise""), and the latter means ""The pleasure is mine"".

, Someone will usually ask this question with ""¿De dónde eres?"" (DEE-don-day-air-es).

, You or the other person will answer ""¿De dónde eres?"" with, ""Yo soy de ______"" (YO-SOY-DEH-). The blank would be your country. The US is ( Estados Unidos ).

, This is asked using ""¿Cómo estas?"" (COH-MOH-est-ahs) for ""how are you?""

, There are multiple answers to the above question. You use ""Yo estoy"" (I am _____). Options for the blank are: ""bien"", meaning good, (BEE-en), ""feliz"", meaning happy, (fel-LEASE), ""mal"" meaning ""bad"", ""cansado"", meaning tired, (con-sods-oh), and enfermo, meaning sick, (en-fer-MOH).

, To ask this, you would say ""¿Cuantos años tines?"", literally meaning ""How many years do you have?"". It is pronounced: ""KWAN-tos-an-YOS-TEE-en-ehs"".

, You would answer that question with a number, obviously. For a list of numbers, see Count up to 10 in Spanish, Count from 10 to 19 in Spanish, Count from 20 to 39 in Spanish, and Count from 40 to 100 in Spanish.

, Someone would ask this by saying ""¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?"" (KWAN-doh-es-TOO-coom-PLEH-ahn-YOSE).

, You would say your birthday by answering ""Es el ____ de _____"" (Es-el) and (DEH). The first blank would be the date, such as the second (dos), the thirty first (treinta y uno) or the nineteenth (diecinueve). See Count up to 10 in Spanish, Count from 10 to 19 in Spanish and Count from 20 to 39 in Spanish, for a list of numbers. The second blank would be the month, such as July (julio), August (agosto), or March (marzo). See Say the Calendar Months in Spanish for a list of months.

, Most people know how to say ""Bye"" in Spanish. ""Adios!"", or (AH-DEE-OHS). If it is evening or night, say ""¡Buenas noches!"", or ""Good night!"", pronounced (BUEN-AHS-NO-CH-EHS).

, Try to do this without the help of anything but your own memory.


Roberto: ¡Hola!
Maria: ¡Buenos días!
Roberto: ¿Cómo te llamas?
Maria: Me llamo María. ¿Y tú?
Roberto: Me llamo Roberto. Mucho gusto.
Maria: ¡El gusto es mío! ¿De dónde eres?
Roberto: Yo soy de España. ¿Y tú?
Maria: Yo soy de Honduras. ¿Cómo estás?
Roberto: Estoy feliz.¿Y tú?
Maria: Estoy bien, gracias. ¿Cuántos años tienes?
Roberto: Quince años. ¿Y tú?
Maria: Catorce. ¿Cuándo es tu cumpleaños?
Roberto: Es el dos de abril. ¿Y el tuyo?
Maria: Es el once de junio. ¡Adiós!
Roberto: ¡Buenas noches!

Start by learning to count to five.,
Learn the numbers for six through ten.,
Put it all together to count to ten.,
Memorize the numbers 11 through 15.,
Study the numbers 16 through 19.,
Count in tens.,
Understand how to form other numbers.,
Review basic accentuation rules.,
Watch TV shows or movies in Spanish.,
Listen to Spanish music.,
Talk to native speakers.",How to Count up to 10 in Spanish," It may be easier for you to learn how to count to ten (and beyond!) if you split the numbers into chunks. Memorizing shorter sequences is easier than trying to learn all the numbers at once. Repeat the words until you can say them without thinking.Although not typically included in counting, you can say zero in Spanish as cero (SAY-roh).
One in Spanish is uno (OO-noh).
Two in Spanish is dos (doss).
Three in Spanish is tres (tress).
Four in Spanish is cuatro (KWA-tro).
Five in Spanish is cinco (SEEN-ko).;
, Once you've committed the Spanish words for numbers one through five to memory, you're ready to move on to the next set of numbers. Repeat the new numbers over and over until you know them as well as you know one through five.Six in Spanish is seis (SAISS).
Seven in Spanish is siete (SYE-te).
Eight in Spanish is ocho (O-cho).
Nine in Spanish is nueve (NWAI-be).
Ten in Spanish is diez (DYESS).

, When you have both sets of numbers memorized, all you have to do is put them in a single series and say them all together. You now know how to count up to 10 in Spanish.Count to ten repeatedly until the words are automatic for you.
One way to incorporate the Spanish words into your every day life is to try to automatically think of the Spanish word for the number when you're looking at a number of items.
For example, if you have a bowl of fruit in your kitchen that has two apples, three bananas, and seven oranges, you might think to yourself that there are dos apples, tres bananas, and siete oranges. It doesn't matter whether you know the Spanish words for those fruits.

, There's no point in stopping once you've learned to count up to 10 in Spanish. Using the same strategy you did when you learned to count to ten, learn the Spanish words for the numbers 11 through 15. The Spanish language has unique words for these numbers.For 11, say once (OHN-say).
For 12, say doce (DOH-say).
For 13, say trece (TRAY-say).
For 14, say catorce (kah-TOHR-say).
For 15, say quince (KEEN-say).

, When you learn numbers 16 through 19, you're also learning how all the other numbers in Spanish are formed. You'll take the word for 10, diez, include an ee sound (""y"" in Spanish means ""and""), and then the word for the second digit.16 is dieciséis (DYEESS-ee-SAYSS).
17 is diecisiete (DYEESS-ee-SYAY-tay).
18 dieciocho (DYEESS-ee-OH-choh).
19 is diecinueve (DYEESS-ee-NWAY-bay).

, To figure out how to form other numbers in Spanish, you'll have to memorize the base numbers by learning how to count in tens. These number words are the building blocks for saying larger numbers in Spanish.For 20, say veinte (BAYN-tay).
For 30, say treinta (TRAYN-tah).
For 40, say cuarenta (kwah-RAYN-tah).
For 50, say cincuenta (seen-KWAYN-tah).
For 60, say sesenta (say-SAYN-tah).
For 70, say setenta (say-TAYN-tah).
For 80, say ochenta (oh-CHAYN-tah).
For 90, say noventa (noh-BAYN-tah).

, Now that you know how to count to 10, and you know how to count in tens, you can easily combine your knowledge to say or write in Spanish any number up to 99.Keep in mind that the spelling may differ, and you may need to stress different syllables.
However, if you understand the basics of how numbers are formed, you can at least recognize any number you see or hear in Spanish.
As with everything else, remember to practice this skill regularly and repeat the numbers to yourself at least once every few days.
Over time, counting in Spanish will become second nature to you.

, In Spanish, if you see an accent mark over a letter, it tells you that you are supposed to stress or emphasize that syllable when you pronounce the word. Some Spanish words are spelled the same way, but mean entirely different things depending on which syllable is stressed.The essential accentuation rule in Spanish is that if the word ends in a vowel, an n, or an s, you'll put stress on the next to last syllable. With any other word, you'll stress the last syllable.
However, if the word has an accent mark, you stress that syllable and ignore the general rule.
For example, in your numbers, you may have noticed an accent in the word for 16, dieciséis. This means that you should stress the last syllable, despite the fact that it ends with an s.


, Listening to people speak Spanish can help you understand more about how the words fit together and how they're said in the context of normal conversation.Actors typically pronounce their words without excessive regional dialect – unless the show or movie takes place in a specific geographic area. This makes it easier for you to learn the language.
Keep in mind that Spanish is spoken in many countries all over the world, giving rise to multiple dialects and variations. Even for a native speaker, someone from another country can be difficult to understand.

, Music can be an easy way to learn a language because of the rhythm and repetitiveness of the lyrics. If you find music with Spanish lyrics that appeals to you, listening to it on a regular basis can help you understand how words are pronounced.If you think back to how you learned your first language, you'll probably recall that there was a lot of music involved. Songs are a very efficient way to learn words and how they fit together.
You may not understand exactly what something means, but the important part when you're just beginning to learn Spanish is to listen to the way the words are pronounced and how the language sounds.

, When you're learning any no language, there's nothing better to enhance your understanding of the language and the way the words are spoken than to talk to people who are fluent in the language.Native speakers also can correct your pronunciation and give you tips on how to pronounce the words correctly.
Particularly if you have another language in common, a native speaker may be able to give you tips on how to pronounce words in Spanish that you wouldn't have picked up on otherwise.

Listen and repeat.,
Pronounce all letters correctly.

,
The Enye (Ñ) makes a Nya sound as in the word: jalapeño

,
The Elle (LL) makes a ya sound as in the word: caballo

,
The Erre (RR) makes a rolled R sound, as in: Guitarra (Don't worry if this does not happen for you right away or even ever.,
One R is pronounced by flicking your tongue up very quickly and slickly.,The H can sometimes be silent, as in Hielo (ice) which can be pronounced Ee-el-o

,
The J and X can sometimes be pronounced as we would say the h sound.,
When two vowels are right next to each other, they merge into one.,
For example: ""Bien"" (Fine) isn't pronounced ""Bee- en"", it's pronounced more of ""Byen"".,
Note: Spanish vowels are the same as English.,
Find the accented syllable.,
Stay motivated.",How to Improve Spanish Accent," Listen to music, watch movies or TV shows or just look up how the word is pronounced. Google Translate is a good site for this. Try to break every word down. Start with the first syllable, then the second, and so on if there are more. Listen and repeat exactly how the speaker said it.;
,,,, The Spanish are very forgiving. If you wish to practice this technique, however, the best thing I have found to do is to breathe out hard, and allow an L sound to emanate from your tongue. Leave the tip of your tongue very loose so that when the hard breathe comes out over the tongue tip, it will flip up and down. The L sound converts in our ears as an R sound.) For more on how to roll your R's, visit this serperate WikiHow article: https://www.wikihow.com/Roll-Your-%22R%22s

, Do it fast, it sounds like a very light, quick D. Once it sounds like a quick D, you've got there.

,, So, once again the word jalapeño would be pronounced: hal-a-penyo. Also the word Texas would be spoken as Tehas. This is not a hard-and-fast rule for the X. The more Westernized a thing becomes the less strength is emphasized for a particular rule. Occasionally, for the J it can be more of a zha sound. For more on how to pronounce the letters, visit this separate WikiHow article: https://www.wikihow.com/Pronounce-Spanish-Words

, This is rule also applies when a word ends in a vowel, and the next word starts with one. They are basically next to each other.

, Why? Because there are two vowels next to each other. You'll have to get used to this.

, (A, E, I, O, U). Also note they are pronounced differently.

, The accented syllable is the one that gets the most emphasis or that you dwell on a bit longer. All ""flat"" words have an accent if they end in a consonant other than ""n"" or ""s"" (the letter ""y"" is considered a consonant). These are words that have the accented syllable second from the end: fácil, césped, mártir, álbum. All ""high-pitched"" words have an accent if they end in a vowel, n, or s. These are words that have the accent on the last syllable: caerá, alhelí, así, camión, jamás.

, You learned the sounds of your native language, you can do it for another one. Over 400 million Spanish speakers can do it, and so can babies, so you can too.

Follow the thousands' rules for million and billions.",How to Count in Spanish," Before you can count to higher numbers, you need to learn the Spanish words for zero through nine. These words will form the base or root of many larger numbers.


The Spanish words for 0 through 9 are:0: cero (say-roh)
1: uno (oo-noh)
2: dos (dohs)
3: tres (trehs)
4: cuatro (kwaht-roh)
5: cinco (sink-oh)
6: seis (says)
7: siete (see-yet-ay)
8: ocho (ohch-oh)
9: nueve (noo-ay-veh)


Note that cero stands alone and does not form the base for any other larger number.
Also note that you should only use uno when talking about the number itself. When describing the number of objects, use un for masculine nouns (e.g. ""un chico"") and una for feminine nouns (e.g. ""una chica).
;
, Some of these numbers are derived from their ones' group counterparts, while others are a combination of the term for ""ten"" and the corresponding one's group term.


The word for 10 is: diez (dee-ays)
The terms for 11 through 15 are derived from their ones' group counterparts:

11: once (ohn-say)
12: doce (doh-say)
13: trece (tray-say)
14: catorce (kah-tor-say)
15: quince (keen-say)


The words for 16 through 19 are combinations of diez (10) and the corresponding ones' place term. Change the z in diez to a c, and link it to the ones' value with the letter i, as follows:

16: dieciséis (dee-ay-see-says)
17: diecisiete (dee-ay-see-see-yet-ay)
18: dieciocho (dee-ay-see-ohch-oh)
19: diecinueve (dee-ay-see-noo-ay-veh)



, The numbers in the 20s group are all formed from linking the term for 20 with the corresponding ones' group word.


The word for 20 is: viente (vee-ehn-tay)
When forming 21 through 29, drop the ending e and change it to an i,"" as follows:

21: veintiuno (vee-ehn-tee-oo-noh)
22: veintidós (vee-ehn-tee-dohs)
23: veintitrés (vee-ehn-tee-trehs)
24: veinticuatro (vee-ehn-tee-kwaht-roh)
25: veinticinco (vee-ehn-tee-sink-oh)
26: veintiséis (vee-ehn-tee-says)
27: veintisiete (vee-ehn-tee-see-yet-ay)
28: veintiocho (vee-ehn-tee-ohch-oh)
29: veintinueve (vee-ehn-tee-noo-ay-veh)



, The tens' group terms are all derived from the ones' group terms, with some variations. You'll need to know these basic words before you can construct any number from 31 through 99.


The tens' place words for 30 through 90 are:30: treinta (treh-een-tah)
40: cuarenta (kwar-en-tah)
50: cincuenta (sink-kwen-tah)
60: sesenta (seh-sehn-tah)
70: setenta (seh-tehn-tah)
80: ochenta (ohch-ehn-tah)
90: noventa (noh-vehn-tah)



, Unlike the 20s group, you will not alter the root tens' place term when forming numbers from 31 through 99. Instead, you'll separate the tens' group term and the appropriate ones' group term with the Spanish word for “and” — y.Examples of this rule in action include:

31: treinta y uno
42: cuarenta y dos
53: cincuenta y tres
64: sesenta y cuatro
75: setenta y cinco
86: ochenta y seis
97: noventa y siete



, You'll obviously need to know this word when counting from 100 through 199, but you'll also need to use it when forming even larger numbers within the hundreds' group since it forms the base for all other numbers within this group.The Spanish word for 100 is: cien (see-ehn)
Note that you'll only use cien when saying “100” exactly. When using this number to form the base of other numbers, you'll add -to to the end of the root, creating ciento.

, To form the remaining hundreds' place numbers, you'll need to add the corresponding singles' number (or an abbreviated form) to the front of cientos.


The Spanish words for the remaining hundreds' group are:

200: doscientos (dohs-see-ehn-tohs)
300: trescientos (tray-see-ehn-tohs)
400: cuatrocientos (kwat-roh-see-ehn-tohs)
500: quinientos (keen-ee-ehn-tohs)
600: seiscientos (says-see-ehn-tohs)
700: setecientos (seh-teh-see-ehn-tohs)
800: ochocientos (ohch-oh-see-ehn-tohs)
900: novecientos (noh-veh-see-ehn-tohs)


Also note that the terms for 500, 700, and 900 are slightly irregular in form, but the basic rule still applies.

, When you need to say or write a number that falls between the even hundreds' group values, simply follow the appropriate hundreds' group term with the number you need. You do not need to insert y (“and”) in between the hundreds' and tens' place values.


Examples of this principle include:

103: ciento tres
530: quinientos treienta
872: ochocientos setenta y dos



, You'll need to memorize and use this word when counting through all of the thousands' group numbers, from 1000 through 9999.The Spanish term for 1000 is: un mil (oon meel)
For all numbers from 1000 through 1099, you'll need to keep the ""un"" before ""mil.""

For example, 1072 would be: un mil setenta y dos


For all numbers from 1100 through 1999, however, you can drop the '""un"" before ""mil.""

For example, 1272 would be: mil doscientos setenta y dos



, To count through the remaining thousands' group, you'll simply need to place the appropriate singles' value term in from of the Spanish term for 1000, mil.


Note that this applies to both thousands, ten-thousands, and hundred-thousands.
The Spanish words for the remaining thousands' group are:

2000: dos mil
3000: tres mil
4000: cuatro mil
5000: cinco mil
6000: seis mil
7000: siete mil
8000: ocho mil
9000: nueve mil


Examples of the Spanish words for the tens-thousands and hundred-thousands group would include:

10000: diez mil
34000: treinta y cuatro mil
800000: ochocientos mil



, When counting numbers between thousands, ten-thousands, or hundred-thousands place settings, write the appropriate thousands' group term followed by the appropriate term for the smaller portion of the number. No irregularities should apply.


Examples would include:

34872: treinta y cuatro mil ochocientos setenta y dos
800103: ochocientos mil ciento tres



, The main words for 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 will form the base words for other numbers in the millions' and billions' group.


The Spanish terms are:

1,000,000: un millón (oon mee-yohn)
1,000,000,000: mil millones (meel mee-yohn-ays)



, All the rules you've learned so far are applicable to numbers within the millions' and billions' groups. You should continue to follow them without exception.


For larger numbers within these groups, precede the term for ""million"" or ""billion"" with the appropriate singles' value.
For numbers that fall within the major millions' and billions' place values, write the number as it usually is without any linking term.
Examples include:

4,800,103: cuatro millones ochocientos mil ciento tres
78,800,103: setenta y ocho mil millones ochocientos mil ciento tres

Check with the local language programs in your community.,
Ask at local schools if there is anyone you could speak Spanish with.,
Find a private tutor who can connect you with Spanish speakers.",How to Find Someone to Speak Spanish With1," Look for language institutes or other centers that offer Spanish Language classes. If there aren’t any in your area there might be also programming at community centers, youth centers, or international cultural centers.


Language schools often sponsor clubs or even courses that give members the opportunity to practice conversational Spanish, check with them to see what your options are. If they don’t have any clubs you can always ask to start one.
They may also be able to put you in touch with other students who are looking for Spanish immersion opportunities. It is likely that they will have students who are also looking for practice opportunities.
Ask if they have a community board where you can post to make connections with other Spanish speakers. Many language centers will provide some kind of forum for Spanish speakers who are looking to make a connection.;
, Try the Spanish departments at local colleges and universities, community colleges, and high schools. All these institutions will have Spanish teachers on staff. They will have students who are learning Spanish who may also be looking for places to practice.


While local high schools and universities will likely have Spanish-speaking instructors and courses, they may also have extra-curricular study groups you can take part in. Many groups may be open to the public or members of the community.
Ask if there are students who are studying Spanish who may be willing to practice with you. There usually be students who are also interested in expanding their skill set. Some people find it easier to learn in groups.
If there is a school nearby that offers advanced course or even degrees in Spanish ask where their students go to practice their language skills. Students learning Spanish are likely to also be looking for immersion opportunities, local schools may be able to provide you with the advice that they provide their students.

, Tutors can provide more than initial lessons.They can also help with guided practice and connecting you to the Spanish speaking community.


Private tutors are not always expensive, look for college students, or teachers who are on summer break.
Tutoring doesn’t have to be formal, some will be happy to meet you at a coffee shop or even give you lessons online.
A tutor is a great first stop because he or she can help to introduce you to the Spanish speaking community in your area.

Understand subjects.,
Determine the subject.,
Remove the ending.,
Conjugate ""-ar"" verbs.,
Conjugate ""-er"" verbs.,
Conjugate ""-ir"" verbs.,
Learn the conjugate the pronoun ""se"".,
Place the form of ""se"" in front of the verb.,
Conjugate the verb.,
Conjugate stem-changing verbs.,
Conjugate verbs that change in the first person.,
Conjugate other irregular verbs in the present tense.",How to Conjugate Spanish Verbs (Present Tense)," The subject is the noun that the verb is referring to. To conjugate a verb in Spanish, you'll first need to be familiar with the several different personal subject pronouns in the language. Here they are:Yo — I(formal)

Tú — you (singular familiar)

Usted — you (singular formal)

Él, ella — he, she

Nosotros/as — we

Vosotros/as — you (plural familiar)

Ustedes — you (plural formal)

Ellos/as — they

Note that while there are eight different subjects, there are only six different forms for conjugation. É, ella, and usted are conjugated the same way, and so are ellos, ellas, and ustedes.


;
, Once you're familiar with subjects, you'll need to find the corresponding noun for the verb. If the verb is necesitar (to need), who is it that needs something? Is it you? The person you're talking to? A group of boys? The subject will determine the form of the conjugation.

, All Spanish verbs have the endings of either ""-ar,"" ""-ir,"" or ""-er."" Once you remove the current ending, you can add on the new corresponding ending. Unless the verb is reflexive; then it will have ""se"" tacked on past the end of the verb., Once you learn the form of conjugation for ""-ar"" verbs in the present tense, you can just add the form to the end of any regular ""-ar"" verbs. Here are the rules for conjugating them in the present tense, using the verb hablar (to talk):


Yo: o - hablo


Tú: as - hablas


Él, Ella, Usted: a - habla


Nosotros/as: amos - hablamos


Vosotros/as: áis - habláis


Ellos/as, Ustedes: an - hablan


, Learn the form for conjugating ""-er"" verbs in the present tense and just add it to the end of each verb. Here are the endings for the verb ""-er"" in the present tense using the verb beber (to drink) as an example:



Yo: o - bebo


Tú: es - bebes


Él, Ella, Usted: e - bebe


Nosotros/as: emos - bebemos


Vosotros/as: éis - bebéis


Ellos/as, Ustedes: en - beben


, Learn the form for conjugating ""-ir"" verbs in the present tense and just add it to the end of each verb. Here are the endings for the verb ""-ir"" in the present tense, using the verb vivir (to live):



Yo: o - vivo


Tú: es - vives


Él, Ella, Usted: e - vive


Nosotros/as: imos - vivimos


Vosotros/as: ís - vivís


Ellos/as, Ustedes: en - viven


, To conjugate a reflexive verb, the first thing you'll have to do is to learn how to conjugate it depending on the subject pronoun. Each subject pronoun has a distinct form of se. These conjugated forms of se will work in any tense. Here they are:Yo: me


Tú: te


Él, Ella, Usted: se


Nosotros/as: nos


Vosotros/as: os


Ellos/as, Ustedes: se


, Before you proceed, you can place the appropriate form of ""se"" before the verb. You can think of this as removing the ""se"" at the end of the verb before you conjugate it. Remove the ""se"" ending from the end -- you've already conjugated it.

, Now just conjugate the verb according to the rules of conjugating a verb in the present tense -- provided that it's a regular verb. Place the verb after the correct form of se and you'll be done conjugating. You can eliminate the subject pronoun before the reflexive pronoun when you make a statement using a reflexive verb; for example, you can say ""Yo me lavo"" to say ""I wash myself,"" but the statement ""Me lavo"" is more common. Here are the forms of the conjugated reflexive verb levanto (to get up) in the present tense:



Yo: me levanto


Tú: te levantas


Él, Ella, Usted: se levanta


Nosotros/as: nos levantamos


Vosotros/as: os levantáis


Ellos/as, Ustedes: se levantan


, These verbs are also referred to as “radical changing verbs”, which means “stem” or “root” in Spanish. In stem-changing verbs, the stem vowel of the verb changes in the present tense. However, the stem does not change in the nosotros or vosotros forms of the verb. There are a few different ways that the stem vowel can change. Here are some examples:


Conjugate verbs with a stem change from o to ue using dormir (to sleep) as an example:


Yo: duermo


Tú: duermes


Él, Ella, Usted: duerme


Nosotros/as: dormimos


Vosotros/as: dormís


Ellos/as, Ustedes: duermen



Conjugate verbs with a stem change from e to ie using querer (to want) as an example:


Yo: quiero


Tú: quieres


Él, Ella, Usted: quiere


Nosotros/as: queremos


Vosotros/as: queréis


Ellos/as, Ustedes: quieren



Conjugate verbs with a stem change from e to i using seguir (to follow or continue) as an example:


Yo: sigo


Tú: sigues


Él, Ella, Usted: sigue


Nosotros/as: seguimos


Vosotros/as: seguís


Ellos/as, Ustedes: siguen




, Some verbs are irregular in their first-person present tense form. The rest of the forms of the verbs will follow the conventions of conjugating regular verbs. It's best to memorize these verbs to conjugate them correctly. Here are a few example of verbs that are only irregular in the first person (the yo form):


Conjugate verbs that change from c to zc in the first person:


Conocer (to be acquainted with): Yo conozco


Agradecer (to thank): Yo agradezco


Ofrecer (to be acquainted with): Yo ofrezco



Conjugate verbs that have a g appear in the first person:


Caer (to fall): Yo caigo


Salir (to go out): Yo salgo


Tener (to have): Yo tengo


Traer (to bring): ""Yo traigo""


Conjugate verbs with others changes in the yo form:


Dar (to give): Yo doy


Saber (to know): Yo sé


Ver (to see): Yo veo




, There are other commonly used verbs -- and some not so commonly used -- that are not stem-changing verbs but which are just conjugated in an irregular way. Memorizing these words will help you speak basic Spanish. Here are some of the most common irregular verbs conjugated in the present tense:Estar (to be):


Yo: estoy


Tú: estás


Él, Ella, Usted: está


Nosotros/as: estamos


Vosotros/as: estáis


Ellos/as, Ustedes: están




Ser (to be):


Yo: soy


Tú: eres


Él, Ella, Usted: es


Nosotros/as: somos


Vosotros/as: sois


Ellos, Ellas, Ustedes: son




Ir (to go):


Yo: voy


Tú: vas


Él, Ella, Usted: va


Nosotros/as: vamos


Vosotros/as: vais


Ellos/as, Ustedes: van

In many communities, local churches offer Spanish language services. These churches will be mostly likely to have large groups of Spanish-speaking parishioners. Often, you can tell just by looking at the sermon schedule if a church serves a large Spanish-speaking population.
If you are a member of a church, ask around, see if there are any volunteer opportunities that involve Spanish-speaking church members or the Spanish speaking community. Offer to help in exchange for some language practice.
Post a notice on the Church message board asking if there are any Spanish speakers in the area, who would be willing to talk..

, As with any culture, restaurants and grocery stores are central to many Spanish-speaking communities, try visiting the ones near you.


Find one near you and see if Spanish is spoken there. In addition to being an excellent place to practice your new language skills, these businesses will be excellent places to learn about Latino culture.
Remember that food and beverages often use a specific vocabulary. Make sure you have a good grasp of what you are ordering and don’t be afraid to ask question or explain that Spanish isn’t your first language.Depending on the business you choose you may be addressed in Spanish or in English, if you are addressed in English explain that you are a new Spanish speaker and politely ask if you can order in Spanish.

Conjugate ver in the present indicative.,
Learn how to conjugate ver in the preterit indicative.,
Conjugate in the imperfect indicative.,
Use the future indicative.,
Know how to conjugate ver in the conditional indicative.",How to Conjugate Ver1," One of the most important verb conjugations to know is the present indicative, which is used to talk about a current action. In this case, the present indicative is used to talk about something one currently sees.


Example: ""I see the cat,"" Veo al gato.

yo: veotú: ves
él/ella/usted: ve
nosotros/-as: vemos
vosotros/-as: veis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: ven;
, The preterit indicative form of ver is used to talk about something definitely or concretely seen in the past which has since come to a clear end and is no longer currently being seen.


Example: ""You saw the cat yesterday,"" Viste al gato ayer.

yo: vi
tú: viste
él/ella/usted: vio
nosotros/-as: vimos
vosotros/-as: visteis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: vieron

, Use the imperfect indicative when talking about something definitely or concretely seen in the past when the action of seeing that thing has not come to a final end, thereby suggesting that the same sight could be seen in the present.


Example: ""They used to see the cat,"" Ellos veian al gato.

yo: veía
tú: veías
él/ella/usted: veía
nosotros/-as: veíamos
vosotros/-as: veíais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: veían

, Reserve the future indicative tense for conversations about something that will be seen, for certain, at some point in the future.


Example: ""We will see the cat tomorrow,"" Veríamos al gato de mañana.

yo: vería
tú: verías
él/ella/usted: vería
nosotros/-as: veríamos
vosotros/-as: veríais
ellos/ellas/ustedes: verían

, Using the conditional indicative tense will help you talk about something that will definitely be seen if another condition happens to be true.


Example: ""She will see the cat if she walks there,"" Ella verá al gato si camina allí.

yo: veré
tú: verás
él/ella/usted: verá
nosotros/-as: veremos
vosotros/-as: veréis
ellos/ellas/ustedes: verán

Isolate the verb stem.,
Watch out for stem-changing verbs.,
Identify your subject.,
Form the conjugated verb.","How to Conjugate Spanish ""Ar"" Verbs1"," A Spanish infinitive is made up of two parts: the verb stem and the ending. For verbs with an ""ar"" ending, you simply subtract those two letters and you are left with the verb stem.For example, habl is the verb stem of the infinitive hablar, the Spanish verb meaning ""to speak."";
, There are some verbs that change their stem when they are conjugated. When you're working with -ar verbs, this includes verbs such as cerrar, meaning ""to close.""The verbs in this group all change in the same way. When conjugated, the e changes to ie. For example, you would say ""yo cierro la puerta"" or ""I close the door.""
There are another group of stem-changers in the -ar category of verbs, where the o changes to ue when you conjugate the verb. For example, when conjugating the verb contar (meaning ""to count or to tell""), you would change the stem, such as ""Yo cuento hasta diez"" (""I count to ten"").The stem doesn't change if your subject is nosotros (we) or vosotros (you all).

, The ending you add to the verb stem depends on the subject pronoun you are using. The subject pronoun identifies who is doing the action of the verb. In Spanish, subject pronouns will be either singular or plural, and either masculine or feminine.In Spanish, there are a total nine subject pronouns. The singular subject pronouns are ""yo"" (""I""), tú (informal or familiar ""you""), él (""he""), ella (""she""), and usted (formal ""you"").
The Spanish plural subject pronouns are nosotros/nosotras (masculine/feminine ""we""), vosotros/vosotras (masculine/feminine informal ""you all"" – used in Spain), ellos/ellas (masculine/feminine ""they""), and ustedes (formal ""you all"" – the only form used in Latin America).
If you are talking about a mixed-gender group, you use the masculine form. For example, if when you say ""we"" you mean a male and female couple, you would say ""nosotros.""

, Once you've found the correct verb stem and identified the subject of the sentence, all you have to do to conjugate a regular verb ending in -ar is find the correct verb ending that matches up with your subject pronoun for the tense you need to use.You'll use the same endings for all regular verbs, even if the verb stem changes. Each verb ending changes depending on the subject pronoun.
Keep in mind that in Spanish, you typically just use the conjugated verb in speech or writing, without actually saying or writing the subject pronoun. Your listener or reader will understand the subject pronoun because of the form of the verb you used.

Choose present tense for actions happening now.,
Speak in future tense about things that will happen.,
Conjugate the verb in past tense if the action has already happened.,
Learn other verb tenses for specific situations.","How to Conjugate Spanish ""Ar"" Verbs2"," The present tense typically is the first tense you'll learn if you're learning Spanish as a new language. In Spanish, the present tense also is used in several different contexts that may seem unnatural to you at first, particularly if your first language is English.For -ar verbs, the present tense endings are -o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, and -an. For the verb hablar (to speak), present tense conjugation would be ""yo hablo"" (I speak), ""tú hablas"" (you speak), ""usted/él/ella habla"" (you/he/she speaks), ""nosotros hablamos"" (we speak), ""vosotros habláis"" (you all speak – this form is used only in Spain), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas hablan"" (you all/they speak).
The regular present tense (technically referred to as the ""present indicative"") also is used in Spanish to talk about habitual actions or ongoing events, where you typically would use the present progressive tense. For example, if a friend called and asked what you were doing, and you were cleaning the kitchen, you would say in English ""I am cleaning the kitchen."" But in Spanish, you would say ""Limpio la cocina"" (literally ""I clean the kitchen"").
Present tense also is used for hypothetical situations, where in English you typically would use either the future tense or the present progressive. For example, if you were at a party and heard someone you dislike might be attending, you might say in English ""If John shows up, I will leave"" or ""If John shows up, I am leaving."" But in Spanish, you would say ""Si llega Juan, salgo"" (literally ""if Juan arrives, I leave"").

, There are two ways to to talk about something happening in the future in Spanish. The simple future tense that requires you to conjugate the verb is used when you are saying that something will happen in the future, or to indicate that something ""might"" or ""may"" happen in the future.Keep in mind that the future tense in Spanish is not a combination of two verbs, as it is in English.
The endings you add to the verb stem for future tense are the same for all three categories of Spanish verbs: -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, and -án. For the verb hablar (to speak), the future tense conjugation would be ""yo hablé"" (I will speak), ""tú hablás"" (you will speak), ""usted/él/ella hablá"" (you/he/she will speak), ""nosotros hablemos"" (we will speak), ""vosotros hobléis"" (you all will speak), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas hablán"" (you all/they will speak).

, In Spanish, the past, or preterite tense is used when an action was completed at some definite point in the past. If the action is ongoing, or has no specific ending or beginning, you wouldn't speak of it in the past tense.To conjugate -ar verbs in past tense, you add -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, or -aron to the verb stem, depending on the subject pronoun.
For example, you would conjugate the verb hablar (to speak) as ""yo hablé"" (I spoke), ""tú hablaste"" (you spoke), ""usted/él/ella habló"" (you/he/she spoke), ""nosotros hablamos"" (we spoke), ""vosotros hablasteis"" (you all spoke), or ""ustedes/ellos/ellas hablaron"" (you all/they spoke).

, Apart from the basic indicative tenses, which you probably will use most often, Spanish has perfect and conditional tenses just as English does. These tenses are used in specific contexts which may differ from the way you would use them in English.Spanish indicative tenses are much more versatile than the same tenses in English. If you're just beginning to learn Spanish, stick to the three main tenses at first. Most of the time, a Spanish speaker will understand what you're saying and what you mean if you stick to the indicative present, past, and future tenses.

Identify irregular verbs ending in -ar.,
Practice conjugating estar.,
Learn how to conjugate dar.","How to Conjugate Spanish ""Ar"" Verbs3"," Irregular verbs are those that don't use the standard, regular rules for conjugation. While fewer than 5 percent of verbs ending in -ar are irregular, many of those irregular verbs are ones you'll need to use often.Unfortunately, there's no blanket rule that you can use to conjugate irregular verbs, although you may notice patterns or commonalities among some of them.
For the most part, conjugation of irregular verbs is simply a matter of memorizing them. One way to start is by searching online for a list of irregular -ar verbs. Reading through the list a few times can give you a basic familiarity.
You also can identify irregular verbs by spending a lot of time reading Spanish-language websites or magazines, watching Spanish-language movies or television programs, or talking to native speakers.

, The verb estar (meaning ""to be"") is probably one of the first Spanish verbs you'll learn, and it also happens to be irregular. While the endings are different, the conjugated verb is formed the same as regular verbs – by adding the ending to the verb stem est.The conjugation of estar is present tense is ""yo estoy"" (I am), ""tú estás"" (you are), usted/él/ella está"" (you/he/she is), ""nosotros estamos"" (we are), ""vosotros estáis"" (you all are), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas están"" (you all/they are).

Estar is not irregular when conjugating it in future tense. You use the same endings as you do for regular -ar verbs.
The preterite or past tense conjugation of estar is ""yo estuve"" (I was), ""tú estuviste"" (you were), ""usted/él/ella estuvo"" (you/he/she was), ""nosotros estuvimos"" (we were), ""vosotros estuvisteis"" (you all were), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas estuvieron"" (you all/they were).

, The Spanish verb dar, meaning ""to give"" or ""to have,"" is another irregular verb that you probably will use quite often even as a beginning speaker of Spanish. It is conjugated in the same way as the irregular verb ir, which means ""to go.""The present tense conjugation of dar is ""yo doy"" (I give), ""tú das"" (you give), ""usted/él/ella da"" (you/he/she gives), ""nosotros damos"" (we give), ""vosotros dais"" (you all give), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas dan"" (you all/they give).

Dar is not irregular in the future tense. Make the conjugated form the same way, and using the same endings, as you would for any regular -ar verbs.

Dar is one of the few verbs that is also irregular in past or preterite tense. Conjugate ""dar"" as ""yo di"" (I gave), ""tú diste"" (you gave), ""usted/él/ella dio"" (you/he/she gave), ""nosotros dimos"" (we gave), ""vosotros disteis"" (you all gave), and ""ustedes/ellos/ellas dieron"" (you all/they gave).

You could say ""puedo ayudarte,"" or ""I can help you"" before getting the object for the child.
If someone asks you to attend an event and you think you might have a scheduling conflict, you might say ""iré si puedo,"" which means ""I'll go if I can."";
, The verb poder also is irregular for the second-person form, so you must change the verb stem to ""pued-"" after taking off the -er ending to create this form in present tense.Consider context when using this pronoun and this verb form. Don't use it to address a stranger, someone older than you, or someone in a position of authority.

You don't have to change the verb stem. ""We can"" in Spanish is ""nosotros podemos."", The pronoun vosotros is the informal second-person plural in Spanish. If you would refer to each person in a group using the pronoun tú, this is an appropriate choice to refer to the group.Vosotros is used primarily in Spain, and isn't used at all in Latin America., For the third-person plural, the verb ""poder"" also has an irregular form. After dropping the -er ending, you must change the verb stem from ""pod-"" to ""pued-.""Use the same verb form if you want to use ustedes: ""ustedes pueden."" This is the primary second-person plural pronoun in Latin America and the formal second-person plural pronoun in Spain., There are many common phrases, particularly using the first-person singular form, that you probably will get significant use out of as you talk to other people in Spanish.You can start with ""yo puedo,"" which means ""I can."" Similarly, you can say ""no puedo"" if you can't do something that someone has asked you to do.
One of the first phrases you might learn in Spanish, either in a class or from a phrasebook, is ""Puedo ir al baño?"" This question means ""Can I go to the bathroom?"" In Spanish, the verb poder also is used when you are asking permission to do something.
Another common phrase using the verb poder is ""no lo puedo creer,"" which means ""I can't believe it.""

Switch to the preterite tense for actions occurring entirely in the past.",How to Conjugate Puedo2," Since poder isn't irregular in this tense, all you have to do is drop the ""-er"" from the verb stem ""pod-."" Then add the ending that matches your subject pronoun.Yo podía (I could)
Tú podía (you could)
Él/ella/usted podía (he/she/you could)
Nosotros podíamos (we could)
Vosotros podíais (you all could)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes podían (they/you all could)

, The verb poder is irregular in the preterite tense. The verb stem for conjugated forms is ""pud-,"" not ""pod-."" The appropriate endings also vary from those you may have learned for regular -er verbs.Yo pude (I could)
Tú pudiste (you could)
Él/ella/usted pudo (he/she/you could)
Nosotros pudimos (we could)
Vosotros pudisteis (you all could)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pudieron (they/you all could)

, In Spanish, there are two different verb tenses used for actions that occurred in the past. In most contexts, you want to use the imperfect tense, which also may be referred to simply as ""past tense.""This tense is used when an action happened over a more general period of time, happened intermittently, or don't have a definite end date.
You also want to use this tense when talking about someone's characteristics or personal traits, or when talking about a mental or physical state in the past.
The verb poder is regular in the imperfect tense, and roughly translated as ""could"" or ""used to be able"" in English., The preterite tense in Spanish should only be used when you are talking about an action that had a definite beginning and a definite end.The verb poder is irregular in the preterite tense. Although the translation in English is the same, it will be understood slightly differently in Spanish than if you used the imperfect tense.
If you're talking about something that only happened for a specific period of time in the past, or on a specific date, you usually should use the preterite tense.
The verb poder is regular in the imperfect tense, but irregular in the preterite tense. In both tenses, you translate the verb as ""could"" in English."
"
Say ""yo podré"" to mean ""I will be able."",
Use ""tú podrás"" to say ""you will be able."",
Choose ""él podrá"" or ""ella podrá"" to say ""he/she/it will be able."",
Say ""nosotros podremos"" to mean ""we will be able."",
Add the ending -réis for second-person plural.,
Choose ""ellos podrán"" or ""ellas podrán"" to say ""they will be able.""",How to Conjugate Puedo3," While the ""pod-"" verb stem seems to indicate regular conjugation for the verb poder in future tense, the ending differs from the regular conjugation of -er verbs.If you're familiar with the conjugation of regular -er verbs, you know that the first-person singular ending is -eré. With all future forms of poder, though, you don't want to add that first ""e.""

, Particularly when in Spain, conjugate poder this way to use the informal second-person pronoun tú., If you are talking about a third person or an object being able in the future, use this conjugation with the appropriate pronoun. Remember objects have gender in Spanish.Use the same form for the first-person singular pronoun usted., To form the first-person plural form of the verb poder in future tense, drop the -er from the verb stem ""pod-"" and add the ending ""-remos."", Particularly in Spain, you might use the pronoun ""vosotros"" to talk to a group of people informally. Only use this form if you would address every person in the group individually as ""tú.""""Vosotros podréis"" can be roughly translated as ""you will be able"" or ""you will have the power"" in English.

, When talking about something a group will be able to do in the future, this conjugation is appropriate. Use ""ellos"" for a mixed-gender group.Use the same conjugation for the second-person plural pronoun ustedes."

Develop (first) a sound command of Turkish and Russian.,
Learn the Cyrillic alphabet.,
Listen to Kazakh.,
Forget the rules of English.,
Have fun learning Kazakh.,
Think Kazakh.,
Travel to Kazakhstan and Central Asia.",How to Learn Kazakh," Language materials in English on Kazakh are few and far between, but are abundant in Turkish and Russian. One of the only Kazakh book/CD sets available in English is Colloquial Kazakh by Zaure Batayeva; it equips learners with the essential skills needed to communicate effectively in Kazakh in a broad range of situations and provides a rich set of cultural notes. However:


Turkish is the most widely spoken and published on Turkic language and shares most of its grammar and base vocabulary with Kazakh. Establishing a working knowledge of Turkish will ease your transition into Kazakh, both in the sense of linguistic elements and better access to materials. It will also open you to the many bookshops across Turkey that carry a sizable array of books and resources on Turkic languages.
Russian is the co-official language of Kazakhstan and is the inter-ethnic language of communication, education, and business throughout both Kazakhstan and the entire former Soviet Union where most Kazakh and other Turkic speakers live. Also, many Kazakh are more comfortable communicating in Russian in certain contexts (i.e. science, technology, news, etc.) and Kazakh in others (culture, music, daily life, etc.).;
, Kazakh is largely written in modified form of the Cyrillic alphabet. At present, there are almost no write resources that transcribe Kazakh into the Latin alphabet for foreign learners. Grasping a solid command of the Cyrillic alphabet will be of big help to you both in decoding Kazakh as well as surviving Kazakhstan if you travel there.


The above applies primarily to Kazakhstan and Mongolia. Kazakhstan has also proposed a Latin-based writing system to draw the written language closer to its broader-spoken Turkic cousins Turkish, Azeri, and Uzbek.
The more than one million Kazakh-speakers in China use an Arabic-derived alphabet similar to that used to write Uyghur.
If you are able to get hold of Kazakh reading materials, practice your reading skills. This will improve your reading fluency and speed as well as develop your language skills. A great place to start is the online newspaper .

, YouTube and the internet have an abundance of Kazakh language media, music, and films available to the world at large. You need to develop an ear for the language in order to cognitively distinguish decode Kazakh's complex morphological and grammatical system to get meaningful information out of what you're hearing.

, Kazakh, like other Turkic languages has an extremely complex system of grammar and word formation:


Kazakh has Subject Object Verb (SOV) sentence structure: Mary market-to went (Mary went to the market); John Frank-from old book bought. (John bought an old book from Frank).
Kazakh observes agglutination: It strings suffixes together to form long words rich in meaning and syntax.
Kazakh observes vowel harmony: A system whereby vowels have to agree with one other based on complex sound/phonology rules.

, Kazakh is a challenging language to acquire, but worth the effort. Don't stress yourself over speaking perfectly or mastering intricate verb conjugation etc. as it will come naturally with listening, practice, and time. Keep your ears open and don't be afraid speak up.

, You have to think Kazakh in order to speak Kazakh. This may be quite challenging if you don't live or have the opportunity to travel to Central Asia, however, you can start by reading as much as you can about the Kazakhs, learn how to cook Kazakh food etc. to give you a better sense of the people and their way of life.

, The Kazakh diaspora is rather limited outside Asia, so the best way to experience and practice the language and culture is to live it where it's spoken. Don't be intimidated at first if all you hear is Russian, especially in major cities---this is a legacy of the Soviet Union. However, the more rural you travel, the more and purer Kazakh you will observe. The Kazakhs are a very proud people with a very rich cultural and oral story telling tradition.


Be careful to observe all government policies and practices. Most Central Asian countries are still communist and are often economically quite poor. Try not to step out of line, try not to stand out, and be sure to keep yourself safe and well informed at all times.
Rural Kazakh families are mostly nomadic. They move from location to location with the seasons and live a very agrarian life. If you chose to live with a nomadic family, help out. You can learn best by helping herd their sheep and yaks, cook, milk, and participate as a member of their families. You will be greatly rewarded with invaluable experience, insight, and knowledge. Be sure also to bring small (but practical) gifts to your host family, a very Turkic practice.

Say ""yo pongo"" to mean ""I put."",
Use regular conjugation rules in present tense.,
Add a ""g"" to the verb stem to talk about possibilities.,
Use the imperative form to tell someone to put or not to put.",How to Conjugate Poner1," For the first-person present tense form of the verb poner, you drop the -er ending and add a ""g"" to the end of the verb stem. This is the only present tense form of poner that is irregular., For all pronouns other than the first person, poner follows the same conjugation pattern as regular verbs ending in -er. Do not add a ""g"" to the verb stem like you did with first person.Tú pones (you put)
Él/ella/usted pone (he/she/you put). Remember that objects have a gender in Spanish.
Nosotros/as ponemos (we put)
Vosotros/as ponéis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes ponen (they/you all put)

, When you're talking about wishes, desires, guesses, or similarly uncertain things, you use the subjunctive tense in Spanish. Conjugate poner following the same pattern you used for the irregular first-person present tense form.Yo ponga (I put)
Tú pongas (you put)
Él/ella/usted ponga (he/she/you put)
Nosotros/as pongamos (we put)
Vosotros/as pongáis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pongan (they/you all put)

, Sometimes you need to order or command someone to do something, and this is what the imperative mood is for. Remember to reverse the verb and pronoun, if you include the pronoun in an imperative sentence. Poner is highly irregular in the imperative mood.Pon tú/no pongas tú (you put/don't put)
Ponga usted/no ponga usted (you put/don't put)
Pongamos nosotros/no pongamos nosotros (we put/don't put)
Poned vosotros/no pongáis vosotros (you all put/don't put)
Pongan ustedes/no pongan ustedes (you all put/don't put)

"
"
Choose the correct tense.,
Use regular conjugation rules for imperfect tense.,
Change the verb stem for preterite tense.",How to Conjugate Poner2," In Spanish, there are two different tenses used for talking about actions that occurred in the past. Use imperfect tense if you're talking about something you used to do (continually or habitually). You need the preterite tense if you're talking about something that is done, meaning the action occurred entirely in the past.Poner is regular in the imperfect tense, but irregular in the preterite tense.

, If you want to talk about the continual past action of putting something somewhere, you would use the imperfect tense. Drop the -er ending and add the same ending to the verb stem (pon-) as you would for regular -er verbs.Yo ponía (I used to put)
Tú ponías (you used to put)
Él/ella/usted ponía (he/she/you used to put)
Nosotros/as poníamos (we used to put)
Vosotros/as poníais (you all used to put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes ponían (they/you all used to put)

, If you're talking about an action that began and ended in the past, you want to use the preterite tense. The verb ""poner"" is highly irregular in the preterite sense.Yo puse (I put)
Tú pusiste (you put)
Él/ella/usted puso (he/she/you put)
Nosotros/as pusimos (we put)
Vosotros/as pusisteis (you all put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pusieron (they/you all put)

"
"
Change the verb stem.,
Add regular endings for future tense.,
Use regular endings for conditional tense.",How to Conjugate Poner3," Poner is irregular in the future tense, even though it still has all the same endings as regular -er verbs. The irregularity lies in the fact that you have to change the verb stem from ""pon-"" to ""pondr-."", In Spanish, the future tense doesn't get a helper verb as it does in English. Once you've changed the verb stem for the irregular verb ""poner,"" you simply use the same endings as you would for regular -er verbs.Yo pondré (I will put)
Tú pondrás (you will put)
Él/ella/usted pondrá (he/she/you will put)
Nosotros/as pondremos (we will put)
Vosotros/as pondréis (you all will put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pondrán (they/you all will put)

, Unlike English, Spanish doesn't use a helper verb for the conditional tense either. Use the conditional tense when you want to say that you (or someone else) would put something somewhere.Yo pondría (I would put)
Tú pondrías (you would put)
Él/ella/usted pondría (he/she/you would put)
Nosotros/as pondríamos (we would put)
Vosotros/as pondríais (you all would put)
Ellos/ellas/ustedes pondrían (they/you all would put)

Small steps are easier to work through. For example, if learning 40 new words each month seems intimidating, tell yourself to learn 10 new words each week. The smaller goal might be easier to work toward.
Change your goals if you need to. If your current goals are too stressful and difficult to meet, you'll become discouraged and may quit your studies as a result. On the other hand, if your current goals do not challenge you enough, you may become bored and quit your studies because of that.;
, Practice your verbal (listening/speaking) and written (reading/writing) skills each day. Schedule your practices for one specific time each day, and commit to studying during that time.


Tell your teacher, classmates, friends, or relatives about your schedule and ask them to check on your progress. You might feel more motivated to stick to your schedule if you're worried about the consequences of straying from it.

, Take an actual English class or find a small group of other English students to practice with. Studying the language with other people will allow you to learn from each other.


Formal English classes work well because they are led by professional teachers. Trust your English instructor. Don't be afraid to make mistakes or ask questions; correcting you and answering those questions is part of your instructor's job.
When learning English informally, try to work in small groups instead of large groups. Smaller crowds may make you feel more comfortable and less embarrassed.

, Don't be afraid of making mistakes when you practice your English. If you stop yourself from practicing because you feel insecure about your current skill level, you won't be able to improve.


When you don't feel confident, review the progress you've already made with your English studies. By realizing how much you've already accomplished, you might feel encouraged to continue improving yourself.

, Learning English can be its own reward, but if you have difficulty motivating yourself, find other ways to reward yourself for reaching your short-term language learning goals.


The reward can be related to your English studies, but it doesn't have to be. For example, you might reward yourself after reaching a major goal by visiting an international festival or other event that attracts English speakers. You might reward yourself after reaching a small goal by buying your favorite snack or visiting your favorite restaurant, though.

, At the beginning of your studies, learn enough basic grammar to express and understand meaning. Focus on learning more advanced grammar after you learn how to speak English conversationally.


Don't worry about memorizing the rules of grammar and using each rule in every conversation or piece of writing. If you try to apply every rule of grammar, your English might seem too stiff and unnatural. Thinking about proper grammar as you try to communicate will also prevent you from conveying your thoughts quickly., Be patient. Learning English easily does not mean that you will learn the language quickly. Take as much time as you need to understand the language instead of trying to speed through the learning process.


Practice consistently. If you do not study or review past lessons on a regular basis, you might forget about the information you learned. Regular practice is the only way to remember English on a long-term basis.
Don't be discouraged about how long the process takes. No one can fluently speak or write English after only studying for a few months, and you will probably need to study for at least one or two years before you can hold conversations in English. It will probably take an even longer amount of time before your English sounds natural and fluent., Find a few favorite English songs and continuing listening to those songs until you understand the meaning of each one.


If you don't know where to find English music, look for an English radio station that streams online. Check YouTube and other video websites for English music videos. Learn who some of the most popular English musicians within your favorite genre (pop music, rock music, etc.) and find several of their songs.

, Watch the characters' actions to help yourself understand the context behind the English they speak. You can also turn on subtitles in your native language to help yourself follow along, but turn them off if the subtitles prevent you from focusing on the English words you're listening to.


Listen to English podcasts, especially podcasts designed to help people learning English as a foreign or second language.
Watch the ""Top Videos"" on YouTube or other video hosting websites with English content.
Visit websites that legally host free episodes of English shows and watch a few. Try to understand who the characters are and what the show is about.

, Practice speaking English when you're alone. Consider recording yourself when you speak English, then listen to that recording later.


You can also practice singing aloud in English or reading short paragraphs of text written in English.
Speaking in English more often can help you improve your pronunciation. Recording your spoken practices can help you identify areas you need to improve.
Record someone who speaks English well as that person reads the same text. Listen to his or her recording, then listen to your own recording and compare your pronunciation., Travel someplace where native English speakers gather. Listen to them speak English and try to understand their conversations.


Visiting a country where people speak English will give you more opportunity to listen to English conversation, but if this isn't an option you can consider, try visiting somewhere in your own country where English tourists gather.
Be polite. Don't stare or make the people you're listening to feel uncomfortable, and try not to listen to every detail. Focus on identifying the general topic of each conversation and pick out several unknown words to look up later.

, Find excuses to talk with others who speak English. This includes native English speakers and others who are still studying the language.


Look for unexpected opportunities to speak English. For example, if you meet an English-speaking tourist who is lost, try to give that person directions in English.
If possible, find several friends who only speak English and do not speak your native language. You will be forced to speak English if you want to talk with these friends.
Become friends with others learning the language, too. These individuals might be able to sympathize with you, and you can encourage each other through the learning process.

, Read short stories and books that are written in English. Choose these stories based on personal interest and your current skill level.When you first start, try reading children's storybooks or materials specifically made for new English learners. These texts will use simpler English and should be easy enough to understand.
Choose written materials that interest you. It will be easier to learn if you enjoy the experience.
After reading the text, try to summarize what happened using your own words. Identify who the characters were, what happened, why it happened, where the story took place, and when it took place.

, Visit websites written in English and navigate through the website without translating it into your native language. Join online forums and other Internet groups that will allow you to write in English to other people, too.


Find friends who speak English through social media websites (Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, etc.). Visit your English friends' pages each day and try to interact based on what you read there.
Join online forums and message boards. Choose topics that interest you and read some of the English conversations for two or three weeks. Eventually, you can start responding to discussions or starting your own discussions.

, Check advertisements, newspapers, and other written materials for English words. Try to understand what each piece of text means and check an English translation dictionary to learn any words you do not recognize.


If the text is pictured next to an image, use that image to help you identify the context of those English words. Look for any words written in your native language that may help provide context, too.

, Find a short piece of text written in your native language and translate it into English. Try to translate most of the text without using an English translation dictionary, then use your dictionary to help with the rest.


Show the translated version to someone who reads English fluently and ask him or her to review it. If you translated it accurately, that person should be able to accurately summarize the meaning of that text in your native language. If the original meaning was lost, try to figure out where your translation went wrong and improve it.

, Write about everyday thoughts and events in a personal journal or diary. Write as much as you can without looking up the words in an English translation dictionary, but use that dictionary when do not know the correct English word for an idea you want to express.


Start your journal by writing one sentence each day. This sentence can talk about how you feel, what you did, or what the weather was like.
As you feel more comfortable with English, you can start writing longer journal entries that use more sentences.

Before you do anything, make sure that you are truly interested in learning this language.,
Commit yourself to your goal.,
Do not miss one letter.,
Stick to one pronunciation of vowels.,
Learn the simplest things first.,
Surround yourself with the language.,
Sign up for a class if you can.,
Get yourself a dictionary.,
Create flash cards.,
Listen to the language.",How to Learn Indonesian," Since there aren't many Indonesians abroad, the language isn't going to be all that useful if you never plan on visiting the country. But it'll come in handy if you plan to visit neighboring countries such as Malaysia, Brunei, Timor-Leste. For those who speak Portuguese, Timor -Leste would be a perfect destination since Portuguese is also an official language.;
, Every language takes a while to learn, whether it's a common or an obscure one. It's a lot like bodybuilding; you need to do it on a regular basis and stick with it. Just because you might not take a class does not mean that you can skip a day or two. Remember that it's a long-term goal instead of a spontaneous decision. A lot of people tend to stop learning a language after a few months or weeks, so try to stay motivated throughout the tough or confusing parts.

, Like Latin and Portuguese, Indonesian language is pronounced the way it is spelled. Every syllable mostly consist of no more than a vowel and one or two consonant(s). The exception to the one vowel rule is diphthong.

, Unlike the English language where vowels are pronounced in different ways, Indonesians have fewer ways of pronouncing them. ""A"" in Indonesian is spoken like ""a"" in ""father"". ""E"" is spoken like ""e"" in ""check"", ""I"" in Indonesian is spoken like ""ee"" in ""see"". ""O"" is spoken like the typical ""o"" as in ""olive"". ""U"" can be pronounced both long and short as of that in ""put"" and ""boot"". The only difference between English and Indonesian pronunciations is ""C"" which is pronounced as ""ch"". e.g. Indonesian word ""cinta"" should be pronounced as ""chin-ta""

, This is the easiest and most fun part, because after you learn the ""tourist basics"", you'll feel much more confident in your knowledge and understanding.
Here's a few basic words and phrases in Indonesian:


Terima kasih (teh-ree-muh kah-see)- Thank you

Maaf (mah-ahf)- Sorry

Apa kabar? (ah-pah kah-bar)- How are you?

Permisi (per-mee-see)- Excuse me

Saya/Aku (sah-yah/ah-koo)- I (formal/informal)

Anda/Kamu (ahn-da/ka-moo )- You (formal/informal)

Saya mau makan (sah-yah ma-oo ma-kahn) I want to eat


, This is going to help you a lot later on, especially on the days when you aren't motivated. There's a lot of things that you can do to make sure that you have the language around you in a fun and convenient way. Sign up for an RSS feed or newsletter of ""Indonesian Word of the Day"", start watching an Indonesian show/movie with subtitles, discover Indonesian music, listen to Indonesian podcasts, etc.

, If you don't live in Oceania or East/Southeast Asia, it probably won't be easy to find classes. However, you can usually get a tutor or join a language club. You'll find it much easier to stick to your goal once you get yourself into a regular schedule and interact with others who are trying to do the same as you.

, Try to look for an English-Indonesian dictionary in your local library or bookstores and ask if there are any other books that will help. The dictionary will be very useful to learn and to flip through when you encounter an unfamiliar word. Online translators are infamous for their incorrect translations, but you can use those once in a while as well.

, This is usually the part that most people hate, but it doesn't have to be. Copy down useful words that you want to remember. Use highlighters, markers, and even stickers to make them fun and interesting. Since it uses 26 Latin alphabet with no variations, you'd find no difficulty in writing or typing Indonesian language.

, Like all languages, Indonesian has a unique sound and rhythm that you will need to become familiar with. Spoken Indonesian can be quite fast and different from formal Indonesian that you might learn from a textbook, so it is best to begin training your ear to understand it early on in the process.

Connect with a native speaker.,
Study the language every day.,
Carry a dictionary at all times.,
Watch, listen, read and write in your chosen language.,
Visit a country where your chosen language is spoken.",How to Learn a New Language Fast1," Hands down, the best way to learn a new language is to speak it. Too often, people spend all of their time studying grammar and memorizing lists of words instead of actually going out there and putting what they've learned into practice. Speaking with a real, live person will help you to feel much more motivated about learning the language than staring at a book or computer screen.


Try to find a friend or colleague who speaks the language you wish to learn and who'd be willing to sit down with you and help you practice. Alternatively, you could try putting ads in local online forums or newspapers to find someone to tutor you or participate in a language exchange.
If you can't find anyone who speaks your language nearby, try to connect with someone on Skype. People in foreign countries are often willing to exchange half an hour of speaking in their native tongue for half an hour of speaking in English. A Hellotalk account is another option.;
, People often claim to have studied a language ""for five years"" and still not be fluent. But when they say five years, they probably mean that they studied the language for only a couple of hours a week over that entire time period. Let's get one thing clear -- if you want to learn a new language quickly -- that is, in the space of a few weeks or months -- you're going to have to commit to studying the language for a couple of hours per day.


Language learning is based on repetition -- hammering something into your brain over and over again until you remember it. If you break too long between study sessions, you are much more prone to forget what you learned last time and you will waste valuable study time going back over what you've already learned.
You can cut down on this wasted time by studying every day. There are no miraculous short cuts when it comes to language learning -- you just need to commit.

, Carrying a dictionary with you will save you a lot of time and frustration, so invest in one as soon as possible!


It can be an actual, physical dictionary, or a dictionary app on your phone -- you just need to be able to consult it quickly whenever you need a word.
Carrying a dictionary will allow you to find the necessary word at a moments notice. This is especially important when you are having a conversation with a native speaker and don't wish to disrupt the flow of conversation by not being able to remember a word. In addition, looking up the word and using it immediately in a sentence will help you to commit the word to memory.
You can also peruse the dictionary at random moments throughout the day -- when you're waiting in line at the grocery store, when you're on a coffee break at work, or sitting in traffic. You could learn an extra 20 or 30 words a day this way!

, Immersing yourself in a language means doing all of the activities you would normally do in your native tongue, through your new language -- whether that's reading, writing or listening.


Possibly the easiest thing you can do is watch television shows or movies in the language you are trying to learn. Try to avoid subtitles, as you will tend to rely on them. To make things easier, try to watch shows or movies whose plots you are already familiar with -- like kids' cartoons or dubbed versions of English movies -- knowing the context will help you to decipher the meanings of words and phrases.
You should also attempt to read and write in your new language. Get a newspaper or magazine and attempt to read one article a day -- looking up any words you don't understand in your dictionary. You should also try to write a few simple things in your new language --whether it's a pretend postcard or a shopping list.
Download podcasts or tune in to radio stations in your new language. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language while you're on the go. Not only does this help with your listening comprehension, it also allows you to hear the correct pronunciation of common words and phrases.
Change your language settings on all your electronic devices so that you can pick up words you know already in English but not in the new language.
Listen to songs in that language. Try to learn the lyrics, then check what they mean. That way, if you hear it again, you can tell what the conversation is about at that point.

, Obviously, it would be a great boost to your language learning skills if you could visit and spend some time in a country where your new language is spoken.


Force yourself to interact with the locals -- whether you're asking for directions, completing a transaction in a store, or simply saying hello -- and you will gain a new appreciation of the language and its speakers.
It doesn't matter how basic your oral skills are, keep pushing yourself to speak and you will soon notice a vast improvement in your vocabulary, grammar and pronunciation.

Learn a few greeting words in the language before you learn the alphabet.,
Learn the alphabet of the language you are learning, if necessary.,
Learn vocabulary.,
Learn to count in the new language.,
Don't worry too much about grammar.,
Work on pronunciation.,
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.",How to Learn a New Language Fast2," This way when you do learn the languages alphabet you will already know some pretty basic words. For example: Hello, Goodbye, How are you?, I am good, What is your name?, My name is____, and so on.

, It will make it significantly easier for you and you will be able to read and pronounce words, which will help you memorize them with greater ease. Plus, it is better for you to be sounding the words out rather than looking at the romanization for the words.

, Mastering basic vocabulary is probably one of the most important things you can do when learning a new language. Even if you can't understand whole sentences, the ability to pick out keywords can help you to understand the general meaning of a speech or text.


Focus on 100 most common words. Picking out the most common 100 words in a given language is a clever way to start. From there, you can work your way up to the most common 1000 words. It is estimated that learning the 1000 most common words in a language will allow you to understand 70% of any text.
Focus on the vocabulary that is most relevant to you -- learn business vocabulary if you're learning a language for business, don't waste time learning the words for different species of fish (which you might want to do if you're traveling to go scuba diving!)
You should also learn words and vocabulary that pertain specifically to you, so you're able to talk about your life and your background to people you meet.

, Start off by learning to count to ten, because it is usually the easiest thing to memorize at first. Each day learn a new set of ten numbers, keep going each day until you are satisfied with how high you can count. If you are up for a challenge, memorize all the numbers up to one hundred in one day.

, The reason why most people can't remember most of the language they spent years learning in school is that school curricula tend to focus a huge amount of time on learning grammar and very little time on speech. This is pretty much backwards -- if you want to learn a language quickly, you should learn how to converse first. The specifics of grammar will come later.


Of course, there's no denying that grammar is important -- you need to learn how to conjugate basic everyday verbs and have some idea of the correct word order in a sentence.
The point is that you shouldn't spend hours and hours learning verb tables by heart, or worrying about the specific circumstances in which a certain preposition can be used. You'll learn these things as you go along!

, Pronunciation is another place where you should focus your energies. There's no point in memorizing hundreds of words and phrases if you pronounce them so oddly that they can't be understood. Therefore, it's important that when you learn a word, you learn the pronunciation simultaneously.


Pronunciation can be difficult to learn from a book -- so this is where chatting with native speakers (or using interactive software programs and applications) comes in handy. You need to actually say the word out loud in order to learn how to pronounce it correctly.
If you're practicing with an actual person, make sure that they're not too timid to correct you when you pronounce a word incorrectly, otherwise you may never fully get the hang of it. Remember -- pronunciation can be the difference between speaking a language well and speaking a language fluently.

, When you're learning a new language you can't be afraid to make mistakes, otherwise you won't get very far.


You're bound to get yourself in a few embarrassing situations, but what's the big deal? The native speakers might have a good chuckle, but they'll still appreciate the effort you're making and be willing to help you out.
You are not aiming for perfection here, you are aiming for progress. Making mistakes (and learning from them) will help you to progress.

Write out all of the symbols in order.,
Group relevant symbols together.,
Keep these in plain sight for as often as possible.,
Put them into context, by writing them out.,
Practice and memorize.",How to Learn IPA Symbols Easily," If you create a list of all the symbols in their chronological sound order, or in the order which you feel you have learnt them in, then you will be able to see all of the information that you need to learn at once and can keep this as a reference material which can be kept in one place.


Write beside each symbol an example of a word which would use it - this can be in your first language or a secondary (whichever you feel most comfortable with).
Also write beside each symbol a clear explanation which will work with the example you have written to ensure you can understand quickly and readily what each IPA symbol means and how it can be used successfully.;
, Once you have your list of sample symbols, you can then begin to transfer this to experimental exercises which will reveal how you think about the process of learning languages, enabling you to begin memorising them more efficiently.


Group together the symbols you think are relevant - such as open and closed vowel sounds, which should all go in to the same category.
You could also group specific sounds under language subtitles - e.g. how does the German umlaut sound on particular vowels?

, Learning subconsciously is perhaps one of the greatest assets we as humans possess. Because if you use these exercises as posters for example, they will constantly be a part of your surroundings and you will be able to pay attention to this with easy access, hence it will not feel too much like revision.


Make it suitable to your learning style - if you are a visual learner, colour code things and if you need to hear something, perhaps you could put together playlists that have a really specific example of a certain IPA symbol in the songs.

,


For example, get a poem in your first language and write out the IPA beneath the lines. Then speak it through to check if you are correct.
Push yourself even further by attempting to apply IPA mentally when listening to music or to a movie. Compare how sounds of a certain symbol differ to others and remember the contrast for future use.
Apply the skill to other languages also - it is an incredibly useful skill which can unlock many doors in the modern foreign languages, and provide a lot of foundation work on which to begin speaking one.
Keep up these exercises and attempt to further use IPA from memory when doing so. The listening exercises mean you will not have your paper reference to help you, so this can be an advantage.

, Depending on how you learn, there are many methods to begin memorising the IPA symbols (such as the posters or listening exercises mentioned earlier) but sometimes you will need to revert to the old, applicable and easy methods, such as copying out the symbols over and over in order to remember their meanings.


If you keep up some sort of repetitive behaviour (like writing things out) make sure you have short regular test exercises from memory so that you can track your progress and see where your weaker areas are.
Focus on your weaker areas - if you already know the symbol for an open E sound (a backwards 3) then there is no sense in writing this out over and over. Instead focus on an area you know you have been struggling with, such as double consonants.

Decide which language you wish to learn and then which dialect.,
Purchase your learning materials.,
Listen to the language you wish to learn.,
Write in the language.,
Read in the language.",How to Learn a Language with Immersion and Formal Study," Usually languages spoken over several countries will have distinct dialects with differing accents and vernacular. For example:  English has three main dialects, North American, European and Australian. While the grammar and vocabulary of each dialect will generally be interchangeable the pronunciation and slang will not.;
, For the formal learning aspect pick several different books to study from. Different authors have different ideas of what is important in a language and you may understand the explanations in one book better than those in another. Buy books that focus more on vocabulary than grammar. While you will need to see the rules most of your grammar learning will come from the immersion part of your studies. If you are an auditory learner or spend a lot of time in the car you may want to look into audio programs, or programs with an audio component. Take notes during the lesson and when you're done write a page or two of what you've learned as if you are teaching it to another. Write the new vocabulary words with their definitions ten times each. Make flash cards of the words as well.

, This process will help familiarize you with the sounds of the language and makes learning grammar much easier as you will become familiar with the structure of sentences in your language of choice. You should be able to find several options for television and radio programs via internet search.


Begin by simply listening in your spare time, such as while driving or cleaning the house. You don't have to actively pay attention to the program but make it loud enough to be able to clearly hear what's being said. News programs are best for early stages; it's easy to determine what country the program originates in and anchors tend to speak slower and more clearly with good pronunciation and without heavy accents or use of slang. Plan to use this as ""background noise"" the entire time you are learning the language, starting at the very beginning.
When you begin to understand phrases and words set aside a quarter hour or so to be still and pay attention to the program. Really listen to what is being said and take notes of phrases or words that you notice but don't understand to look up later. Gradually increase this active learning time to about an hour every other day while still listening casually in your spare time.
When you understand the majority of what is being said on the news programs switch to movies and soap operas, or other entertainment shows. This is where you'll learn to speak ""like a native"" and begin to pick up common expressions.

, While you are learning vocabulary begin learning the alphabet, if there is one. This is a first step to reading in the language.


In addition to journaling your lessons practice writing in the language's alphabet. Every day write your vocabulary list with the other alphabet and write short passages in English using the foreign letters. This will help you to associate the letters with the sounds that they make.
Begin making short journal entries in the new language. Use the dictionary to help you write a paragraph about what you've done that day.
When the journal assignment becomes easy begin writing short stories and poems in the language using its alphabet. This helps you to learn to think in the language and makes speaking it more fluid.

, If your language of choice has its own alphabet wait until you're familiar with its writing system before beginning this step.


Start off small; if you have access to children's books use them, otherwise get a subscription to a newspaper or magazine in the new language and use your dictionary to read short passages. News and magazine stories tend to be short and concise with simple language so they are an ideal starting place.
When you can read this with relative ease move up to short novels that you've already read in your own language. Books written for young adults are a good option but anything that isn't too long should suffice.
As you grow accustomed to reading in the language you can move on to longer books that you haven't read. At this point you should be about finished with the language learning books and can take your vocabulary from what you're reading. As you go note words that are unfamiliar, look them up and make them into flashcards. Reading in a language helps by reinforcing vocabulary and grammar and teaching you to think in the new language which will help fluency in speaking.

,,, Start with the first letter, ա, which is pronounced ""ah"" and continue from there.

, If you speak fluent English, it may be easier to start with letters that look like English letters. These include:


Օ, which is an O in both lowercase and uppercase and pronounced, ""oh"", exactly like English.
լ, which resembles an L and is pronounced, ""luh"".
ս, which resembles a U but is pronounced differently- it is pronounced ""suh"".
Lowercase հ, which resembles a lowercase h and is pronounced ""huh"".
Uppercase Տ, which resembles an S but is pronounced ""thuh"".

, These books are often used by children beginning to learn the alphabet. They begin with the most commonly used letters and have you read sentences, phrases and words containing those letters. The book will progress in difficulty until having you read a full page with all the Armenian letters.

Pick a language.,
Use Google.,
Reading/Writing.,
Pronunciation is key.,
Improve your Vocab.,
Learn Word structure.,
Learn by sentence, not by word.",How to Learn a Language With the Internet," It's best to pick a language that you're going to be using. i.e. Don't learn Korean, just because. Don't learn French, just so you can say a few things to your girlfriend, and have her think you're a romantic. Learn a language that's going to be useful to you. You want to pick one that's going to be helpful to you, even if you simply like to listen to music in that language, and you want to know what they're saying without subtitles.;
, Just search on Google, ""How to speak ****"" or something similar. Google can lead you to a lot of good websites to help you learn languages.

, Reading and writing is fundamental. If you can read in a language, then you can learn to speak it ten times faster. Most languages have syllabaries, meaning that each character is phonetic. Learning those symbols will make it much easier to learn a language, as you'll be able to read and write in the language, and communicate with others, even when there is no one near you that speaks that language. Some languages have a hybrid writing system. Japanese is one example. In Japanese, there are two syllabaries (Katakana, and Hiragana), and ideographs (Kanji). The Kanji have multiple readings, therefore it would be smart to learn them later. This is an example to show you that you have to do research on the writing before you learn it.

, If you can't properly pronounce words, then no one will be able to understand you, and you might not understand others, as you will think things are pronounced differently than they actually are, and get confused.

, Vocab is important. Learn lots of grammar.

, Word structure is very important. You should know how to make your own sentences, how to conjugate verbs, and how to express your own ideas, in your own words. Don't simply look up how to say a sentence. Look up all the different ways to say all other different words in the sentence, then create the sentence yourself.

, This is a method of learning. You learn a sentence, like ""I am happy today"". Then you learn different words that you can change to change the meaning. Instead of learning a lot of similar sentences(i.e. ""I'm happy"" ""I'm sad"" ""You're happy"" ""You're angry"" etc.), you learn one sentence, and then the separate words, that way you can change up the sentence yourself and make all of those sentences, and more. You can learn, ""I'm happy"", then learn the words for Angry, sad, you, and not, then you can make a ton of different sentences. This method is much simpler, and much faster than learning separate sentences.

Have a basic concept of how the words are pronounced.,
Read the language aloud , and repeat what you hear on TV, tapes, etc.,
Memorize sentences and paragraphs or more, to get a 'feel' for the grammar, word ordering, etc.,
Carry around a 3x5 (or 4x6) index card, and write down words that you wanted to say throughout the day, but didn't know how to.,
Practice translating paragraphs from a book into the language you're learning.,
Find a good grammar summary of the language.,
Practice your accent.,
Practice speaking.",How to Learn a Language Fluently when You Live in a New Country," Listen to the radio, watch TV, or get them from a friend, native speaker, etc.;
, aloud. This is probably the most important first step, because it gets you used to the sound of the language.

, of the language. (And recite them to yourself.) By memorizing sentences, paragraphs, passages, etc., you will automatically be learning words in the process, and will be getting the context that gives them easy, intuitive meaning. As well as sentence structure, the sound of the words, etc. And you can choose from these words when creating your own sentences.


To make memorizing paragraphs and understanding easier, it helps to use a translation of a book that you already know. The bible or other religious book (even if you're not religious) is a great way to study and learn a language, because it's so easy to find translations of it in just about any language, the meaning is always the same, etc.
For help in memorizing paragraphs or sentences, it helps to say them quickly. It can almost become 'automatic' when you do that.

, Look these up when you get home, and write them on the card. Practice using them a few times in large, coherent sentences.

, This is a great way to stretch your knowledge and 'expression' within the language. It's OK to look up some words (or phrases) while doing this. The point is to learn new ways of expressing yourself, new words, to become more precise in your expression, etc. And translating the words of a well-spoken writer is a great way to do that.

, I.e. one that fits on 5-6 pages. It's much easier to learn one rule, with its exceptions, and apply it to everything, than it is to learn 2,000 different words independently. A good grammar summary will make those rules evident in a few words.

, Most native speakers regard it as a high compliment when you go through the effort of learning their language appropriately. And it's always fun to see if they will think you are a native speaker or not. Having a good accent will make it much easier for them to understand you. And to have a good accent, listen to good speakers a lot (i.e. on the radio,) and say sentences over and over again, with a relaxed mouth and tongue. When a language (accent) is spoken correctly, it's easy, the mouth is relaxed, and it is not forced.

, A language isn't learned by memorizing word lists and testing yourself on them. It is learned by speaking the language, becoming fluent with it, as you would a piano, or other instrument.

Know your level.,

Find good learning resources - Choose songs you like.,

Know the meaning of each single word.,

Learn a song by heart.,

Sing the song often during your day.,

Write flashcards or use a vocabulary trainer.,

If you are living in a country where that language is spoken: Look out for common patterns, search for words you just learned.",How to Learn a Foreign Language with Songs," When browsing local book stores or online shops, one might feel the urge to buy material that is way out of one's personal language level. Novels for example, even famous ones, children's books, if you have just started learning, or material like movies, or TV shows. The sad truth is, that as a beginner this kind of material is more frustrating than helpful, as a too high number of new words and grammar items will just impede your natural progress and lower your motivation. It is very important to choose material that suits your level of knowledge and vocabulary.
, The good thing about music and song lyrics is that we connect them emotionally and have a much easier time shifting those words into our long-term memory. On the other hand, when listening to music, we don't ascribe too much importance to the correct use of grammar, the learning effect is much more passive. Things you might look for are:

Search for your favorite song in any foreign language
See the exact translation to every word of the song
Sing along to it
Learn it by heart
Practice with a number of language games
Use the built-in vocabulary trainer to never forget the song

, This is especially important and sets you apart from normal fans and listeners of that foreign music. If you know, even only rudimentarily what all the words in a song are supposed to mean, you can automatically get an insight on how the language works. Make sure to review this step, as it is easy to forget the meaning of the most unusual words., Have you ever had a school assignment to learn a poem by heart? Didn't you also get a deeper sense of understanding what the poet meant, after you learned it? The same effect applies to music. Once you know a song by heart and have a rough understanding of its meaning, in theory, you just put 30 to 50 new words into your long-term memory. But not only the words themselves are being processed. Having the song always in your mind, sets your brain free to ponder about it even when you aren't consciously thinking about it., And enjoy learning it! Learning a song should be fun and give you insight into a different culture, explain to you what people of different countries care to sing about. If it is just simple, but not your type of music, then your progress will also slow down.

If you are into Anime or Western Animation, try theme songs!
Disney songs have always been translated into up to 30+ languages.
Pop Songs are usually easy to understand, as they have similar themes.
Children's songs might also be helpful, as they are also being used to teach the language to native children

, If you want to have a long lasting effect from your learning efforts, write flashcards like you would do with any other textbook. Write down the words you didn't know and see how much easier the reviewing gets, when you already formed an emotional connection with these words., Try to incorporate the words you just learned. They might seem outdated or lyrical but if people correct you, you learn something new, if they laugh, you can make a new friend!

But always remember: Songs won't teach you key phrases like ""Hello"" or ""Goodbye"". Make sure to learn them in advance when travelling to a foreign country. They will probably make up 90 percent of your initial conversation!

Investigate your local options.,
Contact the school.,
Attend regularly.,
Ask for tips for further study.,
Arrange conversation groups with fellow students.",How to Learn a Language1," If you are keen to learn another language, one of the best ways to go about it is to join a class near you. Joining a language class will give you opportunities to practice all the elements of the language. A class will also provide you with a ready-made group of fellow learners to work with.


The teacher will often be a native speaker, and will be able to address any questions you have immediately and face-to-face.
One of the advantages of learning with a teacher is to ability to ask questions, and seek clarification for tricky areas of grammar or pronunciation.
Search online for language schools near you. Often local schools and colleges will run adult education evening courses in foreign languages.
You can access contact information for a number of professional organisations through the website of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages: http://www.actfl.org/about-actfl/resources/member-organization-map
;
, Once you have found a class that you would like to join, contact them directly and ask about the options. It is likely that the centre will hold a number of classes for those with different levels of fluency and ability. If you are an absolute beginner it will be easy to decide which class to join.


If you have some knowledge, and have learnt some of the language before, it’s best to talk to the people at the centre to determine what level class is best for you.
The classes will often run according to the academic year, so if you want to join a class look in advance of September and January.
There may be special more intensive summer school programmes available.

, When you have signed up for a class, it’s vital that you stick with it and make the effort to attend every week. Learning a language is all about practice, so if you find yourself missing classes it will be much harder to learn. You need to maximise the amount of time you spend using the foreign language.The lesson will primarily give you opportunities to ask questions and to practice speaking and listening to your classmates.
The conversational skills you will learn in the classes will be especially important if you planning on going to the country of the language you are learning, and you want to be able to express yourself.

, If you have one lesson a week of an hour or two, you should understand that this will not be enough time to really learn the language. Your success will depend to a large extent on the amount of practice and revision you do outside of the class. Be sure to talk to your teacher about what extra work you can, and what resources she recommends you use.


If you have trouble with a difficult grammar rule, ask your teacher to explain it in class and then assign you some tasks to practice at home.
Your teacher will be able to signpost you to freely available online resources that can help you practice.
Watching films and TV programmes in the language you are learning can help you get used to the sound of the language, so ask your teacher for some recommendations., One of the great advantages of learning with a class of people rather than on your own, is that you get a group of people to practice with. Make friends with some of your fellow language students, and suggest meeting up a coffee every now and then so you can practice speaking the language.Try to only speak in the foreign language for ten minutes, and increase up gradually up to an hour as you get more proficient.

Look up private tutors in your area.,
Consider lessons over skype.,
Book in regular lessons.,
Take advantage of the one-to-one situation.,
Look for group conversation opportunities.",How to Learn a Language2," An alternative, or perhaps supplementary, method for learning a language, is to work with a private tutor. These one-to-one classes can help you to focus in on your study, and are much more intensive than studying with a group. If you think this could be a good approach for you, start by searching online for tutors advertising themselves.


As with any online transaction, try to find out as much as you can about the tutor online.
Use trusted websites that allow private tutors to advertise, an always look for online reviews.
Look at the qualifications and experience the tutor has, as well as the price of lessons.
When you find a tutor you like, ask for a trial lesson before committing to a longer programme.

, More and more language teachers are working online, delivering lessons over skype to their students. This can be a good option if you have a busy schedule, and will struggle to have time to travel to classes. You may have to endure difficulties with the connection, and you may find it harder to develop as good a rapport as you could if you were having the lessons in a room together, but skype lessons are often cheaper., As with any method for learning a language, it’s crucial that you commit as much time as you can to studying and practising. A lesson with a private tutor will give you more direct time with the teacher than if you were in a group. A lesson with a group may last two hours or more, but one with a private tutor is unlikely to be longer than an hour.


Be sure to explain what exactly you want to achieve and why you are learning the language.
Try to have a lesson every week, and be well-prepared to ask questions and practice your speaking.
Although the cost of the lessons per hour will generally be higher than a group lesson, you are effectively getting more contact time and attention in each lesson.

, The main advantage of working with a private tutor rather than a class, is the amount of one-to-one time you have with the teacher. This can be intimidating, especially if you are just beginning to learn, but is also gives you plenty of opportunity to get clarity on things you are struggling with.If you are having one-to-one lesson you will be spending almost the entire time in conversation with your tutor, hopefully in the foreign language.
This can really help you work on your speaking and listening. Expect the teacher to quickly pick up quickly on any mistakes in your pronunciation that might get overlooked in a larger group.
Once you and your teacher get to know each other a little better, she will be able to tailor the classes a bit more closely to your needs.
If you are trying to learn a language for business, a good teacher will be able to modify the lessons to teach you relevant vocabulary.

, Although having one-to-one lessons will give you plenty of time to practice speaking and listening, you may like to find opportunities to practice with other people. If you are only working with the teacher, you could investigate a conversation group with people who are closer to your level.


It can be isolating to learn just with one-to-one lessons, so look for opportunities locally to meet other people learning the same language.
Adding a social element can help you keep up the motivation to study and practice.
It’s important to have fun while you learn and practice the language."

Access free online resources and websites.,
Learn with bought learning packages.,
Use textbooks to learn at home.,
Try to combine different methods.",How to Learn a Language3," If you are unable to commit to regular lessons, there is a vast amount of online resources and websites that you access for free to help you learn. Many of these websites are very well developed and have a lot of information about grammar, as well as plenty of exercises to help you practice.


There is huge choice, so try a few different websites and see which one you find the easiest to use.Often countries will have official websites as bases for people to learn their mother tongue.
The government backed websites are generally very reliable and accurate.
Look for websites with addresses that end with .gov or .edu, or are from well-known institutions, such as the BBC or the Goethe Institute.
The American Foreign Services Institute has high-quality materials prepared by linguists, and covers a wide-range of languages: http://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/.

, Learning languages is a big business, and there are lots of different packages you can buy that will guide you through lessons that cover reading, writing, speaking and listening. These packages can have hundreds of hours of material, and be very expensive to buy. Look up online reviews to get an idea of the packages available for the language you want to learn.An advantage of using one of the packages is that you can learn at your own speed, and fit your lessons in around your daily life.


There are also very popular apps that you can get on a smartphone, which enable you to learn anywhere.Without regular face-to-face lessons you may find it harder to develop confidence in your ability to actually speak the language to other people.
If you struggle with motivation, you might benefit more from having the face-to-face contact, where there is more pressure on you to study and contribute.
Most of the major companies will offer a free trial of their software, so be sure to try it out before you pay hundreds of dollars.

, A more low-tech way to learn at home, is to buy some textbooks, grammar guides, and verb tables and start working through them. This approach requires some dedication and commitment, because learning at home with a book can get boring and frustrating. Using books can be a good way to learn technical aspects of the language, such as grammar, sentence structure, and verb conjugation.


Old textbooks can be bought cheaply second-hand online, but try to get one that is fairly recent.
Languages change, so you need to be learning from an up-to-date text.
If you just rely on books, you are unlikely to spend much time on listening, and even less on speaking.

, When you are trying to learn a language, it’s important not to neglect any of the key areas. If you are learning alone, you are likely to spend more time on reading and writing, and if you learn in a group you will probably spend more time speaking and listening. Try to get a good balance of the four different aspects, and vary your learning techniques.You are not just learning the technical aspects of a language, but also developing the confidence to speak to people.
Take any opportunity to practice, and spend as much time on the language as you possibly can.

Wait until you are introduced.,
Bow.,
Refrain from extending your hand.",How to Say Nice to Meet You in Japanese1," In Japan, it is rude to introduce yourself. When possible, wait to be introduced in formal and informal settings. This demonstrates that you understand your status in relation to the statuses of those around you., When Japanese men and women greet each other, they bow out of respect. Non-Japanese men and women are expected to partake in this custom as well. To correctly perform a bow, you must assume the correct posture. Place your heels together and lay your palms flat on your thighs. There are four types of bows:


The eshaku, or greeting bow, is a 15° bow. This bow is used during an informal meeting. While this bow is not held long—less than 2 seconds—it is important that you do not appear rushed.The futsuu rei, or respect bow, is a 30° to 45° bow. This bow lasts for two deep breaths.The saikei rei, or highest respect bow, is a 45° to 70° bow.This bow is appropriate at any occasion. It is commonly held for 2 seconds.
On very formal occasions, bows are deeper and held longer., In Western nations, the handshake is an accepted and expected component of formal and informal greetings. The handshake, however, is not a common part of the Japanese tradition. Upon meeting, do not extend your hand."

When meeting a man or woman of high stature for the second time, you may say mata oai dekite kouei desu. This phrase means “it is a great honor to meet you again.” It is pronounced ma-ta oh-aye dic-tish-te ko-ee dis.

, When you meet a well respected member of society, such as the owner of a business, it is appropriate to use a slightly less formal greeting.


When meeting this person for the first time, you may say oai dekite kouei desu. This means “delighted to meet you” and is pronounced oh-aye dic-tish-te ko-ee dis.Upon meeting them for the second time, you may say mata oai dekite ureshii desu. This phrase means “pleased to meet you again.”It is pronounced ma-ta oh-aye dic-tish-te UR-e-she dis.

, In Japan, there are greetings reserved for meeting a person of a higher status. To turn informal greetings into formal greetings, insert “O” before the informal phrase.


For example, ‘’hisashiburi desu’’ becomes ‘’o hisashiburi desu’’. It is pronounced ‘’oh hee-sah-shee-boo-ree deh-soo neh’’."

, Start with the main topic in the centre and then write connected words on lines branching out from the centre.

, Write the topic at the top of the page and then record related words below. For an example of linear notes see source links.

, You can draw a picture, write a definition, write a similar word, or, if it is a foreign word, you can write a translation.

, Add new words to your mind maps and to your linear notes regularly. Create new pages for new groups of words.

Visit the library.,
Buy used language books.,
Take a free online course.",How to Learn a Language Inexpensively1," If you're starting to learn a new language from scratch, you will need some kind of instructional materials to help you learn the grammar and structure of the language. There are many books and audio courses to help with this, and your local library will likely have some of them.Language course materials can cost a lot if you are buying them new, but your local library will most likely have both books and cds you can check out for free to get started.
Most libraries have a system for borrowing materials from other libraries, so if they don't have anything at your skill level, they may be able to order it within a few days.;
, If you get serious about a language, you may decide you need instructional books of your own, so you don't have to worry about library due dates. If this is the case for you, look into buying used, older editions of language books.


While languages do change, they do so slowly over long periods of time. Many language textbooks, however, come out in a new edition every year. When this happens, prices for the old editions drop considerably. The material they contain, however, is still perfectly useful for self-study.Used bookstores and thrift stores often carry used language texts. If the language you are learning is less common, look on the internet for inexpensive used materials.
E-books for foreign language are also often available inexpensively.

, If you want a little more structure, but can't afford to take a course, there are many free online language courses that can get you started on your new language.


The BBC website contains free language materials for 40 different languages, free of charge.Many nations' international TV or radio networks also feature free courses in the language of the home country. In Germany, for example Deustche Welle offers free German courses.Search online to see if there are options like this for the language you want to learn.
The website Omniglot features listings of online instructional materials for hundreds of languages, as well as basic materials of their own. Some of their listings are paid subscription services, but others are free."

Make flashcards.,
Use an app.,
Use a dictionary.,
Pair words with images.",How to Learn a Language Inexpensively2," Learning a language is about both grammar and vocabulary. One tried and true method for learning vocabulary is using flashcards, available at any office supply store for a few dollars.


The glossary of your language book, or a basic dictionary or phrasebook, can provide the content for these flashcards. Write a word on one side and definition on the other. Use these to quiz yourself.
When you learn a word well enough that you get it every time, remove it from the stack and create a new pile. Review these every month or so, just to make sure you don't forget them., If paper flash cards are too much of a hassle, there are number of free phone apps and computer programs that basically do the same thing, quizzing you on words and sentences.


Duolingo and Memrise have a game-like feel that many people find appealing.Anki works just like flashcards, but automatically reduces the frequency of words as you show consistent mastery of them., A language dictionary or translation app like Google Translate or wordreference.com can also come in handy when trying to learn vocabulary. In your studies, when you come across a word you don't recognize, make sure to look it up!If you're using paper flashcards, you might make a flashcard to add to your stack after you look up a new word.

, If you are having trouble remembering words, try to pair mental images with the words, based on what they sound like.For example, the German word for poison is ""gift."" Poison obviously doesn't make a very good gift, but you could imagine a bottle of poison with a skull and crossbones on the label, tied up in red gift bow.
The Italian word for horse is ""cavalo."" This sounds a lot like ""follow,"" so you might imagine a horse following you around your home as you get ready for work. This might seem time consuming, but once you come up with a mental picture that works, you'll be able to remember words quickly and easily.
The more vivid and interesting the image, the more likely you are to remember it.

Find a conversation group.,
Watch foreign films and TV.,
Listen to music and podcasts.,
Do some light reading.",How to Learn a Language Inexpensively3," Studying on your own is important, especially when you are still learning the basics. To truly a master a language, however, you need to use it in a more natural context. A great way to do this is to join a conversation group.Most cities have free conversation groups for many different languages. Joining one of these groups gives you a chance to use your new language on a regular basis in a natural, conversational way.
Search on the internet to find one of these groups. Many of them use meetup.com to organize their meetings.

, Hearing native speakers use the language is another great way to learn it. Rent some movies in the language you are learning, or check out some television shows from a country the language is spoken in.


Many countries make at least some of their content available for free online for international audiences. The website of the German American International Congress, for example, allows you to stream German television shows for free and entirely legally.Search online to see if there's an option like this for the language you are learning.
Find programs that interest you! It will make this form of studying much easier., Another great way to hear the language spoken by native speakers is by listening to music or podcasts from abroad. Again, there are often free options for this.


The website TuneInRadio lets you listen to radio programming from other countries for free. There are also pre-made playlists on Spotify for different countries that you can stream for free.There are a number of free podcasts that can be very helpful for language learners as well. For example, for many languages, you can download a podcast of the daily news, read slowly in the language of your choice. This allows you to hear native speakers pronouncing a wide variety of words correctly, but at a pace that's easier to comprehend., When you first start learning a new language, you won't be able to sit down and read the great classics of literature in that language. Start with something lighter that you still find interesting.


Many people will start by reading children's books or comic books in the language they are learning. The pictures can add context that improves your comprehension.
Simple magazine content that focuses on topics that interest you can also work well. If you are interested fashion, for example, try picking up a fashion magazine in the language you are learning."

Make practicing memorable.,
Label items throughout your home.,
Create a designated homework time.,
Use the vocabulary on a daily basis.,
Read aloud at home.,
Use technology.",How to Help Your Kid Learn in a Dual Language Program1," Use felt boards to pair objects with their corresponding words. Use brightly colored materials for vocabulary flashcards. Make sweeping, expansive gestures when describing certain vocab words. Pair exaggerated facial expressions with vocab words, too. Try to make every practice moment exciting, so that your child will easily remember what you discussed.For example, if you are discussing how to say the word “sad” in another language with your child, then you might make a point to fake cry and rub your eyes.;
, Get a cheap label-making machine or use tape and a marker. Look over your child’s vocabulary list and find those items in your home. Then, create labels for each item, showing the name in the new language. This will help your child to learn the names of items faster and can help you to learn the language, too.Don’t feel as if you have to label everything at once. Start with a handful of items and continue to add more labels over time.
For example, you could place a label on food items, such as bread or chips. Household locations, such as the kitchen or bathroom, can be labeled as well.

, Spend a few weeks getting a feel for how much homework your child will have each night. Then, set aside a corresponding number of hours each evening just for work. You might create a designated work space as well, such as the kitchen table or an office space. Keep to this schedule as closely as possible and your child will come to expect this time, which will lessen their stress level.It is not uncommon for children in dual language programs to spend at least twice as much time on homework, when compared with traditional students.Make sure to not skip working on your child’s homework, no matter how confusing it might seem. Work with your child to complete a draft and then communicate with the teacher about your concerns., Try to intermix your native language with the new one as you go about your daily tasks around your child. Repeat certain phrases or words until your child seems familiar with them, then move along to a new set.For example, you could describe doing the laundry in your native language and then repeat your statements in the new language immediately afterwards.

, Go to the library and borrow bilingual books. Take these home and then spend a bit of time, perhaps immediately after dinner, reading aloud with your child from the same book. Focus on a single book at a time until translating becomes effortless. You can also buy reading primers and complete the exercises together.Encourage your child to not be embarrassed to read at a lower level than they are accustomed to. Working through children’s literature, in particular, can be a particularly useful way to promote comprehension.

, You can buy DVDs in the new language that your child can watch at home. Or, CDs that they can listen to in the car on the way to/from school. The CDs can be spoken word, but music can be helpful as well. You might also spend some time on the computer with your child, exploring language education websites, such as Early Lingo.Many bilingual education websites, such as ABCmouse, offer brain games that your child can play to improve their language skills.There are also a number of bilingual education apps that work on your iPhone and other handheld devices. For example, Desert Spanish for Kids, is an app that emphasizes Spanish vocabulary retention."

Get them together with a native speaker.,
Sign them up for bilingual extracurricular activities.,
Enroll in a language program.,
Be patient.",How to Help Your Kid Learn in a Dual Language Program2," Ask a friend or family member who speaks the new language to come over and have a few conversations with your child. It is even better if they can share some of their cultural experiences as well, as that will help your child to make a connection between learning and real life.Make sure to warn this native speaker that your child is still in an early learning phase and may make numerous mistakes. Ask the speaker to be as supportive as possible, while providing constructive criticism.

, If learning the new language is just confined to the classroom, your child may grow bored and lose interest. Instead, take them to a museum with bilingual exhibits. Go see a sports match that is announced in the language that your child is learning. Go browse a farmer’s market in which the vendors speak the other language., Find a way to start learning the same language yourself. You can buy a learning program, such as Rosetta Stone, or perhaps even get a private tutor. Keep up with your lessons and talk about your setbacks with your child. You can also create a study routine that parallels that of your child, to encourage them to keep with it., It is possible that your student’s grades and test scores might lower a bit while they are enrolled in the program. They may also be particularly frustrated for the first few weeks as they make learning adjustments. It is important that you are supportive during these times and that you emphasize the long-term goals for your child, such as a better chance to travel internationally in the future.For example, you might say, “This is just a rough period as you are getting used to the schedule. Let’s give it one more week and reassess.”

Choose a model that suits your goals.,
Communicate directly with the teachers.,
Volunteer to help in the classroom.,
Participate in the PTA.,
Attend many school events.",How to Help Your Kid Learn in a Dual Language Program3," Before you enroll your child in a program, investigate how their learning will be scheduled and organized. Some programs split classroom time evenly between the two languages. Others follow a full immersion model and almost completely eliminate the use of the native language. Think about what model best suits the learning style and personality of your child.For example, if you have a child that is quiet by nature, then a full immersion class might be overwhelming and may cause them to withdraw verbally.

, From the first day of class, make sure that you stay in contact with your child’s teachers. Write notes for your child to deliver with any questions that you have over homework or class activities. Send emails if that is preferred. Stop by the classroom before you pick-up your child. Don’t waste their time with random visits, but stay in touch., Offer to serve in the classroom on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. You can spend multiple hours, or just a single one, helping out. Talk to your child’s teacher about your skill set and how you can be of assistance.Be aware that you don’t have to help out directly with the language program in order to benefit your child. By simply being in the classroom, you may provide them with much needed confidence and support.

, Many dual language programs struggle to find funding for activities and educational materials. Join the PTA and offer suggestions about how you can help raise monies for the program and classrooms. This will also provide you with an opportunity to talk with other parents about the program and your child’s performance., If your child is participating in a small language program, in an otherwise large institution, it could possibly make them feel isolated from the general student population. Counter this feeling by encouraging them to participate in larger school activities and events, such as celebrations or sporting events. You can go along with them to show your support and enthusiasm."

Love is a big deal.,
Expressions of love are not common.,
Family and friends are important.,

Love and sex do not have to go hand-in-hand.,
Take advantage of Valentine's Day and White Day.",How to Say I Love You in Japanese1," In Japanese culture and tradition, love is portrayed as a divine feeling bonded by god and torn only by death.In Western culture, the term ""love"" is used more freely and in ways unrelated to a relationships. People may say that they ""love"" ice cream, their smart phone or a favorite sports team. Before saying ""I love you,"" reflect on your true feelings and be clear about what you want to express.;
, While there's been a push in recent years for Japanese men to express their love more openly, words of love are not uttered regularly among the Japanese. Instead, they express their feelings through emotion.


Speak with your eyes. In one study, it was observed that Japanese people focus more on a person's eyes than on his mouth to determine emotion. Research has shown that the expressive muscles around the eyes provide key clues about a person’s genuine emotions, so the Japanese are good at perceiving a person's true feelings. Use tone of voice. In one study it was noted that Japanese participants paid more attention to a person's voice than to his face making the Japanese adept at listening for emotional cues., If you have an opportunity to get to know and make yourself liked by family members and friends, it could go a long way to helping secure the success of a relationship. Young Japanese men and women often go on group dates and value being part of a set.


You cannot necessarily gauge a Japanese woman's interest in you by the way she acts around her friends. Japanese women are often conservative in social groups but may be more open and flirty in more intimate situations.
A look at Japanese ""happy ending"" novels show that unlike their Western counterparts, it's not burning passion that clears the way for a couple to be together but rather friends, family and suitable circumstances. , If your declaration of love is prelude to a journey that you hope will end with a Japanese woman as your wife, you may want to consider your finances. In Japan, marriage has traditionally been built, in part, around practical consideration--one of which is money. In a recent online survey of more than 500 Japanese women, 72% said they wouldn't want to marry without money. , Attitudes among Japanese men and women about sex are fairly open, so if you feel as though you must utter the words ""I love you"" in order to initiate a physical relationship, that's not necessarily the case. Sex and sexuality is less frowned upon in Japan than it is in Western countries. Many Japanese consider physical interest as part of the attraction in a dating relationship.

, On Valentine’s Day in Japan, women give gifts, especially chocolate, to men they love. Men return the favor on White Day, which takes place one month after Valentine's Day on March 14. Men give women gifts of various kinds, most commonly chocolate. "

Know that Japanese uses two ""alphabets."",
Pronounce either にほん or 日本 as ""Nihon."",
Say ""Japanese."",
Understand that the pronunciation is a matter of debate.,
Listen to someone say it.",How to Say Japan in Japanese," Hiragana is the more commonly used alphabet, but some people also use katakana. Both systems use characters to represent syllables. Many people also write in kanji, which originated in China and still bears many similarities to Chinese writing. Thus, you may often see the word ""Japan"" written as 日本 (kanji) or にほん (hiragana).In kanji, 日, or ""ni,"" is the character for ""sun."" 本, or ""hon,"" is the character for ""origin."" Thus, ""Japan"" literally means ""sun-origin,"" or ""The Land of the Rising Sun."";
, The syllables sound like ""nee"" and ""hon"" or ""han."" Say ""hon"" as a sharp ending, however, not a drawl – ""hon,"" not ""hone"" or ""hun.""


""Nihon"" may also sound like ""Nipon"" or ""Nippon."" Pronounce it ""Nee-pon"" – ""pon"" as in ""pond."" To be safe, think of the correct pronunciation as a soft blend of ""Nihon"" and ""Nippon.""

, To say ""Japanese"" in Japanese, add the syllable ""go"" (as in ""got"") to the end of ""Nihon."" Pronounce it ""Nihongo"" or ""Nee-hon-go.""

, In past centuries, the Japanese language has been subject to the influence of Chinese monks, European explorers, and various foreign merchants. There is still no full consensus about whether the name is pronounced ""Nihon"" or ""Nippon."" ""Nippon"" is the older pronunciation – but a recent survey showed that 61 percent of native speakers read the word as ""Nihon,"" while only 37 percent read it as ""Nippon.""When in doubt, take your cues from the people around you.


Some claim that traditionally, Japanese used ""Nihon"" to refer to their nation when communicating between themselves, and ""Nippon"" when speaking to outsiders. This has not been officially verified, and there is no formally ""correct"" pronunciation., The best way to learn how to pronounce the word is to hear someone say it. Once you've heard it, practice saying it yourself. Look online for videos or recordings of people saying ""日本"".If you have any friends or family members who are native Japanese speakers, ask them to pronounce the word for you.

, This is best used to convey true and committed feelings of love. Nothing about this expression speaks to friendship. Do not use it unless your feelings are strong.

, This means ""you are precious"" and may be a preferred way to express your feelings if you're not quite ready for a committed relationship.

, This can be translated ""Don't you know how much I love you?"" Uttering this expression is a way to offer an explanation--""nan"" is used when giving or asking for explanations.

, Those who perhaps are a bit too practical to believe in love at first sight, might talk about ""koi no yokan,"" which refers to the feeling upon meeting someone that love is in the cards, in time. "

Say “kokoro.” This is the Japanese word for heart.,
Listen to people saying the word.",How to Say Heart in Japanese1," It is pronounced “koh-koh-roh.” The “roh” syllable is pronounced quickly and softly. Kokoro is the word for the metaphysical heart, as in “heart, mind, spirit.”


Put the emphasis slightly on the first syllable of the word. Say the syllables fast. Don’t draw any of them out dramatically.One way to remember the word is to think about “Cocoa Puffs.” The Japanese word for heart has a similar sound to the American cereal’s name. Kokoro has a meaning related to the soul. This is why the word is often used in Japanese literature and music to refer to ""heart and soul"" in one.;
, If you have a Japanese friend or relative, ask them how to say it. You could also take Japanese lessons online or at a local college.

You can start with translated versions of books like Disney or The Very Hungry Caterpillar. This way you can easily compare the translation to the original text to help grasp the sentence structure.
Look for books by Mari Takabayashi while you learn hiragana. Her children's books are written entirely in hiragana, but will challenge your mastery of the script.
Guri and Gura are also a very famous series of Japanese children's books that you can try as you become more advanced. They can help to build your basic vocabulary.
Try manga. Once you feel comfortable with children's books, try moving up to some manga as a gateway to more advanced reading.;
, Japanese can seem confusing to read at first because there are no spaces between the characters.


Basic sentence structure is quite different than English. Whereas an English sentence might be ""I drink water"", the Japanese equivalent would translate literally to ""I water drink"". Also make sure to know the proper characters to put after a subject or object.

, It can be frustrating to get past the first page of a book in Japanese, but stick with it. As you go through a text, many words will be repeated later in the document. The more you read and encounter the same words, the faster your reading will go as they become more familiar.Choose subjects you like. If you are interested in music, get books that are at your Japanese reading level for that subject. If the topic interests you, you stand a much better chance of pushing through the reading and picking up more of the language.

, If your goal is simply to learn to read and write Japanese fast, you will only slow yourself down if you get an audio learning course or take a class where you will practice conversational Japanese. It is possible to learn the language without having to speak it. Since kanji uses characters to represent meanings, it doesn't matter whether you know how to pronounce the words out loud. All that matters that you know what a symbol means and how to correctly use it in a sentence.


Instead of practicing speaking, spend all your study time building your kanji vocabulary, learning grammar, and practicing writing.

, Try putting on a television show or movies in your native language, and turn on Japanese subtitles. As you begin to build your reading speed and vocabulary, you can mute the volume so you have to read the Japanese subtitles. It might be difficult to keep up at first, but you can use the images on the screen to help you gather the context along with the words.

, Most of the words in Japanese are kanji characters borrowed from Chinese. The Jōyō Kanji are a list of 2136 Chinese characters that the Japanese government promotes as most useful to understanding the language.Keep a kanji blog as you learn. It can take many months or even years to learn kanji. Having a blog makes it easy to look back and review the words you have learned.Be patient. It will take a good deal of time and repetition to learn Kanji.

, Hiragana is the phonetic script used in the Japanese language. Since it accounts for every sound used in the language, it is possible to write everything in hiragana.


There are 46 characters in the hiragana script.Each of them represents a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or a vowel + consonant (k, s, t, n, h, m, y, r, w).Use hiragana script to write participles and expressions, or words that are uncommon and might not be known by your reader.Make flashcards of each of the hiragana characters with the phonetic sound they represent on the backside. Practice by going through them once or twice a day by saying the phonetic sound that goes with each character. Then try looking at the phonetic sound and writing the corresponding hiragana character.

, The katakana script is composed of 46 symbolsthat create the same phonetic sounds and the hiragana script but are used for words that originated from another language. This can be useful when you want to talk about things like America, Mozart, or Halloween.


Since there are no long vowel sounds in the Japanese language, all long vowels in katakana are denoted by a long dash ""⏤"" following the character. For example, ""ケーキ"" is how you say ""cake."" The dash indicates the long ""a"" sound.The hiragana and katakana scripts can be learned in just a couple weeks if you practice them for a couple of hours each day.

, Just as the letter 'a' appears different on computer fonts than when it is handwritten, many typed Japanese computer fonts appear different than the handwritten fonts.


Memorize. A good way of learning is to spend about a half hour to an hour a day memorizing and writing characters.
Quiz yourself. To test if you're remembering hiragana and katakana, try to write a certain group of sounds from memory. If you can't do it, go over it again. Make a chart of all the Japanese sounds, then try to fill them in with the corresponding hiragana or katakana scripts. Keep trying daily until you can do all 46 for each script.

, Learning kanji can help to shorten your writing significantly, but it is used sparingly, even by native speakers. You often need to be sure that the reader is going to recognize the kanji you use. If you know how to say a word, but do not know the kanji, you can spell it out phonetically using hiragana.

,


Write characters top to bottom, left to right.
Make your horizontal strokes before vertical strokes.
Make shapes in the middle doing strokes on the sides.
Dots or smaller strokes should come last.
Learn the proper angles for each stroke.

, It doesn't have to be anything fancy. It can be a sentence as simple as ""I am a girl"" or ""I am a boy"".


Write in hiragana unless some of the words are imported. You can choose to either write it horizontally (in which case you'd write left to right, as in English) or in the more traditional vertical fashion (in which case you'd write top to bottom, right to left).
Write nouns, adjectives and verbs using kanji. Most of the words in Japanese are kanji characters that have been borrowed from the Chinese language.Once you start writing kanji, make sure that you're using the proper kanji and not writing the wrong one.

, While it may seem easier to simply use romanization to capture the syllables, romaji is not used by Japanese people and your writing may just end up confusing the reader.Since there are many homonyms in the Japanese language, romaji is not a very efficient way to write or read.

, Once you have mastered the stroke order, you can begin to write characters in semi-cursive or cursive. Practice writing sentences and words while removing the brush or pencil as little as possible from the page. Since you have learned the proper stroke order, you can simply apply less pressure in between the strokes and produce characters seamlessly.


Just like in other languages, certain characters can be simplified slightly in the writing to write quickly.While you don't want to make your characters illegible, usually the context of the writing will help the reader to understand a sloppily written character.

, こんにちは means ""hello"" in Japanese. You pronounce it Konnichi wa.


お早うございます means ""Good morning."" You pronounce it like, Ohayo gozaimasu.
こんばんは means ""Good Evening."" Pronounce it like, Konban wa.
お休みなさい means ""Good night."" Pronounce it like, Oyasumi nasai.
さようなら means ""Goodbye."" Say, Sayonara.

, ありがとうございます means ""Thank you very much"" in Japanese. You pronounce it Arigatou gozaimasu.


If someone thanks you, say you're welcome. どういたしまして means ""You're welcome."" Pronounce it, Do itashimashite.

, お元気ですか means ""How are you?"" You pronounce it Ogenki desu ka?


If someone asks how you are doing, let them know you're fine. 元気です means, ""I'm fine."" Pronounce it genki desu.

, 私の名前は means, ""My name is..."" Pronounce it Watashi no namae wa.

ますぐ(masugu) means straight.
右(migi) means right.
左(hidari) means left.

Say “shinzou.” This is the Japanese word for heart when it refers to the actual organ in the body.Thus, if you are trying to use the word heart to refer to love and emotion, it’s better to use “kokoro” than “shinzou.”


Shinzou is pronounced, “shin-zoh.” Put the emphasis on the first syllable.The word for chest in Japanese is “mune.” Mune is pronounced “moon-eh” with emphasis on the first syllable.The bottom line is that the Japanese place an emphasis on separating the metaphysical and spiritual from the tangible physicality of the body.,
Write heart using Japanese characters.",How to Say Heart in Japanese2," A person can have heart (kokoro), or the person’s heart needs medical care (shinzou). That’s the difference.

, Perhaps you want to write the word heart as a Japanese person would write it, not in English.


The Japanese characters for kokoro is 心 . Using the Japanese script is much better if you want to write the word.
The Japanese characters for shinzou are 心臓."
"
Determine the context.,
Master some common phrases.",How to Say Heart in Japanese3," The phrase will actually help you determine the word you will choose, kokoro or shinzou.


Remember, if your phrase at all has the connotation of spirituality, you will need to use the word kokoro, not shinzou.
In English, of course, the word heart is the same whether you are referring to the spiritual heart or the physical heart, so this can take some getting used to.

, If you want to say your heart is beating but in a sentimental way because it’s beating due to love or being anxious, say, “Kokoro ga doki doki suru.”


If your heart is beating in a physical or medical sense, say “Shinzou ga doki doki suru.”. To say the phrase “it’s a heart,” say “coke-oh-ruh des.”
To say your heart is broken, say “Watashi no kokoro wa zutazuta desu.” To say you’ve had heart surgery, say “shi-n-zo-u shujutsu.” ""My heart is broken"" in Japanese is: 私の心は傷ついています

The f in 'fuyu' is an approximation. The sound is somewhere between an f and an h, but the difference can be difficult to discern to non-native speakers of Japanese. Saying it as an f will be understood.;
, If you are familiar with written Japanese, you will know that there are three separate writing systems. The word 'fuyu' in hiragana is 'ふゆ'. In katakana, it is 'フユ', and in kanji, '冬'. Memorising the kanji in particular is very important.

Visit local Japanese cultural centers or plan a trip to Japan.",How to Learn Kanji," Libraries are a great resource because they not only provide free books but may also offer free, online learning programs to help you learn a new writing system. While you may not find a specific program offered at the library, there may also be community lead tutorials or tutors posting at the library bulletin board.Both books and personal tutorials can teach stroke order, basic grammar, character identification or translation.;
, There are a variety of language apps available for free or purchased download. Functions you may be looking for are whether the app can create flashcards to help learn new characters and words. Flashcard apps can be searched for Apple, Windows or Android phone., Submerse yourself in the language system by listening to specific tutorial podcasts and audiobooks as you practice each lesson. Read reviews of podcasts and audiobooks to ensure that they are at an appropriate level., Kanji is commonly known as Chinese characters. Kanji characters differ from the English alphabet because they describe an idea rather than represent a specific letter. This is unlike the other two Japanese language systems, Hiragana and Katakana, which do not have meaning on their own but rather are used for grammar and to write non-Japanese words., Many people may assume you only need to learn to speak Japanese, without learning to write kanji. Understanding kanji increases your vocabulary and can familiarize yourself with the nuances of the Japanese language.


For example, kanji is similar to some English affixes. For example, a word starting with “re-” in English, like reunite, means “again” or united again. Similarly, when seeing specific kanji characters you will come to understand that the meaning of the word may change based on the kanji., Flashcards are a great tool to drill new information. For example, commit 30 minutes everyday to learning at least 7 new kanji characters. Don’t forget to quiz yourself on the previous lessons to ensure the information stays fresh Remember to learn the meaning of the word, how it is said, and how it is written.

, When possible, use mnemonics to glue a word to memory. Mnemonics works by associating a word with a funny, silly, or memorable story. While you can create your own mnemonics there are also numerous apps and online resources to help if you feel your creativity waning., Learning another writing system can be daunting so it is important to clearly define your endgoal in order to map out the appropriate steps you’ll need to attain it. Learning how to write in another language is a vague goal so perhaps a more specific goal can be learning how to write a one page letter in Kanji to your favourite Japanese television.Defining an appropriate timeline may also help you reach your goals faster and stave off frustration. Make your goals according to your everyday schedule. Choose an appropriate end date that won’t be pushed back or interfered with by other, more important, events., Kanji characters may seem foreign but if you look closely you may be able to associate more familiar images within a kanji character to help you remember it. For example, the kanji character for “person” looks like a person. Similarly, the kanji character for “stop” looks like a person motioning with his arm to stop.There are a few resources including the books Remember the Kanji by James Heisig and Kanji Pict-O-Graphix by Michael Rowley that can help decode kanji characters into more recognizable image association., Use flashcards and change the order of the cards everyday to ensure that you’re memorizing the words and not the order of the words. Additionally, do not simply randomize your cards by changing the order of a few new ones each day. You must continue to learn the writing system by building on words that you have already learned, which is best done every day.If you don’t have energy, motivation, or time to review on a given day, simply go over what you do remember. Whether you have access to your flashcards or not, your motivation and energy will increase as you both confirm what you’ve already learned and wonder what you could be missing.Whether walking to your car or using the bathroom, there’s always time to review.

, There are many sites where you can find a language partner that you can easily write to everyday. Even 3 sentences a day can help you learn kanji., Stroke order can not only help you write efficiently but may also help you memorize characters. Stroke order for most kanji stays consistent and can be relatively easy. While there may be difficult kanji characters such as 飛 or 鬱 where you’ll need time to master the stroke order, ensure that you don’t develop any bad habits when you first master the less complex characters., Learn new vocabulary and practice verb construction as you continue to write. While it's easy to learn words individually, it’s more difficult to write them fluidly into fully formed sentences and paragraphs. Writing also gives you time to completely express your emotions and construct full ideas.Writing allows you time to think and practice as conversation doesn’t give you the same opportunity to process your thoughts. You will be able to refine your communication style the more often you write., Immerse yourself in the culture and language by checking out what is trending on Youtube for Japan. You can also buy a popular Japanese television series to watch at your own pace. Depending on how popular the program, you may be able to easily find English manuscripts, dubbing or subtitles so you can follow along. News outlets may also provide their programming and content in alternate languages. Check the site of your local news outlet for a Japanese alternative.

, You do not have to learn every single word to become fluent in another language. More importantly, you only need to learn the most frequently used words to understand most of a language.For example, there are just 300 words that make up 65% of all written English material.For example, learn colloquialism over formal forms of words if you are trying to learn conversational Japanese., While learning to speak a language is easiest when forced into a conversation, having visual aids may also quicken your reading comprehension. Being able to speak to someone over video can help you associate the spoken word with the written word if they are willing to read along with you or provide visual aids. Search online for tutors or conversation partners. You may be able to trade a lesson in English for a lesson in Japanese.Skype allows you to have multiple windows and apps open as a safety net in case you feel lost in your conversation. You can use translation tools while you chat to make sure you don’t feel too far behind. Don’t rely too heavily on anything other than your memory. Depening on your partner, you can always ask to take a break because you are lost in the conversation., There’s no better way to learn about Japan than visiting the country; however, travelling can be very expensive so turn to local cultural centers. If you do not have a local Japanese cultural center, look to establish a club so that you and other community members interested in the culture may share resources.


If travelling in Japan, many directions, menus, and signs will be read in kanji."

Study Japanese writing systems.,
Practice Japanese pronunciation.,
Learn some key phrases.,
Learn the rules of grammar.",How to Learn Japanese on Your Own1," The Japanese language uses four writing systems. In order to learn Japanese, you will need to study each of them. You can visit https://www.tofugu.com/japanese to view each writing system and take beginning lessons to learn each one.


Hiragana is the Japanese alphabet. It consists of 51 phonetic characters. Each character stands for one sound. Begin by studying and memorizing these characters. Once you understand Hiragana, you will know how to pronounce any word in Japanese.Katakana is a series of characters used to stand for non-Japanese words (such as fast food or California). It is a good idea to learn the Katakana phrases for words you commonly use.Kanji are actually Chinese symbols that are used to stand for words and phrases in Japanese. Whereas Hiragana symbols are more like “letters” (depicting simple sounds), Kanji symbols depict complete words.Romaji is a system of using English letters to spell Japanese words. A little Romaji will be helpful at first (especially for learning initial key phrases) but if you rely too much on on it, you are unlikely to move on to a real understanding of the language. Instead, focus mostly on Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji.;
, There are 46 sounds in the Japanese language. These sounds are composed of one of five vowel sounds, by a vowel-consonant combination. (There is only one exception, which is a sound composed of only a consonant). You can begin studying pronunciation by learning how to pronounce each character in hiragana and katakana.


Visit http://www.forvo.com/languages/ja/ to take beginning lessons in Japanese pronunciation.

, Knowing some key phrases will allow you to begin practicing. Although Romaji should not be heavily relied upon, using Romaji to learn these basic phrases is OK for beginners.Hello - Kon'nichiwa
Nice to meet you - Hajime mash'te
Goodbye - Sayonara
I'm fine, thanks - Watashiwa genki desu. Arigato.
Thank you very much - Domo arigato gozaimasu
Please (asking for something) - Kudasai
Please (offering something) - Dozo
Do you understand? Wakarimasuka

, Japanese grammar is very different from grammar in English, so try not to apply English rules of grammar to your Japanese study. Learning Japanese grammer will take some time to get used to. Purchase a Japanese grammar workbook and begin following the lessons. Some examples include ""Practice Makes Perfect: Basic Japanese"" and ""A Guide to Japanese Grammar"" by Tae Kim. Or locate free online resources (such as Duolingo) to study Japanese grammar.Here are some basic tips:


Nouns do not have gender. Also, most nouns don't have separate plural forms.
In Japanese, the subject is optional and may be omitted.
The predicate is always at the end of the sentence.
Verbs do not change according to the subject (he/she/it). They also don't change according to number (singular/plural, like I/we or he/they).Personal pronouns (such as I or you) differ according to the level of formality of a given situation.

Make sure that Japanese is really for you, and that you are dedicated to the learning process.,
Understand that the first thing that all Japanese students should try to do is establish a slight understanding of what exactly is ahead of them.,
Use the tools that you have to supplement your learning.,
Buy simple, easy to use resource materials (see reading list at the end of this article).,
If possible, take up a Japanese friend.,
Practice, and practice more.,
Again, if you are capable of doing so, try to adopt a Japanese accent, people in Japan will view you as more native.,
Practice writing on an erasable surface, there is no need to waste paper.,
Create a schedule that conforms to your daily activities.,
Never give up, even if you become frustrated.",How to Learn to Speak Japanese in Your Spare Time," Many people who begin studying Japanese eventually quit because they view it as being too difficult. Before you continue, make sure that you are serious about learning the language, even if you are only trying to learn simplistic Japanese.;
, The Japanese writing system can be broken down into various components: Hiragana, Katakana and Kanji (collectively called Kana). Hiragana flows like the cursive letters that we use in the English language, each character represents a single syllable(ex. あひの). Katakana represents the same syllables as Hiragana, but the characters are more straight, much like manuscript in English (ex. アヒノ). Katakana characters are only used to represent ""foreign words"", or words that are borrowed from other languages. Kanji, probably the most difficult of the writing system to master, are ideographs, symbols that represent ideas. Each kanji character may posses more than one meaning or pronunciation, so it is important to memorize the characters if you plan to become fluent in Japanese.

, An iPod is a great way to learn Japanese when on the move. Inexpensive index cards are also an indispensable tool.

, Children's books are a great way to get started with learning Japanese. Japanese audio CD's will help you to observe the speaking patterns of native Japanese people, and eventually adopt their accent if you are capable of doing so (and they can be loaded to your iPod. Japanese Podcasts are also a good way to learn.) Also, take advantage of the wealth of free resources that you can find on the internet.

, There are many Japanese natives who wish to become fluent in another language. Having them help you out every so often will help them too.

, At first, you may feel funny speaking Japanese, but that feeling will eventually dissolve. Be sure to take into consideration that depending on who you learned from, you may speak Japanese differently. Try not to make the mistake of adopting the speaking patterns of a gender that you do not wish to represent.

, Japanese people are usually very kind to foreigners, but speaking more like them is a sign that you respect their language and were willing to learn to properly speak it.

, Small marker boards are great for practicing Kana.

, Learning the language in your spare time can be sometimes more rewarding and effective than formal classes.

, Forgetting things that you swear you learned is completely normal, you may just need to reinforce those specific topics.

Strengthen your grasp on the writing systems.,
Talk to someone online.,
Use flashcards.,
Use online resources.",How to Learn Japanese on Your Own2," If reading and writing is important to your understanding of Japanese, it is crucial to spend time studying all four of the Japanese written systems. Hiragana and katakana can be learned in as little as a few weeks, and you can use them to write anything you want in Japanese. Kanji will take much longer to learn, but it is also important. Begin practicing Kanji as well.


A good workbook is a great way to begin practicing your reading and writing.
You may also want to try online resources, like Duolingo.

, A fun option for practicing Japanese is to video-chat with a native speaker. Look for online resources that pair language partners together. If you find someone who is a good fit, begin practicing with them 1-2 times per week.Look into My Language Exchangeor The Mixxerto locate an online language partner.

, Purchase Japanese language flashcards, or make them yourself at home. You can purchase (or make) flashcards for each language system, to study specific phrases, and to memorize grammar fundamentals.

When you try to read in Japanese, you expose yourself to new words while strengthening your skills and encountering Japanese culture., Another fun way to expose yourself to Japanese is to watch Japanese movies. Movies can expose you to a wider range of terms (including slang) and provide some entertainment. You can even use English subtitles to help you understand the plot., Just like movies, listening to Japanese radio can be a good way to hear new words and sharpen your listening skills. Look for Japanese music with lyrics, or Japanese talk radio., If you have the opportunity to experience an immersion in the Japanese language, take it!

Say ""Hajimemashite."",
Choose your greeting according to the time.,
Introduce yourself.,
Say ""Yoroshiku onegaishimasu,"" to end your initial introduction.",How to Introduce Yourself in Japanese1," This translates to ""Nice to meet you,"" or to something similar to ""Let's begin a friendship."" Pronounce it (ha-she Exchanging a ""Hajimemashite"" is usually the first step to introducing yourself in Japanese. ""Hajimemashite"" is a conjugation of ""hajimeru,"" which is a verb meaning ""to begin""., It is acceptable, though less common, to substitute these greetings for a ""Hajimemashite."" In Japanese, there are three basic ways to say hello: ohayou, konnichiwa, and konbanwa. Much like English-speakers say, ""Good morning,"" ""Good day,"" and ""Good evening,"" the Japanese use different greetings to distinguish each time of day.



""Ohayou"" (pronounced just like ""Ohio"") means ""good morning"" and is used pretty much anytime before noon. To make it more polite, say ""ohayou gozaimasu"" (go-zah-ee-MAHS).

""Konnichiwa"" (KO-nee-chee-wah) means ""good afternoon"" and is also a standard hello. It can be used between noon and about 5 PM.""Konbanwa"" (kon-BAHN-wah) means ""good evening,"" and is used between 5 PM and midnight. If you want to mix things up, you can say the Japanese equivalent of ""Greetings,"" which is aisatsu (AH-ee-saht-soo).

, The most common and simple way to introduce yourself in Japanese is the phrase ""Watashi no namae wa ___ desu."" (wah-TAH-shee no nah-MAH-eh wah ___ dess). It means ""My name is ___."" If you're using your full name, say your surname first.For example: ""Watashi no namae wa Miyazaki Hayao desu,"" means ""My name is Hayao Miyazaki.""
Bear in mind that Japanese people rarely use ""watashi"" in conversation. When introducing yourself, you can omit the ""watashi wa"" if you're comfortable trying to sound like a local. ""Anata,"" which means ""you,"" is similarly avoided.Thus, you can simply say ""Joe desu,"" to tell someone that your name is Joe.

, Pronounce it (yor-OH-she-koo oh-nay-guy-ee-shee-mass). This translates roughly to ""Please be nice to me."" It may not be common to say something like this in English, but it is a very important phrase to remember when introducing yourself to native Japanese speakers. This is usually the last phrase that Japanese people use when they introduce themselves.For a more casual form, you can just say ""Yoroshiku."" In almost all cases, however, you should err on the side of the more formal, more polite form.
If you're introducing yourself casually to a young person of similar social standing, you can omit almost all of the extra words. Simply say, ""Joe desu. Yoroshiku,"" to mean ""I'm Joe. Nice to meet you."""

A bit of ""foreign"" tone makes you sound interesting, and are what set you apart from a silly foreigner trying to speak Chinese and a fluent Chinese speaker.;
, ""Ni Hao"" literally translates into ""You Good"" and can be a very generic greeting term. It is pronounced like ""nee how"". You can say it when you shake hands with your Chinese friends, when you walk by them in the hallway, when you sit down next to a new friend at dinner, etc.etc. It can be loosely used in all situations where you may say ""hi"" or ""hello"" in American English.

, ""Xie Xie"" means ""Thank you"". It is pronounced like ""Shi-e Shi-e"" or ""Zhi-Zhi""(if that is not too confusing). It can be used whenever you want to say thank you to someone.

, ""Bu Ke Qi"" means ""You're welcome"". It is pronounced like ""Boo Ker(British accent without the ""r"") Chi"".

, ""Tai Hao Le!"" means ""Wonderful!"". It is pronounced like ""Thai Hao Lah"". This can be applied to many situations as you may suspect, such as someone agreeing to see you again, someone giving you a business card, etc..

, ""Na Li Na Li"" is a standard response to any compliment, including compliments to your spouse. Do not say ""Xie Xie"" (Thank you) when you receive compliments. It is not the Chinese way. Instead, say ""Na Li Na Li"" (pronounced as ""Nah Lee Nah Lee"").

, Ask your Chinese friend ahead of time how to say your name in Chinese and practice it. Then as you shake hands with your Chinese host/hostess/guests, say ""Wo Jiao. ""Wo Jiao"" means ""My name is"". For instance, you say ""Wuo Jiao John"" but pronounce ""John"" the Chinese way which actually sounds like ""Yue Hahn"". You can also say ""Wuo de ming zi shi , which also means ""my name is.""

, Except for ""Na Li Na Li"" which is already a repetitive phrase, everything above can be said twice to make you really sound like a native. For instance, instead of saying ""Ni Hao"", say ""Ni Hao Ni Hao!"". Instead of ""Xie Xie"", say ""Xie Xie Xie Xie"" (I know it may sound crazy but trust me, this is how a native Chinese would say it.) This is done to put emphasis on the words. Say the phase a little softer the second time, and keep repeating to fade out smoothly. So here you go again: Ni Hao Ni Hao! Xie Xie Xie Xie! Bu Ke Qi Bu Ke Qi! Tai Hao Le Tai Hao Le!

, when opening a speech. You may be asked to make a speech. Open the speech by saying ""Da Jia Hao!"" which can be loosely translated into ""How's everyone today?"", ""Hello everyone!"", """"Wish everyone well!"", or ""Good day, everyone!""

, Chances are you have a translator or your Chinese friends speak English. Even then, try to use a Chinese phrase before you move on to talking normally in English. This will really differentiate you from any other foreigners they meet and leave them very good impressions.

Use flashcards.,
Take your first word.,
Flip the flashcard.,
Start practicing.",How to Learn Japanese Words1," Making flashcards is a very effective way to learn words. While you are writing down the words you are already learning them. It gives you also a possibility to see how the words are written. For this method you need:


2 pens/pencils in different colours
Flashcards;
, Write the translation with 1 colour on one side of the flashcard. Advantageous a dark colour like blue or black.

, Take a bright colour like red, pink or orange. This will help you to remember the word because the translation will be in a dark colour. With this difference our brain is more likely to remember the word.Write down the word in Hiragana or Katakana. While you write it down you should say it out loud for several times. When you`ve finished, put the card away and try to say it again by heart. Then continue with the next word.

, Go through the flashcard stack. If you know the word, put it on the ""I know it"" stack. If you got it right but you needed a lot of time, you should put it on the ""Still need a bit of practice"" stack. If you got it wrong, put it on the ""I didn't know"" stack.The most effective way to study words with flashcards is to repeat them several times in a day for about 5-10 minutes. You can study when:


You`re waiting for the bus
You`re watching TV and they are showing advertising
You`re having a break at school or work
You`re cooking and waiting for your meal do be done

Say ""xiè xie.,
Use ""nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ"" when given a compliment.This phrase translates roughly into “where, where!”


The Chinese culture values humility, and saying “thank you” in response to a compliment can come off as being a little arrogant.,
Try ""bù, bù, bù"" for compliments, as well.",How to Say Thank You in Chinese1,"""This is the most common way to say ""Thanks"" in Chinese, especially in Mandarin Chinese.


Mandarin Chinese is spoken across most of northern and southwestern China. It has more native speakers than other forms of Chinese.

Xie does not translate directly into English, but when spoken as xiè xie, it means ""Thanks"" and ""'xiè xie nǐ"" means ""Thank you.""
A rough pronunciation of xiè xie is syeh-syeh. The first xiè starts high and drops by the end. The second xie is a neutral tone, meaning it is said lightly and without any emphasis.
In simplified Chinese characters, xiè xie is 谢谢. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 謝謝。
Other ""thank you"" sayings involving xie xie include ""xiè xiè nín de bāng zhù,"" (谢 谢 您 的 帮 助) a formal way of saying ""thanks for your help,"" and ""xiè xiè nǐ bāng wǒ,"" (谢谢 你 帮 我) a casual way of saying ""Thanks for your help.;
, By saying “where, where,” you are essentially deflecting the compliment. Within the U.S. culture, it would be similar to saying “shucks.”
A rough pronunciation of this response would be na-ha-lee na-ha-lee.

In simplified Chinese characters, this response is written as 哪里哪里. In traditional Chinese characters, it would be 哪裡哪裡.

, As with nǎlǐ, nǎlǐ, responding with bù, bù, bù is a way to politely deflect compliments.


This response is similar to saying ""no, no, no"" in English.
The number of times you say ""bù"" can vary depending on how strong your denial needs to be. The greater the compliment, the stronger the denial.
A rough pronunciation of bù, bù, bù would be bhoo bhoo bhoo.
Write bù in Chinese as 不.

Learn the intonations.,
The word for ""I miss you"" is written ""我想你"" Pronounced: Wo Shiang ni

,
The word ""I"" is ""Wo"" and it is the third intonation.

,
The word ""miss"", which is pronounced ""shiang"" is also the third intonation.,
The word ""you"" is ""ni"" is again, the third intonation.

,
Learn four ways to say ""I miss you"" in Chinese.",How to Say I Miss You in Chinese," First of all, you must know that there are 4 intonations in Mandarin Chinese. (There are actually 5, but the last one is not used that often).


The first one sounds flat like when you sing ""la~"".
The second one sounds like going up, like asking something. For example, ""How are you?"" ""I'm fine, and you?"" The second ""you"" sounds like the second intonation for Mandarin.
The third one goes down then up. For example, ""He-eh?"" The first syllable goes down, the second comes up.
The fourth one goes straight down. For example, ""Hey!"" ""Stop!"";
,,, But since the following word is also going to be in the third intonation, it is often spoken as the second one.

,,


I love you 我爱你 wǒ ài nǐ
I like you 我喜欢你 wǒ xǐ huān nǐ
I miss you 我想你 wǒ xiǎng nǐ
I need you 我需要你 wǒ xū yào nǐ

Explain more about yourself.,
Start with a polite icebreaker.,
Respond.,
Know how to apologize.",How to Introduce Yourself in Japanese2," You can use the ""Watashi wa ___ desu"" form to share other qualities, like age, nationality, or profession. ""Watashi wa Amerikajin desu,"" (wah-TAH-shee wah a-mer-i-cah-shin dress) means ""I am American."" ""Watashi wa juugosai desu,"" (wah-TAH-shee wah ju-u-go-sigh dress) means ""I am fifteen years old.""

, The Japanese equivalent of ""How are you?"" is ""Ogenki desu ka?"" (oh-GEN-kee dess kah). However, this is an actual inquiry into the person's health. If you'd rather avoid a response, say ""Otenki wa ii desu ne?"" (oh-TEN-kee wah EE dess neh), which means ""The weather's nice, isn't it?""

, If you said ""Ogenki desu ka,"" be ready to respond to their reply. When you ask this question, the person will most likely respond either ""Genki desu,"" (GEN-kee dess) or ""Maamaa desu"" (MAH-MAH dess). The former means ""I'm fine,"" and the latter means ""I'm so-so."" Either way: they will then ask you ""Anata wa?"" (ah-NAH-tah wah), which means ""And you?"" When they say this, you can respond ""Genki desu, arigatou,"" (GEN-kee dess, ah-ree-GAH-to), which means ""I'm fine, thank you.""


You could also replace ""arigatou"" with ""okagesama de"" (oh-KAH-geh-sah-mah deh) which means basically the same thing.

, If there's ever a time when you don't know what to say (or don't know what the person just said) don't be afraid to apologize and say so. You can do this in English, if you must, and use apologetic body language, but it wouldn't hurt to learn how to say sorry in Japanese. If need be, say ""gomen nasai""（ごめんなさい）(goh-mehn nah-SAH-ee), which means ""I'm sorry.""

Say ""doh je"" for a gift.,
Use ""m goi"" for service.",How to Say Thank You in Chinese2," This is the standard way of saying “thank you” in Cantonese.Cantonese is spoken mainly within southern China. Outside of mainland China, it is spoken by most people living in Hong Kong and Macau. It is also spoken within many overseas Chinese communities in Southeast Asia, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Cuba, Panama, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the United States.
Even though this is the most common way of saying “thanks” in Cantonese, it is almost always used in response to thanking for someone for a tangible gift. Thanking someone for a favor requires a different term.
In native Chinese characters, spell the response out as 多謝.
A rough pronunciation of do jeh is daw-dyeh.
If you are thanking someone for a gift in advance, say ""doh je sin” instead of “doh je.”

, If someone performed a service or favor for you, this would be the correct way of thanking him or her in Cantonese.


This response would not usually be used when thanking someone for a physical gift. It is generally used for services. For instance, you would say “m goi” to a server at a restaurant after he or she refills your glass but not as a response to a birthday present.
Using Chinese characters, m goi is written as 唔該.
A rough pronunciation of m goi is mm gai. The mm is said in a fairly neutral tone, while the goi or gai rises toward the end.

This phrase is pronounced ""knee chill-uh mah."" The final syllable rhymes with ""raw."" The ""chill-uh"" is pronounced at a slightly higher tone than the other two syllables, like this: ""kneechill-uhmah."" This isn't pronounced like a question in English — it doesn't ""go up"" at the end.

In Chinese, this word is written ""喂.""

In Chinese, this phrase is written ""去哪儿.""


, This is the sort of greeting you'd use when you're meeting an old friend you haven't seen in a long time. It comes across as very warm and affectionate.This phrase is pronounced ""how jyoo boo-jyin."" The ""jy"" sounds are tricky — it's almost like there's a very short ""ee"" sound in the second and fourth syllables. Again, the n sound at the end of the phrase is very delicate.

The phrase for saying ""I love you"" in Chinese, in pinyin, is ""wo ai ni"" or 我爱你 in calligraphy.,
The third tone in wo means that the sound is pronounced with the tone first going down, then up.,
The fourth tone just goes down and doesn't come back up, unlike the third tone, so ai should be pronounced like you're slashing a knife downwards.,
Ni is, again, the third tone so the sound should go up and down like for wo.

,
Practice stringing these syllables together to get the phrase ""I love you.""",How to Say Love in Chinese," If you already speak Chinese, then it shouldn't be too hard to pronounce the phrase correctly. Wo is the third tone, ai is the fourth tone, and ni is of the third tone. Tones represent how the word is spoken and are very important; if the tone is wrong, what you say can become a completely different word! It's like homophones, except with an extremely subtle difference.;
, Imagine a rollercoaster ride and you're going down a dip, then coming back up again. That's how wo should be pronounced, going down, then up.

, It should be somewhat sharp, but don't cut it too short; remember the tone needs to be clear so we know which word you're saying.

,, Wo is I, ai is love and ni is you. You can look up sound clips on the internet if you're unsure of your pronunciation, and be sure to practice it until it flows comfortably from you. You don't want to sound jerky and amateurish when you say it, or it'll lose its special exoticness. It's a special phrase, so learn it well before you use it!

Use ""zǎo shang hǎo"" or just ""zǎo"" for ""good morning."",
Use ""xià wǔ hǎo"" for ""good afternoon."",
Use ""wǎn shàng hǎo"" to say ""good evening.,
Use ""wǎn'ān"" to say ""good night.""",How to Say Hi in Chinese2," This chipper phrase is a great way to start your day. It's appropriate for use up until the early afternoon. Just like in English, you can say the whole phrase for ""good morning"" or use the shortened form, ""zǎo,"" for ""morning!""


This phrase is pronounced roughly ""tzow shong how."" The first and last syllables rhyme with ""plow."" The middle syllable rhymes with ""wrong."" If you just want to say ""zǎo,"" be sure to emphasize the slight t sound at the beginning of the word. The pronunciation is ""tzow,"" not ""zow.""
In Chinese, this phrase is written ""早上好.""


, From about noon until the sun starts going down, you can use this cheerful phrase.This phrase is pronounced ""Shah-oo how."" The first syllable rhymes with ""raw."" The tones of the syllables descends, like this: ""shahoohow.""
In Chinese, this phrase is written ""下午好.""

Note that ""xià wǔ hǎo"" is seldom used in Taiwan — there, ""wǔ'ān"" (""午安"") is more common. ""Wǔ'ān"" is pronounced ""ooh-on."" The ""on"" is said higher-pitched than the ""ooh,"" like this: ""oohon.""

,""This phrase is appropriate during very late afternoon and the twilight hours.


This phrase is pronounced ""wun-shong how."" The first syllable rhymes with ""ton."" The n in this syllable is very light — almost silent. Emphasize the second syllable by putting extra stress on it, like this: ""wunSHONGhow.""
In Chinese, this phrase is written ""晚上好.""


, Use this phrase to great someone when it's dark out. Alternatively, use it when you're going to bed for the night.


This phrase is pronounced ""wun-on."" Here, again, the second syllable receives the stress and is pronounced in a higher tone, like this: ""wunON.""
In Chinese, this phrase is written ""晚安.""


"
"
Use ""nǐ hǎo"" as a standard greeting.,
Use ""nǐn hǎo"" as a more formal greeting.,
Use ""nǐmén hǎo"" to address a group of people.",How to Say Hi in Chinese3," This is the ""classic"" greeting that most English-speakers learn as their very first way to say hello in Chinese. There's nothing wrong with this greeting per se, but it's not one that's common among actual Chinese people. Some claim that this sounds a little ""stiff"" or unnatural — a little like how a greeting like ""Hi, how are you doing?"" would sound in English.The approximate pronunciation here is ""knee how."" The first syllable is a rising tone (it starts low and ends high), while the second is a ""dip"" tone — its pitch dips in the middle.In Chinese, this phrase is written ""你好.""


, The very slight difference in this phrase is used to give the phrase a formal tone. Be aware that, even more than ""nǐ hǎo,"" this phrase can imply a ""distance"" between the two speakers. If you use it with a friend, it can come across as rather cold and corporate.


The pronunciation is very similar to ""nǐ hǎo,"" but with a very delicate n sound at the end of the first syllable.

, Unlike in English, Chinese uses different words for when you speak to multiple people as opposed to a single person. The meaning and tone here is basically the same as for ""nǐ hǎo,"" only applied to multiple people.


This phrase is pronounced ""knee-min how."" The first syllable again is a rising tone while the last one is a ""dip"" tone.

Think long and hard as to whether this is the right decision.,
Once you have decided that home education is for you and your child, you can begin to think about how exactly you are going to go about the education.

,
Figure out how you will approach home education.,
Think about how to incorporate that with your child and his/her special needs.,
Make sure to incorporate your child's needs into the day.,
Make sure to keep education fun so that your child doesn't get too downbeat about it.,
Trust your techniques and have faith in your abilities.,
Don't worry too much if it takes a while to get into a routine.,
Make time for you.,
Enjoy learning together.,
Make sure you ask for help if needed.",How to Homeschool a Child with Special Needs," Home educating involves lots of sacrifices on the parents' part, including finances, socialising and even mental health! If you are not sure yet, the best thing to do is write up a list of the pros and cons surrounding home education and your family/situation-just because it works for someone else does not mean it is the right thing for your family. Some things to think about are:


Can I financially afford to do this? (There are many free resources out there but you will end up paying sometimes.)
Do I have the time to allocate to, what amounts to be, a full time job?
How will I find ways to wind down after a long day with my child? What can I do so that I maintain good mental health?
Is this the best thing for my child and am I doing it for the right reasons? Reasons could include religion, lack of support received at school, bullying, isolation, poor school choices among many others.;
,, There are a number of ways of doing this:



Unstructured Allow the child to pursue his/her own interests and don't worry too much about the school set work.

Structured This could be pretty close to actual school regarding having a timetable and following the curriculum, having a desk and workbooks etc. This usually works better for autistic children.
if it's affordable you could employ tutors to teach different subjects
There are many more. The best thing to do is have a Google and research which seems to suit you best. Or try them, one by one, and figure it out through trail and error.

, This will vary wildly based on the nature of their disability. If he/she has severe learning disabilities then you should have an educational plan in place which should set out the best ways for your child to learn to achieve their full potential. If your child is more able then you need to find out where exactly they are in relation to the curriculum (if you choose to follow this).


You could buy workbooks covering a range of ages or do some activities to see which they get on best with. There are plenty of printable worksheets on the web and loads of educational ideas you could easily replicate within minutes.

, If he/she likes to have half an hour a day to be alone and take some quiet time, make sure they get that. They don't need the extra stress to deal with when so much has already changed (this only applies if they have been taken out of school).


If you see the signs of a meltdown, just take a step back, tone down the education for a while and deal with it in the usual way. Education shouldn't come before your child's needs.

, You don't want it to be a negative thing. Also ensure that they get lots of time outside in the fresh air, as well as taking him/her to play groups/museums to stimulate their mind and allow them time to 'let go'.

, You don't need to be a qualified teacher to educate your child. You have parented your child this far and taught him/her everything they know; just add in a few educational games, some workbooks and a few outings and carry on as normal.

, This is new territory and it could be a difficult adjustment for you and your child. Give it time, try to have fun, relax and it will get easier.

, Home educating is a full time job and can come with a lot stress. You need to make time for you to ensure you are on top form for this important job. The little guy won't be thanking you if you are tired, snappy or grouchy.

, You already have a special bond with your child-you found it during pregnancy or birth; there is another special bond to be had through teaching your little guy. Don't ruin it by being too hard on the little one. One of the great aspects of home educating is that you don't have to stick to any certain timetables or expect them to hit milestones at exactly the right time. If they take a little while to learn algebra, its okay as they make up for it in another subject that they are really good at. Allow your child to go at their own pace. Don't place pressure on your child and stop worrying!

, This doesn't mean you have failed in any way. There are lots of online groups, helpful websites and plenty of meet ups. You can find phone numbers on the web relating to home education; give them a ring and they are more than happy to give you advice.

Assess each student’s strengths and areas for improvement.,
Vary the pace of instruction.,
Try inquiry-based learning.,
Assign homework and classroom activities based on ability.,
Evaluate and reward students based on individualized progress.",How to Differentiate Instruction1," In order to effectively differentiate instruction, you need to have a strong knowledge of each student’s current abilities and capacities. Create learning profiles by tracking each individual’s aptitude and progress in basic subjects like reading, writing, speaking, thinking, and problem solving.It helps to review students’ files in advance to get an idea of what you can expect in your classroom.
Teaching assistants can often help with these assessments since they have frequent one-on-one interactions with students.
Your assessments should be ongoing, so that you can adjust your approach to a particular student in line with their emerging needs and demonstrated progress.;
, Students learn at varying rates, with some grasping the material immediately and others requiring content repetition. The brain needs some degree of challenge to stay stimulated, and new skills are better grasped when an associated activity is not too easy or too difficult. Assess the learning speed of each student so that you can tailor your instruction according to the different paces present in your classroom.Increase the amount and depth of the workload for advanced students. Moving too slowly creates boredom and serves only as a trying review for advanced students.
Allow slower learners to take more time with in-class assignments. Frustration with a fast pace inhibits learning and leads to a lack of focus for slower learners.
Use teaching tools, such as interactive instructional software and workbooks, to allow students to learn at their own pace.

, When you practice inquiry-based teaching, you start with a question or problem instead of giving your students established facts through lectures or presentations. This is a useful approach for differentiated instruction because each student can conduct the inquiry process at their own speed while you circulate and help to move each one forward from where they’re at.In the case of a science lesson, you might opt to have students conduct individual lab investigations in lieu of of a full-class demonstration.
For instance, if you’d like for students to learn about physical forces, you could start with a simple question that has everyday relevance like: how can you move a heavy object from point A to point B?

, This means creating flexible tiers when it comes to course content and assignments. For instance, if you’re teaching English, you might assign different levels of reader differing amounts or types of reading in accordance with their comfort levels. You might ask some students to write a paragraph in response while you ask others to produce a full book report or creative project related to the reading.Provide step-by-step instructions to slower learners. Repeat information when necessary. Place fewer demands on slower learners, allowing them to answer fewer questions and spend more time on each task.
Model tasks and provide examples for the average learner. Encourage average learners to engage in independent work.
Challenge advanced students. Assign more complicated tasks, and encourage advanced students to study the content in greater depth.

, Avoid highlighting the gifted students repeatedly or exclusively. Celebrate the degree of effort and amount of progress exerted by each student.Create rubrics that evaluate students according to their individual progress rather than on a curve in relationship to other students.
A slow learner who painstakingly masters a difficult skill should be rewarded. A gifted student who learns the skill in just a few seconds should be highlighted only when they exceed expectations.

"
"
Adapt your lessons to meet the language needs of students.,
Celebrate diversity.,
Make each lesson appeal to multiple senses.",How to Differentiate Instruction2," Students for whom the language of instruction is not their native tongue may learn at a slower speed or feel alienated in the integrated classroom. Incorporate them into the classroom by providing bilingual activities and targeted teaching support to address their needs.For instance, assign a teaching assistant to work with non-native speakers during reading lessons.

, Modern classrooms tend to have heterogeneous student bodies, so it’s important that everyone feels included in learning. Make a point of communicating the value of diversity by incorporating lessons that explore multiple cultural perspectives.This could be as simple as reading texts whose authors come from multiple countries or involve more in-depth projects like asking students to investigate and share how education is conducted in various countries.
You can also tap the diverse cultural knowledge that exists within your classroom by asking students to share a story, recipe, or tradition from their family.
Be sure that you consistently offer lessons that engage multiple cultural perspectives. It should not be confined to a single multi-cultural day.

, Some students’ cognition is linked to specific senses that need to be activated in order to maximize their learning. Be sure that your lessons incorporate as many senses as possible, especially sight, hearing, and touch or movement.For example, if you’re teaching vocabulary, you should present each word orally and visually. You might also include a related picture, song, and/or hands-on game to reinforce the word and its definition.
The most common learning styles are visual, auditory, and kinesthetic, which are focused on sight, sound, and movement respectively."
"
Foster student ownership.,
Give students multiple options for assignments.,
Appeal to students' personal interests.",How to Differentiate Instruction3," Students will feel a greater investment in their education if they have some control over the content and evaluation of their learning. This is also a great strategy for differentiation in the classroom since it gives students some of the responsibility for setting their individual agenda.A good way to promote shared ownership in the classroom is to have students help set their own learning goals and offer input on the rubrics you use to evaluate them.
Another way is to provide students with open-ended activities and projects that allow the most room for pursuing individual creativity, initiative, and passions.

, Offer more than one prompt for each assignment and allow students to pursue to the one that speaks to them most. Be sure to include at least one option that provides full, in-depth instructions for students who prefer established criteria and at least one that is more open-ended for students who’d like to pursue their own visions.It’s also good to provide options that appeal to various types of learners. For instance, visual learners might prefer creating a graphic representation of a story while word learners may favor a traditional book report.

, Tapping into students’ established interests can accelerate the learning process and lead to greater information retention. Taking interest surveys that ask individuals to communicate their favorite subjects, activities, and hobbies is a great way to know that you’re appealing to the things that already excite their attention.When teaching math, for example, use word problems that connect students to real world experiences, like adding up football scores or understanding ratios through slices of cake.
Assign writing exercises that ask students to connect course material to with their personal lives, challenges, and/or hobbies.
When doing group work, consider grouping students by shared interests, so that they form immediate connections.

Seat them to minimize distractions.,
Plan ahead and organize.,
Keep your advice positive, not negative.,
Use recognition to encourage good behavior.,
Take misbehavior seriously.,
Make fidget toys available.,
Have ADHD students sit in a comfortable seat.,
Get time for physical movement.,
Coordinate with parents.,
Ask probing questions, and let students think.,
Help students correct their own mistakes.,
Use cooperative learning strategies.,
Use assistive technology.,
Be patient.,
Use visual methods.,
Have them use a Tracker when they Read.,
Have them write things down.,
Have them use an Accordion Folder.",How to Help Students with ADHD," Students with ADHD should ideally be seated away from the windows and doors to help them remain attentive in class. These students are best placed in the front row, where they can get the maximum attention from teachers., Draft a schedule or a worksheet and divide the activities so that the child knows how much is done, and what is left. This will assist the child in becoming more organized in the classroom.

, Using negative remarks to comment on a student's inability to understand and complete a task can be very demotivating. It is vital that you explain the mistakes to them in a constructive way and let them redo the assignment.

, Recognition is the key. This will help them gain a lot of self confidence and self-esteem. Rewards and compliments are two simple ways to go about this.

, An ADHD student's misbehavior must not go unchecked. If the child misbehaves, steals someone's pencil, etc. you should not just let it slide lightly. Talk to the child immediately and make them understand why their behavior was unacceptable. This will help them learn and give them reasons to avoid it in the future.

, This may not be a requirement for every ADHD student, but using items such as stress balls, rubber bands, clips, pennies or even simple items to for them to fidget with is likely to help ADHD students concentrate, remain calm and help them with hyperactivity. Keep in mind that children who have ADHD tend to fidget a lot, due to lack of impulse control.

, Students with ADHD find regular classroom chairs boring, uncomfortable and hard to sit in for a long time. Have ADHD students sit on something such as a large exercise ball, a chair with thick and soft cushion, a comfortable rolling chair or special chairs that move and are comfortable that are school approved. It is likely that these comfortable things to sit on will help ADHD students focus, concentrate, remain calm and help them with hyperactivity, Students with ADHD may have trouble sitting still. As teachers, you can make a timetable of physical activities to help them cope better. For instance, you could allow them to take quick stretch breaks or go for a 2-minute walk out in the open to get some fresh air.

, It must be understood that education does not stop at school. Keeping in touch with parents of ADHD children will help you enhance the overall learning process and make amends wherever necessary.

, Ask questions after giving students sufficient time to work out the answer to a question. Count to at least 15 seconds before calling on another student for the answer. Keep in mind though that you should try not to ask deliberately difficult questions in front of the entire class. Not being able to answer correctly might result in embarrassment and frustration for ADHD students.

, Facilitate the learning process by describing how students can correct their own mistakes. For instance, remind them to recheck their calculations in math problems or go through their English essays again to make sure there are no common spelling errors.

, Divide students into small groups and then assign tasks. Use methods such as Think-Pair-Share, where students are asked to think of a topic, pair up with a fellow student and discuss it.

, All students, particularly those with ADHD, can benefit from the use of assistive technology in the classroom. Computers, projectors and screens make the learning process more interactive and easier to follow. Let them also work with computers because most ADHD students find it more fun to work on assignments or homework on computers and will most likely help them focus and improve their learning. ADHD students tend to think regular work on paper/worksheets is boring.

, This is extremely important when dealing with students with ADHD. They will test your patience by asking you to repeat instructions over and over again. Understand that they are forgetful, and expect you to forgive them for disrupting the classroom decorum at times, etc. Do not overlook their behavior entirely but deal with them patiently.

, Using charts, diagrams and color coded text would be more helpful and make learning easier and more fun for them. ADHD students find plain text in black and white boring and monotonous. People with ADHD do best with visual and kinesthetic learning but find auditory learning hard and boring.

, Having them use a tracker when they read will help them follow along when they read. They will get lost without a tracker., People with ADHD tend to be forgetful and having them write things down they need to do will help them remember so they can check it., Having them keep their assignments and papers in an accordion file folder with pockets will help them stay organized and will help them keep track of their assignments. They get messy and disorganized if they use a regular binder or folder and they end up losing things"
"
Create varied lesson plans.,
Play with the process.,
Aim for different products.",How to Differentiate Instruction in Mixed Ability Classrooms1," Look up state and national requirements for the curriculum you are teaching and identify the skills that your students should master. Keeping student assessment levels in mind, assign projects that use different skills and mediums (e.g. research papers, oral reports, slideshow presentations) to keep kids with different learning styles interested and engaged. Give students the option to add content and resources to their studies to enhance their learning.For instance, identify some current pop culture narratives that reflect one of the main themes in your course (e.g. Twitter and other social media with regards to the study of rhetoric) and encourage students to observe them mindfully to add context to their lessons.;
, To differentiate learning with regard to procedure, try alternating the process of how students learn. Learning styles and preference vary greatly, and a fresh take on old course material can reinvigorate a student's desire and aptitude to learn. For instance, cover one chapter of a textbook by lecturing on the topic, then cover the next chapter by initiating a group discussion about the assigned reading.As another example, if you are teaching 20th century history, lecture one day, then have students visit online archives to look for relevant pictures and documents the next day. To further engage creative students, have them write a fictional story about the historical period covered in that week's lesson using accurate historical information.

, In a classroom setting, products refer to the tangible results of a student’s understanding of course material. Vary the products that students put together by giving them choices that will let them work with their unique competencies and interests. Some examples of products are:Tests
Written reports
Oral presentations
Performances (e.g. skits)

"
"
Establish “anchor activities”.,
Prepare students to help themselves.,
Encourage feedback and discussion.",How to Differentiate Instruction in Mixed Ability Classrooms2," In a mixed ability classroom, it is inevitable that more advanced students will sometimes complete their assignments earlier than their peers. As a classroom rule, establish acceptable activities for students to work on after completing their assigned tasks. These “anchor activities"" could include:Reading
Practicing academic skills (e.g. vocabulary or timetables)
Journal writing

, Provide various options to your class for alternative ways to get help with assignments when you are indisposed or unable to assist. Encourage peer-to-peer consultations, whereby classmates can provide instruction, help to problem-solve, or proofread work for a fellow student who is struggling. In addition, suggest “thinking on paper”- a strategy whereby students brainstorm ideas and work through problems on paper to try to get their minds “unstuck”., Encourage “metacognition” in your classroom– i.e., get students to think about and discuss their learning process. Initiate classroom discussions with your students about how they think they learn best, what types of projects they feel most confident doing, and what they find most challenging in their school lives. Have students brainstorm solutions for different learning issues (e.g. making speeches or oral presentations more comfortable by sitting or standing in a circle and using visual aids)."
"
Give content reinforcement assignments.,
Assign a more complex project for advanced students.,
Be discreet.",How to Differentiate Instruction in Mixed Ability Classrooms3," Have students who are struggling to grasp course material do a project that helps build their fundamental knowledge of a topic. The scope of the assignment should not extend beyond the lesson or build on it. Instead, the work should reinforce the basic tenets of a subject and boost a student's confidence in their own understanding.For instance, if a grade school student is struggling with fractions, give them recipes to divide or multiply the quantities for. This assignment will not introduce new material, but it will allow the student to think about fractions in a practical, real-world way.

, Students who have grasped the course material can express their knowledge with more intricate projects and presentations than their other classmates. This will allow them to expand their knowledge of the curriculum into broader themes and contexts. Material can expand beyond the basic outline of what students should learn about a subject.For instance, while other students complete a basic report about the novel “Anna Karenina”, an advanced student can write a report comparing the book to Tolstoy’s first work, “War and Peace”.

, Tiered assignments can hurt student morale if the materials, expectations, and objectives are too disparate. Offset this by telling students that you're aiming to have a variety of unique projects for students to share with each other. Be sure to outline assignments that are equally interesting, and convey equal levels of enthusiasm and excitement about them."
"
Assess student knowledge.,
Plan a lesson for knowledge that is lacking.,
Plan for advanced learning during free time.",How to Differentiate Instruction in Mixed Ability Classrooms4," Assess a student’s level of understanding of a given subject by evaluating the level of competency that they demonstrate over several situations. Methods of determining comprehension include one-on-one instruction, pop quizzes, participation in class discussions, and written or oral reports. Based on these results, gauge and record what content a student still needs to master., Based on your understanding of what a student has absorbed from the material taught, plan a specific, personalized learning plan with the goal of providing the knowledge that they are lacking. This plan should exclude the content that the student has already mastered, and be tailored specifically to their weaknesses. Write out this plan and share it with the student so that they clearly understand their learning goals.For example, if a student shows an overall improvement in math but still struggles consistently with assignments and test questions dealing with the Pythagorean Theorum, make a lesson plan focusing on that concept.

, Knowing what a child has already learned and anticipating free time, make a specific plan for accelerated studies of the subject at hand. This plan should be established beforehand to minimize distractions for other students. For instance, if a student has mastered a theory and lab experiment in Chemistry class, have them move on to a second experiment to expand on the theory."
"
Establishing group choices.,
Offer flexibility and choice of resources.,
Look for mentors for shared interests.",How to Differentiate Instruction in Mixed Ability Classrooms5," Allowing students to work within an interest group gives them the advantage of building and furthering knowledge within the scope of their preferred focus. Hold a brainstorming discussion in class where students can propose ideas, and where you can gauge the range of common interests in the peer group. Following the discussion, used the ideas gathered to form specific group for students to join.For instance, if a history class is focusing on the 1960s, have students discuss historical developments of the period that interest them the most and form groups for the suggestions that resonated with multiple students (e.g. the Vietnam war, civil rights movements, women’s rights movements, the moon landing).

, In the spirit of collaboration and investigative learning, provide students with enough flexibility to use a wide range of resources for their group projects. For instance, let students use traditional library research or internet sources, but encourage creative ideas like interviewing sources and searching for historical records or documents. For instance, a project on the subway system could include traditional research as well as an interview with a conductor., Having specific focus groups will allow you to give special attention to certain areas of course content and provide advanced instruction. Finding a mentor for students working on a particular theme can enrich their study of the material and provide them with additional perspective about it. For instance, invite a former student who also took a special interest in a topic to speak to an interest group working on a similar project."

, A big part of being a successful special education teacher is keeping organized. You may be required to teach multiple children and will need to keep track of what you are working on with each of them. Scheduling, time management, and personal organization will all help you to succeed in your career as a special education teacher., Working with disabled children will require you to easily understand a child's needs. Many of the children you work with will likely have difficulty expressing their needs and may also have a tough time understanding your own needs of them. Being able to intuitively connect with your students will be a critical skill., You may not always use technology directly when working with the students. However, other tasks such as sending emails, entering data, or working with educational software will all require you to stay current with your technological skills. If you aren't up-to-date in this area, brushing up on what technology is currently used by special education teachers can be a good idea., Most of your work as a special education teacher will involve directly working with children who have mild to moderate disabilities. Because of this, you will need to be a good mentor, teacher, and coach to help your students understand whatever it might be that you are working on., Being a special education teacher can present its own unique challenges. These challenges can lead to feeling frustrated, stuck, or otherwise upset. It's important to have a good sense of humor when considering a career as a special education teacher.. Having a good sense of humor can also help to reduce stress and keep things on track., It's likely that not everything will go according to your plans as a special education teacher. You'll need to be ready to adapt and stay flexible in the event that something isn't working out like you had hoped it would. Don't be afraid to change your approach with a student if something isn't working. Always keep an eye out for what's working and don't be afraid to deviate from a lesson plan if needed., Since working as a special education teacher involves working directly with children, you should have a passion for this aspect of the career. You'll want to have a real passion for helping children with disabilities learn, grow, and become empowered. If you think you have this desire to help children, you might consider a career as a special education teacher., Knowing what kind of environment you can expect to work in can help you get a better understanding of the career. In the case of special education teachers, many work with public schools, working with students in nearly every age group. Special education teachers may also work in private schools or other institutions. Since most schools are not in session over the summer break, many special education teachers will work ten months out of the year., Before you pursue a career as a special education teacher, it can be helpful to know what you can expect in regards to annual pay rate. Knowing this average pay rate can help you decide how to finance your education and if the position will meet your financial needs. Take a look in your local area to learn more about the average pay rate for special education teachers.The national average yearly income for a special education teacher in 2014 was $55,980
Average pay rate will vary depending on location and qualification.

Utilize the Multi-sensory Structured Language (MSL) approach.,
Be direct and explicit when teaching.,
Repeat yourself often.,
Use diagnostic teaching.,
Use time wisely.,
Stick to a daily routine.,
Utilize other resources.,
Consider developing an Individual Education Plan (IEP).,
Be aware of the child’s self-esteem and emotions.",How to Teach a Dyslexic Child1," While this method is the gold standard for teaching children with dyslexia, it is beneficial for all children. MSL teaches phonemic awareness, phonics, comprehension, vocabulary, accuracy and fluency, and writing and spelling. Students are encouraged to use all of their senses (touch, sight, movement, and sound) as part of the learning process. Phonemic awareness is the ability to hear, recognize, and use the individual sounds in a word.A child that can identify that the words pat'', park, and ""pump"" all start with the same sound would be demonstrating phonemic awareness.
Phonics is the relationship between letters and sounds.Knowing what sound the letter ""B"" makes or that ""ph"" makes the same sound as the letter ""f"" is an example of phonics.
You can receive MSL training and certification. The International Dyslexia Association and the Institute for Multi-sensory Education provide information about training and certification requirements.
Visual cues help individuals with dyslexia to understand written material. Use color on the blackboard or marker board. Write decimals in math problems in a different color. Grade in a color other than red, as red carries a universally negative connotation.
Write note cards. This provides something tangible for students to look at while also giving them something to hold. Having them read the note card out loud also engages their motor and auditory skills.
Make sand trays. Sand trays are simply tray-like containers that contain sand (or beans or shaving cream). Students can use these to spell words or draw pictures in the sand. This engages their sense of touch.
Incorporate fun activities into their learning time. Games and other creative activities get the dyslexic child more involved in the learning process. This makes learning more fun and rewarding, as it gives them a sense of accomplishment.
You can use music, songs, and chants to help students learn and remember rules.;
, Explicit teaching includes describing and modeling the skill, breaking down the skill into steps, providing clear instructions and feedback throughout the process, providing examples and demonstrations, clearly stating the purpose and reasoning behind the skill., and presenting the information in a logical order.This process is done until students master the skill.


You should not assume that student has any previous knowledge or understanding of the concept.
If you are using explicit teaching to teach a child about the letter ""s,"" you would begin by clearly stating what he or she will be learning that day. You would then demonstrate the sound that the letter ""s"" makes and have them repeat it back to you. You would then model different words that begin with ""s,"" and have them repeat the words out loud. You may also use songs, chants, or pictures of things that begin with the letter ""s."" You could ask them to think of some words that start with the letter ""s."" You would provide constructive feedback throughout the lesson as well., Since dyslexic children may struggle with short-term memory, it is challenging for them to remember what you say. Repeat instructions, key words, and concepts so students are more likely to remember what you say, at least long enough to write it down.When building on new skills, continue to incorporate previously learned information. Repetition will help reinforce older skills and create a connection between concepts., You should continually assess how well a student understands what is being taught. If something is not clear, the skill should be retaught. This is an ongoing process. Students with dyslexia often require more time and more intense instruction to learn a concept.If you wanted to teach children phonemic awareness, you might start by giving them some words and asking them to identify all the sounds in the words. You would note the strengths and weaknesses and then develop your lesson and teaching strategy based on the assessment.As you are teaching, you would provide correction and feedback by asking the child questions and noting any progress. You may also conduct small quiz at the end of each day to monitor progress. When you feel the child has learned the skill, you would give them the original assessment and compare the results. If the child has mastered the skill, you would move on to something more difficult. If the child did not master the skill, you would continue to teach the skill.

, Dyslexic children often struggle with focusing. Other things may distract them, or they may have a hard time listening to a long lecture or watching a lengthy video. Dyslexic children may also struggle with short-term memory, making it difficult for them to take notes or understand simple instructions.


Take your time. Do not rush through a class lecture. Give students time to copy anything written on the board. Make sure dyslexic students understand you before moving on to another section.
Incorporate short breaks regularly. A dyslexic child often struggles to sit for long periods of time. Take short breaks throughout the day to divide long lectures. You can also move from activity to activity. For example, lecture, game, back to lecture, followed by a learning activity.
Use appropriate time limits. It takes dyslexic children longer to complete assignments other students may have no problem completing. Allow dyslexic students more time to take exams and quizzes and to complete homework so they do not feel rushed.

, Schedules help dyslexic children know what to expect and what is coming up next. If possible, post your routine, using both words and images, on a classroom wall for students to refer to.Your daily routine should also include a daily review of previous information. This well help the students connect previous lessons to the lesson you are currently teaching.

, Do not feel like you are the only teacher for a dyslexic student. There are several resources available to help dyslexic children learn. Seek out other teachers, dyslexia specialists, or tutors who have experience working with dyslexic students.You should also ask the child and the parents about preferences, learning styles, and the strengths and weaknesses of the student.
Encourage peer tutoring. Peer resources and social support are probably one of the strongest resources you can offer. Students can read aloud to each other, review notes, or conduct lab experiments together.
Different forms of technology are a great way to enhance learning. Games, word processors, voice activated software, and digital voice recording can all be very useful for a child with dyslexia.

, An IEP is a comprehensive plan that identifies the educational needs of the child, provides specific recommendations, and defines specific curriculum adjustments.The IEP is a collaborative document to ensure that the school supports the needs of the student. This document will also make sure parents, teachers, counselors, and the school are on the same page.


The IEP process is long and complex, but it is worth it. If you are a parent, you should talk to someone at your child’s school about starting the process. If you are a teacher, let the parents know that you think an IEP would be helpful.

, Many children with dyslexia struggle with low self-esteem. They often feel that they are not as smart as other students, or they are perceived as being lazy or problem students.Try to be as encouraging as possible and highlight the strengths the student has as well.

Consider the person's verbal skills.,
Think about how much the person can communicate.,
Consider how frustrating communication is.,
Think about how well strangers can understand them.,
Recognize that several forms of AAC might be useful to have around.,
Use picture exchange communication systems (PECS) for young children or previously uncommunicative people.,
Use switches or buttons.,
Try communication board apps for more complex visual communication.,
Try an AAC app or device.,
Teach typing to people who know how to read and spell.,
Use facilitated communication (FC), judiciously, for confident teens or adults with motor skills issues.,
Consider Baby Sign or regular sign language.",How to Choose AAC for an Autistic Person," If an autistic person is completely nonverbal, or has significant nonverbal episodes, or if their communication isn't developed or reliable enough to be functional, then they can benefit from some form of AAC. AAC can supplement limited verbal abilities or be used as a sole means of communication.AAC may be a stepping stone to verbal speech. It helps develop many of the principles of communication and exchange in interactions, and doesn't hinder the development of natural speech.;
, Language has to be functional; saying words because you've been ""trained"" to say them after a particular stimulus isn't functional. Language needs to be a tool for communicating wants, needs, ideas, thoughts, and feelings. If an autistic person is not able to reliably communicate their thoughts, then they need AAC.

, If you or the autistic person regularly become stressed, agitated, or overwhelmed trying to communicate, then help is a good idea.


Using AAC when someone isn't verbal helps build their communication skills and get their needs met, and it can significantly reduce frustrations at not being understood; in children, this often means that AAC can help avoid meltdowns and ""tantrums"" that really stem from being misunderstood.

, Ideally, an autistic person should be able to be understood by acquaintances as well as close loved ones. If they speak with a strong disability accent or with mannerisms, then the option of AAC might be useful.

, For example, an autistic person who is usually able to type may need PECS (Picture Exchange Communication System) if they are very stressed. Abilities vary from day to day, and it is good to have several tools available.

, PECS is useful to communicate basic needs, wants, and learning concepts, and is easier to teach and learn.


At the very simplest level, the use of PECS involves the communicator handing a communication partner a card with what they want on it, like a picture of a cookie or the word ""cookie""; however, word cards can be chained together on sentence strips to form full phrases like, ""I want a cookie, please"".
The ability to add more words to the chain as the communicator builds skills makes it ideal for newer communicators. PECS can be a useful stepping stone for speech or more advanced AAC.PECS is not sufficient for people ready to communicate more nuanced ideas like feelings, jokes, and complex thoughts.

, Switches are often used by people with physical disabilities who need an workable way to access a computer interface or communicate. However, they're also useful for beginning to build communication skills in someone who doesn't communicate clearly with others yet.


These low-tech devices often take the form of a big button that can be programmed with an audio recording of a short word or phrase.When the communicator pushes the button, the device speaks the phrase for them, issuing a request or expressing a need. Because they need to be pre-programmed for use, buttons and switches are generally not used for very complicated communication but as a stepping stone to more complex, higher-tech communication devices.

, The autistic person points to a pictures to identify a need or create an approximate sentence.


Communication boards work for those who can't read or spell very well yet, since the icons can be presented as pictures or pictures and words.
This may be difficult for autistic people who have severe motor skills issues. Boards are also not terribly dynamic, meaning that they need to be prepared ahead of time and generally contain a limited set of icons, thereby limiting the communication possibilities for the user. They're good in the early stages but don't always ""move"" as fast as the communicator's needs.

, High-tech AAC devices can be very expensive, but the rise of smartphones and tablets has allowed developers to build apps that do the same thing. Very simple AAC apps work similar to PECS in that the communicator's device can be pre-programmed with a set of icons representing needs, wants, and familiar items from their day-to-day life. These icons can also have an audio recording or text-to-speech snippet associated with them so that when the communicator presses the icon, a voice says the word aloud. As the user develops more communication skills, they can transition to chaining words and phrases together, switch from picture icons to written words, and transition into typing full sentences through the app.


High quality AAC apps are designed with the input of professional speech-language pathologists and therefore aren't as cheap as some of their lower quality counterparts. The price tags may be higher but it's worth keeping in mind that many of these apps and layouts have had the professional input necessary to make them as functional and useful as possible; because of muscle memory and the chaining of concepts, where buttons are located in the app makes a difference for both learning and everyday use, and there is a science to it. You may find it's worth, if possible, investing in a slightly higher quality app in order to encourage the building of communication skills; otherwise the user may end up plateauing at expressing wants/needs, rather than growing their skills to expressing more complex thoughts.
Because most smartphones and tablets have built-in cameras, adding new icons is fairly quick and easy, meaning that parents, teachers, and mentors can update the AAC to expensive devices around all day, you may well end up dropping them eventually, and a good case can help prevent damage!

, Typing is a versatile form of communication that can be used to communicate nuanced thought.


Young children may not have the cognitive or motor skills necessary to type. They need to learn to spell before they can type.
People with severe motor skills issues may not be able to move their fingers well enough to type.

, Facilitated communication might work for people who can't hold their hand steady, but it can also lead to the facilitator speaking instead of the autistic person.Thus, the autistic person should be mature and capable enough to communicate any issues going on, and the facilitator should be sensitive to the possible pitfalls of FC.


FC can be used with typing, writing by hand, or picture boards.
A facilitator should be well-trained to continuously provide the right support and to avoid influencing the autistic person.FC may be dangerous for autistic people who have undergone intensive compliance-based therapies, because they may not be able to stand up for themselves if something bad happens.

, Sign language can be a great way to communicate with loved ones and the deaf and autistic communities. Loved ones can learn sign language along with the autistic person.


Sign language may not be a good option unless the family is willing and able to set aside time to learn.
Many forms of sign language, including ASL, do rely on expressions and face-to-face eye contact, not just hand gestures, to communicate ideas. If eye contact is difficult for the autistic individual, sign language can be a more difficult choice once they reach more complex levels of communication.

Have the student sit close to the teacher.,
Allow the use of recording devices.,
Provide handouts.,
Use different test taking formats.,
Decrease the amount of copying.,
Do not focus on the quality of handwriting.,
Model organizational structures.,
Modify homework assignments.",How to Teach a Dyslexic Child2," Placing the student near the teacher will help eliminate any distractions and allow the child to focus on their work. Sitting next to extremely talkative children or a noisy hallway may make it more difficult for them to concentrate.This will also make it easier for the teacher to provide extra instruction of necessary.

, Tape recorders can help students overcome reading difficulties. The student can replay instructions and concepts for clarification or reinforcement. If recordings are made available before class, the student can read along as he or she listens to the tape., Again, since dyslexic children struggle with short-term memory, providing them with some sort of outline as you are lecturing is helpful, especially following long lectures.This well help the child follow along with the lesson, take better notes, and know what to expect. .


Use visual cues, such as asterisks and bullets, to highlight important directives or information.
Write homework instructions directly on the assignment so the child knows what is expected. It is also beneficial to allow use of reference guides such as alphabet and numbers

, Because children with dyslexia learn differently, the usual test taking formats may not allow them to demonstrate what they have learned. Children may benefit from oral testing or untimed tests.During an oral test, the test questions are read to the student and the student answers the questions orally. The test questions can be pre-recorded or read at the time of the test. The student’s answers could also be recorded for easier grading.
Students with dyslexia often have trouble working under pressure and take longer to read questions. Allowing the student ample time to take a test will ensure that student has time to understand the questions, think, and write down an answer.
Seeing all of the test questions at once can be overwhelming. Only allowing the student view one test question at a time will help them focus.

, Students with dyslexia need more time to copy information from the board, take notes from lectures, and write instructions for assignments.Teachers can provide lecture notes and written instructions for assignments so the student can focus on the actual information.Teachers may also assign another student to take notes or allow a good note taker to share their notes with the student.

, Some children with dyslexia may struggle with handwriting because of the fine motor skills it requires.You can change the response format of the question to multiple choice, underlining, or some other form of marking to make it easier for them to answer. Students could also be given extra space to write answers. Emphasis should be placed on the content that the student provides versus how the information looks or is presented., Help individuals with dyslexia to develop organizational skills that will benefit them for the rest of their lives. Organization could involve using different folders and dividers to keep track of homework, assignments, and tests. Model these in your classroom, but also encourage them to apply them at home.


Students should also be encouraged to use personal assignment planners and calendars to keep track of due dates for assignments, test dates, and other activities they may be involved in. Have them write daily assignments in their assignment book. Check the assignment book before the students leave school to make sure they understand the direction., A one hour assignment for a typical child may take 3 hours for a dyslexic child to complete. This can make the child anxious, stressed, and place an unnecessary burden on them. Instead having the student complete questions 1-20, have the student only answer the odd or even numbered questions. Teachers can also set a time limit for homework each night or only have the student focus on key concepts.


Instead of presenting homework assignments through writing, students may be allowed to present information orally, visually, or other ways that they communicate best."

Use caption software to record lectures.,
Have a live note taker caption discussions on a computer.,
Find programs that convert speech to sign language.",How to Help Deaf Students Using Technology1," The most basic way to help your deaf student is to convert your lectures into text that they can read. When you are giving a lecture, giving instructions, or talking in general to your classroom, your deaf student can use a computer program to translate your spoken words into text he can read. This will ensure that your deaf student gets that same information as all your students.


These programs are far from perfect. Your deaf student may need some training on common mistakes the programs make. He should also be able to follow up with you if you has questions about uncommon mistakes or issues he has.
Common software used for this purpose include Dragon Naturally Speaking and Caption Mic.;
, If your school is not able to provide caption software that can convert the lectures into text, ask a student in your class who types quickly to take notes for your deaf student. Computers can be set up where what is being entered on one computer can be filtered directly to another computer. With the notes transferred between these computers, your deaf student will be able to read what you are discussing in class in real time.


There may be a program through your school for a professional note taker or stenographer to provide these services. Ask your administration for help if you are unsure of the policies in your school.
There are also professional programs, such as C-Print and Computer Aided Realtime Translation (CART) that allow for a on or off site stenographer to provide a verbatim account of your lectures to your deaf students. These transcripts are transmitted via computers or large monitor screens.Make sure this service is available when your student is working in small groups as well.

, There are some software options that will convert spoken word into computer created sign language. With this kind of software, your words are recorded by a computer, it is converted into text and then output on the computer screen as sign language.


These programs will also work in the other direction, where your student can reply using sign language as well. This option requires a video camera.
Software such as iCommunicator and MotionSavvy UNI are used for these kinds of services."

Start as soon as you can with getting experience.,
Pick a disability population to focus on.,
Get a bachelor's degree.,
Research your credential program.,
Take the CBEST (California Basic Educational Skills Test) and the CSET (California Subject Examination for Teachers) Multiple Subjects test (if you want to teach in high school you might take a CSET Single Subjects test).,
Apply.,
Meet with a counselor, and figure out your program plan.,
Decide whether you want to do an internship or not.,
Apply for your credential.,
Apply for jobs!",How to Be a Special Education Teacher in California," Look for opportunities in a special day class, a resource room, or any other setting where you get a lot of interaction and deal with responsibilities that require working with people with disabilities. Apply to be a para-educator (aka, a teacher's aide, paraprofessional, dedicated student aide, 1 on 1 aide, etc.), or volunteer. Unlike a teaching position, para-educators have a competitive and highly sought-after job, so be prepared to apply to many places and to work as a sub, or part-time.;
, Focus on the disability population you're most interested in working with. In California, there are five major areas you can become credentialed in: Early Childhood Special Education, Mild - Moderate disabilities, Moderate - Severe disabilities, visual impairment, and deaf or hard of hearing.

, The degree can be in any field of your choice, though the following list of majors will greatly inform your future teaching practice and prepare you for the type of graduate work you will be doing: psychology, sociology, child development, ethnic studies, and math/English education. If you have a degree in anything else, though, it will probably not affect your chances at having a successful career, just make sure you do at least some work study in the areas of education, psychology, sociology, or any related field.


In many California State Universities (San Jose State, CSU Monterey Bay, CSU Los Angeles, etc.) you'll be able to get a minor in Special Education while you obtain your bachelor's degree, and that can put a significant dent in the intimidating amount of work you'll have to do for your Level I credential. It's recommended that you do as much as you can to lessen the amount of courses you have to take in your graduate level of education.

, Only a handful of private schools and UCs, offer credentials in any area of special education. Every CSU offers a preliminary credential program in special education in at least one field (of the mild/moderate, moderate/severe, etc.). Some universities, like San Jose State, or San Francisco State, offer nearly every possible credential and have huge departments of Special Education. Some, like Humboldt State, have only one or two programs. Do your research and determine what you want to do before you decide which you would like to attend.

, Passing scores on both tests are required to apply to credential programs.

, Get everything in order in advance. Be prepared to apply as early as a full year prior to the start of the program you want, especially since the changes CSUs have had to make do to state budget cuts which means often admissions is limited to the fall term and some programs may have more limited ability to admit students.

, If you already have a credential for general education, either multiple or single subject, you'll be able to waive several of the classes and tests required for the Special Education credential. If you don't have a credential already, you can go straight into a special education program.


Keep in mind that a special education credential allows you teach special education in all grade levels K-12, with the exception of Early Childhood which restricts you to Birth - 5 and Moderate - Severe, which allows you to teach adult students up to age 22 in addition to the K-12 grade range.

, Don't be fooled into thinking this is ""just"" an internship. An internship in Special Education as a teacher is basically doing a full-time regular teaching job but also taking classes full time at your university at the same time. An internship is an excellent way to get into a district, get your first two years out of the way (known to be the most difficult time in a teaching career), and make an excellent salary while you're at it.


Be fully aware that an internship is a lot of hard work (and that's an understatement) but it can be extremely rewarding when you finally get your preliminary credential and realize you've already got two years of experience under your belt.
An intern credential is good for two years, and no longer. You must plan to have all of your classes finished before your internship credential expires.

, There are two credentials you'll get, Level I and Level II. After you finish your Level I credential, which will include the majority of your classes, you'll have 5 years in which to finish your Level II (a program which takes 2 years at a comfortable pace) and which includes more courses at a university and a minimum of two full years of teaching experience.


This is done through the university and the Beginning Teacher Support and Assessment - BTSA process that general education teachers complete, but is a little more intense. It can be coupled with a Masters degree in Special Education, which is only one to three classes of extra work along with a masters project, thesis, or seminar. After three and a half years, it's really worth adding one extra semester of work, and most districts will give you a small stipend for having an MA.
You may apply to any university to get your Level II if you choose to move or just try a different college, you do not have to continue at the same university you started at. Your school district will arrange the BTSA portion of your Level II credential with you.

, Special education is a field with many more job openings than applicants, as there is a large growth in students receiving special education and quite a bit of teacher turnover. The field of special education offers many employment opportunities for those people who are interested! You'll almost definitely have a job in any place in California, and the job security is unbeatable. If you've ever thought you just might be interested in working with people with special needs, then you'll probably find yourself very happy in this field.

Convert written words to sound.,
Use text to speech phones.,
Try handwriting recognition software.,
Use telecommunication devices for the deaf (TDDs).",How to Help Deaf Students Using Technology2," In order for your deaf students to feel as if they are participating like other students, look into software that will convert any text they type into spoken words. This way, your deaf students can participate in your class discussions without you having to read his responses.


There are computer programs available that will convert the messages that a deaf student writes into spoken phrases. Have this program installed on a few computers in your classroom so your deaf student can use them.
Also look into licensing the software for your student’s personal laptop so he can use it in class as well.Try to prepare your other students for the different way the computerized voice will sound. You want to make your deaf student feel included without the others students calling him out for being different.

, Similar to programs installed on computers, there are many different apps and cell phone programs that will convert text messages to vocal responses. These can be especially helpful when your deaf student is working in small groups or in other situations where a large laptop or computer may get in the way.


These software options will also send messages back to the student, converting their classmates’ vocal responses to text and sending it to them through the Bluetooth service., If your school is unable to get text to voice technology, handwriting recognition software may be useful. These programs use a pen or board hooked up to a computer to communicate anything written with or on them. With these technologies, your deaf student can write down a response that can be easily projected for you or his classmates to see.


With this technology, he can chime into the conversation without having to hand write it and hand it to you on a normal sheet of paper.
Look for technology such as Digital Pen and Interactive Whiteboards (SMART Board)., TDDs are specialized phones that allow the transfer of text messages over phone lines. The deaf person writes the message on a keyboard and message gets relayed either to another TDD enabled phone or through an operator. The operator recites the messages and writes the responses back to the originator of the call. These can also be used to initiate calls from a hearing person to a deaf person, which will be translated in the same way.This technology would be helpful for teachers when they want to connect with a deaf student or their parents outside of school. These calls might relate to conferences, teacher work days, or other school events.

Incorporate more visuals into your lectures.,
Show videos with captions.,
Use electronic handouts.,
Provide information on projectors.,
Talk to your institution and student.",How to Help Deaf Students Using Technology3," In your lectures, instead of relying on vocal descriptions or audio lectures alone, incorporate more visual materials in your lectures. This will give your deaf student a visual representation of the concepts to which you are describing, which will make it easier for them to understand it before they see your notes.


You can do this easily with computer presentations using computer programs such as Microsoft PowerPoint or online presentation tools such as Prezi.
Make sure you provide captions for any image you use so your student will know exactly what the visual examples represent.
Try to relate similar or previously discussed concepts together by linking their visualizations. This will not only help your deaf students make the connections, the visual reminders will also help your other students as well., If you are showing a film in class, avoid those that lack captions. In these situations, your deaf student may miss out on a key point in your lesson by missing the contents of the video.Most store bought DVDs have closed captions. Make sure to play these when you watch a video in class.
There are online services, such as the Described and Captioned Media Program, that provide 1,000s of videos already embedded with captions. YouTube also has a closed caption option if you are able to find your video clip uploaded there.If you cannot provide captions, look for a transcript of the contents or ask a fellow student to transcribe the video for your student so he will be able to receive the information.

, If you know you are going to have a lecture heavy day, give a print out of your lecture notes or class summary to your deaf students. These can be helpful in digital form so your student can annotate them while he is in class.


Being able to see a written version of your lecture will help your student relate any activities in class to the concepts you write down. These will be helpful in conjunction to the notes he receives of your live lectures., If you add new information in a lecture that is not in notes given to your student, use an overhead projector to communicate this information. You can also use a projector to give visual examples if your deaf student is having trouble understanding a concept.This method is also helpful to communicate homework or other time sensitive information not covered in his notes.

, When you are trying to accommodate a deaf student into your classroom, contact your institutions Office of Disability Services. They will have knowledge of what policies are already in place for your school and how you can get access to them. You should also ask your student if he has preferences about what technology would work best for him.


If you already have ideas about what your student prefers, take these ideas to the Office of Disabilities and see if they will can help. If not, present your student with what is available and see what he would like to use the most.

Prevent trip hazards.",How to Build a Computer Lab," The first step in building a computer lab is knowing where it is going to be set up. You want to choose a room that has plenty of evenly spaced outlets and enough space to fit the number of computers you want to have in the lab.


Rooms that are square or rectangular will work better than rooms that have sharp angles or strange shapes.;
, Identify the purpose of your computer lab so that you will have an idea of the type of equipment you will need. Is it a lab that people will use for advanced digital design or programming requiring substantial computing power? Or is it just a general school lab with computers that just need to be able to run basic programs such as Word and PowerPoint?


The needs of your lab will help you identify the type of equipment that you will need to provide.
You will also need to consider the purchase of printers, scanners, projectors, and internet modems/wireless routers. At least one printer and internet access are two essential items for the lab., Along with determining the needs of your lab, you will need to identify the exact number of computers you will have available. If you know how many students will be using the lab at any given time, you will have an idea of how many computers you need. The number of computers you will have is also dependent upon the size of the room.If you want users to have access to higher end computers, but have a limited budget, consider getting a small number of advanced computers and a larger number of mid-range computers.

, The height of the desks that the computers are placed on is very important. The ideal desk height is one that allows users to type on the keyboard with their arms parallel to the desk.Try to obtain furniture that fits the needs of the users you are designing the lab for.


Chairs with adjustable heights are the best option for a computer lab so that all users can be comfortable while working. The top of the computer screen should be about level with the user’s eyes.

, There are a few configurations available depending on the use of the computer lab. If it will be a teaching space, you will probably arrange the computers differently than if the lab is just a free workspace at a library. Consider the following layouts to decide what will work best for your needs:Theatre style: This consists of rows of computers all facing one wall. It is good for teaching, but not good for student interaction or collaboration.
Up against the wall: All computers are facing the wall of the room. Good for seeing what everyone is doing on their screen and students have to turn away from computers to face you while giving instructions. Not an efficient use of space.
Rounds: Grouping computers together in round tables of four each. This configuration is great for group work and collaboration, but not good for teaching.
U-shape: Computers are arranged in a U-shape with everyone facing towards the center. It’s easy to see and hear everyone in this configuration, but it requires more space.

, All of these computers are going to need to be plugged in. Use surge protectors to keep the computers from being damaged during power outages. They also increase the number of available outlets allowing you to plug in multiple computers into one surge protector.A power strip is not the same as a surge protector. Power strips just increase the number of available outlets, but do not protect against power spikes.
You may need to use extension cords attached to surge protectors to get every computer plugged in. This may also affect the layout of your computer lab.
Keep in mind the presence of all of the wires and possible trip hazards when thinking about the layout of the computer lab.

, If you are building a computer lab on a budget, it is a good idea to start by calling local businesses to see if they have old computers. When companies update their computer systems they are usually willing to donate their old computers to a good cause.To encourage donations, let companies know that they can use their contribution as a tax deduction.

, Similar to asking businesses, you can also go directly to friends and family. Many people just store the old computers in the basement when they buy new ones. These old computers can be repurposed for your computer lab.Your friends will probably be happy to get rid of those old computers.

, If you have a bigger budget, you can purchase new computers. You should be able to negotiate a good deal because you will be buying the computers in bulk. You probably don’t need a top-of-the-line computer, but a mid-range high performance computer would be appropriate.Shop around a few different places to get the best deal.
Remember to get a compatible keyboard, mouse, and monitor for each computer.

, Before using old computers for your lab, you need to reset them to factory settings. This will improve their performance and erase all information that may have been left on them.Resetting the computers will depend on the type of computer you have. A quick online search of the computer should yield the proper procedure.

, The type of computer purchased for the lab will affect the type of operating system used. Linux is an open-source free operating system that is a great option for a budget computer lab. Other operating systems include Microsoft Windows and Apple OS X.


There are many classes available to take on the use of any of these operating systems. Whole communities of people will be willing to help you get started with whichever one you choose., Once you have all of the components purchased, you can start building the computer lab. Assemble all of the furniture and place it around the room in the configuration you decide on earlier.Use caution when assembling all of the desks and furniture.

, Arrange all of the computers on top of the desks. Attach all of the monitors, keyboards, and computer mice. Plug everything into the electrical outlets. Turn on the computers and make sure everything is hooked up properly.Assign each computer a number so they can easily be kept track of.

, Getting all of the computers on the same network allows you access information saved to the network on any linked computer. This is good in case your normal computer is taken or damaged.The network will also incorporate internet access to all of the computers.

, Using floor cord covers over exposed cables are an easy way to prevent users from tripping. Covers are inexpensive and easy to install. Use Velcro ties to organize cables together and secure them out of the way.Cable clips are also a good way to keep cables from becoming unruly hazards.

For example, a child who enjoys playing video games can be asked to write a report about it – teaching him writing and creative thinking skills. On the other hand, a tablet PC could be used in art class to draw pictures or even signs and banners for school.;
,  If you have a classroom of teenagers, then most of them will likely have Twitter accounts. Why not make learning a bit more fun by having them contact popular personalities, or spread hashtags related to the topic of the day using Twitter?


This could help gain interaction from people around the world who have something to share. By doing this, it can help teach your students the value of making connections and the influence it can have on them.

, There’s a more efficient way of sharing classroom notes, documents and projects and that’s with programs like Google Docs. Teach children how they can collaborate via the Internet, which could be a part of their future if they decide to pursue a business career. You can also upload videos to a private channel just for your class using YouTube.

, The idea of pen pals can be enhanced using video chat systems like UberConference. These systems can also be used to connect with experts or students from other classrooms that are far away.


In this scenario, children will learn how to share experiences and build new relationships from a distance. Teleconferencing is a great way to teach children about teleconferencing etiquette, such as understanding when it’s alright to connect and how to act when on camera.

, In order to help get your students active in class lessons, you can use a blog or wiki to entice them to comment on lessons, topics and current events.


Students should also be allowed to create new posts about news or their thoughts. This is a great way to enhance creative writing. Parents can also feel connected, since they’re able to browse through the discussions and see how the children and teachers interact in an open online environment.

,  Technology isn’t always about being seen; it can also be used to be heard. With a classroom podcast, you can read passages from a textbook or a novel or schedule for discussions to take place on a certain topic that’s in line with your curriculum. This will teach broadcasting skills, speaking skills and critical thinking skills. You can also record the discussion, which can be reviewed by the class or future students.

, Similarly to YouTube, a private account can be created (no one but classroom students can log into the account). With Pinterest, you and your students can post photos of projects, activities, field trips and anything else that’s class related. Since this is a visual medium, it will help to bring out creativity and confidence to share things with others.

, If you’re a math or life skills teacher, you could put Excel to use in teaching your students about formulas, budgets and working with spreadsheets overall. This will show them how to do complex and simple calculations, and how they can be used to improve their personal or work life.


When doing financial planning, you can use real-world scenarios to help teach a point that can be used in real life. This includes learning about savings, earnings, credit and expenses based on formulas that the students create.

,  Whether going on a family vacation to another state or country or learning the transits of Christopher Columbus, an interactive map can be used.


This will also allow students to place their thoughts and exploits on the map. Some maps also provide fun facts, pictures, street views and videos of different cities, states and countries, offering a virtual field trip. #*Integrating technology into your classroom can have more benefits than one. You can try implementing these ideas into your class to see how it can help enhance teaching lessons for your students.

Learn to count in German.",How to Speak Simple German," Each German-speaking country has its own particular greetings.Yet no matter where you are, the following standard greetings will work.


""Guten Tag"" (goo-tehn tahg), “Good day.” Use this as a general way of saying “hello” during daytime hours.
""Guten Morgen"" (goo-tehn mor-gen), ""Good Morning.""
""Guten Abend"" (Goo-tehn Ah-bend), ""Good evening.""
""Gute Nacht"" (goo-teh nah-cht), ""Good night” (usually said to close family only, when going to bed).
""Hallo"" (hah-low), “hello.” This is basically used anytime, anywhere.
In Austria greetings such as ""Servus"" or ""Grüß Gott"" ""Greet god"" are common.;
, There are two easy ways to say “My name is…” in German:


""Ich heiße "" (“ich hi-seh ,” literally “I am called…”)
“Mein Name ist ” (“mine nam-eh ist ,” literally “my name is…”).
For example, say either “Ich heiße Andreas” or “Mein Name ist Andreas” to mean “My name is Andreas.”

, In German, as in many languages, you will often need to differentiate between acquaintances and strangers (formal) and people you know well (informal) when speaking.To ask someone’s name, for example:


""Wie heißen Sie?"" (vee hi-sehn zee), “What is your name?” (formal)
""Wie heißt du?"" (vee heist du), “What is your name?” (informal)

, As with greetings, goodbyes may vary somewhat depending on where you are or who you are speaking to.Generally, however, you can’t go wrong with these:


""Auf Wiedersehen"" or (owf vee-dair-zayn), ""Good-bye!""
""Tschüss!"" (choos), ""Bye!""
“Ciao!"" (chow), ""Bye!"" This Italian phrase is often used by German speakers to say goodbye.

, Not only is it polite, it also allows you to show off more of the German you are learning!


Use the formal phrase ""Wie geht es Ihnen?"" (vee gate ess eenin), when asking strangers or acquaintances, “How are you?”
Use the informal phrase ""Wie geht es dir?"" (vee gate ess deer) or simply “Wie geht’s?” (vee gates) to ask someone you know well, or a child, ""How are you?""
Generally speaking, to be polite use the formal version with someone you don’t know, unless they begin using the informal with you. This is especially the case in settings involving areas like business, education, and government., If someone asks, you can respond to the question “Wie geht es Ihnen?” or “Wie geht’s” in a variety of ways.


You could simply say: “Gut” (“goot”), “good”; “Sehr gut” (“zair goot”), “very good”; or “Schlecht” (“shle-cht”), “bad.”
However, a more extensive response is more polite. You can say “Mir geht es…” (“mere gate es…”), followed by “gut,” “sehr gut,” or “schlecht” to mean “I am doing…” “well,” “very well” or “bad,” respectively., A good conversation starter is to ask people about their backgrounds. Try these questions, using the formal / informal version as appropriate:


“Woher Kommen Sie?” (“Voh-hair co-men zee?”) / “Woher kommst du?” (“Voh-hair comst do?”) = “Where are you from?”
“Ich komme aus ” (“Ich come-uh ow-s”) = “I am from ”. For example, “Ich komme aus den USA” (Ich come-uh ow-s dane oo ess ah), “I am from the United States.”
“Wo wohnen Sie?” (“Voh voh-nen zee?”) / “Wo wohnst du?” (“Voh voh-nst do?”) = “Where do you live?” (in the sense of “Which country, state, or city, etc. do you reside right now?”
“Ich wohne in ” (“Ich voh-nuh in”) = “I live in .” For example, “Ich wohne in Chicago.”

, This includes “Ja” (ya) for “yes” and “Nein” (nine) for “no” as well as:


""Wie bitte?"" (vee bitteh), ""pardon me?""
""Es Tut mir leid!"" (ess toot mere lied), ""I am sorry!""
“Entschuldigung!” (ehnt-shool-dig-ung), “Excuse me!”

, While technically speaking, saying “thank you” in German has a formal/informal distinction, a simple “Danke!” (dank-eh), or “thanks!” is absolutely fine to be used in any situation.


If you are curious, the full formal version is “Ich danke Ihnen” (ich dank-eh eenin), while the informal is “Ich danke dir” (ich dank-eh deer).The word for “please” is “Bitte!” (bittuh). The same phrase doubles as “you’re welcome!”

, If you want to know if something is available at a store, restaurant, etc., then simply ask “Haben Sie ?” (hah-ben zee), or “Do you have ?” For example, “Haben Sie Kaffee?” (hah-ben zee cah-fay), “Do you have coffee?”


If you want to know how much something you see costs, then ask “Wie viel kostet das?” (vee feel cost-et dahs).

, If you are lost, need to find something, or otherwise need help, a few phrases will come in handy.


To ask for help: “Können Sie mir helfen, bitte?” (coon-en zee mere helf-en bit-teh), “Could you help me, please?”
To ask for a location: “Wo ist ?” (Voh ihst), “Where is ?” For example, “Wo ist die Toilette, bitte?” (Voh ihst die Toil-et-eh, bit-teh), “Where is the restroom?” or “Wo ist der Bahnhof?” (Voh ihst dare Bahn-hof), “Where is the train station?”
To be polite, introduce the question by saying: “Entschuldigen Sie, bitte, wo ist der Bahnhof?” (ent-shool-dig-ung zee bit-tuh, voh ihst dare bahn-hof), “Excuse me, please, where is the train station?”
To ask if someone speaks another language: “Sprechen Sie Englisch?” (or Spanisch/Französisch, etc.) (shpreh-chen zee english/shpanish/fran-zoo-tzish, etc.), “Do you speak English/Spanish/French?”

, German numbers generally work much the same as English numbers. The main exception is for numbers 21 and above: you say “einunzwanzig” (ayn-uhnd-tsvahn-tsich), literally “one-and-twenty” for 21; “vierunddreißig” (fear-uhnd-dry-sich), literally “four-and-thirty” for 34; “siebenundsechzig” (zee-ben-uhnd-zech-tsich), literally “seven-and-sixty” for 67, etc.

Gender words.,
Conjugate verbs.,
Employ the case system.,
Understand word order.",How to Speak German1," Unlike in English, nouns in German have what is called a gender. This is a grammatical approach which alters the noun itself (when pluralizing) as well as the words around it. The three genders are masculine, feminine, and neutral.


It is best not to think of words in terms of actually having a gender, since German gendering uses little logic and often changes. Instead, think of the genders as different types or categories into which all of the German nouns fit, with each category having it’s own grammatical and spelling rules.
The best way to learn the German gender system, since it is not related to spelling as it is in French, is to simply listen. Listen a lot. Watch movies, listen to music, have conversations with native speakers. Eventually it will simply sound right or wrong.;
, Verbs are conjugated in German, meaning that they change based on who is doing them, conditional language, tense, etc. This same practice occurs in German but is far more extensive. Thankfully, the system is fairly regular and you can begin to learn it fairly quickly.


For example, in the indicative present tense (the most basic form), the endings are often -e (I), -st (you), -t (he/she/it), -en (we), -t (you all), and -en (they).
English has this system as well but it is less noticeable. For example, in English we say “I break” but we also say “She breaks”. The most common English example is the conjugation of the verb “to be”: “I am”, “He is”, and “You/We/They are”.

, The case system is how nouns change in order to indicate what role they play in a sentence. English has largely lost this system but it can be seen in certain instances, such as indicating the subject of a sentence (he) versus the objects of a sentence (him). German still uses this system, however, and you will need to learn it.


The four cases used in German are the nominative (indicating subject), the accusative (indicating the object), the dative (indicating the indirect object), and the genitive (indicating a possessive).
The gender and number of a noun will affect how the noun changes within the case. Pay attention to this when looking up words.

, German word order, like English word order, can be easily manipulated. Because of the case system, it is actually easier to manipulate German sentences. It will take you time to learn proper German word order but here is a basic framework with which to start:


First position - Cannot contain a finite verb, usually contains the subject
Second position - Contains the finite or inflected verb
Third position - Contains the objects affected by the verb phrase
Fourth position - Contains adverbs.
Fifth position - Contains verb complements, which are verbs that act as the object of the main verb.

Understand the context.,
Saying Sister when your sister is with you.,
Saying ""My Sister"".,
Saying ""Half Sister"".,
Saying ""little sister"".",How to Say Sister in German,"

You need to consider in what way you want to use this word to ensure it is used correctly.
Are you talking about a full sister? or a half sister? Will she be present when you speak about her? or will you be speaking about her in the third person?



 

;
,

The correct word is ""Schwester"". The first portion of this word the ""sch"" is pronounced similar to the start of ""schnapps"" the drink and the rest of the word ""wester"" is pronounced as it sounds.
Now put the two sounds together to make ""Schwester""







,

The word for Sister does not change from the above step however as in English we insert My in front of the word sister, the Germans inserted a word before ""Schwester"" to complete this saying.
The German word need to be added here is ""Meine"". This word is pronounced with a ""My"" sound to start despite it's spelling and finishes with a ""Na"". Now put these sounds together to pronounce ""My-na"" and you are saying the word for ""Meine"", when you add the previous word ""Schwester"" you are now saying ""My Sister"" in German







, The word for this expression in German is one word. ""Halbschwester"" instead of the English two words. The first half of this word is ""Halb"" as it is in English added with it is the previously discussed ""Schwester"" to create ""Halbschwester"".

, The word for little in this context is ""kleine"". It roughly translates to the English word of ""small"" but it is the correct word for this context. To pronounce the first sound is ""klein"" like Calvin Klein the designer and the second sound is a ""na"" sound. So add the two together to make ""kleinna"" sound. Now add the previous word ""Schwester"" for sister to make the full saying ""Kleine Schwester""

The /ch/ sound in ""ich,"" which is also called a voiceless palatal fricative, isn't pronounced the same way you would pronounce it in English. It sounds something like the /j/ sound in Spanish, kind of like a snake hissing.


The /ch/ sound is really hard for non-native speakers to master. Most English-speakers getting away with saying ""ish,"" as in ""finish"" or ""fish.""

, This is the ""love"" in ""I love you."" Say this slowly ""lee-buh."" The ""l"" is pronounced normally but the ""ie"" is pronounced as ""ee"" like in ""tree"" and ""bee."" The ""be"" at the end of it is pronounced like the ""b"" in ""burn."" Put it together to form ""liebe.""

, The ""ich"" in ""Dich"" is pronounced the same as ""ich"" in the first step. ""Dich"" sounds similar to the English word ""dish,"" except the /ch/ sound is produced in the middle of the mouth instead of the front. This is the ""you"" in ""I love you"".

Master the word for sit.,
Master some common phrases using the word sit.,
Use past tense for the word sit.,
Hold your mouth correctly.,
Pronounce consonants correctly in German.,
Choose whether to speak formally or informally.,
Conjugate the verb correctly.",How to Say Sit in German," In German, the verb for sit is “sitzen.”The verb is pronounced “zitss-ihn.”Put the emphasis on the first syllabus in the word.
The German verb for sit down is “sich setzen” (zeek zeh-tsihn). If you want to tell someone to sit, though, the quickest way to do that is to say, ""sitz!"" (pronounced as zihtss). Be aware this could be perceived as impolite!;
, You will want to learn a few sentences that contain the word for sitting. Some people want to use German when commanding certain breeds of dogs to sit. You may, instead, need to speak German to a person!


To say sit down, say “setz dich” (zehts deekh). This differs from the verb itself because it's conjugated with dich, which means you.Bittzen setzen sie sich means please take a seat (bit-tsihn zeh-tsihn zee zeekh). The ch is pronounced uniquely in German. It’s best to listen to it. Some have described it as sounding like an angry cat sound! It's a bit like a ""kah"" sound in English, but more gutteral.Ich sitze means I am sitting (“eekh ziht-tsah”). Again, listen to the German version of –ch.

, Perhaps you want to say that you sat, not that you’re sitting. The past tense version of the verb sitzen is sass. Pronounce sass “sahss.” The ""a"" sound is similar to the ""o"" in the English word bond.


Ich saß (I sat). The ß is the German symbol for a double s, “ss.”
Du Saß (You sat, informal).
Er saß (He sat).
Wir saßen (We sat).
Ihr saß (She sat).
Sie saßen (They sat, formal).
You can find detailed charts online for other tenses of the verb to sit, including the past perfect, future I and future II versions of the verb. For example, I have sat is “Ich habe gesessen” in German (pronounced Eek hah-bah Gih-seh-ssihn)., When pronouncing German words, try to hold your mouth fairly tightly shut when talking. This is how native Germans speak.Germans have visible tension in their mouth and pull their lips to the side when they pronounce words. Sometimes non-native speakers of German will hold their mouths too slack, especially their lower lips.
Too loose of a lower lip, and you will not sound German. You will look like you’re chewing gum, and your accent will be obvious!

, When saying sit in German, it’s important that you understand that an “s” in German doesn’t sound like an English “s.”When the letter “s” appears in front of a vowel, you need to pronounce the German consonant “s” like you would pronounce the English “z.” Thus, the “s” at the start of the word “sitzen” should be pronounced like an English “z.” The German sound “z” is not voiced as strongly in German as it is in English, though. Be aware that the way you pronounce the letter “s” is different though when it appears at the end of a word instead of at the front. The sound at the end is a hissing sound of an “s.” That is also the case when a double “s” appears in the middle of a word.
When the German letter “z” is in the middle of a word (as with sitzen), it is pronounced as an English “ts” sound.

, In German, you will conjugate a verb like the one for ""to sit"" depending on the context and the person you are addressing. You will use different words for formal settings and different words when speaking to a friend more casually.


Du is the word for you that is used when you are speaking to a friend or someone more informally. The word is pronounced “doo.”
Sie (""zee"") is the word for you that is used when you are speaking to an older person or someone with greater status, such as a boss.Keep the –en on the end of verbs you use more formally.
This matters when saying the word sit if you are addressing someone else. Sitzt du? (Are you sitting) is how you would speak to someone informally. Sitzen Sie? (Are you sitting) is how you would address someone more formally.

, Sitzen is the full verb for to sit. However, in German, the way you use that word changes depending on whom you are addressing and the context. You need to shorten the verb for non-formal and non-plural uses.Ich sitze (I sit)
Du sitzt (you sit, informal)
Er sitzt (he sits)
Wir sitzen (we sit)
Ihr sitzt (she sits)
Sie sitzen (They sit, formal)

Practice vowels.,
Practice consonants.,
Practice compound sounds.",How to Speak German2," The difference in how vowels are pronounced is what often makes languages sound very different. Pronouncing vowels correctly will allow you to be more easily understood by other speakers. It is important to note that German has three vowels which are not present in English.


a - sounds like “ah”
e - sounds like “eh”
i - sounds like “eee”
o - sounds like “oh”
u - sounds like “oo”
ö - sounds somewhat like “oo-uh”, very like on the “uh”
ä - sounds like short “eh”, like in melon
ü - no English equivalent but it sounds somewhat like “oo”, or the middle sound in the word “ewww”
These last three letters with the umlaut can also be written as oe, ae, and ue. Don’t get confused.

, German consonants are not very different from those in English, but there are some noticeable differences which you will want to be aware of if you want to be understood.


w - sounds like “v”
v - sounds like “f”
z -sounds like “ts”
j - sounds like “y”
ß - sounds like “ss”

, As in English, there are letters which sound different when placed in conjunction. You will need to be able to recognize these and pronounce them correctly if you wish to be understood.


au - sounds like “ow”, as in English “brown”.
eu - sounds like “oy” or “oi”, as in English “toy”.
ie - sounds like “eee” or “ea”, as in English “tea”.
ei - sounds like English “eye”.
ch - there is no English equivalent. This is a guttural sound, which sounds vaguely like an “h”.
st - sounds like “sht”. The “sh” is made with your lips further outward than in English, like you are blowing out candles. Your mouth muscles should be much more rigid and tight than when making the English “sh”. The t is pronounced normally.
pf - both sounds are pronounced, but the p is nearly silent.
sch - sounds like “sh”.
qu - sounds like “kv”.
th - sounds like “t” (the h is silent).

Hello - The most basic way of greeting someone would be “hallo” but you can also say “guten morgen(formal)/morgen(informal)” for good morning or “guten tag(formal)/tag(informal)” for good day.
Goodbye - the formal way of saying goodbye in German is “Auf Wiedersehen” but it is much more common to hear people say “bis den” (until then) or “tschüß” (‘bye).
I’m sorry - “Es tut mir lied” (I’m sorry) or Entschuldigung (pardon me).
I didn’t understand that/I don’t understand - Ich verstehe das nicht.
What does this cost? - Was kostet das?
Can you speak slower? or Can you say that slowly? - Kannst du langsamer sprechen?
Alles klar is a special phrase in German which directly translates as “everything’s clear”. It is used very commonly and has a number of different meanings.

""Guten Morgen!"" -- Good morning!

It is usually used until about noon. In some areas of Germany, it is only said until 10 a.m.


""Guten Tag!"" -- Good day!

This phrase is usually said between the hours of noon and 6 p.m.


""Guten Abend."" -- Good evening.

This greeting is usually used after 6 p.m


If you are writing, take note that all nouns in German are capitalized.

, Often in English, asking a question is a polite way of saying, ""Hello!"" In German, it is no different.

""Wie geht es Ihnen?"" -- How are you? (formal)
""Geht es Ihnen gut?"" -- Are you well?

""Sehr erfreut."" -- Nice to meet you.

To respond: ""Gut, danke."" -- I'm fine, thank you.
""Es geht mir sehr gut."" -- I'm very well.
""Ziemlich gut."" -- I'm rather well.



If you are asked a question such as this, it is customary to respond with, ""Und Ihnen?"" -- And you? (formal)

, In every culture or region, there is a different standard of greeting, be it bowing, hugging, or hand-shaking. Germany is a bit different than the rest of Europe.


People in Germany usually prefer to greet non-family members with handshakes instead of the cheek kissing that is customary in most of Europe; however, cheek kissing is still a common type of greeting in many German-speaking countries.
The rules regarding the number of kisses to give and knowing when and who to kiss change from place to place. When you meet someone for the first time, you can usually just shake hands. Then just watch how other people interact. You'll quickly recognize the pattern.

Say goodbye before a trip with ""Gute Reise!""",How to Say Goodbye in German," This is the most formal and traditional way to say ""goodbye"" in German.Pronounce ""Auf Wiedersehen"" as:

owf vee-der-say-en


Even though this is the phrase most German classes probably teach first, it's somewhat old-fashioned, so you won't hear it spoken much by native Germans in casual settings. It's similar to saying ""farewell"" in English.
Reserve this phrase to professional settings and other formal circumstances, especially when you're speaking with someone unfamiliar and wish to demonstrate a high level of respect or admiration.
To make the phrase slightly less formal, you could also shorten it to “Wiedersehen.”;
, When speaking informally, this phrase is probably the most common way of saying goodbye in German.


Pronounce ""Tschüss"" as:

chuuss


The English equivalent of ""Tschüss"" would probably be ""bye"" or ""bye-bye"" rather than ""goodbye."" Even though it's considered to be an informal way of bidding farewell, you should be able to use it with friends and strangers alike in most circumstances.

, When you're saying ""goodbye"" to someone you know relatively well, you can use ""Mach's gut.""Pronounce ""Mach's gut"" as:

mahxs goot


The phrase literally means ""do well"" (""Mach's"" is a conjugated form of ""do,"" and ""gut"" means ""good"" or ""well""). Translated more loosely, however, the phrase is essentially the equivalent of the English, ""Take care!""

, When you're separating from friends in a fairly casual setting, you can use ""Bis bald"" to say ""see you soon"" or ""bye for now.""Pronounce ""Bis bald"" as:

biss bahllt


""Bis"" is a conunction meaning ""until,"" and ""bald"" is an adverb meaning ""soon,"" so a fairly direct translation would be ""until soon.""
There are several other phrases that are similar in both construction and meaning:

""Auf bald"" (owf bahllt), meaning ""onto soon"" or ""see you soon""
""Bis dann"" (biss dahn), meaning ""until then""
""Bis später"" (biss speetahr), meaning ""until later""



, Essentially, this is a polite yet informal way to say ""see you later"" when speaking with friends and acquaintances.


Pronounce ""Wir sehen uns"" as:

veer zeehn oons


You would leave the phrase at this if you do not know when you'll see each other next, but if you've made plans for your next meeting, it would be better to add ""dann"" (dahn) to the end of the phrase: ""Wir sehen uns dann."" This changes the meaning to ""see you then.""

, This means ""have a good day"" in German, and you can generally use it with loved ones and strangers alike.


Pronounce ""Schönen Tag"" as:

shoon-ehn tahg


You may also hear this spoken as ""Schönen Tag noch,"" (shoon-ehn tahg noc), which is actually the full version of the phrase.
Similarly, you can use ""Schönes Wochenende"" (shoon-eh vahk-ehn-end-ah) if you wish to say ""have a good weekend"" rather than ""have a good day.""

, This is a popular, informal way of saying “bye,” but its usage is primarily restricted to Austria and Bavaria. The greeting is not used often—if ever—in Germany.


Pronounce ""Servus"" as:

zehr-foos


Essentially, ""Servus"" is another way of saying ""bye"" rather than ""goodbye."" It's fairly polite, but it is considered informal, so it's best used in casual conversations.
Note that this is not the only way of saying ""goodbye"" in Austria or Bavaria. You can still use ""Tschüs,"" ""Auf Wiedersehen,"" and other German farewell greetings in either country.

, Like “Servus,” “Ade” is another German farewell greeting restricted by geographic location. This one is heard most commonly in Baden-Württemberg, a German state located in the southwest.


Pronounce ""Ade"" as:

ah-dee


This term is actually somewhat formal, so you should translate it as ""goodbye"" or ""farewell"" rather than ""bye."" You can use it in nearly any setting, but you'll hear it in professional settings and other formal venues more often than you'll hear it spoken casually.
Additionally, you can still use ""Auf Wiedersehen,"" ""Tschüs,"" and other German greetings in Baden-Württemberg. You're not restricted to ""Ade"" only.

, This is the German equivalent of saying “good night” in English.


Pronounce ""Gute Nacht"" as:

goo-tuh nakht


""Gute"" means ""good,"" and ""Nacht"" means ""night.""
The other ""good"" phrases, like ""Gute Morgen"" (good morning) and ""Gute Abend"" (good evening), are usually used as greetings. Unlike these phrases, though, ""Gute Nacht"" is almost always used when parting ways at the end of the night or when saying ""good night"" before going to sleep.

, If you're saying farewell to someone you see on a regular basis, you can use this phrase to say ""see you next time.""


Pronounce ""Bis zum nächsten Mal"" as:

biis zuhm nii-stihn maahl""


The work ""nächsten"" means ""next,"" and ""Mal"" means ""time."" Essentially, this phrase means ""until next time"" or ""see you next time.""
You can use this with anyone you see regularly. This can include coworkers, classmates, family members, or other regulars at an eating establishment you frequent.

, There are multiple ways to end the conversation when you're talking with someone on the phone, but ""Wir sprechen uns bald"" is one of the most common. It means ""we'll speak soon.""


Pronounce ""Wir sprechen uns bald"" as:

veer spray-heen oons baahld


Another appropriate phrase would be ""Wir sprechen uns später,"" which means ""we'll speak later."" Pronounce this phrase as:

veer spray-heen oons speetahr



, This phrase means ""have a good trip,"" so it's a great way to bid farewell to someone before that person leaves on any trip.


Pronounce ""Gute Reise"" as:

goo-tuh rai-suh


The term ""Gute"" means ""good,"" and ""Reise"" means ""travel,"" ""trip,"" or ""journey."" As such, the phrase translates directly as ""good trip.""

"
"
""Ich"": means ""I"".,
""vermisse"": is derived from the infinitive ""vermissen"" meaning ""to miss"".,
""Dich"" means ""you"" (as an object pronoun) and is pronounced exactly like the first word ""Ich"", except that it is preceded by a .

,
Finished.

",How to Say I Miss You in German," The letter 'I' is pronounced as a near-front, near-closed unrounded vowel like the 'i' in ""bit"". The 'ch' part is pronounced as a voiceless palatal fricative , a sound which does not exist in English, but for example in Russian and Gaelic. The closest approximation in English may be 'sh', the voiceless palato-alveolar sibilant . But you can do better than that. Going from , keep on breathing out and relocate your tongue such that the point of highest air friction is half an inch more back in your mouth, between tongue and palate. The result should sound like the very first sound when you say a highly emphatic, highly aspirated ""Yes!"" (or ""Hhhyes!"").


To hear this sound and see both an animation and a video of how it is pronounced, follow this link. Click on ""Frikative"", and then click on the .;
, ""v"" is . In ""er"" the 'r' is not pronounced. The two letters are pronounced as or depending on the local dialect, that is either as a diphthong gliding from open mid-front unrounded ('e' in American ""bed"") to near-open central ('u' in ""but""), or just as near-open central vowel. The ""miss"" is pronounced as an English speaker would expect. It's also the stressed syllable of the word and the whole phrase. It's followed by an ""e"" which is pronounced as a mid-central unrounded vowel like 'a' in ""about"".

, All nouns in German have a gender. Learn the gender when you learn a noun and remember that all nouns must have their gender before it.


Masculine = der
Feminine = die
Neuter = das

, There are four different cases that dictate the endings of adjectives, indefinite articles and which pronoun to use.Nominative: used for the person doing the action
Accusative: used for the person affected by the action
Dative: used to show the indirect object of a verb
Genitive: used to show that something belongs to someone

Simple Past: used for all completed actions
Present Perfect: used for completed actions that have relevance in the present
Past Perfect: used to describe a time in the past that is previous to another time in the past
Future: used for all future events
Future Perfect: used to separate two future events from one another

, German word order in a sentence is not the same as English. Typical German word order is: Subject, Verb, Indirect Object, Direct Object. But there are many cases where this isn’t true.


Information should follow importance of: Time, Manner, Place.
Certain conjunctions put the verb at the end of the sentence.
Modal verbs make the second verb go at the end of the sentence.
Relative clauses place the verb at the end of the sentence.
A temporal phrase at the beginning of the sentence means the verb has to come second., Switch between these two ways to approach reading and you will learn better and faster.Casual reading. This is when you read to get a general understanding of the text and don’t focus on specific grammar points or vocabulary. This will improve your general knowledge and help you understand basic overall structure.
Reading with intent. This is when you read with a focus on grammar and vocabulary. You should take notes while you read, refer to a dictionary, and spend a lot of time thinking about why the language is structured the way it is.This will help improve your language awareness and allow you to build foundational knowledge.

, Start with children’s books before you try reading a novel. Read the newspaper before you try to read a legal document. Start with too difficult a text and you’ll quickly get frustrated. Some places to start:


Street signs.
Text on packaging.
Picture books.
Comic books.
Fairy tales.
News articles.

, It’s important to be consistent when learning a new language. The mind needs time to process new vocabulary and grammar concepts. Repetition is an important part of the process. Ask yourself these questions if you’re getting stuck or falling behind:


What is preventing you from maintaining regular practice?
Are you getting frustrated due to unrealistic expectations?
Do you need to create or revise your learning plan?
Can you relate your learning to something in your life that truly interests you?

, Take a look at your notes from the beginning of your studies. What have you learned? How much have you progressed? Focus on what you achieved as opposed to what you didn’t achieve. Learning a language is a lifelong process.

, Before you can begin learning vocabulary and phrases, it’s a good idea to learn the alphabet in German. Because German words are pronounced as their written, knowing how to say the alphabet will help you with pronunciation.


The alphabet in German has the same 26 letters as the English alphabet. There are four additional sounds that are not included in the actual alphabet: ä, ö, ü, and ß (which is increasingly written as “ss”).You pronounce the letters in the German alphabet as follows: a- ah; b- bay; c- tsay; d- day; e- ay; f- eff; g- gay; h- hah; i- eeh; j yot; k- kah; l- ell; m- emm; n- enn; o oh; p- pay; q- koo; r- err; s- es; t- tay; u- oo; v- fow; w- vay; x icks; y- oop-si-lohn; z- tset.You pronounce the additional letters as follows: ä similar to the e in melon; ö similar to the i in girl; ü no equivalent in English; ß double s sound.
To hear how the alphabet sounds, listen the pronunciation video at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e6vquyjxImk. A native German speaker walks you through each sound.There are several diphthongs, or combinations of letters, in German that are useful to know: th- tay; sch- shh. Vowel diphthongs, like “ie” or “ei” are always pronounced like the second letter. Thus, “die” (the) is pronounced like “dee” and “Eier” (eggs) sounds like “eye-er.”
There are some additional vowel diphthongs that you should know: ai- eye; au- ow; äu- oy; ea- ay ah; ee- ay; eu- oy; ui- oo ee., Now that you’ve got the basics with the alphabet, you’re ready to learn the German pronunciation. This will help you learn how to order food without confusing your waiter.


Unlike English, you pronounce German words just as they’re written. That is, you say each syllable, making famously long German words like Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung (ge-shvin-dig-kites-be-grenz-oong) (speed limit) relatively easy to pronounce.
Unlike English, German has very few exceptions to this rule. For example, you won’t need to learn that “rough” and “although” have different sounds. The words “sprechen” (to speak) and “rechen” (to rake) sound exactly the same.
Here are some examples of food words that show how German pronunciation follows its spelling: Wasser (vah-ss-er, water); Cola (koh-la, soda); Saft (sah-eff-t, juice); Bier (beer, beer); Wein (vine, wine);Frühstuck (froo-stoock, breakfast); Abendessen (ah-bend-ess-enn, dinner); Suppe (soo-puh, soup); Käse (kay-suh, cheese); Fleisch (fly-sh, meat); Nudeln (noo-dell-enn, noodles or pasta); Obst (oh-b-st, fruit).

, There are some key phrases in German that anyone ordering food or visiting a restaurant should know. Learning these will make your culinary experience easier and more pleasant.


The words for “yes” and “no” in German are “ja” and “nein.” If you want to say “I would like,” the German equivalent is “Ich möchte…”
Many restaurants in German-speaking Europe allow you to seat yourself, but if not, you can ask for a table by saying “Ein Tisch für zwei, bitte” (A table for two, please.).
If you have a reservation at a restaurant, you say “Ich habe eine Reservierung um neunzehn Uhr” (I have a reservation at seven.).
Most restaurants will post a copy of their menu on the outside so that people can see what they offer, but you can also see a menu by asking: “Kann ich die Speisekarte bitte anschauen” (May I see the menu?).
Once you’ve looked at the menu and want to order food, say “Wir möchten etwas zum Essen bestellen” (We would like to order something to eat.).
If you only want to get a drink, for example at a bar- called a Lokal or Bar in German- you can say “Wir möchten nur ein Getränk bestellen” (We would only like to order a drink.).
If you are a vegetarian or vegan, you can ask “Haben Sie vegetarisches/ veganes Essen” (Do you have vegetarian/ vegan food?).
If you are allergic to something, you would say “Ich bin gegen Fisch allergisch” (I’m allergic to fish.).

, In addition to knowing key phrases to use when ordering, you’ll also want to learn vocabulary that you can use in any food-related situation from a restaurant to a bar or grocery story. The following is a basic list of food and drink vocabulary that you’ll see often.


All nouns in German are capitalized. This will help you identify food-related vocabulary on a menu.Drinks: Wasser (water) (Sprüdelwasser, Stilles (carbonated water; still water); Cola (soda); Milch (milk); Saft (juice); Bier (beer); Wein (Weisswein, Rotwein, Rosé (wine, white wine, red wine, rosé); Cocktail (cocktail).
Food: Frühstuck (breakfast); Mittagsessen (lunch); Abendessen (dinner); Vorspeise (appetizer); Hauptgericht (main course); Dessert/ Nachtisch (dessert); Salat (salad); Suppe (soup); Käse (cheese); Fleisch (meat); Nudeln (noodles or pasta); Gemüse (vegetables); Obst or Früchte (fruit).
Spices and Sauces: scharf (spicy); salzig (salty); Salz (salt); Pfeffer (pepper); Senf (mustard); Ketchup (ketchup); Essig (vinegar); Öl (oil).
Cutlery terms: Löffel (spoon); Gabel (fork); Messer (knife); Teller (plate); Schale (bowl); Glas (glass); Tasse (cup); Serviette (napkin).

, There are regional differences in vocabulary and pronunciations between the Germans, Austrians, and Swiss, just as there are differences between Americans, Canadians, the English, and Australians. Knowing this will prepare you for different sounds and words when ordering you food in these different places.


Switzerland, in particular, has a very different dialect, called Swiss-German or Schwiizerdüütsch, to that spoken in Germany or Austria. It is almost unintelligible even to native German speakers.Some examples of differences you might encounter when ordering food: Brötchen (roll) is used in Northern Germany, while Semmel and Mütschli are used in Bavaria/ Austria and Switzerland, respectively; Sprüdel or Sprüdelwasser (carbonated water) is called Mineral in Austria; Pilze (mushrooms) are Schwammerl in Bavaria and Austria, and Champignons in Switzerland.

, Every country has different customs restaurants or food stands. Learning about food and restaurant culture will help you avoid unpleasant situations or offending people.


Europeans generally spend more time in restaurants enjoying the food and conversations than eating quickly and leaving. It’s thus not uncommon to wait longer for servers to arrive at your table, take orders, deliver food, or collect your payment.There are still many places that do not take credit cards, so always make sure you have enough cash. Tipping is generally 5-10%.If you want to get your server’s attention, put your hand up in the air and make eye contact.
It’s not uncommon to sit at a table with people you don’t know, especially in traditional restaurants (called Gaststätten) or beer gardens (Biergarten)., If you find a restaurant that looks nice and you decide to try it out, it may or may not have a host who seats you. Either way, there are a couple of useful phrases that will help you find a seat in any location.


Remember that it’s not uncommon to be seated with people you don’t know, especially if the restaurant has longer family-style table.
If you’re in a restaurant with a host or hostess, ask for a table by saying “Ein Tisch für zwei, bitte” (Table for two, please.).
If you’re in a restaurant or at a food stand and want to know if a table or space is free, you can ask a server or the people at the next table/ seat “Sind diese Plätze noch frei” (Are these seats taken?) or “ist hier noch frei” (is this available?).

, If you need a menu or are just interested in the daily specials that many restaurants in German-speaking offer, you can ask your server, the host/ hostess, or the bartender.


If you want to see a regular menu, ask “Kann ich die Speisekarte bitte anschauen?” (May I see the menu?”).
If you are interested in daily specials, which are often local specialties, you can ask your server “Gibt es eine Tageskarte?” (Are there daily specials?).
Many restaurants now offer the so-called “Businesslunch,” a fabricated “English” word that simply means the restaurant offers a lunch special that usually comes with a soup or salad, a main course, a dessert and coffee.

, German-speaking Europe has wonderful cuisine and an equally wonderful selection of drinks and local specialty beverages. Knowing your various options and the names for them will help you make an informed choice that you’re sure to enjoy.


If you’re interested in ordering in beer, ask your server “Was für Bier haben Sie?” (What kind of beer do you have?). The word for brewery is “Brauerei” and it’s not uncommon to see “Bräustüberl” that are restaurants affiliated with a specific brewery.
If you want to ask your server to suggest a beer, ask “Können Sie ein Bier empfehlen?” (Can you suggest a beer?).
Know that a beer is not a Bier. While the German word for beer is Bier, you almost never order by saying “Ich möchte ein Bier” (I would like a beer). Every region has its specialty beers and names to go with them. In Cologne for example, you may want to try Kölsch, while in Bavaria you might want to try a Weissbier (a wheat beer) or a Helles, which is similar to a Pilsner. In the north, you’re likely to find Pils, which is a Pilsener to English speakers.
If you want to see the wine list, say “Kann ich die Weinkarte bitte anschauen?” (May I see the wine list please?). If you want your server to suggest a wine, ask “Können Sie einen Wein empfehlen?” (Can you suggest a wine?).
Germany, Austria, and Switzerland have incredible wine cultures. Beyond Germany’s famous Riesling, try out local vintages like Silvaner in Rheinhessen, Grüner Veltliner or Zweigelt in Austria, or St. Saphorin in Switzerland.
A “Schorle” is generally fruit juice spritzer, thus “eine Apfelschorle” is an apple juice spritzer. If you want a wine spritzer, though, you’d order a “Weisswein Spritzer.”
Restaurants in German-speaking Europe don’t generally serve tap water. If you ask for “ein Wasser,” for example, you’ll get bottled water. For tap water, ask for Leitungswasser, but know that the server may get irritated by this request., Once you’ve ordered your drinks, you’re ready for the main event- your meal. Germany, Austria, and Switzerland all have excellent local cuisines that serve everything from Wiener Schnitzel to Maultaschen and Käsefondue. But if you’re not in the mood for typically heavier Germanic fare, you also have many options, especially in larger cities like Berlin, Vienna, or Zurich.


Most restaurants in larger cities and towns will have menus in German and English if you’re not entirely comfortable with a German menu. Likewise, most people in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland speak some English, especially in service positions. Don’t be surprised if your attempts to order in German are answered in English. Your server is likely trying to make you comfortable or try out their own English.
If you’re ready to order you can say either “Wir möchten bestellen” (We would like to order or “wir sind soweit” (we’re ready, which is less formal).
As you order each course, say “Ich hätte xx gern.” (I would like…) For example, if you want a small salad to start, you would say “Ich hätte den Beilagensalat gerne als Vorspeise” (I’d like the side salad as an appetizer, please.). For your main course you can say “Als Hauptgericht hätte ich das Wiener Schnitzel gern” (I’d like the Wiener Schnitzel, please).
Ordering dessert is formulated a bit differently: “Zum Dessert hätte ich den Schwarzwäldertorte gern” (I’d like the Black Forest Cherry Cake for dessert, please).
Know that some restaurants still allow smoking, though it’s becoming increasingly uncommon. If you want to smoke, ask “Kann man hier rauchen?” (Can I smoke here?).
If you need to use the washroom, ask “Wo ist die Toilette?” (where is the washroom?).

, If you’ve finished eating and you’re ready to pay for your meal, ask “Kann ich die Rechnung bitte haben?” (May I have the check please?) or say “Zahlen, bitte” (I’d like to pay, please.).

Give a personalized apology.",How to Apologize in Spanish," Perdón is essentially the Spanish equivalent to the English ""pardon"" or ""excuse me.""



""perdón"", pronounced ""perr-donn"" can be used in most minor, everyday incidents, such as accidentally bumping into someone or interrupting someone.
Alternatively, you can say ""perdóname"", pronounced ""perr-donn-ah-may"", to give a more direct apology.;
, The word disculpa, which translates as ""apology"" or ""excuse"" and is pronounced as ""dees-kool-pah"" can be used to mean ""forgive me."" It is appropriate for minor incidents in which you need to excuse yourself. It can be used in the same situations as perdón.


When making an informal apology you would say ""tú disculpa;"" but when making a formal apology you would say ""usted disculpe."" When you say ""tú disculpa"" or ""usted disculpe"", you are literally saying ""you forgive me"", though it's an imperative.
As a result, ""tú disculpa"" and ""usted disculpe"" are listener-oriented apologies, because they make the listener the subject of the sentence. This structure, which is common in Spanish, places the emphasis on the listener's ability to forgive you rather than on your own feelings of regret.
Alternatively, you can just say ""'discúlpame"", pronounced ""dees-kool-pah-meh"", which simply means ""forgive me"" or ""excuse me"" (informal).

, Lo siento, which literally means ""I feel it,"" is the phrase that most novice Spanish speakers will learn as the all-purpose apology.


You can also say ""lo siento mucho"" or ""lo siento muchísimo,"" meaning ""I'm so sorry"" or ""I'm very sorry."" Another variation with the same meaning is ""cuánto lo siento."" ( how sorry I am)
This apology is appropriate for serious situations such as the death of a loved one, a break-up, or a firing or layoff.

Lo siento is pronounced as ""loh syenn-toh"".

, Lo lamento literally means ""I regret it."" It can be used in place of lo siento to express remorse in more serious situations.


To say ""I'm terribly sorry"", you can use the phrase ""lo lamento mucho"", pronounced ""loh lah-menn-toh moo-cho"".

, To say this, use the phrase ""siento lo ocurrido,"" which is pronounced as ""syenn-toh loh oh-coo-ree-doh"".

, To say this, use the phrase ""mil disculpas"", which is pronounced ""meel dees-kool-pahs"".

, To say this, use the phrase ""te debo una disculpa"", which is pronounced as ""tay day-boh oo-nah dees-kool-pah"".

, To say this, use the phrase ""le ruego me disculpe"" (informal), which is pronounced as ""lay rway-go may dees-kool-pay"".

, To say this, use the sentence ""Pido perdón por las cosas que he dicho"", which is pronounced as ""Pee-doh perr-donn por las koh-sas kay ay dee-cho"".

, To say ""I was wrong"", use the phrase""me equivoqué"", pronounced ""may eh-kee-boh-kay"". To say ""it's my fault"" use the phrase ""es culpa mía"", pronounced ""ess kool-pah me-ah"".

Making a slight or deep bow, or a slight or deep curtsy.
Removing your hat.
Where shaking hands is appropriate, use a good, firm hand grip and shake confidently without being rough or holding on for too long.

, Some examples include:


Try ""hi"", ""hey"", or ""hello"". ""Hey"" is most often heard most among ""Gen Y"", so it's best to use it with the younger crowd (but you may find Gen X using it too). ""Hi"" is usually fine for many people but hello is a standard and polite way to greet informally when you're unsure, or the person is much older than you, or unfamiliar to you.
Try ""greetings!"" or ""salutations"". Each of these makes sense but to many ears will sound a bit old-fashioned and may alert the listener to you having learned your English from a rather old book.
Try ""How are you?"" or ""Great to meet you/see you"".

, If you wanted to make a good impression on someone you're meeting for the first time, you may want to shake hands.

, If you are in a group with its own more familiar forms of greetings, learn what is said, then repeat it. For example, you might say: ""hey,"" ""whassup?"" and ""what's crack-a-lackin'?"" Personalize your greetings once you feel confident enough to do so. If you're not sure, ask a friend to confirm that what you're saying is okay.

, English is the language of other languages and soaks up foreign words and renews them as English all the time. You'll likely find that most people understand ""hola,"" ""bonjour,"" and ""namaste."" Just don't overdo it or try it out on formal occasions.

, For example, ""'Sup, Tom!""

, You never know until you give it go."

Obtain print and audio materials for learning Punjabi.,
Take a Punjabi course or get a Punjabi tutor.,
Immerse yourself in the Punjabi community and culture.,
Listen to Punjabi.,
Read Punjabi.,
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.",How to Get Started Learning Punjabi," Many publishers such as Travel Guide, Teach Yourself, and Assimil offer an array of phrase books, textbooks, tapes, CDs, and other learning materials to get you started learning Punjabi. Do your homework on what's available and invest in what works for you.


Don't forget a dictionary. A dictionary can help you when your language materials are short on expressions, words, or other language tid bits. In general, dictionaries may be difficult to find because Punjabi is not as common a language to learn as say Italian, Hindi, or Chinese, but they do exist if you know where to look/shop. Try Amazon.com;
, Many people feel more confident being taught their target language by a native speaker. If you have access to a local Indian community, ask around and check out their community centres and Sikh temples regarding available classes and tutors. Verbalplanet.com has available Punjabi tutors you can Skype at times that suit your lifestyle.

, Language and culture are inseparable elements; you need to know both in order to understand the nuances of the people behind the language, and language behind the people. Attend Sikh religious and cultural events, shop at Punjabi stores, eat Punjabi cuisine, make Punjabi-speaking friends, etc.

, This is important for getting a feel for the ebb and flow of the language. Listen to as much of the language as you can---eavesdrop on conversations, listen to Punjabi music and radio programs, watch Punjabi television. You don't have to understand a single word, just absorb the language like a baby.

, Presuming that you're studying outside India or Pakistan, the Punjabi diaspora is a very literate one rich in community newspapers, bilingual signage, and small libraries filled with books for both children and adults. Learn how to read Punjabi and then start reading whatever you can get your hands on, first for pronunciation and later for comprehension. Reading opens your doors into new culture and new thinking, it builds vocabulary and language skills, and it teaches you how native speakers use their own language naturally and creatively.


Punjabi uses any one of three writing systems: Gurmukhī, Shahmukhī, and Devanagari. Gurmukhi is the official script used in India's Punjab state as well as both the most commonly used script in the Punjabi diaspora and the script in which the Sikh holy scriptures are written in. Shahmukhi is an Arabic-based script and is used officially in Pakistan and among Punjabi-speaking Muslims. Devanagari is used by Punjabi-speaking Hindus and is the same script used in writing Hindi and Sanskrit.

, Try not to be intimidated if your grammar is broken, your vocabulary is limited, or your comprehension is poor. It will come with time and practice. People learn best from their mistakes and native speakers will be more than happy to correct you.

Learn to conjugate your verb into future tense.,
Learn to conjugate your verb into the conditional tense.,
Learn to conjugate your verb into the subjunctive tense.",How to Conjugate Any Verb in Any Tense in Spanish," Once you have chosen your verb, look at the last two letters in its ending. All verbs fall into three verb categories by their endings: -ar, -er, or -ir. For instance, if you were to look at the simple verbs hablar (to speak) or comer (to eat), you would see that they end in -ar or -er.;
, These will affect the process of conjugating the verb. They are known as ""I', you, he/she/you formal, we, and they/you all."" Translated to Spanish, they are yo, tú, él/ella/usted, nosotros, vosotros, and ellos/ellas/ustedes.

, The ar, er, and ir verbs all conjugate in a similar manner. However, they are different in key areas to make the stress remain on the same syllable of a tense to keep the sound shape. For instance, piso (yo) - which is present tense - places stress on the first syllable. Meanwhile, pisó (él) - which is past tense - stresses on the second syllable.


Saying the two tenses out loud will help you manage better.
You can add some mental help to further understand the difference. For instance, Yo piso ahora and Él pisó ayer.


, In order to correctly conjugate your verb, first look at the subject in order to determine what ending your verb will have. Once you have found your subject, drop the -ar, -er, or -ir from your verb and replace it with the appropriate ending. For instance, the sentence ""I speak"" would become ""Yo hablo."" The original word hablar loses the -ar and is replaced with an -o. Note that this rule applies to all tenses (past, present, and future).


For all present tense verbs that end with -ar, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -o, -as, -a, -amos, -ais, or -an. For instance, the word ""I listen"" would become ""Yo escucho.""
For all present tense verbs that end with -er, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -o, -es , -e , -emos, -eis, or -en. For instance, the sentence ""I eat"" would become ""Yo como.""
For all present tense verbs that end with -ir, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -o, -es, -e, -imos, -ís, or -en. For instance, the sentence ""I open"" would become ""Yo abro.""

, Preterite tense refers to events and/or actions that (a) have already occurred at certain time, (b) have been performed more than once, or (c) have occurred during a period of time (ex: a year). The same rules mentioned above can be applied to your verb, only there will be different endings. In this case, -er and -ir verbs have the same endings.


For all preterite tense verbs that end with -ar, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, or -aron. For instance, the sentence ""I spoke"" would become ""Yo hablé.""
For all preterite tense verbs that end with -er or -ir, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, or -ieron. For instance, the sentences ""I ate"" and ""I opened"" would become ""Yo comí"" and ""Yo abrí.""

, The imperfect tense is simply used for repeated events or ones that don't end in one instance. Examples would be going to school or work. For instance, the sentence ""I went to the store every day"" would be ""Yo iba a la tienda todos los días."" The same rules mentioned above can be applied to your verb, only there will be different endings. In this case, -er and -ir verbs will have the same endings. They all have accents on the ""i"" to keep the stress on the vowel.


For imperfect tense verbs that end with -ar, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -aba, -abas, -aba, -ábamos,-abais, or -aban.
For imperfect tense verbs that end with -er or -ir, drop the ending and replace it with one of the following: -ía, -ías, -ía, -iamos,-íais, or -ían.

, This tense refers to English verbs that end in -ing. For this, you would use the word estar (to be) and place it before your verb. Then, you can conjugate it according to the tense you're using (present, preterite, or imperfect). Remove the last two letters from your verb before replacing them with the proper ending. The -ar verbs would use the ending -ando while -er and -ir verbs would use -iendo. For instance, the sentences ""I am speaking"" and ""I am eating"" would become ""Estoy hablando"" and ""Estoy comiendo.""


Estar in preterite would be estuve, estuviste, estuvo, estuvimos, estuvimos, and estuvieron.

Estar in present would be estoy, estas, esta, estamos, and estan.

Estar in imperfect would be estaba, estabas, estaba, estabamos, and estaban.


, These two tenses allow you to use a past event and bring it into the present. For present perfect, the formula is ""haber (to have) + present participles."" The word haber in the present perfect is conjugated as he, has, ha, hemos, habeis, or han. The same goes for past perfect (also known as pluscuamperfecto). But instead of using the earlier conjugation of haber, you conjugate it as había, habías, había, habíamos, habíais, or habían with an accent on all the letter i's.

, This tense will allow you to talk about events that will happen in the future. All regular verbs follow the single conjugation -é, ás, á, emos, eis, and án with an accent on the endings marked so. All -ar, -er, and -ir verbs will use those endings for future tense. However, in this case, you won't be dropping any of the verb endings. Instead, you'll add the ending to the verb. For instance, the sentence ""I will kill you"" would be ""Yo te mataré.""

, Conditional works in a similar manner as the future tense when it comes to conjugation. It's used to talk about ""what would/could"" happen in the future. It's less commonly used, but you only need to conjugate all regular verbs with ía, ías, ía, íamos, íais, or ían, remembering to add an accent on all the i's. For this tense, you won't need to drop any of the verb endings. Instead, fix the ending onto the end of the word (ex: hablaría).

, It is more of a mood than a tense. It allows you to describe any events/actions that cause doubt, hope, wish, desire, emotion, or impersonal/passive phrases starting with se. Place the independent clause first, which is the normal verb that begins the subjunctive. Then, add the word que (that), which links the independent and dependent clauses together sa one whole phrase. The final part is the dependent clause, which is the verb conjugated in the subjunctive. For instance, the sentence ""I doubt that he might (ever) buy the house"" would become ""Dudo que compre la casa.""

To conjugate in the subjunctive, take the yo form of the verb and drop the -o from it. Then, replace it with the appropriate ending.

For -ar verbs, the endings are: -e, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, and -en. For instance, the word ""hablar"" would become ""hable.""
For -er and -ir verbs, the endings are: -a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, and -an. For instance, the words ""comer"" and ""vivir"" would become ""coma"" and ""viva.""

The alphabet and its pronunciation have a very important role in Malay, so you will want to learn this as thoroughly as possible before attempting to master Malay words. Here are the letters of the Malay alphabet:a: pronounced as in “father”
b: pronounced as in “bay”
c: pronounced ,“ch” as in “chay”
d: pronounced as in “day”
e: pronounced as in “elephant”
f: pronounced as in “fine”
g: pronounced as in “gold”
h: pronounced as in “house”
i: pronounced ,“ee” as in “meat”
j: pronounced as in “job”
k: pronounced as in “kitchen”
l: pronounced as in “life”
m: pronounced as in “man”
n: pronounced as in “nice”
o: pronounced as in “olive”

z: pronounced as in “Zulu”
ng: pronounced as in “hanging”
ny: prounced as in mañana
kh: pronounced as in “bach”
sy: pronounced as in “shield”
nng: pronounced as in “bingo”;
, If possible, speak with a native Malay speaker, or simply listen to him talk. This will help you to detect the way he intonates his speech and the general rhythm of the Malay language. This can help you learn to speak Malay much quicker than looking at the words alone.


If you don’t know a native Malay speaker, try searching for videos of Malay language on YouTube. Hearing the language will help you grasp it better. Searching “Counting in Malay” is a good place to begin.
Attempt to find a video that features a person who seems very comfortable with the language and possibly introduces him or herself as a native speaker.
Note that emphasis regularly falls on the penultimate syllable in a word in Malay.Understanding the verbal consistencies of the language can help you become a more natural speaker.

, Understanding the role of numbers in the structure of the Malay language is the first step of being able to count in Malay. Similar to many other languages, Malay uses both cardinal and ordinal numbers (similar to how we speak in English), but cardinal numbers will be the ones that you use for counting to ten.


Malay cardinal numbers convey “how many.” These numbers are also known as the “counting numbers” because they describe a quantity.
Malay ordinal numbers tell the order of things in a set (for example, first, second, third, etc.). These numbers do not show quantity, but instead show rank, order, or position.

, In order to learn to count to ten, you should familiarize yourself with the numbers from one to ten and be able to recognize them by sight, as well as be able to pronounce them correctly. As a next step, you should learn to spell these words correctly.


1 - satu (pronounced “sat-too”)
2 - dua (pronounced “doo-uhh”
3 - tiga (pronounced “tee-guh”)
4 - empat (pronounced “um-paht”)
5 - lima (pronounced “lee-muh”)
6 - enam (pronounced “uhh-nom”)
7 - tujuh (pronounced “too-jew”)
8 - lapan (pronounced “lah-pahn”)
9 - sembilan (pronounced “sem-bee-lan”)
10 – sepuluh (pronounced “seh-poo-loo”)

, Just as learning to speak your native language took practice, so will learning Malay. Consistent practice will help you master counting to ten in Malay.


Use Malay for counting everyday objects. Instead of counting in English (or your native language), attempt to use Malay for your everyday counting.
Count out loud. Practicing the Malay numbers out loud will help you master them sooner than practicing only in your head.
Quiz yourself. Give yourself a short quiz once every few days to check your progress on learning Malay numbers. Once you confidently know numbers one through ten, you can move on to larger numbers.

, After you have learned to pronounce the numbers, the next step is to use them in phrases and sentences to describe the objects that you are counting, and this means you must learn and understand classifiers. Classifiers are words inserted between numerals and count nouns.Classifiers allow you to identify the type of word you are counting; it is equitable to a unit in English.


For example, “dua buah rumah” would mean “two houses” in Malay.

, When counting and using classifiers, the correct word order is always number + classifier + noun.Practice counting with classifiers. Malay classifiers can be tricky to learn at first, but are an important part of counting objects correctly.""Orang"" is used to count people.
""Ekor"" is used to count animals
""Batang"" is used to count rod-like objects. These include cigarettes, pens, and pencils.
""Buah"" is used to count large or cubical objects. These can include countries, buildings, ships, vehicles, furniture, rooms, and books.
""Biji"" is used to count spherical objects. These include items such as cups, fruits, and eyes.
""Helai"" is used to count flat and thin objects, including paper and leaves.
""Pucuk"" is used to count firearms, letters, and needles.
""Bilah"" is used to count bladed objects, including knives, axes, and other weapons.
""Keping"" is used to count flat thick objects. This includes objects like wooden planks.
""Ketul"" is used to count hard and objects with irregular shape such as pebbles.
""Bentuk"" is used to count finger-rings and fishing-hooks.
""Buku"" is used to count loaves of bread.
""Kuntum"" is used to count flowers individually.
""Pintu"" is used to count shop-houses or terrace houses.
""Rawan"" is used to count fishing-nets.



, Classifiers can refer to a single or several of the people/objects to which they refer. Plurality can be expressed by words such as “bəbərapa” meaning “some,” or “səmua” meaning “all.”


Replication can also be used to express plurality: for example, “buku-buku” means “many books.”, Becoming confident in your counting ability means being able to use classifiers and numbers comfortably in phrases. Once you have learned the numbers one to ten in Malay, it is time to start using them in phrases, and eventually in full sentences.


First, learn to say the numbers 1-10 as a child would learn to count (“one, two, three, four…”).
Next, start pairing your numbers with vocabulary words.
Finally, make sure you memorize and include the correct classifier! Here are some simple phrases that can be used for practice.

Lima ekor anjing = “five dogs”
Dua buah pulau = “two islands”
Lapan biji pisang = “eight bananas”
Lima bilah pisau = “five knives”
Tujuh kuntum tulip = “seven tulips”
Lima buku roti = “five loaves of bread”

Learn about the culture beforehand.A little knowledge can go a long way.,
Expect differences.,
Understand hierarchies.,
Be upfront about difficulties in communication.,
Be respectful and tolerant.,
Be patient.,
Speak clearly and slowly, if necessary, but do not shout unnecessarily or treat others as though they do not understand.Raising your voice does not make you easier to understand, and can be seen as rude.,
Be proper.,
Brush up on your foreign language skills.,
Try to use the dominant language if you are in the linguistic minority.,
Avoid slang and profanity unless you are absolutely sure how it is used in another culture.Using non-standard or obscene language improperly can make you hard to understand, and may be perceived as very offensive.,
Use “open handed” gestures.,
Assume a formal posture at first.Keep your feet on the floor, sit up straight, don’t use your arms too expressively, and otherwise keep your posture more or less conservative.,
Understand rules regarding touching.Some cultures may expect more physical contact between people when communicating than other cultures do.,
Know how to make or avoid eye contact.,
Expect different facial expressions.It is common for different cultures to use facial expressions differently.,
Respect the amount of personal space the situation requires.Some cultures may require more personal space than others.",How to Communicate Well With People from Other Cultures," If you have time before embarking on a trip or meeting with someone from another culture, try to take time to learn the basic “do’s and dont’s” of that culture. You can find information on this from internet sources such as those provided by the National Center for Cultural Competence., Different cultures will speak at different volumes, be more or less direct in showing emotion, may or may not expect to engage in “small talk,” and exhibit other dissimilarities in communication.When communicating with people from other cultures, be prepared to encounter such differences, including ones that you were not aware of.

, When communicating with a different culture, there may be unwritten rules about social hierarchy that you are not used to.For instance, you may come from a culture where men and women are expected to communicate equally with each other, but may have to interact with someone from a culture where men may do more talking in mixed company. Similarly, you may be communicating with someone who expects that a younger person should let an older person do most of the talking, while you expect people across age groups to communicate equally.

, If you could not understand someone, or think that he or she did not understand you, say something about it. Avoid being rude or offensive, but patiently explain the problem. It’s usually better to be upfront than to let a problem in communication go undressed, since there may otherwise be bigger problems later.


If you think you did not understand what someone meant, try saying something like: “I’m not sure I understood you. Could we go over that again?”
If you think that someone did not understand you, try saying something like: “Let’s review things to make sure we’re all on the same page.” You can also make sure to let the person know to ask questions.

, Each culture has its own set of dominant values, beliefs, and prejudices. Signs of these may emerge when communicating with people from other cultures. Basic communication, however, it is not the time to judge people based on these differences. Instead, respect them for what they are, and tolerate them.You may even learn something new.


Even if cultural differences come up explicitly in conversation, be tolerant and open-minded instead of argumentative. For instance, if you are American and someone comments on Americans’ tendency to be work-focused, say something like: “Yes, it’s true that many Americans take work seriously, and there are a lot of reasons for that. Why don’t you tell me some more about how your culture thinks about work?”

, Communicating with people from other cultures can be enlightening and rewarding, but also have its difficulties. Expect that not everything will come out quite right or be fully understood. Be patient with others, and ask them to be patient with you.

, Likewise, even if there are difficulties in communicating with people from other cultures, do not treat other people as though they are unintelligent. Communication difficulties arise from cultural differences, not because of matters of intelligence.

, Be polite and use formal modes of address until it is made clear that you don’t need to (such as a business contact telling you to use first names).Depending on the cultures that are interacting, this may include addressing others:


By first and last name
By last name alone
With a title such as “Mr.” or “sir”
Using formal pronouns, if they exist in the language used for communicating

, If you will be communicating with people who speak a different language, try to learn a few basic phrases beforehand. Your situation may not require you or permit you to become fluent in the foreign language, but you can still try to learn some.


Practice the basics, including: “Hello,” “Please,” “Thank you,” “How are you?,” etc.
Carry a phrase book or electronic device that can help you find phrases you need and don’t know.
Be patient when others are trying to use your language.

, If you are communicating with people who speak a different language, try to use their language at first, or as much as you can. Even if you can’t say much more than “hello” and “how are you?” in their language, the gesture is usually appreciated.

, Since a language’s slang and profanity are complex and highly dependent on context, it is best to avoid them altogether unless you are absolutely sure you know to use them properly.

, In some cultures, pointing with an index finger, giving the “ok” sign, and other common gestures can be seen as offensive.Since you may not know which gestures could be mistaken in this way, stick to “open handed” gestures.For instance, try using your whole hand if you need to point to something., This is because certain postures can be seen as offensive to others. For instance, showing your foot in some cultures is seen as a rude gesture, so you would not want to cross your legs in a way that your sole sticks out.If it becomes clear that a less formal posture is acceptable, you can follow suit.

, For example, some cultures may shake or touch hands more willingly than others.Don’t take it as offensive if another culture is more or less physical than you are used to when communicating. The exception is if you think you are being violated or abused. If you are uncomfortable, let others know.
It’s a good rule of thumb to be conservative with the way you touch people from other cultures when communicating with them. However, if they appear to use more physical contact, follow suit if you are comfortable doing so.

, In some cultures, looking another person in the eye when you speak is seen as a sign of honesty and interest. In other cultures, however, it may be seen as disrespectful, confrontational, or a sign of sexual interest.Conversely, some cultures think than not looking a superior person in the eye when communicating is a sign of respect., For instance, Americans may smile frequently, while other cultures may see excessive smiling as a sign of shallowness. When communicating with people from other cultures, you may notice that they are more expressive with their face (to show happiness, sadness, frustration, etc.) than you are used to, or you may notice that they do not show much expression at all.


Much communication is non-verbal, no matter what the culture. However, you can focus on the content of what is being said, and ask questions to clarify if you need to. For instance, if someone reacts to something you say with an unexpected smile or laughter, you may need to say “Actually, I'm being I’m serious.”

, If you are communicating with people from another culture and you find they get closer to you or farther away from you than you are used to, it’s not necessarily the case that they are invading your space or trying to avoid you. Just try to follow their cues regarding personal space and communicate as best you can.

Listen to native speakers in natural contexts as much as possible.,
Focus on the unique sounds of the language, including the inflection patterns.

,
Practice speaking every day.,
Practice the sounds in the language which are most difficult for non-native speakers (for example ""ra"" and ""tsu"" in Japanese).

,
Record yourself speaking, then play it back and compare your inflection and pronunciation to that of native speakers.

,
Think in the language as much as possible, instead of thinking in your native language and then translating.

,
Speak as native speakers usually are doing, using idioms and linguistic shortcuts, instead of imitating a textbook, which is often excessively formal and repetitive.

,
Study the grammar.,
Read books, magazine articles, and other ""real life"" material whenever possible.,
Read some material in the language every day.

,
Make a list of new words as you come across them.,
Write something in the language every day.,
Imitate the words of what you've read.

,
Study the literary conventions of the language thoroughly.",How to Become Fluent in a Language," If you can't find live native speakers to eavesdrop on, watch movies and television shows in that language, or listen to books on tape or music in that language.;
,, Try to learn new words and phrases every day. It is also crucial to frequently practice the earlier words you have learned, in addition to newer words. If possible, practice with native speakers, and encourage them to correct you.

,,,,, Grammar books try to explain the rules of the language. The sentence 'This that same is' consists of English words, but isn't grammatically correct.


Make strong efforts to improve and remember specific grammar rules, so as to avoid incomprehensibility or vagueness to native speakers. 'Thinking' in the other language will also become easier and more frequent.
People who speak only one language often assume that the rules of their own language apply to all languages, or that these rules are almost the same everywhere. This is not the case at all. Learning a language requires more effort and commitment than just learning lots of foreign words.
Crash courses often try to play down the importance of studying the grammar. Attempt to opt for a foreign language class, where the teacher may be more adept in helping you better understand grammar rules on a personal and more efficient level.

, Based on vocabulary you have learnt, attempt to translate or at the very least, get a gist of the contents' meaning or aim.

,, Guess the meaning based on the context, visual or auditorial clues before looking them up in a dictionary.

, This could range from a short sentence summing up your day, to a full-page diary entry or article.

,, Sometimes the written version of the language is radically different than the spoken version.

Study the pronunciations of different letter combinations.,
Practice your pronunciation (preferably with a friend who is good at that) so you don't make embarrassing mistakes.

,
If you have to pause between words to work out how to pronounce the next word, stop thinking and speak.,
Check YouTube.,
Watch.",How to Become More Fluent in English (Simple)," For example, consider 'ph'. This doesn't sound like you might think based on the pronunciation of p and h separately. Instead, it sounds like an ""f"". Rare exceptions are usually compound words like haphazard or flophouse.


Ph: Makes an ""f"" sound. Ex: Phoenix (fee-nix. This is just how it is pronounced.) Your top teeth should be on bottom your lip. Your mouth should be kind of open, kind of closed. Now all you have to do is blow gently.
Th: One of the most common consonant sounds in English, but can be difficult to describe to speakers of languages where this sound isn't used. Place your tongue on the bottom of your top front teeth and blow gently like you did when you made the Ph sound. Ex: the word The. The ""e"" in this word can either be pronounced either with a long e (for emphasis) or as a schwa in most other cases.;
,, Your brain will start working out the similar words automatically.

, You get pronunciation advice and you can actually observe how they speak.

, You might have been seeing television shows in your respective language but to improve your English you have to see English shows. For starters, you can watch a version of it in your native language first before watching it in English. You can also find TV shows with subtitles, so you know the pronunciation.

Find others to join in. Get people who can share their experience and knowledge, as well as their time.;
,,


Avoid focusing on a complete language from the start, but rather step by step beginning the process of increasing the ""universal vocabulary that already exists."" This way it is useful from the start. People will not spread or continue to use that which they cannot immediately put into use. Nor will people abandon their own comfortable language to learn something complex. But people create idioms all the time and if a universal language can build on this with only universal words, it's likely to be more effective.

, Words like ""ok"", ""coca-cola"", ""taxi"", ""hotel"", etc.

, Already our universal number system of 1-9 and so on is recognized in all the Americas, Europe, India, Africa, and most Chinese learn this as children. People of almost any language can recognize and read numbers without trouble. It is called the Hindi-Arabic numeral system, though most of us just think of them as numbers. To this day you can write down any large number in almost any country of the world and be understood.

, Simplicity requires that one word, number or meaning can be shown in only one number, letter or symbol. In implementing a universal language, think about extra simplicity to accomplish the task.

, For written Chinese, as difficult as it might look, there are some great lessons to learn. China is divided by seven different spoken languages. And they are not simple dialects; they are distinctly different spoken languages. However, many years ago, they had a leader who merged the several different languages into a single written language not based on pronunciation. To this very day, when two Chinese from different places can't understand each other, they simply have to write and then they understand one another. This is how our written number system of 1-9 works. Only for the Chinese, they can communicate about almost anything on paper. They're not limited to numbers.

, Considering how hard learning new symbols might be it might be easier then learning letter combinations, such as when we learn French or German. That doesn't mean that we have to use such odd looking symbols.


Consider using individual letters for many words such as ""l"", ""b"", ""e"", or symbols like ""@"", € and ""©"". Imagine if the whole world could have its own universal written language, without anyone having to give up their own spoken language. Imagine if Spanish, French and Russians could all understand each other on paper. With the power of the internet, this would have a huge impact.

While your school probably doesn't have an etymology club, it might have other clubs that will make you think more critically about language. A poetry club, for example, might expose you to new language concepts and writers.;
, When getting your bachelor’s degree in college, study something that would inform your career as an etymologist. Good fields include Linguistics, English, Communications, Creative Writing, Journalism, Literature, or Library Science.It is possible to apply to a graduate degree in linguistics without an undergraduate degree in a related field. You will, however, find it to be more difficult than it would be otherwise.

, In order to be an etymologist you will need a Ph.D. in linguistics. Prior to that, you might also need to get a master’s degree in linguistics. When picking a graduate school, you should be particularly mindful that you go somewhere with a professor or professors who focus on etymology.In a Ph.D. program, it is important to find a professor who will serve as your adviser. The status of your adviser is often more important than that of the school more generally.
If at all possible, you should find an adviser whose interests coincide as closely as possible with your own.
You should also try to find an adviser who is well known and respected in the field.

, Most jobs in etymology will require you to teach on the college level. This is a difficult profession to find employment in. To be successful, you will need a record of original research and teaching on the college level.


Only about 40% of new Ph.D.’s in English are able to find employment as a full professor immediately after graduation.Whether you find employment will depend, at least in part, on how strong your record of original research is. To establish this, you will need to present papers at conferences and publish articles in academic journals. You will also be judged on the basis of your dissertation, a large piece that you work on at the end of your Ph.D. program.

, Professional societies hold conferences where you can present papers or learn from the presentations of others. They provide a good opportunity to network with professionals who can help you find employment. They also typically come with a subscription to the society's journal, which will allow you to keep up-to-date with the most recent research in the field.


Relevant professional societies include the Institute of Linguists, International Quantitative Linguistics Association, Linguistic Society of America, Linguistics Association of Great Britain, and the Philological Society., The Journal of Historical Linguistics is a good venue for academic papers pertaining to etymology.Since etymology is not a big field, you might also want to consider journals in linguistics and English that might be interested in work on historical usages.


Prominent linguistics journals include Communication Research, Journal of Memory and Language, Linguistic Inquiry, Language Variation and Change, Discourse Studies, Language in Society, and Mind and Language., Dictionaries like the Oxford English Dictionary still employ professionals to refine their definitions and provide additional etymological context. There is not an overwhelming supply of these jobs, but they will be advertised publicly in job forums and newspapers. Watch carefully for such listings and be prepared to find alternative work until such a job opening appears., Every language has been influenced by the diverse cultures that it has encountered, whether they were trading partners or conquerors. Learning the history of the language you study will give you a sense for where its words might have originated from.


The largest foreign influences on the English language include Latin, French, German, Dutch, Scandinavian, and Greek., Learning other languages, especially those that have influenced your principal language of study, will help you see how word roots are exchanged between languages. Recognizing these “cognates,” terms held in common across languages, will help you understand the building blocks of your language.Recognizing similarities in grammar and sentence structure can also help you understand how languages have influenced each other.

, Etymology is the study of how language evolves over time. An important component of that is seeing how words were used in the past. Finding a new word or a word that is being used in a way that you are unfamiliar with, might send you on a quest to understand that word. That is exactly the sort of research that etymologists perform.Shakespeare could be a good place to start, because he had a huge influence on the development of the English language., Word roots are commonly used in many words, often throughout several languages. Learning roots is essential to understanding how words and languages are related.


Word roots are generally prefixes or suffixes which are short combinations of letters at the beginning or end of the word.
Some of the most common prefixes include “in-,“ “anti-,” and “sub-.”
Some of the most common suffixes include “-able,” “-less,” and “-ness.”, The sounds that letters make change over time and across languages. IPA is a more accurate alphabet, included along with most dictionary definitions, that will allow you to understand how a word was actually pronounced. Understanding this sort of real world pronunciation can be essential for recognizing similarities between words.Vernacular (common speech) pronunciation often differs dramatically from the proper written word. This sort of vernacular can be passed from language to language, creating shared origins that might look different on paper, but are actually very similar.

, Although etymologists typically focus on individual words, rather than the general structure of language, it is important to get a sense for grammar as well. Grammar can also be exchanged from one language to another. For practical reasons, it is also important to understand grammar because professional etymologists will need to be successful in linguistics programs., Most dictionaries will include some comments on where a word comes from. Some, however, have particularly detailed descriptions of a word’s origins and evolution. The Oxford English Dictionary is the premiere source for studying the origins of words.

, Understanding etymology will give you a better sense of language that can help you become a better writer. It will be easier to build a bigger vocabulary and remember words if you know how words are related.Understanding what words have meant over time will also give a more nuanced understanding of their definition and help you understand when they are appropriate to use.


Utilizing the multiple definitions of words can also allow for word play.

, The study of words was originally developed, in large part, to better understand religion. If we don’t properly understand the words that are used in ancient religious texts, we can misinterpret the underlying message. Debates about the proper way to interpret religion often depend heavily upon proving the ancient meaning of words., As with religious texts, understanding the original meaning of words can be important for understanding historical documents and beloved literary works. Sometimes this sort of research has important practical significance.For example, today many people are debating whether the constitution permits the Republican Ted Cruz to run for President. This debate hinges entirely on how the founder understood the term “natural born citizen.” To determine the answer, scholars have studied how the term was used in debates and contemporary laws."

Ask yourself what your mother tongue means to you.,
Treat all languages as equal.,
Treat all cultures and people as equal.,
Read as much as you can about language communities, both thriving and dying.,
Support the learning of foreign languages.,
Continue speaking your own language.",How to Care About Endangered Languages," Whether the language you were brought up speaking is English, Japanese, Cherokee, or Chulym, it has value to you. It is how you see your world and it is what you are most comfortable using.


While you contemplate that, imagine yourself in a situation where you and one other person are the only two people left in the world who speak your mother tongue. How would would you feel? Would you defend it? Protect it? What would the world lose when they lose the language you live and breathe?;
, No one language is more or less important than any other.

, No one person or culture is more or less important than any other. We all have a message and something to bring the world.

, You have to know about language communities and why languages are fading from the planet. You also have to learn about what languages contain and why they are worth preserving. A few Joe Average friendly book suggestions include:


Trip of the Tongue: Cross Country Travels In Search of America's Languages, by Elizabeth Little.
The Last Speakers: The Quest to Save the World's Most Endangered Languages, by K. David Harrison.
Bastard Tongues: A Trailblazing Linguist Finds Clues to Our Common Humanity in the World's Lowliest Languages, by Derek Bickerton.
Spoken Here: Travels Among Threatened Languages, by Mark Abley.
The Prodigal Tongue: Dispatches from the Future of English, by Mark Abley.
Outwitting History: The Amazing Adventures of a Man Who Rescued a Million Yiddish Books, by Aaron Lansky.

, English is not the only language spoken in the world. Get yourself and others to dabble in at least one foreign language, be it French or Farsi or Navajo. You don't have to be fluent, but you need to open your mind to how other human beings view the world through their languages.


If you're up for the language, teach yourself or study an endangered language. The more speakers there are, the healthier the language will be!

, This applies to all people regardless of where they live, but is especially important for those whose language is in a minority position. You have to continue speaking your language in the face of others who think and tell you otherwise. Languages carry your past, your present, and your future, and is an invaluable gift to give your children and those who listen to you. All languages have value.

Become an avid and intimate reader in each of your languages.,
Master your writing skills in your mother tongue.,
Get an education.,
Research the writer and work you are translating.,
Know the risks behind what you're translating.,
Remember that no translation is perfect.,
Find a publisher.,
Join a professional translation organization.,
Practice constantly.",How to Translate Literary Works," Translating creative works requires the ability to read between the lines. You have to love reading in the genre(s) you're translating and be both intimate with the writer and the nuances of language, culture, thought, and message.


If, for instance, you translate prose poems from Dutch into English, you have to read as many published (and unpublished) prose poems as possible, in Dutch and in English. This will help you to grasp the styles, the subtleties, the contexts, and soul of prose poetry in order to deconstruct the Dutch and reconstruct the English.
Remember to keep on top of your languages. Language is a fluid entity that constantly changes and evolves. Dialects change, semantics change, new words are coined, old words die and are reborn.;
, Most literary translators, with very few exceptions, translate exclusively into their mother tongue, the language within best they express themselves and are most at home in. To translate a book, you have to write a book; to translate a play, you need to know how to write a play. The only way you can do this is write as much as possible in your language and continuously hone that skill. Most published translators are also published writers.


A rare exception to the rule was Israel's Leah Goldberg (1911 - 1970). She was European raised and educated, yet translated exclusively into Modern Hebrew, her third language, from six other languages. She however adopted Hebrew as her home and vehicle of expression and was a prolific writer exclusively in Hebrew as well.

, Academic institutions worldwide are one of the strongest sources and supporters of literary and academic translation. Consider getting at least one degree in comparative literature, linguistics, languages, or translation to give you a head start. Literary translation specifically is often offered through creative writing programs. Receiving academic training will also give you access to literary lectures, mentor ships with professors who translate, and libraries with well-established and worldly collections.


If academia is out of your league, you can teach yourself through books. Check out your local book shops and libraries on what is published on the subject and read, read, read. (See Tips below for more information.)

, A writer's work is a piece of him/herself. In order to interpret what you're reading, you have to know everything about the person behind the words. Ask yourself: When and where was the work written? Where was the writer from? What surrounded the writer at the time the work was written? Does the work draw references from other literary pieces? What else has the writer written? And so forth.

, The translation of a particular work can cost both the writer and translator their lives depending on the statement of the work. The translation of books has sparked revolutions and wars. Know your audience.

, The minute you begin to render your first sentence, the original is already lost in translation. It is your job not to find an equivalent but rather reconstruct the original as though it was written in the target language. Cultural concepts, shades of colour, shades of meaning, and even history can and will be lost. Don't be afraid of that but instead embrace it. You can always use footnotes / end notes if necessary. Who is your audience?


Proofread the translated finished parts one by one before the general read and review at the end. You might find a better word or an expression in the same language that gets the exact meaning of the other. Do not over process, but check to see where can you install your enhancements.

, Literary translations are largely contracted through publishing houses. Approach them, research them, provide writing/translation samples, and negotiate.


Some countries offer grants through federal arts/culture councils allocated specifically for translating literary works. Check out what's available to you and weigh your options.

, Whether you live in Canada, Chile, Cameroon, or China, there are professional organizations for translators as well as organizations for literary translation. Joining an organization is important for your professionalism, it enables you to network, and it opens your doors to professional training opportunities and translation prizes.

, Find yourself a comfortable place and translate for at least fifteen minutes a day. You can only get better by working hard and maintaining a regular schedule. After a while, you will be amazed at how much work you have accumulated.

Find someone that speaks the language fluently.,
Practice using Japanese with the people you have met.,
If you can listen to and speak with native speakers of Japanese, listen carefully to how they pronounce words and phrases and try to mimic what you hear.,
Practice using different phrases and words by role playing scenarios such as shopping, ordering food at a restaurant, talking on the phone, etc,.

,
Don't be discouraged if you make mistakes, even if people laugh when you mispronounce words or use the wrong phrases.,
Be interesting to talk to and have topics up your sleeve to fill in silences.,
If you know certain topics are likely to come up in conversation, do some studying beforehand to put phrases and vocabulary related to that topic into short-term memory.,
Be familiar with the correct use of conversation fillers, such as soo desu, ne, majiide and so on.

,
Practice shadowing native speakers.",How to Improve Speaking Japanese," If you can't find someone in person, try looking online. There are many communities online where people from all over the world gather to learn Japanese.;
, Try to engage in actually speaking the language if possible. If you are doing this online, there are several voice chat programs out there that will help you communicate freely over the internet. You should ask other people online which programs will work best for them.

, You should pay close attention to the differences between the language when spoken by different genders. Some words and phrases may be different.

,, One of the keys to learning a language is learning what mistakes can be made so that you don't make them in the future.

, Learn about Japanese popular culture- singers, books, anything. Studio Ghibli movies such as Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away are good. This is where a little knowledge of Japanese culture goes a long way. Of course, cultural differences are fine, but they may end up a monologue if the conversation partner isn't really interested.

, There are a lot of stock and predictable questions- be ready not only to answer, but to elaborate. This will not improve speaking skills, but it will facilitate ease of conversation.

,, Shadowing is a technique where you listen to someone speaking the target language and then repeat what they said aloud as clearly as you can. Don't worry about repeating things perfectly, just try to repeat as much as you can as quickly and clearly as you can.

Hire a Japanese tutor and/or take formal language classes.,
Don't get stuck on the slang.,
Spend time in Japan, if you can.,
Take the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT or 日本語能力試験).",How to Learn Japanese Fluently," A large number of Japanese language learning materials for foreigners use romaji (roman script) as a pronunciation aid. This is effective only to a point---written Japanese almost never uses romaji; rather, it uses a mix of hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Knowing the first two will open your doors into knowing the third, build your literacy skills in Japanese, and enable you to take the JLPT.;
, If your goal is total written and spoken fluency in Japanese, you need to know a minimum of 1,500 to 3,000 Kanji for functional literacy. The best way to learn these is through graded formal lessons, flash cards, and extensive practice.


Well educated and well read Japanese may know as many as 10,000 Kanji. Kanji represent loan words from Chinese into Japanese, they are used to distinguish homonyms and synonyms, they are used in names, in grammatical functions, and specialized vocabulary.
Japanese Kanji often differ in meaning and usage from Chinese characters as used in contemporary Chinese as well as Korean. Learning how to read Chinese won't necessarily help you with Japanese.

, Different methods work for different people: flashcards, textbooks, memorize, Manga, etc. Check what's available to you.

, Volunteer at your local Japanese Community Centre, befriend Japanese people, watch Japanese television, films, theatre, anime, and YouTube clips, listen to Japanese music---both modern and traditional. If you have access to English subtitles, make use of them, but try not to depend on them as your Japanese advances.

, In Japanese, the words or phrases you say may change depending on who you're talking to. For example, ""How are you?"" can be said as ""Genki?"" or ""O genki des ka?"" depending on how polite you are being., The best way to absorb the language and culture is by interacting with native (trained) speakers who know how to walk you through the thinking, dos, do nots, and subtitles within Japanese.

, Japanese has many spoken dialects and city-specific slang spanning Hokkaido to Okinawa. Work with what you know and expand gradually from there. Almost all textbooks and learning resources teach you Standard Japanese, which is universally spoken and understood across Japan and is an effective base for building upon your knowledge.


The above said, learning a colloquial Japanese dialect will prove useful depending on where in Japan you live and how natural you want to sound. Dialects contain a lot of regional colour that Standard Japanese can lack.

, If total fluency is still your goal, you have to live Japanese in order to master Japanese, which means that you should travel to and spend time in Japan. Japan has many job and study opportunities for foreigners, you simply have to find, target, and aim for it.


Be well aware of the necessary paperwork and customs you are expected to abide by in Japan. Furthermore, naturalization into becoming a Japanese citizen is not easy. Do your homework and ask questions.

, The JLPT is an international, graded, five level Japanese proficiency exam hosted by the Japan Educational Exchanges and Services (JEES) and the Japan Foundation that is designed to assess and evaluate your Japanese-language proficiency. It will grade you on kanji and vocabulary, listening comprehension, and reading comprehension and grammar. N5 is lowest level of the exam available, N1 is the highest (near-native) level. The JLPT can be taken almost anywhere in the world, usually through universities and Japanese Cultural Centres. Take each exam when you feel you that your language skills are good enough to.


JLPT practice materials and tutors are available in many major international cities and through iPod apps! Again, do your homework and see what works for you!

, If it's obvious you're a tourist, you're more of a target. Don't wear bright clothing, or walk around with a camera hanging from your neck.

, If possible, vacation with a friend or family member, and stay together when you're out. When you're alone, you're more vulnerable. Traveling in pairs or groups makes you less attractive to criminals, and you can keep an eye out for each other.

, When addressing shopkeepers, restaurant servers, transportation personnel, museum attendants, or anyone else you encounter while seeing the sights, speaking the native language will help you stand out less as a tourist.

, If someone approaches you on the street and tries to talk to you, speak to them in the native language of the country you're in, even if they address you in English, or whatever language is native to you. This lets them know you understand them, and makes you less vulnerable to scams they may be trying to get you to fall for.

, If someone approaches you on the street, they may be the distraction while another person is trying to take your bag or wallet. Stay aware of who is around you, and keep your belongings close to your body, and in your full view.

, As soon as you discover that a street vendor took advantage of you, or that you were pickpocketed, contact the authorities. Speaking the native language will help you explain to them what happened so they can help you., This is especially important is your passport is stolen so they can help you get a replacement, and be on the lookout in case anyone tries to use your stolen one for travel.

, If your wallet or purse is stolen, you need to notify your creditors as soon as possible so they can freeze your accounts, and prevent anyone from using your cards. Keep their phone numbers and your card numbers somewhere separate from where you keep your cards.

, Before you travel you might want to install an app that will allow you to find your way around in an unknown city. There are navigation apps that require data connection such as Waze and other where you could download the maps upfront (while being at home) such as Tom Tom.

It is pronounced ""he"" (as in that guy over there) ""toe"" ""tsu."" (This is likely the most difficult sound to produce as it doesn't exist in English. Think 'sue' with your tongue starting between your teeth.)
Notice that the kanji is simply ichi (一) and hiragana tsu (つ). This pattern will continue for all the other numbers in this system.

,　(二つ)


It sounds like ""foo"" (the f is quieter, and not as distinguished as in English) ""ta"" (as in talk) ""tsu"" (that tricky tsu again).

,　(三つ)


It sounds like ""me"" ""tsu"".
Japanese is a rhythmic language. Each character or pause is given one beat. So if you spoke it with a metronome, the silences and pauses would be just as important as the spoken sounds. If you look at the phonetic characters of this word, ""みっつ"", it's not two sounds, but three; that little tsu in the middle represents a pause in speaking.　When Japanese is written with Latin characters (called ローマ字 ""rōmaji""), you can tell these pauses by two consonants next to each other - in this case, the two Ts (mittsu). It's tricky, but if you listen to it you'll start to understand.

,　(四つ)


It sounds like ""yo"" ""tsu.""

,　(五つ)


It sounds like ""ee"" (as in eek) ""tsu"" ""tsu"" (double the tsus!).

It sounds like ""toe"", but again, don't let the ""oe"" slip towards a ""w"" sound.
This is the only number in the system that doesn't have the つ at the end.
It may seem complicated, but if you remember these, you can count practically any item and Japanese people will understand. It is much easier than learning all the different counters.
Why does Japanese have two counting systems? In a nutshell, the first system's pronunciations are based on Chinese (音読み on'yomi ""Chinese reading""), since the Japanese borrowed their kanji (ideographic, or idea-expressing, characters) from the Chinese language centuries ago. The second system is derived from the native Japanese words (訓読み kun'yomi ""Japanese reading"") for numbers. In modern Japanese, most kanji have both an on'yomi and a kun'yomi - and often more than one - and both readings are used depending on the (grammatical) situation.

November: novembre (noh-vah(n)br)

December: décembre (day-sah(n)br);
, In French, the date is written in ""day month year"" order, with no commas separating each term. Note that the month is not capitalized. Here are a couple examples (plus the abbreviated version):


4 août 1789 (4/8/1789)
15 mars 2015 (15/3/2015)

, To read the date out loud, add le to the beginning of the date, and read all dates as cardinal numbers (""five"" instead of ""fifth"").Here are the previous examples written as you would say them. Study how to count in French if you are not familiar with reading French numbers:


""le quatre août mille sept cent quatre-vingt-neuf""
""le quinze mars deux mille quatorze""
Every month is a masculine noun, so the article used is always le.

, When talking about the first day of the month, use ""1er"" in writing, and say ""premier"" when speaking aloud. This is the only date that uses ordinal numbers (""first"") instead of cardinal (""one""). For example:


1er avril (1/4), spoken ""le premier avril""

Learn the Japanese writing systems.,
Practice Japanese pronunciation.,
Learn variations on the basic sounds.,
Get to know Japanese grammar.",How to Learn Japanese1," Japanese language has four writing systems, each of which is composed of different characters. This may sound like a lot to learn, but every word in Japanese, regardless of which writing system it comes from, is pronounced with some combination of only 46 basic sounds.Sorting out the different writing systems and their uses is an important part of learning Japanese. Here's a brief overview:


Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary, phonetic characters that make up one Japanese writing system. Unlike the English alphabet, each character stands for one syllable, which may include a vowel and a consonant sound.
Katakana is also a syllabary, most often used for foreign words or onomatopoeic sounds (like bang or squeak). Together, hiragana and katakana account for the entire range of sounds in the Japanese language.
Kanji are Chinese characters that were adopted as a Japanese writing system. Whereas hiragana and katakana are simply phonetic letters, kanji are ideograms, characters which have meaning. There are thousands of kanji characters, with about 2000 in common use. Hiragana and katakana were derived from these characters. The same 46 sounds that are used to pronounce hiragana and katakana are also used to pronounce kanji.
The Latin alphabet is used in Japanese to write acronyms, company names, and other words for aesthetic reasons. Called Romaji (""Roman letters""), Japanese can also be written in Latin letters. This is not done in Japan, but it is used by beginning Japanese speakers to ""spell out"" Japanese characters. However, there are many sounds in Japanese which are difficult to express in Latin letters, and many homonyms (many more than English) which become confusing. Therefore, students of Japanese are encouraged to begin learning Japanese characters as soon as possible, and avoid using Latin letters as a crutch.;
, The 46 sounds in the Japanese language are composed of one of five vowel sounds or a combination of a vowel and a consonant, with the exception of one sound composed of only a consonant. Vowel sounds are not inflected (unlike in English, where ""a"" in apple vs ace are different). You can start practicing pronunciation by learning how to pronounce each character in hiragana and katakana. See this site for examples of how to pronounce the sounds.


Focus on the intonation of the different sounds. Variations on the sounds change the meaning of the words you speak. A long syllable may have a completely different meaning from the same sound made shorter (""o"" vs. ""oo"").

, Japanese characters may add marks to indicate that they should be pronounced slightly differently, sometimes changing the meaning of the words they make up. This similar to ""s"" sometimes sounding like ""z"" in English.


Hard consonant sounds are pronounced with a hard stop in between two sounds.
Long vowel sounds, pronounced by holding the vowel sound for an extra beat, are distinguished from short sounds, indicating a different word.

, Knowing a few basic grammatical rules will help you start understanding Japanese and creating your own sentences. Japanese grammar is simple and flexible, so it's easy to string words together in a way that makes sense.The subject is optional and may be omitted.
The predicate is always at the end of the sentence.
Nouns do not have gender. Most also don't have separate plural forms.
Verbs do not change according to the subject (he/she/it). They also don't change according to number (singular/plural, like I/we or he/they).Particles, which mark words as subject, object, etc, always follow the word to which they relate.
Personal pronouns (I, you, etc) differ according to the level of politeness and formality that is needed in each situation.

Do not use weeaboo jargon.,
Do not abnormally prioritize things that are Japanese.,
Do not alienate yourself through your choice in clothing.,
Do not neglect your authentic self.",How to Avoid Becoming a Weeaboo1," In any group environment, there are factors that encourage cohesion and indicate member status.A major indication of a weeaboo in your midst is the use of broken and incomplete Japanese in casual conversation, often in emphatic or overly dramatic ways. Using Japanese ungrammatically can be culturally insensitive, hinder communication, and create difficulty should you choose to learn the language in the future.Some expressions appropriated by the weeaboo community include:



Kawaii (かわいい)
English statement + desu (です)

Variation: English + Japanese adjective + desu (です). For example: ""I passed that exam so you know I'm kakkoii desu.""


Suffixes like -kun (－くん) and -chan (－ちゃん)

Baka (ばか)

Sugoi (すごい)

Chibi (ちび)

Ne! (ね);
, There are many positives to joining a group or subculture, but in-group bias isn't one.The automatic assumption that Japanese products are superior to others can be self isolatingand/or a mild form of delusion.Self-inquiry is a good way of diffusing weeaboo tendencies. If you can't identify the reason why something is better, chances are your preference is a matter of taste. Some questions to ask yourself:


Why do I like this Japanese product?
What is different between the Japanese product and a similar, non-Japanese product?
What makes the Japanese product better than a similar, non-Japanese product?

, Dress code and other social conventions telegraph group membership to others.There are socially appropriate places for you express your interest by wearing the same costume as your favorite character, like at an anime convention. Choosing daily clothing styled after anime characters is, in many cases, the hallmark of a weeaboo.


A single accessory or article of clothing from your costume can add flair to your daily outfit without appearing socially inaccessible to others.

, You can meet new friends and boost your creative capacity through role-playing specific characters and fantastical scenarios,but don't let this come at the cost of your own development. Pretending to be something you are not, even if you are emulating something you admire, can lead to a mismatch between your outer self and inner feelings and cause potentially extreme consequences.Accept that your personality changes as a function of growth, as do preferences and beliefs. Even if you consider yourself a die-hard fan, respecting the potential for future change influences more moderate (and less weeaboo-like) behavior.
Occasionally put aside instant gratification, including anime, manga, costume making, and online activities. Reevaluate personal goals and your place in your community.Are you happy with where you're at? Ignoring these in favor of Japanese cultural pursuits is considered evidence of a weeaboo.

はじめまして (""Nice to meet you."")
おはようございます (""Good morning."")
こんにちは (""Good Day"" {can be used only till sunset and thus can also be used as ""Good Afternoon""})

Understand that the bow is equivalent to a respectful handshake.,
When you receive a bow, bow back.,
Bow with your arms at the side, eyes facing the same direction as your head.",How to Say Hello in Japanese3," The most important thing to remember is when you are returning a bow.

, You should bow at least as low as, though preferably slightly lower than the one who bowed first. Bowing lower is a sign of respect, so try to bow lower than the person giving the bow if they are of higher social status than you, or if you don't know that person.

Greeting bows are generally 15 degrees for people you are familiar with and 30 degrees for people you just met or are of higher social standing. 45 degree bows are usually not used for greetings, unless you're meeting the emperor or Prime Minister.
If you're bowing in greeting to a good friend, you can simply nod your head to bow. This is the most casual of bows.

, Make sure to bow from the waist. Bowing with just your head or shoulders is very casual and can be seen as rude."

Learn the days of the week.,
Write and pronounce the date, including the day of the week.,
Know when to use articles.",How to Write the Date in French2," Refer to the list above to learn the days of the week in French, along with how they are pronounced.Note that the days of the week are not capitalized in French.


Monday: lundi (luh(n)-dee)

Tuesday: mardi (mahr-dee)

Wednesday: mercredi (mehr-kruh-dee)

Thursday: jeudi (zhuh-dee)

Friday: vendredi (vah(n)-druh-dee)

Saturday: samedi (sahm-dee)

Sunday: dimanche (dee-mah(n)sh)

, This is identical to writing the date, with the day of the week added to the front of the phrase. Here's an example:


English: Wednesday, the 5th of June
French (written): mercredi, le 5 juin 2001 (formal)
French (written): mercredi 5 juin 2001 (normal)
French (spoken): mercredi cinq juin deux mille un

French (spoken): le mercredi cinq juin deux mille un (eventually if you want to describe a precise day)

, Every day of the week is a masculine noun, so the article le is used.For example, ""Le samedi est le sixième jour."" means ""Saturday is the sixth day."" However, when you are talking about an event that occurred on a specific day, know the difference between le samedi and samedi:Samedi, je dîne au restaurant. = On Saturday, I dine at a restaurant. (A single event.)

Le samedi, je dîne au restaurant. = Every Saturday, I dine at a restaurant. (A repeated event.)

Aujourd'hui means ""today."" Optionally, you can use d'aujourd'hui (""of today"") to use the word as a noun instead of an adverb. Both are widely used.

, To ask for the day of the week, say Quel jour sommes-nous aujourd’hui? or Quel jour est-on aujourd’hui?, If someone asks you one of the above questions, be prepared to answer:


To answer with ""Today is Monday, November 15th,"" write Aujourd'hui, c'est le lundi 15 novembre.
To answer ""Today is Sunday,"" say Aujourd'hui, c'est dimanche. or simply C'est dimanche.

, Use this word to write ""in July"" (en juillet), ""in 1950"" (en 1950), ""in April 2011"" (en avril 2011), and so forth.This phrase can go at the front or the end of a sentence. For example:



J’ai un rendez-vous chez le médecin en mars. = I have an appointment with the doctor in March.

J'ai vécu à Paris en 1990. = I lived in Paris in 1990.

Get audio learning software.,
Sign up for classes.",How to Learn Japanese2," After learning the basics, it's time to get some outside instruction so you can improve your skills. If you are learning Japanese for fun because you like Japanese culture such as manga and anime or for travel, an audio learning CD might be all you need. Just spending an hour a day can build up grammar usage and teach you simple stock phrases and useful vocabulary.


Listen to the software during your commute to work or have it ready on your portable music player for lunch and breaks or walks in the park.
It isn't necessary to learn the reading and writing to enjoy the language and culture, so if you plan on taking a short trip to Japan, knowing a few useful phrases will be more practical than cramming obscure characters into your brain.

, If you are learning for business or you want to live in Japan, consider enrolling in a college level course, an intensive language program, or online classes. Learning to read and write will be crucial to your long term success, and having a mentor during the early stages is ideal for developing good study habits and asking all the questions you will have about Japanese language and culture.


Study the writing systems. Begin studying all four writing styles early on if literacy is important for your purpose of learning the language. Hiragana and katakana can be learned in a few weeks, and you can use them to write anything you want in Japanese. Around 2,000 kanji are currently in common use in Japanese, so it typically takes several years to learn, but it's worth it if you want to actually be able to understand and speak Japanese.
Use flashcards to learn vocabulary and simple phrases. They can be used while waiting for a meeting, on a train, and so on. Some free cards can be found on the web to get you started, or you can buy higher quality cards at most college bookstores or online.

To practice kanji, look for cards that show stroke order (how to write the character) represented in calligraphy on one side and have example compound words on the other side. You can pick up a pack of blank 3x5 cards to make your own flash cards with exactly what you want to learn.


Participate in class discussions and activities. Do all of your homework, raise your hand a lot, and be as involved as you can to make the most of language classes. If you don't, your skills will not improve.

Join a Japanese language conversation group.,
Make Japanese friends with whom you can regularly practice.,
Consume Japanese media.,
Study in Japan.",How to Learn Japanese3," Conversation groups abound and are usually easily found with a simple Internet search or phone call to your local civic center or library. Train your ears to pick out what is being said. Even if you don't understand it, try to repeat what was said so you can begin to pick it apart and develop comprehension.

, Lots of Japanese people want to learn English, so you may be able to find some who are willing to help you in exchange for help in English. Simply having friends to trade notes with can help everyone improve their abilities.


Do things with your friends that involve language but aren't ""study time."" If your Japanese friends haven't lived in your country very long, show them around town. Go sightseeing. Remember, you have to blow off steam regularly or you'll get stressed out about all those Kanji you have to memorize. Having fun is the best way to accomplish two goals at the same time.
On the days when you don't have outings, call up a friend every day and have a half-hour conversation during which you speak only Japanese. The more practice you get, the faster you will improve.

, Whether it's the newspaper, a novel, a movie, or a show, read or watch Japanese language media every day. There is lots of TV content on the internet, from comedy to game shows to drama. Find something which fits your interests and learning will be much easier. Japanese newspapers will expose you to the most practical vocabulary and grammar. As you improve, read novels, which will give you a warmer style of writing. Mix things up by watching classic Japanese films and anime without subtitles, or with Japanese character subtitles.


Comic books (Manga) can make good reading material, but be aware that the level of sophistication varies greatly. A more mature, literary comic might be good practice (especially since the illustrations help you understand what you are reading), something intended for smaller children is likely to be full of sound effects and slang. Be careful about repeating what you've read in a comic book.

, This is simply the best way to practically apply what you have learned and learn more. It's a very exciting and unpredictable experience to immerse yourself in another culture, even for a short period. Even if you have researched exhaustively, actually experiencing a place will expose you to things you could never have imagined.


If you're enrolled in a college or university, ask about programs to study in Japan. This is one of the best ways to gain long-term exposure to Japanese language, and you may be eligible for financial aid.
Don't be discouraged if you do not understand everything that is said to you or you can't read or write as well as you expected. It takes many years to become fluent in another language. The intricacies and nuances of the Japanese language make it difficult to master, but they are also part of its beauty.

Jiro Dreams of Sushi (2011)

The Kingdom of Dreams and Madness (2013)

Hafu: The Mixed-Race Experience in Japan (2013)

Brakeless (2014)

Kokoyakyu: High School Baseball (2006)

The Invention of Dr. Nakamats (2009)

, Even if you don't plan on getting your degree in Japanese language or culture, learning the historical reason for contemporary culture can clear misconceptions and minimize out-of-context assumptions. Weeaboos are perceived as doing just this. Fixation on aspects of Japanese without the cultural framework necessary for accurate interpretation can lead to warped perspective. As an added bonus, your knowledge of Asiatic history and culture will improve your ability to make sense of future encounters with Japanese culture.If a college course is out of the question, you can contact your local Japanese Cultural Center or embassy to see if there are activities you can join. Popular traditional arts you can ask about:

Taiko (太鼓) drum classes
Kendo (剣道, Japanese fencing)
Shodou (書道, Japanese calligraphy)
Sadou (茶道, Japanese tea ceremony).



, A frequent criticism of the weeaboo subculture is that its members only consume overly dramatized mass media. Reading on a variety of topics will help you to achieve a more complete picture of the intricacies of the Japanese way of life.

, Language and culture are closely linked.Many foreign languages contain words or concepts that simply don't exist in your native tongue, and learning these can equip you with tools necessary to pin down foreign perspectives.In the same way, exposing yourself to other cultures promotes broader cultural awareness.You don't need to study Japanese have the advantages that accompany bilingualism. If there is a community nearby that speaks a language different than your own, immersing yourself in that community can promote acquisition."

Get to know the Japanese writing systems.,
Learn Japanese pronunciation.,
Learn variations on Japanese sounds.,
Understand Japanese grammar.",How to Learn to Speak Japanese2," Japanese language uses four different writing systems that have different characters.To speak the language, you don't necessarily need to learn how to write in Japanese, but it's important to understand the way the four systems work together.


Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary, a system of characters used to represent distinct Japanese sounds.Katakana is similar to Hiragana, in that it is made up of Japanese sounds, but it is mostly composed of words that originated in different languages. It could be considered the syllabary for foreign words. Together, Hiragana and Katakana cover every sound in the Japanese language, 46 in total.
Kanji are Chinese characters adapted for Japanese that are the foundation of Japanese writing. The sounds used to pronounce Kanji are the same as those used in Hiragana and Katakana.
In Japanese language, the Latin alphabet is sometimes used for acronyms, company names, and names meant to be read by non-Japanese speakers.
Romaji, the written Roman version of Japanese words, is also worth mentioning, even though it is not used in Japan. It is recommended that new students of Japanese skip Romaji and learn Japanese characters instead. Once you start learning Romaji it's difficult to associate Japanese sounds with Japanese characters.

, The sounds corresponding to the Hiraganaand Katakanaalphabets are composed of either one of five vowel sounds or a combination of a consonant and a vowel sound, with the exception of a few consonant-only sounds.


Since each character in Hiragana and Katakana has only one distinct sound, it is relatively easy to learn how to pronounce all 46. Pay special attention to intonation, though, since variations on these basic sounds can drastically change the meaning.
Whereas English pronunciation is based on accents, Japanese pronunciation is based on pitch. A word may be pronounced the same way and mean something different depending on whether it is spoken in a high or low pitch. To sound like a native speaker, getting intonation right is key.

, Japanese characters may be written with extra strokes to signify that they should be pronounced with an additional sound.The additional sounds fall into these categories:


Voiced consonants, which are pronounced with a ""voice,"" a vibration in the throat. There are 4 voiced consonants and one semi-voiced consonant.
Y-vowel sounds, which can directly follow consonant sounds to change the pronunciation.
Hard consonant sounds, which add a hard stop between sounds.
Long vowel sounds. The meaning of a sound can alter depending on how long the vowel sound is held.

, Japanese grammar is quite different from other languages, but it follows a logical format that is easy to learn. The following is true about Japanese grammar:


Nouns don't have plural forms and they don't change according to gender.
Verbs don't change according to gender, number, or whether the subject is an object or person.The predicate is always at the end of the sentence.
Personal pronouns vary based on different levels of politeness and formality.
Particles directly follow the word they relate to. For example, instead of saying ""I am Japanese,"" it would be ""I Japanese am."""
"
Sign up for courses at a university or community college.,
Take online courses.,
Buy Japanese language software.,
Get a tutor.",How to Learn to Speak Japanese3," Japanese is a popular language that is taught at nearly every university and community college. Check into taking a course at a local school so that you can learn under the instruction of someone who is fluent in Japanese.


Do your Japanese homework. It may seem like it will take forever to learn the 2,000 Kanji characters or get a grasp on Japanese vocabulary, but these are important steps to take if you want to learn how to speak Japanese with fluency.
Participate in workshops and class discussions. The written homework is important, but learning how to converse in Japanese requires that you get out of your comfort zone and let your voice be heard during class. Raise your hand, go to the workshops, and get in as much speaking practice as you can.

, Online courses are a good alternative if you want to save a little money. Many are designed to encourage you to speak out loud by hosting virtual classroom discussions and workshops. Do some research to find a course that fits your needs and take it as seriously as you would any university course.

, Language software produced by companies like Rosetta Stone is designed to help you learn at your own pace by using CDs and workbooks to gradually learn the language. Check out reviews before you decide which software to purchase, since this option can be rather pricey.

, Hire a more advanced Japanese student or a fluent Japanese speaker to help you build a solid foundation in Japanese. You could hire a tutor as a supplement to the courses you are taking or the software you are using, or choose someone who is equipped to teach you the language on his or her own.


Check out the classified listings at local colleges and universities for Japanese tutors. Students hoping to make some extra money tutoring often advertise on bulletin boards and college websites.
You could also hire a tutor who is actually living in Japan. Put up an ad on Craigslist stating that you're looking for a Japanese tutor and would be willing to have tutoring sessions online using Skype or another online video chat program.

Spend time with people who speak Japanese.,
Watch Japanese movies and shows.,
Study Japanese in Japan.",How to Learn to Speak Japanese4," Talk to students in more advanced classes, or better yet, fluent Japanese speakers who have lived in or are from Japan. Speaking Japanese with someone who is fluent will help your pronunciation and clue you in to intricacies of the language that are impossible to pick up from a textbook.


Start a Japanese discussion group that meets at least twice a week. Plan to speak only in Japanese for a full hour. Each meeting can have a theme, or you could simply talk for an hour on any subject in Japanese.
Plan excursions with Japanese speakers so that you can practice speaking in different contexts and situations. For example, take a trip to the botanical garden and focus on learning Japanese words for different plants and trees.
Speak with Japanese speakers a little bit each day, even when you aren't meeting for a group discussion. Give someone a call and converse only in Japanese, or drop by your professor's office hours for a little extra practice.

, This is an excellent way to learn more about Japanese language when you aren't able to spend time with Japanese speakers. Replace your regular shows with anime and watch at least one Japanese movie a week to immerse yourself in the language at home.



Rashomon, Seven Samurai, and Spirited Away are popular Japanese movies.
You can start by watching the films with subtitles, but you'll get a better immersion experience if you turn them off and focus instead on the Japanese sounds and pronunciation.

, Taking a trip to Japan and spending as much time there as possible is the best way to learn Japanese, period. If you can arrange it, find a way to work or study there for 6 months or more so you can spend time soaking in the language and practicing all day long.


If you're enrolled in a college or university, look into study abroad programs in Japan. You may be able to take classes there for a semester or more.
You could also try to work there for a few months or longer. The organization WWOOF,which stands for World Wide Opportunities on Organic Farms, lets you work on a farm in exchange for room and board. This is a great way to immerse yourself in the language of another country for as long as you want to stay.

Familiarize yourself with Japanese vowels.,
Learn the basics of Romaji.,
Break Romaji into syllables.,
Practice difficult combinations.,
Learn new words while practicing reading Romaji.",How to Learn to Read Japanese1," There are five vowels in Japanese, and these are generally consistent in pronunciation. Unlike English, where vowels can be read many different ways depending on context, in Romaji you can most always expect:


The ""a"" to sound like the ""a"" in ""father.""
The ""i"" to sound like the ""ee"" in ""feet.""
The ""u"" to sound like the ""oo"" in ""fool.""
The ""e"" to sound like the ""a"" in ""tape.""
The ""o"" to sound like the ""oa"" in ""boat."";
, Aside from vowels, Romaji mostly follows the rules of English pronunciation, but there are a few special characteristics you'll want to keep in mind. For example, long vowels in Romaji are often marked by a long bar above the vowel (as in ā, ī, ū, ē, and ō), but in some cases may be represented by a double vowel (as in aa, ii, uu, ei, and ou). Furthermore:


Some Romaji systems use an apostrophe to indicate syllable boundaries, especially before the sound ""n"" (ん). For example, the word shin'ya (しんや) is three syllables「shi (し) • n (ん) • ya (や)」whereas shinya (しにゃ) is only two「shi (し) • nya (にゃ)」.
Doubled consonants represent a short, abrupt pause when reading aloud. This pause is important and can completely change the meaning of a word, like in sakki (just now) and saki (previous, prior)., Japanese is a metrical language. Each syllable is approximately the same length, excluding long vowels, which are held for two syllables. Breaking Romaji into syllables will help you figure out common word endings and boundaries, will improve the flow of your reading, and will help prepare you to learn hiragana and katakana.


Generally, you can expect an alternating consonant (C) vowel (V) structure in Japanese, as in CVCVCV or kodomo (children), where each CV alternation forms a syllable.
Some Japanese sounds have clusters of consonants followed by a vowel. Some common examples are tsu (つ), kya (きゃ), sho (しょ), and cha (ちゃ). These form a single syllable, each., Speaking in a different language frequently involves using muscles in and around your mouth differently than you do in your native tongue. Practicing difficult or uncommon sounds in Japanese will help them become more natural in both your reading and speaking. Some words you might use for practice include:



Kyaku (きゃく ; guest), with the syllable breaks: kya • ku

Kaisha (かいしゃ ; company), with the syllable breaks: ka • i • sha

Pan'ya (ぱんや ; bakery), with the syllable breaks: pa • n • ya

Tsukue (つくえ ; desk), with the syllable breaks: tsu • ku • e, When you read Romaji regularly, the flow of Japanese will become more familiar to you and the sound patterns easier to grasp. As you read, keep a notebook handy and write down words you don't know to look up in a dictionary later.Review your new word notebook often so the words become ingrained in your mind. For example, you may want to glance over new words every morning and evening.
If you don't have a textbook to practice reading Romaji, there are plenty of resources available online. Try a general online keyword search for ""Japanese romaji reading resources.""

Learn the vowels.,
Identify consonant groups.,
Acquaint yourself with the nasal groups.,
Make sense of the Japanese ""Y"" group.,
Study the tail end groups of hiragana.,
Avoid particle confusion.,
Memorize hiragana symbols.,
Build your vocabulary through reading.",How to Learn to Read Japanese2," Five vowels form the basis of hiragana. These are: あ, い, う, え, and お (a, i, u, e, o). Almost all consonants in Japanese pair with these five vowels to make up consonant groups of five symbols. These groups often have voiced and unvoiced members, which will be further explained later.


An example of a consonant group is the ""K"" group. The consonant sound of this group combines with each vowel to make the five symbols: か (ka), き (ki), く (ku), け (ke), and こ (ko)., Groups are easier to remember because they're unvoiced (V-) symbols are only differentiated from voiced (V+) symbols by a quote-like mark (〃) or a small circle (゜). Voiced consonants in a group will make your throat vibrate, and unvoiced consonants will not.


V-: か, き, く, け, こ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko)
V+: が, ぎ, ぐ, げ, ご (ga, gi, gu, ge, go)
V-: さ, し, す, せ, そ (sa, shi, su, se, so)
V+: ざ, じ, ず, ぜ, ぞ (za, ji, zu, ze, zo)
V-: た, ち, つ, て, と (ta, chi, tsu, te, to)
V+: だ, ぢ, づ, で, ど (da, ji, zu, de, do)
V-: は, ひ, ふ, へ, ほ (ha, hi, fu, he, ho)
V+: ば, び, ぶ, べ, ぼ (ba, bi, bu, be, bo)
V+: ぱ, ぴ, ぷ, ぷ, ぽ (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), A nasal is a sound like an ""m"" or an ""n."" These sounds vibrate in the top-back of your throat and into your nasal cavity. Japanese has two nasal groups in hiragana:


な, に, ぬ, ね, の (na, ni, nu, ne, no)
ま, み, む, め, も (ma, mi, mu, me, mo), The ""Y"" group in Japanese can blend with consonant symbols that end in an い (i) sound (like き, じ, ひ / ki, ji, hi). This is represented by the consonant symbol followed by a small ""Y"" group symbol. The ""Y"" group has no unvoiced members.


The ""Y"" group: や, ゆ, よ (ya, yu, yo)
Some common ""Y"" group blends: しゃ (sha), じゃ (ja), にゃ (nya), きゅ (kyu), ぎゅ (gyu), しゅ (shu), ひょ (hyo), びょ(byo), and しょ (sho)., Traditionally, the ""R"" group is taught last along with three unique symbols. Neither of these two end groups have unvoiced members. All ""r"" sounds should be pronounced similar to the ""t"" sound in ""water.""The ""R"" group: ら, り, る, れ,ろ (ra, ri, ru, re, ro)
The unique three: わ, を, ん (wa, wo, n), Particles are a special part of Japanese grammar. There is no English equivalent, though it can help to think of particles like prepositions. Particles indicate the grammatical role words play in a sentence, and sometimes have a different pronunciation than you'd expect.


For instance, in the sentence, ""I go to school,"" the word ""I"" is the topic and ""school"" a destination, so it is written,「わたしはがっこにいきます」(watashi wa (I + topic particle) gakko ni (school + direction particle) ikimasu (go)).
There are many particles in Japanese, but the most common include:

は (pronounced wa): topic marker.
か (ka): indicates a question at the end of a sentence.
が (ga): subject marker.
に (ni): indicates location, movement, marks time and the indirect object.
の (no): indicates the word before の is possessive of the word following it.
へ (e): indicates direction (of movement).
を (o): marks the direct object., The shape of hiragana symbols can be very foreign if you don't have experience writing in a similar Asian script. Practice regularly to improve your recall so that you can read these symbols quickly, fluently, and correctly.


You may want to make flash cards to help study. Write each symbol on one side of an index card and the pronunciation of the symbol on the opposite side., Many children's books and beginning learner Japanese materials are written solely in hiragana. By reading materials like these, you'll be sure to pick up some new vocab terms as you practice.You may want to make flash cards for new words, too. You can mix these in with your hiragana flash cards to add variety to your study.Some websites publish articles or simple stories in hiragana for beginning learners. An online keyword search for, ""hiragana reading practice"" should help you find something suitable.

Conquer katakana vowels.,
Study similar groups for easier learning.,
Learn the nasal groups.,
Master the ""Y"" group and its combinations.,
Close out katakana with the final groups.,
Commit the symbols to memory.,
Practice reading regularly.",How to Learn to Read Japanese3," Exactly like hiragana, katakana is made up of five vowels which combine with consonant groups to create groups of five symbols. The five katakana vowel symbols are: ア, イ, ウ, エ, オ (a, i, u, e, o). An example of a consonant group combining with vowels to make its five symbols for the ""S"" group would look like:


サ, シ, ス, セ, ソ (sa, shi, su, se, so)., Same as hiragana, katakana generally separates similar consonant groups into unvoiced (V-) and voiced (V+) members. To change a symbol from unvoiced to voiced, you only need to add a quote mark (〃) or small circle (゜). This makes learning the symbols easier. Voiced consonants will make your throat vibrate, unvoiced ones will not.


V-: カ, キ, ク, ケ, コ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko)
V+: ガ, ギ, グ, ゲ, ゴ (ga, gi, gu, ge, go)
V-: サ, シ, ス, セ, ソ (sa, shi, su, se, so)
V+: ザ, ジ, ズ, ゼ, ゾ (za, ji, zu, ze, zo)
V-: タ, チ, ツ, テ, ト (ta, chi, tsu, te, to)
V+: ダ, ヂ, ヅ, デ, ド (da, ji, zu, de, do)
V-: ハ, ヒ, フ, ヘ, ホ (ha, hi, fu, he, ho)
V+: バ, ビ, ブ, ベ, ボ (ba, bi, bu, be, bo)
V+: パ, ピ, プ, ペ, ポ (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), There are only two nasal groups in Japanese. Nasal sounds are those vibrate up into the top-back of your throat and into your nasal cavity. These sounds are generally represented by ""n"" or ""m."" The nasal groups in katakana are:


ナ, ニ, ヌ, ネ, ノ (na, ni, nu, ne, no)
マ, ミ, ム, メ, モ (ma, mi, mu, me, mo), The ""Y"" group in katakana operates the same way it does in hiragana. ""Y"" group symbols can blend with symbols that end in an イ (i) sound (like キ, ヒ, ジ / ki, hi, ji). This is represented by the symbol ending in an イ sound followed by a small ""Y"" group symbol.


The ""Y"" group: ヤ, ユ, ヨ (ya, yu, yo)
Common ""Y"" group blends: シャ (sha), ジャ (ja), ニャ (nya), キュ (kyu), ギュ (gyu), シュ (shu), ヒョ (hyo), ビョ(byo), and ショ (sho)., Katakana mirrors hiragana in that its final groups contain the ""R"" consonant group plus three unique symbols. The ""R"" group has no unvoiced members, and the ""r"" sound should be similar to the ""t"" in ""water.""The ""R"" group: ラ, リ, ル, レ, ロ (ra, ri, ru, re, ro)
The unique three: ワ, ヲ, ン (wa, wo, n) , Katakana has a few symbols that are similar to hiragana. Making these connections (as in き and キ) will help you to learn katakana more quickly. You may want to isolate and practice easily confused katakana symbols, as a few look very similar to the untrained eye. Some katakana symbols you may want to practice include:


シ (shi) and ツ (tsu)
ソ (so) and ン (n)
フ (fu), ワ (wa), and ヲ (wo), Since katakana occurs less frequently than hiragana, some students give it less priority or learn it incompletely. This, however, will only hurt your ability to read in the long run. The more you read katakana, the easier it will become.Since many students struggle with katakana, there are plenty of reading resources online. A general online keyword search for ""katakana reading practice"" should help you find suitable practice reading material.

When using verbs that contain infinitives ending in -er, we remove the final letter ""s"" from the -tu form of the present tense for the imperative, unless it is followed by the pronouns -y or -en.,
There are three verbs that are irregular in the imperative, taking their imperative from the present subjunctive form.,
When you want to form the negative imperative form, simply put -ne in front of the imperative and -pas or an alternative after it.,
When using object pronouns with the imperative, the pronouns follow the verb and are hyphenated.,
However, with the negative imperative, the pronouns will precede verb, as in these examples:


Ne lui dites rien.,
With reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun follows the imperative, and -te changes to -toi.,
Just as we saw earlier with object pronouns, however, in the negative imperative of reflexive verbs, the reflexive pronoun precedes the verb, and -te is used, not -toi.",How to Use the Imperative in French," Here are some examples:

Regarde; (Look) (To those you would normally address as ""tu"")
Regardons; (Let's look)
Regardez; (Look) (To those you would normally address as ""vous"")



 

;
, For example:


Être (To be): Sois, Soyons, Soyez. (Ex; ""Sois sage"" means ""Be good"".)
Avoir (To have): Aie, Ayons, Ayez. (Ex; ""Ayons de la patience"" means ""Let's have patience"".)
Savoir (To know): Sache, Sachons, Sachez. (Ex; ""Sachez vos amis"" means ""Know your friends"".)

, For example:


Ne va pas au parc. (Don't go to the park.)
Ne mangeons plus de viande. (Let's not eat any more meat.)
N'oubliez jamais ce que je vous ai dit. (Never forget what I have told you.)

, Some examples:


Donne-le-lui! (Give it to him!)
Achetons-en. (Let's buy some.)
Vas-y. (Go there.) Remember the letter ""s"" is kept when followed by -y or -en.

Parlez-moi! (Speak to me!) Notice the emphatic ""moi"" is used rather than ""me""; -toi would be used instead of -te.

Select high frequency kanji.,
Break your list into groups.,
Look up kanji details.,
Memorize the readings of kanji and common compounds.,
Make use of radicals.,
Make connections to interpret meaning.,
Read and practice kanji frequently.",How to Learn to Read Japanese4," Many kanji books teach the most frequently occurring kanji first. You're more likely to see common kanji, so it's not only more useful to study these first, but it will also help you to remember them better, as you'll see them more often when reading. If you don't have or can't afford such a book, in that case:


Search for a kanji frequency list online with the general keyword search, ""list of most frequent kanji"" or ""list of most common kanji."", Trying to learn the 100 most common kanji all at once will make learning more difficult. Breaking that number down into smaller, more manageable chunks will help you to learn kanji more completely and quickly. You'll have to experiment to find what works best for you, but you might start by learning 5 to 10 kanji at a time.You might also break up your list according to word type. For example, you might group all kanji that are used in verbs together, group food related kanji together, and so on.

, Look up each of the kanji you are studying in an online Japanese dictionary. You can do this by copying the symbol from your list and pasting it into the word input box on the dictionary home page. You may have to select a ""kanji"" option for the text input box, first. This will bring up the dictionary page for the kanji, which should include:



Stroke order. The order in which you draw kanji can influence its appearance. To prevent confusion, stroke order is always consistent.

On-yomi. Is the reading of a kanji used when there is no hiragana added to it. On-yomi reading kanji are often made up of several kanji working together, which are called kanji compound words (as in 地下鉄 / chikatetsu / subway).

Kun-yomi. This reading is used when hiragana has been added to kanji (as in 食べます / tabemasu / to eat) and is also used for words of Japanese origin., Along with the stroke order, On-yomi, and Kun-yomi, there should also be a list of common compounds on the dictionary page for your kanji. These will not only help build your vocabulary, but will also help you learn the kanji itself.


You may want to write out useful compounds in a notebook and review these regularly, like every morning and evening.
Kanji carries a lot of information. For this reason, you may want to make and use flash cards to help learn the kanji shape, On-yomi, Kun-yomi, and compounds.There are free-to-use kanji learning programs available for your computer or phone. These operate like flashcards, but many track your progress so you can isolate troublesome kanji.

, Radicals are commonly occurring symbols contained in a kanji, and these can often help you understand words you don't understand. For example, in the word 詩 (shi / poetry, poem) you have the main radical 言, which means ""speech."" Even if you didn't know the symbol 詩, by seeing the radical for ""speech,"" you could guess that the word is language related and may even be able to figure it out with context. Some common radicals include:⼈ / ⺅: person, people
⼊: to enter
⼑ / ⺉: knife, sword
⼖: to hide or conceal
⼝ : mouth, aperture, entrance, exit
⼟: earth
日: sun
月: moon
⼠: man, scholar, samurai
⼤: large or big
⼥: woman
⼦: child, son, Even if you don't know how to read a kanji or kanji compound, you can still understand it. For example, if you know the kanji for sugar (糖), urine (尿), and sickness (病), although you might not know how to pronounce the word, you could deduce that 糖尿病 means ""diabetes."" Diabetes is a disease where the body can't process sugar, which makes people sick and causes the sugar to pass out their body in urine. Some other examples of useful connections:


地下鉄 • chikatetsu • kanji meaning: earth + below + iron • English: subway
水球 • suikyuu • kanji meaning: water + ball • English: water polo
地理 • chiri • kanji meaning: earth + logic/arrangement • English: geography
数学 • suugaku • kanji meaning: number/law/figure + study • English: mathematics

, Even some native Japanese struggle sometimes with uncommon kanji. Give yourself plenty of time to learn these symbols, and add new ones to you list as you master them. In the nine years of education required for children by the Japanese government, approximately 2,000 kanji are taught.


You can practice reading with Japanese newspapers and online publications that use kanji.
For beginning kanji learners, you may want to read text that includes furigana, which are small hiragana letters over the kanji that assist with reading.
Although most native Japanese learn 2,000 kanji during primary and secondary school, general literacy for Japanese of often set at about 1,000 to 1,200 kanji.
This may seem like a big number, but many kanji and radicals repeat or combine to create new words. This means that after the first 500, you'll start to see patterns and similarities tha make reading these symbols easier."

Add minutes after ""heure."",
Learn shorthand terms for common times.,
Use ""moins"" to denote the minutes until an hour.,
Note morning and night with ""du matin,"" and ""de l'après-midi."",
Learn the vocabulary for noon and midnight.",How to Tell Time in French," To tell time, you'll need to know all of the possible hours and minutes in French. Check this phonetic list for a quick refresher if needed. At minimum, you should know:


1-12: une, deux, trois, quatre, cinq, six, sept, huit, neuf, dix, onze, douze.
15, 30, 45: quinze, trente, quarante-cinq.;
, Pronounced -- ""kell eurh eh-teel"" -- this the basic translation of ""What time is it?""


The word ""temps"" means ""time spent somewhere,"" not ""the time."" The word for time is ""heure,"" which is also the word for ""hour.""
For informal situations, you can also use ""avez-vous l'heure,"" or ""do you have the time?""

, To say it is one o'clock, you would say ""Il est une heure"" (eel eht euhn eurh). While we often omit the words ""o'clock"" in English, you cannot do this in French. You must always add ""heure"" after the hour.


Make time plural when there is more than one hour. For example, two o'clock is ""deux heures, and five o'clock is ""cinq heures.


, In French, the literal translation of 2:15 is ""two hours fifteen."" Thus to say 2:15 in French you would say, ""il est deux heures quinze."" or ""Il est deux heures et quart."" This works for any number of minutes.


4:27 -- Il est quatre heures vingt-sept.
10:12 -- Il est dix heures douze.
7:30 -- Il est sept heures trente.

, Much like in English, the French have other vocabulary for common times, like half-hours (""demie"") and quarter hours (""quart""). You add these after ""heure"" along with ""et"" (the French word for ""and""). Thus you could say 4:30 in French as, ""il est quatre heures et demie.""


Just like in English, no way is ""wrong."" There are just different ways to say each time.

, In English, we might say 6:45 as, ""it is quarter-to five,"" or 12:50 as, ""10 'til one."" The French do the same thing using the word ""moins,"" which means ""minus"" in English. So, to say 6:45, we might say, ""Il est sept heures moins le quart."" or ""Il est sept heures moins quart."" (without ""le"") which literally translates to ""It is seven o'clock minus fifteen.""


Many french speakers use this structure instead of saying larger, more complex numbers like 45 or 50.

, The French do not use AM or PM to note time. After the ""heure,"" add ""du matin"" for morning and ""de l'après-midi"" for the afternoon. So, 3:00 AM would be ""il est trois heures du matin,"" whereas 3:00 PM would be ""il est trois heures de l'après-midi.""

You can also use ""du soir"" to indicate the phrase, ""at night.""
However, most French speakers use 24-hour time. 3:00 PM would be viewed as 15:00, or ""quinze heures.""

, You do not need to use the full expression ""il est douze heures"" for midnight and noon. Instead, say ""il est midi"" for ""It is noon"" and say ""il est minuit"" for ""it is midnight.""


You cannot add minutes to this. It is incorrect to say ""il est midi quinze"" for 12:15 PM.

Learn the pronunciations of the numbers.,
Learn how to say two or more digit numbers.",How to Count to Ten in Mandarin," This four tones are denoted (in hanyupinyin format) by the symbols as: - / V \ . Basically, the tones follow the gradation of these symbols. For example, the first tone is represented by a horizontal dash (-), which means that there are no fluctuations of pitch; rather, the tone is held steady and high. The second tone (/) requires an upward rise in pitch, while the last tone (\) sounds as when you're extremely mad, it's the same tone as the word, ""No!"" when you're mad. The third tone (V) requires the tone to dip down and then rise again. This 4 tones can otherwise be written down as 1, 2, 3 or 4 respectively.;
, The following are the (simplified) Chinese characters from one to ten, followed by the hanyupinyin version, and then the pronunciation spelled out phonetically with the tone next to it.


一 yī (yi) 二 èr (er) 三 sān (san) 四 sì (si) - like a snake with 'uh' (say the vowel in the back of your throat)
五 wǔ (wu) (Not to be confused with wo meaning I or me.)

六 lìu (liu) 七 qī (qi) (say it in the front of your mouth, with your teeth together and your lips pulled to the sides)
八 bā (ba) 九 jiǔ (jiu) 十 shí (shi) (This time, say the vowel in the front of your mouth, with your teeth together)

, For numbers up to 99, just say the number in the tens place, then say ""十"" ""shi"", then the number in the one's place, for example. 46 is pronounced ”四十六“ ""sì shí lìu (si shi liu),"" and 82 is pronounced “八十二” ""bā shí èr (ba shi er).""

Don't be too harsh on yourself.",How to Learn Mandarin Chinese," Mandarin Chinese is a tonal language, which means that different tones can change the meaning of a word, even if the pronunciation and spelling are otherwise the same. It is essential to learn the different tones if you wish to speak Mandarin Chinese correctly. Mandarin Chinese has four main tones, as follows:


The first tone is a high, flat tone. Your voice stays flat, with no rise or dip in the way it sounds. Using the word ""ma"" as an example, the first tone is indicated using the symbol above the letter a: ""mā"".
The second tone is a rising tone. Your voice rises from a low to middle pitch, as if you were asking someone to repeat something by saying ""huh?"" or ""what?"" The second tone is indicated using the symbol ""má"".
The third tone is a dipping tone.The pitch goes from middle to low to high, like when you say the letter ""B"". When two third tone syllables are near each other, the second one retains its third tone sound while the first takes the sound of the second tone. The third tone is indicated using the symbol ""mǎ"".
The fourth tone is a lowering tone. The pitch goes rapidly from high to low, as if giving a command e.g. stop! Or as if you're reading a book and have come across something new and interesting and are saying ""huh"". The fourth tone is indicated using the symbol ""mà"".
Easy enough? If not, don't fret. It's definitely recommended to hear the tones demonstrated by a native speaker, since it's hard to get an idea of what they sound like purely through text.;
, No matter what language you're learning, the more words you have at your disposal, the sooner you will become fluent. Therefore, the next thing to do is to memorize some useful Chinese vocabulary.


Some good vocabulary lists to start with includes: times of day (morning: zǎo shàng, afternoon: xià wǔ, evening: wǎn shàng) body parts (head: tóu, feet: jiǎo, hands: shǒu) food (beef: niú ròu, chicken: jī, egg: jī dàn, noodles: miàn tiáo) along with colors, days, months, transport words, weather, etc.
When you hear a word in English, think about how you would say it in Mandarin. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you for this purpose. Attach little Chinese labels (with the character, the pinyin and the pronunciation) to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it!
Although having a wide vocabulary is good, remember that in Mandarin, accuracy is more important. It's no good learning a word if you can't pronounce it properly, using the correct tone, as different pronunciations could have entirely different meanings. For example, using the wrong tone (using mā instead of má) could be the difference between saying ""I want cake"" and ""I want coke"" - two completely different meanings.

, Luckily, the Mandarin numerical system is fairly straightforward and logical, and once you have learned the first ten numbers you will be able to count to 99.


Below you will find the numbers one to ten, written in simplified Chinese characters, followed by the Hanyu pinyin translation and the correct pronunciation. Make sure to practice saying each number using the correct tone.


One: written as (一) or yī, pronounced Two: written as (二) or èr, pronounced Three: written as (三) or sān, pronounced Four: written as (四) or sì, pronounced Five: written as (五) or wǔ, pronounced Six: written as (六) or liù, pronounced Seven: written as (七) or qī, pronounced Eight: written as (八) or bā, pronounced Nine: written as (九) or jiǔ, pronounced Ten: written as (十) or shí, pronounced Once you have mastered numbers one to ten, you can continue counting in double digits by saying the number in the tens' position, then the word shi, followed by the number in the one's position. For example:
The number 48 is written as sì shí bā, literally meaning ""four tens plus eight"". The number 30 is written as sān shí, literally meaning ""three tens"". The number 19 is written as yī shí jiǔ, literally meaning ""one ten plus nine"" (however in most Mandarin dialects the initial yī is omitted from numbers in the teens, as it is deemed unnecessary)
The word for hundred in Mandarin is (百) or baǐ, so 100 is written as yī baǐ, 200 hundred is written as èr baǐ, 300 is written as sān baǐ, etc.

, Once you have a basic grasp of vocabulary and pronunciation, you can move on to learning basic conversational phrases which are used in everyday Chinese speech.



Hello = nǐhǎo, pronounced What is your surname (family name)? = nín guì xìng, pronounced What's your name? = nǐ jiào shén me míng zìYes = shì, pronounced No = bú shì, pronounced Thank you = xiè xiè, pronounced You're welcome = bú yòng xiè, pronounced Excuse me = duì bu qǐ, pronounced I don't understand = wǒ bù dǒng, pronounced Goodbye = zài jiàn, pronounced , There is a common misconception that grammar does not exist in the Chinese language, but this is not true. Chinese grammar rules do exist, they are just very different to those in European or other language systems. Unlike these languages, Chinese is a very analytic language which is both good news and bad news for language learners.


For instance, in Chinese there are no complicated rules about conjugations, agreement, gender, plural nouns or tense. Most words consist of single syllables which are then combined to make compound words. This makes sentence construction fairly straightforward.
However, Chinese has its own set of grammar rules which do not have an equivalent in English, or other European languages. For example, Chinese uses grammatical features such as classifiers, topic-prominence and preference for aspect. As these features are not used in English, they can be quite difficult for learners to grasp.
However, despite the differences, Chinese does use the same word order as English mostly, i.e. subject - verb - object, making it easier to translate word for word. For example, the English phrase ""he likes cats"" is translated directly as ""tā (he) xǐ huan (likes) māo (cats).

, Pinyin is a system used for writing Mandarin Chinese using the Roman alphabet. Hanyu pinyin is the most common form of such Romanization, and is used in many textbooks and teaching materials.


Pinyin allows students of Mandarin to focus on their pronunciation, while also enabling them to read and write, without needing to learn complex Chinese characters. Although Pinyin uses the Roman alphabet, the pronunciation of its letters is often not intuitive to English speakers, which is why it must be studied carefully before it can be used.
For example, the letter ""c"" in Pinyin is pronounced like the ""ts"" in the word ""bits"", the letter ""e"" is pronounced like the ""er"" in the word ""hers"" and the letter ""q"" is pronounced like the ""ch"" in the word ""cheap"". Due to these differences, it is essential that you learn the correct Pinyin pronunciations before using it as a guide.
Although learning Pinyin pronunciations may seem like a pain, it can be extremely beneficial to your language learning and is still significantly easier than learning to recognize traditional Chinese characters.

, The final hurdle in learning Mandarin Chinese is learning to read and write traditional Chinese characters. This can take a very long time (even years) to master, as the only way to learn them is through memorization and continuous practice.


According to the BBC, there are over 50, 000 Chinese characters in existence, however most of these are rarely, if ever, used. An educated Chinese person will probably know about 8000 characters, but only about 2000 of these are necessary to read a newspaper.When writing Chinese characters, you will first need to learn each of the 214 ""radicals"" - which are essentially the building blocks of every Chinese character. Some radicals can stand on their own as independent characters, while others are used only within more complex characters.
It is also important that you follow the correct stroke order when writing the characters. There are a specific set of rules you will need to follow, such as left to right, top to bottom and horizontal before vertical.
There are many Chinese workbooks you can buy which will guide you in the correct formation of characters. These are usually intended for schoolchildren, but are useful to anyone attempting to learn Chinese characters.
One of the major benefits of learning Chinese characters is that you will also have access to Cantonese, Japanese, Korean and other literatures, which also use many traditional or simplified Chinese characters in their writings, even though the spoken languages are not the same.

, One of the best ways to improve your new language skills is to practice speaking with a native speaker. They will easily be able to correct any grammar or pronunciation mistakes you make and can introduce you to more informal or colloquial forms of speech that you won't find in a textbook.


If you have a Mandarin-speaking friend who is willing to help, that's great! Otherwise, you can place an ad in the local paper or online or investigate whether there are any pre-existing Mandarin conversation groups in the area.
If you can't locate any Mandarin-speakers nearby, try finding someone on Skype. They might be willing to exchange 15 minutes of Mandarin conversation for 15 minutes of English.
If you can't find someone on Skype , Try QQ (just google it , you will find it in the first link :)), It's a chat tool , only popular in China , There you can find many Language learning groups/rooms , Most people there are learning English . They will be glad to talk to you , Add the group(ID:229776426) , Hope you can find your language partner.

, If you need some extra motivation or feel you would learn better in a more formal setting, try signing up for a Chinese language course.


With the growth of Asian neighborhoods around the country, many classes taught by volunteers have popped up. They range in cost from $300 to $500 or more per year, plus other costs. You can also try an online Mandarin school.
Look out for language courses advertised at local colleges, schools or community centers.
If you're nervous about signing up for a class by yourself, drag a friend along. You'll have more fun and someone to practice with between classes!

, Get your hands on some Chinese DVDs (with subtitles) or watch Chinese cartoons online. This is an easy, entertaining way to get a feel for the sound and structure of the Mandarin Chinese language.


If you're feeling particularly proactive, try pausing the video after a simple sentence and repeat what has just been said. This will lend your Chinese accent an air of authenticity!
If you can't find any Chinese films to buy, try renting them from a movie rental store, which often have foreign language sections. Alternatively, see if your local library has any Chinese films or ask if they would be able to source some for you.

, Listening to Chinese music and/or radio is another good way to surround yourself in the language. Even if you can't understand everything, try to pick out keywords to help you get the gist of what's being said.


Get a Mandarin Chinese radio app on your phone, so you can listen on the go.
Try downloading Chinese podcasts to listen to while exercising or doing housework.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Mandarin Chinese speech, consider taking a trip to China, or even Taiwan. What better way to immerse yourself in the Mandarin language than a journey to its native land!

, Learning a language is a gradual process - you have to keep at it. Chinese is one of the hardest languages to learn, so take your time.

Make a German friend.,

Write.",How to Learn German," The vowels and consonants sound different in German than they do in English. Learn these sounds first so that you will have an easier time learning words and pronouncing them correctly.


Pay attention to how vowels sound alone, versus how they sound when they are used in conjunction. Much like English, two vowels together sound very different than either of them alone.
Similarly, the consonants can sound very different when used in certainly places in a word or when used in conjunction. Learn these variations so that you can pronounce words correctly.
Don't forget that German has a few extra letters that are not present in English. ( Ä Ö Ü ß ) You will need to learn these, as well as how they're pronounced, if you want to understand and be understood.;
, Learn the most basic words so that you have a starting framework in which to place the nouns, verbs, and adjectives you will learn later. It is also important to learn some basic words before traveling to Germany or trying to talk to any Germans.


Start with important singular words, like “yes”, “no”, “please”, “thank you”, and the numbers 1-30.
Move on to basics like “I am” (Ich bin), “You are” (Du bist), “He/She is” (Er/Sie ist), etc.

, Get a basic idea of how sentences are constructed. This will not be too difficult, as German is very similar to English in this way. There are slight variances but you can learn some now and will learn the more complex ones with time.


Germans will generally be able to understand what you are trying to say, even if you get the word order wrong. Pronunciation goes much further towards being understood, so worry about that much more in the beginning.

, Once you have a basic framework with which to learn and use the language, you will want to start learning words. Nouns are a great place to start. Try to start with the most basic and necessary nouns, the sorts of things and people that you would see and use every day.


Nouns are subject to a case system, gendering, and will also change based on how many of that thing there are. Learn how all of these things affect nouns while you are increasing your vocabulary.
Examples of good nouns to start with include food words, the objects you find around the house, important places around town, and important people you may need to talk to or find (such as a doctor, police officer, etc.).

, You will also want to learn key verbs. This will give all those nouns you just learned something to do! German verbs are conjugated. You will need to learn the basic conjugation systems while you are expanding your vocabulary.


Learn the most basic verbs before you learn complex ones. To run, to walk, to jump, to stop, to fall, to be, to have, to say, to do, to get, etc. These will be the most useful in the beginning and are easier to say and learn than more complex words.

, Once you have some nouns and verbs down, you will also want to learn some adjectives, so that you can make your sentences more complex. Adjectives are also subject to a case system, so be sure you understand the basics of this as you learn.

, While you are learning all of these words, try to read. This will give you opportunities to practice as well as to look up words that you don’t know. Read very basic books, such as children’s books, since these will be easier for you to follow so early on.

, Watch films with subtitles on. This will allow you to enjoy a movie but it will also get you used to how the language sounds. As you are watching the film, you can repeat words and phrases after the actors. This is also a good way to learn some basic vocabulary. Try to pay attention to how the translation correlated with what they are saying on screen.

, As your knowledge advances, you will want to take classes that correspond to the level that you are at. These will challenge you and introduce you to the more complex aspects of the language. Advanced courses are available through your local colleges and universities, but it is also possible to take online courses from reputable sources, such as the Goethe Institute.

, The German state strongly encourages cultural exchange and you will find that there are a number of opportunities to study there. Living in Germany will increase your language abilities better than anything else, as this will immerse you in the language and you will get to see how it is used first-hand.


You can go to Germany through an exchange arranged by your high school or university, or you can apply to a university or community college in Germany. Student visas will be granted to allow you to stay in the country and tuition is much less expensive than in many other places. You may also be able to get a job and work, rather than going to school. If you are young enough, it is even possible to work as an au pair (or nanny). English-speaking nannies are coveted in Germany.

, Making a German friend will give you the opportunity to practice your German, get advice on pronunciation and grammar, learn new words, as well as getting to know the culture. You can chat with them online, make calls over Skype, or you can try to find a local German (such as a student at your university).

, Read everything you can get your hands on. Try to read at progressively higher levels, so that your vocabulary is being challenged. You can read from any source, but try to read sources that are likely to have good use of grammar and spelling. This will help you to learn the language correctly.


You can read online copies of German newspapers and magazines. Examples include Die Zeit, Frankfurter Rundschau, or Der Spiegel (which tends to be of a slightly lower reading level than the newspapers).

, This will challenge you to understand the language without the crutch of relying on the translation. You may not understand words all of the time but as time goes on you will learn more and more. This can be a great way to build uncommon vocabulary, as you will get to hear the kind of language that doesn’t come up in everyday conversation.

, It doesn’t really matter what you write, just write. Writing reasonably well requires a decent understanding of the language and the grammar but it will help you learn faster and become more comfortable with the language. If at all possible, find a native German to read whatever it is you are writing and give you feedback.


You can write letters, a journal, movie reviews, or anything else you can think of.

Listen and repeat.",How to Count to 20 in German," If you want to learn to count to 20 (and beyond) in German, the easiest way to start is to break the numbers down into smaller chunks. Learn the first five numbers first, and proceed to the next five when you have those down. Here are the first five numbers, with pronunciation in parentheses:One is ""eins"" (ighnss).
Two is ""zwei"" (tsvigh). Remember to pronounce ""ts"" like the ""tz"" in the English word ""quartz.""
Three is ""drei"" (drigh).
Four is ""vier"" (feer).
Five is ""fünf"" (fuunf). Most Germans pronounce it with more of an ""m"" sound than an ""n"" (like ""fuumf"") because the ""mf"" consonant combination is easier to pronounce than ""nf."" So don't feel embarrassed if you find yourself doing the same thing.;
, The best way to learn to count is to count from one to five over and over again until it becomes second nature. When you count things in your daily life, count in German instead of in English.You can also write the words on cards and tape them to a mirror or a door you look at regularly. This will help solidify the letters and words in your mind.

, Once you've mastered counting to five, you're ready to add the next five numbers to the mix. Here are numbers six through ten in German, with pronunciation in parentheses after the German word:Six is ""sechs"" (zekhs). The ""ch"" sound is a hard ""k"" sound, spoken from the back of your throat. Think of the noise you make when you clear your throat, or that a cat makes when it hisses.
Seven is ""sieben"" (ZEE-ben). Capitalization of a syllable in pronunciation tells you which syllable to stress.
Eight is ""acht"" (ahkht). Remember to say it from the back of your throat.
Nine is ""neun"" (noyn).
Ten is ""zehn"" (tsayn).

, You can practice six through ten for awhile first if you want, so you have them down pat as well as you memorized one to five. When you're ready, start practicing counting all the way from one to ten.You can use the same practice methods that worked for you when you practiced counting from one to five.
You might also be able to find counting songs for German children on the internet. You may feel silly listening to children's music, but listening to these songs can help you learn to count in German the same way you probably learned to count in English.

, Just as in English, the numbers 11 and 12 in German are outliers – they aren't formed the way the other larger numbers are. For this reason, it's easiest to learn them separately.Eleven is ""elf"" (elf).
Twelve is ""zwölf"" (tsvoolf). This is a deceptively difficult word for native English speakers to pronounce.

, The ""teens"" in German are formed similarly to the way these number-words are formed in English, although English actually gets a bit more complicated.In German, all you have to do is take the word for ten, ""zehn,"" which you already know.
On the front of ""zehn,"" put the word from one to nine that corresponds to the second digit of the number.
So, for example, 13 in German is ""dreizehn"" (DRIGH-tsayn). Literally, you can think of it as ""three and ten,"" which add up to 13.
All the other number-words in the teens are formed the same way, with stress always on the first syllable.

, The easiest way to learn to continue counting in German is to first memorize the words for the tens – 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90. Many of these words are formed by adding ""zig"" to the word for the initial number, as you'll see:Twenty is ""zwanzig"" (TSVAHN-tsikh).
Thirty is ""dreißig"" (DRIGH-sikh). The ""ß,"" called an Eszett or scharfes S (sharp S), is a unique German letter pronounced essentially like the ""s"" sound in ""kiss"" or ""bless.""
Forty is ""vierzig"" (FEER-tsikh).
Fifty is ""fünfzig"" (FUUNF-tsikh).
Sixty is ""sechzig"" (ZEKH-tsikh).
Seventy is ""siebzig"" (ZEEP-tsikh).
Eighty is ""achtzig"" (AHKH-tsikh).
Ninety is ""neunzig"" (NOYN-tsikh).

, Once you know how to count by tens and how to count from one to nine, you have all the building blocks you need to create virtually any other number in German.Start with the smallest number, and work up from there to build the word. For example, 21 in German is ""einundzwanzig"" (IGN-oont-tsvahn-tsikh). A literal translation would be ""one and twenty,"" as ""und"" is the German word for ""and.""
All numbers up to a hundred are built this way, with the word for 100 being ""hundert"" (HOON-dert). The word literally means ""hundred,"" so 100 is einhundert.
As you can probably guess, the building starts again here, the same as it did with the lower numbers. Write (or say) the hundreds first, then the digits that follow.
Keep in mind that there's no ""und"" or ""and"" between the hundred and the other digits. Since people often say ""three hundred and eleven"" in English to mean 311, you might be tempted to add it in.
Since you know how to pronounce the building blocks, you know how to build and pronounce some lengthy words. For example, 535 in German is ""fünfhundertfünfunddreißig.""

, Unlike English or French, the German language has an inherent logic in the way words are put together. This logic can help you understand how German words are put together, as well as how they're pronounced.You can see this logic easily in the German words for rooms in a house. The word for ""room"" in German is ""zimmer,"" and many German words for rooms are a combination of the word ""zimmer"" with the verb that you would use to describe what you did in that room.
For example, the German word for ""bedroom"" is ""Schlafzimmer."" Since ""schlaf"" means ""sleep,"" a literal translation would be ""sleep(ing) room.""
Likewise, the German word for ""dining room"" is ""Esszimmer"" – ""ess"" meaning ""eat"" and ""zimmer"" meaning ""room,"" literally ""eat(ing) room.""
You will see this logic at work when you are learning to count in German.

, While most of the German letters look the same as English letters, they may be pronounced differently. If English is your first language, you must practice repeatedly to overcome your first impulse to pronounce those letters as you would in English.Pronounce ""w"" the way you would pronounce a ""v"" in English.
A ""v"" in German is pronounced like an ""f"" in English.
You can put those two pronunciation rules together to say a phrase related to counting. To ask ""how much?"" in German, you would say ""Wie viel?"" This question is pronounced ""vee feel.""
A ""j"" in German is pronounced like a ""y"" – as in ""ja"" (yah), the German word for ""yes.""
German also includes many consonants next to each other that may seem difficult or impossible to pronounce if you're used to speaking in English.
Generally, when you see two consonants together, you want to pronounce both sounds quickly. Neither letter is silent, as is common in English. For example, if you see a ""ts"" together, you pronounce it much like the ""tz"" in the English word ""quartz.""

, The German language has some vowel sounds that aren't present in English, or at least aren't common. These sounds can be difficult to make because they're entirely foreign both to your mouth and your ear.For example, the sound of an ""ö"" has no equivalent in English. It approaches the ""i"" sound in the word ""girl,"" but saying it literally that way is still not quite right. You will see this sound in the German word for the number 11.
Likewise, the sound of an ""ü"" in German has no exact equivalent in English. It's somewhat like the vowel sound in the word ""due,"" but a little rounder than that. If you're familiar with French, think of the ""u"" sound in words such as ""une"" or ""etude,"" which are closer to the correct sound.
The only way you can get sounds like this correct is to practice words with those sounds over and over again.

, A diphthong is a combination of two vowels that are blended together into a single sound. However, you can hear the sound of both vowels if you draw out the word.For example, the German diphthongs ""eu"" and äu"" are both pronounced similarly to the way ""o"" is pronounced in the English words ""boy"" or ""joy.""
However, just because there are two vowels together in a German word does not mean they are a diphthong.
Keep in mind that if you see an ""e"" at the end of a word, it's typically not silent. The ""e"" in German has a sound like ""eh"" or ""uh."" So ""treue,"" the German word for ""true,"" would be pronounced ""troy-uh.""

, The best way to get your pronunciation right is to say the words over and over, as well as listen to native speakers. Search online for German videos and listen to the words.At this point, it doesn't matter that you don't understand what the words mean. You're listening to become accustomed to the sound of the German language.
You also should pay attention to the way Germans move their mouths when they speak. Generally, the German language is a more tight-lipped language, with tension in the jaw.
If you try to imitate this and hold your jaw more tightly, you may have an easier time getting the pronunciation right.

Sit in on a local German class.,
Take an online class.,
Work with a private tutor.",How to Improve Your German Speaking Skills1," Many colleges and universities have German classes because it may interest students or because young scholars need the language to do their work. Looking at the course offerings of local learning institutions can help you find a German class at the level you need to improve.Check university websites for courses in German. If you need to learn the very basics, sit in on an introductory level German language class. If you're already somewhat proficient, look beyond traditional language departments to classes taught in German in other disciplines such as history or chemistry.
Find a faculty member who specializes in German or Germany. They may be able to point you to courses.
Ask if you may attend on a professor’s course without enrolling at the university. Also consider asking the university registrar how you can audit a German course.;
, Some universities and institutions such as the Goethe Institute may offer online courses in German. Figuring out your different options for online classes can help you decide which program will help you improve the most.Check course requirements and any fees you may need to pay. Many programs allow you to participate for free.Rely on a course from a university or other institution of learning. They often have better and more useful resources for improving your German.

, If you can’t find any courses that fit your needs, hire a private tutor. Professors, graduate students, or native German speakers may give you private lessons. This can be expensive, but it is a great way to get one on one exposure to German.Contact professors in your local area to see if they teach private lessons in German. Ask for suggestions of other professors or graduate students who may be able to offer a private course. They may also know local native German speakers who can tutor you.

Remember that Germans have a lot of tension in their cheeks when they speak. To sound like a German, you need to hold your mouth right.


When you open your mouth, shape it as if you are forming a large ""o"" or a lowercase ""u.""Try to find videos of people speaking German so you can understand how they keep their mouth when speaking. Germans also pronounce some consonants and vowels differently than English speakers would.;
, Although German does share some things in common with English, some of the vowels are pronounced differently. This will be very important when you try to count in German.In German, the vowel combination of ""ei"" is pronounced like the ""i"" in ""lie"" or the ""y"" in ""dry."" For example, the word ""drei"" in German means three. However, it's pronounced ""dry."" Similarly, the word ""frei"" means free in German. It's pronounced ""fry.""
It's the opposite for the vowel combination ""ie."" This combination is pronounced like the ""ee"" in the English word ""free."" So when you say the German word for four (""vier"") remember to pronounce the ""ie"" in it as ""ee.""
The vowel combination of ""eu"" is pronounced ""oy"" in German.
If you see an umlaut over a vowel, you pronounce that vowel differently.The German word for ""five"" has an umlaut: fünf. The ü should sound like ""ee"" but with rounded lips.

, One of the key ways that speaking German differs from English is how you pronounce some consonants. Some will be pronounced similarly to English, but not all.


The consonant ""v"" is pronounced as an ""f"" sound. So make an ""f"" sound, not a ""v"" sound, when you pronounce the German word for four.In German, the consonant ""s"" is pronounced as a ""z"" when it starts a word, such as ""sieben"" (the German word for seven).
When the letter ""r"" ends a word, it's pronounced lightly, as in ""uh."" The letter ""r"" is also pronounced very lightly when it's in the middle of a word. Put your tongue on the roof of your mouth as you say it.So, the word in German for four ""vier"" is pronounced ""feeah."" When the consonant ""z"" starts a word, pronounce it as ""ts.""

, To pronounce ""eins,"" say the word ""eye"" but pronounce the ending ""nz."" It's pretty easy to count to 10 in German now that you know how to pronounce some of the key consonants and vowels.

, In German, ""zwei"" is pronounced as ""tsvy."" The ""zw"" is not pronounced as an English ""z"" would be, but rather is said as a ""ts"" sound.

, Pronounce it as ""dry,"" with the ""r"" pronounced guttural.

, This word also has different consonant sounds than English. Pronounce ""vier"" like the English word ""fear,"" but remember not to end with a hard ""r."" Say it more like ""feeah.""

, Say it like ""foonf,"" and put a big accent on the ""u"" and make it an elongated sound.

, In this case, you do use a ""z"" sound. Pronounce it ""zecks.""

, Pronounce it as ""zeebhen."" The ""s"" sound when it starts a sentence sounds like an English ""z.""

, Pronounce this German word as ""ahkt.""

, Pronounce it ""noyn.""

, Don't forget the German rule that the ""z"" starting a sentence is pronounced with a ""ts"" sound; thus, pronounce ""zehn"" as ""tsehn.""


You might also need to know how to say the word for zero in German once you've mastered how to count 1 through 10. Zero is ""null,"" but that's pronounced as ""nool.""

, Once you've mastered basic German pronunciation and how to count past 10, try counting higher! It's easy.


Put the word ""zehn"" after each number to indicate you've added 10 when counting from 13-19. So, ""neunzehn"" is how you say 19 and ""achtzehn"" is how you say 18, and so on. Eleven is pronounced ""elf"" and 12 is ""zwölf.""Twenty is ""zwanzig."" To count past 20, start with the German word for the second number and add the word for the number 1-10 and ""und"" and then ""zwanzig."" So, 21 is ""einundzwanzig,"" which literally means ""1 and 20"" (while dropping the ""s"" in ""eins."") To say 22, follow the same process. The word for 22 is ""zweiundzwanzig."" And so on through 29.
Follow the same process all the way up to 100. However, instead of zwanzig, put the words for 30 (""dreißig"" - the ß is ""ss"" in German and pronounced the same as the ""s"" in English), 40 (""vierzig"" - pronounced ""feahtsig'), 50 (""funfzig""), 60 (""sechzig""), 70 (""siebzig""), 80 (""achtzig""), and 90 (""neunzig""). The German word for 100 is ""(ein)hundert"" (pronounce the ""d"" like a ""t"" and the ""u"" like ""oo."")

, One beauty of the Internet is that it's easier than ever before to find native speakers of foreign languages to practice with. The same is true of German.


Various language sites online will match you with native speakers. Some allow you to hear pronunciation by putting your cursor on a letter.Look up You Tube videos of people speaking German, including counting from 1 to 10, so that you can hear the words before you try speaking them.Some sites use music and song to teach children and others how to count in German., German is a very common language at universities. It should be pretty easy to find a local school that teaches the language if you live in a big enough city. Otherwise, you could check online.You could also record yourself counting to 10 in German, and then play it back. This is one of the best ways to perfect your speech.
Traveling to or living in Germany is going to greatly enhance your language abilities. Speaking a foreign language repeatedly to native speakers is really the best way to learn it.

Identify the severity of the situation.,
Choose variants of common German apology language to address each of the above situations.,
Pronounce your German vocabulary well.,
Evaluate using additional language to enhance your basic apologies.,
Utilize German sentence structure for longer responses or expressions.",How to Apologise in German," As in all languages, forms of apology in German will differ based on the kind of situation for which the speaker is apologizing. This ranges from the basic forms of light apology for situations like squeezing through crowds, to more serious situations where a personal apology is necessary.;
,


For an informal, polite apology like asking someone for the time, asking them to move aside, or other similar situations, the Germans used the words ""Entschuldigung"" or ""Entschuldige, bitte."" This translates roughly as ""excuse me.""
Another common German phrase for apology is ""Das tut mir Leid."" This translates to ""I'm sorry"" or ""That's too bad."" It's important to note that in general, ""Das tut mir Leid"" has the association with saying ""I'm sorry (for you)"" and not asking for forgiveness. Another common form of this phrase is ""Es tut mir leid."" (I'm sorry for this or that)
Another alternative for apology in German is the expression ""Verzeihung."" This literally means ""forgiveness"" and is generally understood as a request for forgiveness, or an effective apology. You can also use an imperative form, such as ""Please forgive me"" which would be ""Bitte verzeih mir"".

, Listen to audio resources or native speaking individuals pronouncing these phrases in order to model your pronunciation well and accurately imitate the sounds that will make your speech sound good.

, For example, one commonly used word in German is ""bitte,"" which translates to ""please."" You could add this to forms of apology in phrases like ""Bitte verzeih mir"" (see above) to more accurately convey your expression. You should take into account that some combinations, such as ""Verzeihung, bitte"" are usually not used when apologizing heartfeltedly, but is rather used, when bumping into someone or asking someone to step aside, so you don't bump into them (comparable to ""Excuse me, please"" in English).

, Following up a single phrase with clarification requires understanding the unique structure of German sentences. Take an advanced look at German grammar and expand your vocabulary to be able to give a more detailed apology.


Consider the phrasing of ""Ich habe das nicht gewollt,"" a phrase that translates into English as ""I didn't mean to do that."" Taking each word in literal translation, the phrase would look something like this: ""I have that not wanted."" (/""I have not wanted that"")
Assess German sentence structure in phrases like ""Kann ich es wieder gut machen?"" This translates as ""Can I make it up to you?"" but word for word, something like ""Can I (it) again good make?"" (or in a more understandable way ""Can I make it good again?)

Complete an undergraduate degree in English Literature or a related field.,
Apply for master’s programs in English Literature.,
Complete an application for a PhD program in English literature.,
Publish papers and other original research.,
Complete your dissertation.,
Search for open positions at colleges and universities the year before you graduate.,
Be prepared to work in a related field.,
Continue to publish and maintain a good teaching record.",How to Become an English Literature Professor," Though it will be more beneficial to have a degree in English Literature, a degree in a related field or subject like Comparative Literature or Creative Writing can also move you forward in your career. You should maintain an excellent grade point average and do well overall in your undergraduate degree to appear more appealing to graduate schools.In some cases, you can teach English at the higher education level even if your undergraduate degree is in an unrelated field like fine art or engineering. However, you will need to able to demonstrate that you have a high level of expertise and writing ability in your applications to graduate English programs.
In a bachelor’s English Literature program, you may cover subjects such as English literature, American literature, African American literature, Postcolonial literature, Shakespeare, nonfiction, global literature, and contemporary novels and short stories.;
, To teach English Literature at the college or university level as a professor, you will need to begin by completing your master’s in English Literature. Many master’s programs are one to two years and require you to choose a sub-field of English literature that you would like to specialize in, for example, the seventeenth-century novel, postcolonial literature, or American poetry. You will be required to produce a written dissertation, known as your master's thesis, on your chosen topic of specialization in order to graduate.During your master’s degree, you should try to get more experience in the classroom as an instructor. If possible, you should apply for a teacher assistant (T.A.) position, which will allow you to work closely with an experienced professor and gain first hand experience in a college classroom. Your responsibilities as T.A. may include organizing class materials, instructing students on small tasks, grading assignments, preparing exams, and lecturing on topics to the class. Your professor will give you expectations around how many hours a week you are expected to put into your T.A. position., In your application, indicate your area of expertise, your readiness for doctoral research, and your past accomplishments in the field. Include examples of your work from your undergraduate or master's program.To complete the application for most programs, you will need to provide a statement of purpose, a CV or resume, letters of recommendation (at least two for most programs) and a writing sample. A writing sample that showcases your best writing in essay or paper form is expected for the application.
In a recent study done by an economist, data showed that getting a PhD from a top 10 ranked school can improve your chances of landing a position as an English Literature professor. Though you may be able to find a position if you go to a lower ranked university for your PhD, you may end up working with undergraduates with weak academic backgrounds. Take this information into account when you are applying for PhD programs.You should focus on coursework and expanding the scope of your reading during the first two years as a doctoral student. You should also try to secure a position as a teaching assistant or lecturer during the middle years of your doctoral program. Teaching experience is essential for becoming an English literature professor.

, You should try to do this as soon as possible, or at least by the second year of your degree. Having a record of publications and research will look good on your resume when you are applying for English literature teaching positions.Ideally, you will publish papers early in your PhD career and often. You should try to gear your seminar papers towards topics that you are interested in or have specialized knowledge in the subject. You can then revise them and submit them for publication in journals. To submit papers for publication, you should look on the website of the publication for the submission guidelines. Each publication will have their own guidelines to follow in order to submit your article for consideration. You can find a database of current English literature journals for submission here.

, You will then need to complete a dissertation by the end of your sixth or seventh year in graduate school that demonstrates your mastery of your chosen sub-field, your ability to conduct original research, and your writing ability. Once your complete your dissertation, your degree will be complete and you can enter the workforce.

, Between 2012-2022, the job market for post secondary teachers is expected to rise by 19%. However, it can be difficult to get a position straight out of your PhD and academics is a competitive market, so you should begin your job search while you are still completing your PhD.The most desirable jobs are tenure-track positions at major universities; after those, look for lecturer positions or adjunct faculty posts. Teaching-intensive jobs at junior or community colleges are another option.
You should also look for postdoctoral research positions, as they are a good stepping-stone to move from the completion of your PhD to a permanent position. These positions can allow you to pursue further research and, often, gain teaching experience, increasing your job prospects later.
Often, you may find that many job offers are for part time work as an adjunct professor. Even with a PhD, many masters graduates struggle to find full time work, especially if they did not attend an Ivy League masters program. In fact, 58% of community college courses are taught by adjunct professorsand at least 50% of all university faculties are not tenure tracked.It's important that you keep an open mind and do not only search for tenure tracked or full time teaching positions, as these positions may not be available for a long time in the current state of the field.
Keep in mind your salary may fluctuate based on what state you are teaching in. For example, post secondary teachers in Vermont had an annual mean wage of $75,860 and the median annual wage for post secondary English teachers in California was $82,290.
In general, the median annual wage for post secondary English teachers as of 2013 was $60,920. The upper 90% of these teachers can make $116,460 or more per year, and the lowest 10% of these teachers can make $32,610 or less.

, Many newly graduated PhD English literature students can have a difficult time finding a position as a professor at a university. Some students end up teaching composition or reading and comprehension, instead of English literature. You may also find more open positions in interdisciplinary studies or in non-academic studies. Often, PhD programs do not prepare students for other options besides a career as an English literature professor, which has been a point of criticism from economists and individuals working in English literature PhD departments.It’s important to be open to work in other related fields once you graduate from your PhD program. You may find a position as an English literature professor at a university, or you may have to branch out to teaching reading composition and technical writing. Some PhD graduates have also found success teaching at high schools, especially elite high schools. These positions can pay well and offer a more secure teaching career.

, Once you secure a position at a university or college, you should continue to publish new work every year and maintain a positive teaching record. If you are not already tenured, you may be offered a tenured position at the university you currently work for or at other universities based on your publishing credentials and your teaching record."

Find a radio station broadcasting in the language you are studying.,

Try a few different stations until you find one(s) that seem to work best.,

Set aside some time each day to listen.,

Don't worry if you don't understand anything at first.,

Use any contextual clues available to you to begin to understand what you hear.,

Use contextual clues from the radio website.,

Don't worry about skipping words you don't know, especially at first.,

Try to understand a little more each time you listen.,

Be patient and persistent.,

Most of all, have fun.",How to Learn a Language by Listening to the Radio,"

If you live in an area where the language is spoken, you may find a local radio station just by scanning the dial. For example, if you want to learn Spanish and you live in many parts of the United States, there may be a local station broadcasting in Spanish. If you live near Quebec, you will probably be able to pick up some French stations.
If there is no radio station near you in the language you are studying, look online for internet radio stations. There are many possibilities available through live streaming nowadays; read How to broadcast radio from your computer for more details. Or, listen the old-fashioned way with a shortwave radio. The Internet usually works better, though.
Try to find a talk radio station or a station that has talk radio style programming rather than just music. You can listen to music, too, if you enjoy it, but you'll learn language best by listening to speech.
You may have to figure out how to search the web in the language you're seeking. If you know any native speakers who can help, ask them to help you find a station for you. If not, use a dictionary or online translator if you need to, and use a search engine to search for the word for ""radio"" and the name of a country or region in the local language. Don't be afraid to guess a bit to navigate the sites once you arrive.
You'll probably be able to find at least a few possibilities in English-language directories, such as the Radio Locator at http://www.radio-locator.com/.;
, Skip the loudmouth DJs who probably don't make much sense even to those who do speak the language. For learning the language, you'll be better off if you can find a station that focuses more on things like news, weather, and call-in advice programs.

Find a program that makes you want to listen. If politics is your thing, find a political talk show or a news broadcast that covers political developments. If you're a huge soccer fan, tune in to the game. When you want to understand what's being said for reasons above and beyond learning the language, learning is easier.
Sometimes you can find kids' programming on line, which might have narration of stories or simpler dialogue that is easier for you to follow.

, Even if you only listen for five or ten minutes each day, you'll still be exposed to the language, and that's what you are trying to do., If you're only getting the occasional word, you're still getting something. Even if you don't understand a word, you're still hearing the intonation and rhythm, the sound and the flow of the language. As you progress, you'll get better at picking out words and interpreting their meanings as they flow past at the speed of speech. This intonation and rhythm is also part of the accent that you will develop., One place to start is to listen to things that repeat.

The call sign and the commercials repeat exactly, often with jingles that will help you distinguish them from one another. Use these things as bookmarks and jumping-off points.
Things like weather and traffic reports don't repeat exactly, but they're often quite repetitive, in the sense that they'll always be talking about sun and rain and delays on roads.
The programs themselves repeat less, but you will still have some context if you figure out that the psychologist is on every day at 8.

,

If you're listening to Internet radio, see if the website has any shows as podcasts so that you can back up and listen to a segment several times. The repetition in listening is an important part of learning accurately.
Also look around for transcripts of shows or even little blurbs that tell you what each show is. Even the titles will give you something on which to build.
If you're listening to the news, the website may well have articles about the same news items that you can refer to while or after you listen. Even headlines of the articles can be enough to give you an handle on the topic being discussed.

, Looking up every word (even if you can spell it) is a motivation killer and it's not too effective for remembering the words. At this point, you're listening for language in general anyway, not because you actually need the details of each caller's question.

Get all you can from context. If you figure out the sense of a word for yourself, you'll understand that word as it is really used, and you won't need to think about that word as a translation of a word in your native language. You will also be far more likely to remember that word and be able to use it.
Do look up a word if you have heard it several times and you still don't understand it.
Also look up a word if only one word or a few words are preventing you from understanding the larger meaning.
If you don't understand all the words, choose the most common and the ones of interest or relevance to you to learn first. This strategy means that you will learn words in the order you need them.

, One day, you might figure out that what you're hearing is a weather report. Over the next days, challenge yourself to pick out the words for ""sun"" or ""rain"" or ""degrees,"" and so on. Over time, work up to understanding more and more what the weather forecast is in the place where the radio station is based., Languages are not small or simple, and learning a new language is a lifetime endeavor. Learn a few words today, any way you learn them, and learn a few more tomorrow. Eventually they will grow to add up to meaning, and it will get easier to understand, and to add on to what you can understand.

Find your own balance. It's ultimately up to you how much time to devote to listening, how much time to devote to other efforts to learn the language, and how much time to devote to your language overall. The right mix is the one that works best for you.
Don't get discouraged by what you don't understand. Instead, treat it as a challenge. You may find that the announcers speak clearly enough to understand, but that callers mumbling across poor phone connections are unintelligible. You may grow to understand the newscasts but have trouble understanding a rapid-fire sportscaster. Celebrate what you do understand and what you are learning, and don't worry too much about the parts that are still missing.

, If it's drudgery, it will be hard to make yourself do it every day. If it's fun, a game, a puzzle, something you look forward to, then you'll be listening to more and richer broadcasts as the months and years go by, and one day you'll realize you understood the whole show!"

Editors send their finished copy to the project manager who should consolidate all the copy and confirm its appropriateness for publishing and reach of the target audience.

Listen to the radio.,
Read, read, read.,
Watch films, TV, lectures, instructional videos; listen to music.,
Phone a friend.,
Learn to greet, apologize and thank people in the second language.,
Think.,
Write it down.",How to Master a Second Language," Listening to a radio show or even music broadcast in the respective language is a fantastic way of tuning your ears in to the language's phonetics. Many radio apps can be downloaded from app stores or the internet on multiple devices and many are free of charge, meaning you have access to a host of genres and channels to suit your interests. If you're after a developing a richer vocabulary and more creative use of language, you may be interested in old radio theatre programs and audio books, which focus on listening as an art form and means of entertainment.


Whether you're taking the tube home from work, or doing some gardening, hearing conversations in the target language is one of the best things you can do to accustom yourself to the subtleties, colloquialisms and rhythms.;
, Picking up a weekly edition of a newspaper or magazine in the target language - 'Le Monde', 'Correre della serra' or 'Der Spiegel', for example - is one of the best methods for picking up new vocabulary and reinforcing your grasp of already-learnt vocabulary. As well as increasing your feel of the structure of the language and the use of different lexis, it will provide you with a culturally interesting experience by reading around the current affairs of the country; something which is an integral part of foreign language learning

, Arguably one of the best activities that is open to you when learning a new language, watching films and listening to music at a comfortable pace in the target language (with or without subtitles, depending on your ability) can help your vocabulary to develop and help you to understand conversational conventions in the respective language. Take note of words or phrases which you do not know the meaning of, then learn them afterwards. TV series are also a great way of doing this, especially if they appeal to your sense of humour (assuming you have one!)

, Having a friend who is like-minded in your motivation to master a foreign language can be a great opportunity to improve both yours and his/her grasp. To begin with, an hour of conversation a day, slowly increased to two hours, then three hours and so forth will gradually accustom your brain to switching into the foreign language and getting your head around its grammar, vocabulary and sounds. Better still, if you have a family member or friend who can fluently speak your respective language, take advantage of this!

, A simple 'Hello' in the local language will find people willing to look in your direction. You can further your conversations while at the same time enacting your most important need. Apologizing to someone is another technique that will help in the long run when you are at a foreign destination. Learn a few short words that may help you. And finally, learn to bid a cheerful goodbye in your second language.

, Pensez. Denken. No matter how many different methods people choose to become fluent in their target language, the almost universal opinion is that when you feel like you are 'thinking' in the language, this is a definitive mark of success. Making a significant effort to 'say' things in your head throughout the day in the target language is a brilliant way of getting cognitively used to articulating your thoughts in the language. If you are at a beginner-intermediate level, try thinking of the equivalent for each thought, desire or opinion you have in the foreign language; this will prepare you for complete mastery.

, Keep a diary in the foreign language and add in entries every day (with a foreign dictionary), roughly a page long so as to improve your written skills in the language. Alternatively, you could arrange to converse via email or letters to a pen-pal/family friend who speaks the language, which is one of the most agreed upon methods of mastering the foreign tongue.

Obtain Uzbek language learning materials.",How to Learn Uzbek1," Before the fall of the Soviet Union, Uzbek was not a widely published foreign language. However, there is a small but steadily growing array of phrasebooks, self-teaching courses, textbooks, grammars, and dictionaries available in English on Uzbek. If you read Turkish or Russian, you will find even more resources available at your disposal.


Check what's available online, at your local library, and local book shop; universities with Turkic and Central Asian Studies programs may also have a broader selection of Uzbek references as well. Do your homework.;

Listen to Uzbek.,
Befriend Uzbek speakers.,
Take an Uzbek course or find an Uzbek tutor.",How to Learn Uzbek2," In order to build an ear for any language, you have to listen to it as much as possible––Uzbek is no exception. If you conduct a simple Google or YouTube search, you will find a mosaic of Uzbek audio and video clips, media sources, and the like available for you to listen to. One excellent resource is BBC Uzbek.

, If you are aware of an Uzbek diaspora where you live or you have access to penpal websites and online chatrooms, find Uzbek speaking friends. You need to immerse yourself in Uzbek food and culture as well as have people to practice your language skills with.

, There is nothing better than learning under the proper guidance of an experienced teacher. Although finding language instruction for Uzbek may pose an incredible challenge because of its rarity outside Asia, it doesn't hurt to still look. There may be a visiting Uzbek student studying in your area who would love to do some tutoring!

Throw English grammar out the window.,
Don't be afraid to make mistakes.",How to Learn Uzbek3," Uzbek has more in common with Japanese and Korean than it does English, meaning that learning Uzbek will be challenging but rewarding. Notable features of the language that are different from English include subject-object-verb sentence order, vowel harmony, and suffixes/agglutination. However, unlike English or most European languages, Uzbek has highly regular phonetic spelling, no irregular verbs, and is gender neutral; learn a rule and apply it to all. 

, Native speakers won't scorn you if you make mistakes. There are so few foreigners who speak Uzbek that any knowledge of the language you have is a sign of honour and significant respect to Uzbek people. Spend most of your time listening and try to imitate what you hear as best possible. You will learn Uzbek well if you keep practicing.

Travel to Uzbekistan.,
Read as much as you can about the Uzbeks.",How to Learn Uzbek4," If you have the ability to travel through Central Asia, the best place you can learn and apply Uzbek is in Uzbekistan itself. Uzbekistan is country rich in culture, art, history, and hospitality. Again, do your homework and find what works for you.

, Language is more than just words and syntax, it is woven intricately with history and culture. While or before you learn Uzbek, immerse yourself in as much information as you can about the Uzbek peoples and traditions. The more informed you are, the better you will understand the subtleties of Uzbek.

Look for circles and ovals.,

Look for simple characters.,

If you do not see the characteristic shapes of Korean Hangul or Japanese hiragana or katakana, then you are probably looking at Chinese.","How to Tell Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Writing Apart"," Korean uses a phonetic alphabet called Hangul, which is distinguishable by the large number of circles, ovals, and straight lines (example: 안녕하세요)If the block of text you are reading has these characteristic round shapes, chances are it is Korean. If not, go to step 2.
, Japanese writing has 3 main components: hiragana, katakana, and kanji. Hiragana and katakana are syllabic systems, while kanji are derived from Chinese characters. Many hiragana characters are curvy, but do not have the neat round shapes of Korean (e.g さっか). Katakana, on the other hand, uses mostly straight or slightly curved lines in relatively simple combinations (e.g. チェンジ ). Chinese and Korean do not use either of these systems. Note that Japanese writing uses a mixture of hiragana, katakana, and kanji in the same text, so if you see either hiragana or katakana or both, you are looking at Japanese. The links below show you full lists of hiragana and katakana characters.

Hiragana
some common Hiragana: あ,お,ん,の,か
Katakana
some common Katakana: ア,リ,エ,ガ,ト

, Chinese writing has complicated characters called hanzi in Chinese, kanji in Japanese, and hanja in Korean. Although these characters are also found in Japanese, if there are hiragana or katakana, it is Japanese. So if you are looking at a small block of text that has only complex hanzi characters, you cannot rule out that it is Japanese. However, if you are looking at a large block of text and see no hiragana or katakana, then you can be pretty sure that it is Chinese."

Don’t get discouraged.",How to Teach Yourself a New Language," There are many different kinds of software for learning new languages on your own. Assimil is quite popular in Europe, though it is less well-known in America. This method uses audio dialogues and comes with a book as well as CDs. Teach Yourself is another popular method. It uses direct translation as well as audio exercises, level by level.If you are an auditory learner, listening to someone else speak the language may be the best way for you to learn it.;
, Purchase a grammar guide as well as a dictionary in the language you wish to speak. You’ll also need a dual-language book to see translations from your native language to the target language. Choose a few books, other than textbooks, such as novels or nonfiction in the language you wish to learn as well.


If you are a visual learner, reading about the language may be the best way for you to learn it.

, Immersing yourself means put yourself in an environment where only that language is spoken. This doesn’t necessarily have to be a foreign country, it can also be a classroom or even your own home if you listen to music and television in the target language. You could also visit a section of your city where the particular language is spoken (e.g., if you live in a big city and are trying to learn Mandarin, hang out in Chinatown for a few hours).


If you are a kinesthetic learner, immersion may be the best way for you to learn the language.

, There are tons of applications out there that will help you to learn a new language. Read reviews and choose one or two that you think will be both fun and helpful. This way you can learn on the subway or train, during breaks at work or school, and just about anywhere else.


Duolingo and Busuu are great language course apps. LiveMocha is a fun chat and social language app. Memrise uses mnemonic devices to help you learn a new language. Mindsnacks is an education language-learning game., Chances are good that the grammar rules of your target language will be quite different from that of your native language. Spending some time learning how sentences are structured, such as the word order, parts of speech, and subject-verb agreement, will help you in the long run.

, Words that you would use daily should be the first ones you learn. Try starting with personal pronouns (I, you, she, he, they, etc.) and common nouns (boy, girl, chair, table, city, teacher, restroom, school, airport, restaurant, etc.) before moving on to adjectives (green, thin, fast, beautiful, cold, etc.) or verbs (go, do, take, leave, offer, meet, etc.), which will need to be conjugated., You’ll likely want to figure out how to ask a few simple questions, such as “Where is the restroom/train station/hotel/school?” and “How much does this (coffee, newspaper, train ticket) cost?” You’ll also probably want to learn to say “My name is…” “What is your name?” “How are you doing?” and “I’m doing well/poorly.” Think of a few dozen phrases you want to know and start with those., One word may make you think of another. Try to build mental images or draw pictures based on connections. It doesn’t matter how obscure or silly they may seem if it will help you remember., Repetition is one of the best ways to learn vocabulary. Make flash cards with your vocab words and go through them daily. You can even post the cards around your room or home so that you see them often. You can also use an automated flashcard generator (e.g., lingua.ly)., Listening to music can be a fun way to learn a new language. Songs you enjoy may be available in another language; this will make it easier for you to recognize words if you know the lyrics by heart. You can also choose songs you’ve never heard and print out the lyrics, then translate them.

, Identify a topic that you regularly read about (e.g., technology news) and read about it in the other language. Find online newspaper sections or blogs that cover that topic in the language you're learning. Try reading about the topic only in the target language.

, BBC World Service is a great place to start for foreign language broadcasts. You can also tune into many TV stations and watch news stories and shows produced in another language. This can be a lot more fun than simply reading grammar texts., You could select the option for a voiceover in another language, while also selecting subtitles in your native language. Watch the movie or show to read the words in your language while hearing them in another. Conversely, listen in your native language while reading foreign subtitles. After a while, try to watch the movie or show in the foreign language with no subtitles.

, The huge advantage over internet radio is that they're downloadable. You can listen to the same show repeatedly until you feel you understand it. Don't be afraid to specialize, especially once you've got the basic vocabulary and grammar down — if you're into technology, for example, listening to tech-podcasts is a good place to start as many technology-related words and names are adapted from English., Many online and app games allow for language changes to the most commonly used languages. If this is the case for your game, switch to the language you're learning. Since you're already familiar with the game, you’ll be playing some of it intuitively. You will also see the new words regularly and in some cases, be forced to work out what is being said in order to advance through the game.

, This can help you correct mistakes you are making as well as learn new tips and tricks for mastering the language.


Once you have become semi-fluent, join a foreign-language social network, such as VoxSwap, Lang 8, or My Happy Planet.
You could also change the language of your internet browser, which, for many sites, will cause it to change the language automatically.

, Using the same materials or method every day can get old. Watch videos, read scripts, and play interactive games. Incorporate the new language into daily use in your reading, writing, and entertainment to reinforce what you're learning and build fluency.

, You could decide to learn ten new words a day, or five new phrases. You could also choose to read a few pages in your target language each day, watch a show in the language, or listen to a few songs. Perhaps you want to set a goal based on speaking a certain amount in the target language each day. Be realistic, and set goals based on your personal learning style.

, Learning a new language can be difficult. Don’t berate yourself if you aren’t fluent after a few months. Focus on what you have learned, and keep trying. Remind yourself why you wanted to learn a new language in the first place to help you stay motivated.

Determine whether there is any possibility of verbal communication.,
Speak slowly.,
Don't shout.,
Keep your words simple.,
Beware of challenging phrases.,
Be consistent.,
Listen actively.,
Put it in writing.,
Be patient and polite.,
Get a foreign language dictionary or phrasebook.",How to Talk With Someone Who Doesn't Speak Your Language1," Your first step should be to determine whether you and the person you are talking to know any of the same words. Even a few basic words can help, whether you can understand a few terms in their language or vice versa.


If you recognize their language and you know a few words, that's great. If not, ask if the other person understands any English.
English is the language of travel and business. It is likely that even in parts of the world education is not widespread, many people will still know a few words or phrases in English.If that fails, try any other languages you know, even if you only understand a little bit. See if the other person shows any signs of understanding. Just a few words can make communication much easier, even if they're not in either of your native tongues.;
, If it seems there is a chance the other person will understand even few words, try speaking to them in English (or any other language both you and he or she understand a little) very slowly. Slowing down will make it easier for him or her to understand.That said, try to keep a normal rhythm. When you slow down your speech, you may have a tendency to get into an odd, stilted rhythm and/or put emphasis on the wrong words. This can make you harder to understand.
If you speak English with a strong regional accent (e.g. you live in the deep south or have cockney accent), speaking slowly is doubly important., Many people have a tendency to raise their voices when talking to someone who doesn't speak their language, or doesn't speak it well. This isn't actually helpful. Avoid doing this.Shouting will only make you look foolish and may offend the person you are trying to communicate with.

, Use the simplest words you can to express yourself. Definitely stay away from any jargon, technical language, or similarly complex words.


Likewise, stay away from the use of idioms or figures of speech.These are expressions that, by definition, are culturally specific, and are not likely to be understood by non-English speakers.
For example, don't say something is ""as easy as pie"" or that you you need to ""hit the sack."" These common American expressions obviously don't have meanings that align with the literal meaning of the words. They are likely to seem bizarre and perplexing to non-native English speakers., Similarly, use the simplest sentence structures you can. Use as few words as possible to get your meaning across.Avoid confusing structures, such as questions asked in the negative. Instead of saying: ""You don't have any idea what I mean, do you?"" ask ""Do you understand what I mean?"", Once you've chosen a word for something, don't switch to another term for same thing. This can add confusion and create misunderstandings.


For example, if you are trying to ask where you can buy some pain medication, stick with that term, don't vary your words and say ""aspirin"" or ""painkillers"" or some other synonym a moment later, at least not if the person you are talking to seemed to understand the first term., Ask questions to make sure the other person is understanding you, and express your understanding when he or she successfully communicates something to you.


Similarly, be on lookout for signals that she or he does not understand you, such a scrunched brow or the universal ""huh?"", Many people who are just learning English understand things better in written form than via spoken language.If speaking isn't working, it might be worth writing down a few words.


This also eliminates problems that might come about because of pronunciation issues, especially if you have a strong accent.
Carrying a small notepad and pen for this purpose when you travel is a good idea., Interactions with someone who doesn't speak your language can be frustrating, both for you and the other person. Be as patient as you can, and try to keep your frustration to yourself.


Do not laugh at the person, roll your eyes, or anything else that you wouldn't do in polite conversation with someone who does speak your language., If you are traveling to a country where English isn't common, it's good idea to pick up a dictionary and/or phrasebook that will help you understand and speak a few words and phrases in the dominant language.


While a dictionary will give you a greater variety of words to choose from, a phrase book will contain useful sentences with the verbs already conjugated correctly. This can make you easier for others to understand.
Small dictionary/phrasebook combinations are available for travelers via your local bookstore or online.
Some travel guidebooks including a section of common phrases as well."
"
Use gestures.,
Act it out.,
Draw a picture.,
Use an app.",How to Talk With Someone Who Doesn't Speak Your Language2," Whether the person you are trying to communicate with can understand a single word you are saying or not, simple gestures can often be helpful in reinforcing meanings or conveying basic ideas. Use gestures such as pointing at objects that are almost universally understood.Using your hands to indicate size, location, and so on can be very helpful.
Be careful, not all gestures are universal. Some common gestures in America have very different meanings in other places. For example, the common sign for ""ok"" or ""perfect"" made by touching the tips of your thumb and forefinger is an offensive gesture in Greece and Turkey.So keep it simple!

, While it might seem silly, sometimes you can communicate by acting out what you are trying to communicate, like in a game of charades. People might laugh at you, but if you can get your point across, it's probably worth it.For example, if you are trying to find a good place to eat, you might act out the motion taking some bites with a fork, then rub your belly and and make a contented sound, such as ""Mmmmm.""

, If you're carrying a notepad and pen or pencil, you may be able to communicate effectively by drawing things. Looking for the bus station? Try doing a quick sketch of a bus.You can pass the pad off to the other person and let them respond using a picture too, if that helps.

, If you have a smart phone and access to the internet, there are numerous translation apps you can use to make conversation easier. Many of these allow you to simply talk into the phone and will translate what you've said to the language of your choice.Some of these apps are free. It's a good idea to download one before going on a trip somewhere where English isn't spoken.

Present perfect tense or passato prossimo refers to that action which has already taken place in the past but has still has its effect in the present.,
Now, in Italian the passato prossimo is formed with the present indicative of essere or avere + the past participle of the main verb.,
Many verbs have a regular form of the past participle.,
Some of the common irregular past participle are :


aprire (to open) - aperto
bere (to drink) - bevuto
chiedere (to ask) - chiesto
chiudere (to close) - chiuso
dire (to say/tell) - detto
fare (to do/make) - fatto
prendere (to take) - preso
scrivere (to write) - scritto
tradurre (to translate) - tradotto
vivere (to live) - vissuto
vedere (to see) - visto (veduto)

,
Also, there are certain rules that must be kept in mind.,
But there is an exception.",How to Use Present Perfect Tense (Passato Prossimo) in Italian," For example: I have eaten.;
,


For example: Io ho mangiato (I have eaten)

,


ARE - cantare (to sing) - cantato
ERE - credere (to believe) - creduto
IRE - dormire (to sleep) - dormito

,, These can be called 'Past participle agreement'.


I.e., when 'essere' (to be) is used the past participle agrees with the subject, both in number (singular or plural) and gender (masculine or feminine).
For example: Gloria è andata in discoteca sabato sera. (Gloria went to the disco Saturday evening)
In the above example since Gloria is female, the past participle 'andare' becomes 'andata'. If it had been a male then it would have been 'andato'.
Another example: Siamo tornati dalle vacanze da poco e ora non abbiamo voglia di lavorare. (We returned from vacation recently and now we don't want to work)
In the above example since the past participle 'tornare' is in the plural form.
When 'avere' is used there is usually no need for past participle agreement.
For example: Cinzia ha ordinato una birra gelata. (Cinzia has ordered a really cold beer)
When past participle follows a direct object pronoun the agreement is optional.
For example: Vi hanno sentito/ti cantare giovedi sera a teatro. (They heard you sing at the theatre on Thursday evening)

, When the pronouns lo, la, l', li, and le, are used with 'avere', then the agreement is necessary.

""Atra esterni ono thelduin."" This line is usually spoken by the person of lower status (e.g. a student greeting a teacher), or by the person of higher status as an honour.
""Atra du evarínya ono varda."" This is the response of the second person.
""Un atra mor'ranr lifa unin hjarta onr."" This is spoken by the first person to finish the greeting.
The lines mean ""May good fortune rule over you, may the stars watch over you, and may peace live in your heart."";
, The grammar is similar to English, with a few twists:


Adjectives come after nouns. For example, ""the white dragon"" would be written as ""du skulblaka hvitr"", with the adjective (hvitr) coming after the noun (skulblaka). the nouns can be in any order. This applies to adjectives describing who the noun belongs to, so ""my hand"" would be written as ""lam iet""
There are no ""-ing"" verbs. There are past simple (walked, swam), present simple (I walk, I swim) and future simple (I will walk, I will swim).
Two nouns can be joined to form one. If this happens, the descriptive noun comes first. For example, ""skulblaka"" (dragon) is a combination of ""skul"" (scale) and ""blaka"" (flapper).

, Future tense form just uses the word ""weohnata"" (will) in front of the present tense.


-í : past tense of verbs not ending in -ir. Note that the i has an accent.
-o : past tense of verbs ending in -ir.
-ar : plural for nouns ending with a consonant. For nouns that end in -consonant-r, add an a between the consonant and the r to form the -ar ending.
-ya : plural for nouns ending in a vowel or -vowel-r. For -vowel-r, replace the vowel and the r with -ya. For vowel, replace the vowel with -ya, unless -ya interferes with pronunciation, in which case just add the -ya after the vowel. Vowels ""a"" and ""i"" are usually changed to e. For example, ""celöbra"" becomes ""celöbreya""

, There are a few other suffixes and prefixes that crop up sometimes. It's worth knowing how to use them:


-r : gives nouns a masculine connotation.
-s : makes nouns possessive.
-sja : adds ""-looking"" to the end of adjectives. For example, ""ramr"" (strong) becomes ""ramrsja"" (strong-looking).
äf- : gives words a malignant connotation.
eld- : changes verbs into words of action. For example, ""jierda"" (break) becomes ""eld jierda"" (breaker).

, These are said after a person's name, and are usually attatched with a hyphen. Each has a different meaning.


elda : gender neutral, indicates great praise.
finiarel : young man of great promise.
svit-kona : woman of great wisdom. Not attatched with a hyphen.
vodhr : male honorific, indicates middling praise.
vor : male honorific for a close friend.

, The language is used for magic, so the more words you know, the more magic you could perform (in general, some solutions could be improvised from relatively few words).


Brisingr - fire
Deloi - earth (not to be confused with delois, a type of plant)
Vindr - air, wind
Adurna - water
Jierda - break
Thrysta - thrust, compress
Fricai - friend
Neiat - not
Weohnata - will
Haina - harm
Ono - you
Iet - my (capital i at the start, not lowercase L)
Nosu - us
Eka - I
Vae - we
Stenr - stone
Reisa - raise
Malthinae - bind, hold in place
Abr - of
Aí - a
Un - and
Unin - in
Thäet - it
Shur'tugal - dragon rider

,


Eka ai shur'tugal un fricai - I am a dragon rider and a friend.
Kvetha fricai/fricaya - Greetings, friend/friends (less formal greeting).
Vel eïnradhin iet ai Shur'tugal - Upon my word as a rider.

, besides being used for magic, the language has a few traits that make it very important:


Anything said in the language is unquestionably true. However, this only applies to the exact translation of what is being said: it is possible to say something that is technically true, but mean something completely different.
Names have power over the person, creature or item being named. Being a language of truth, anything's name in the language is it's true name: it describes it absolutely, and can be used to gain power over the thing that it belongs to. This is why hardly anybody knows the true name of the language itself: it could be used to control the entire language, and by extension, anybody using it.
Oaths made in the language cannot be broken. You can't lie in the language, so any oath or contract that you make in it has to be obeyed. However, you can exploit any loopholes that you may find to get you out of obeying.

, Just type in ""The Ancient Language"" on Google, and it comes up with lots of word lists and dictionaries that people have made. The main ones are on Paolini.net and the Inheritance wiki.

",How to Study for a French Exam," Teachers do not always give you the questions or clues to what is on the test. Pay attention in class and review your notes. Most likely, a test will be over recently covered information. The teacher will most likely give you some info but if not then just read your current text chapters, notes, and correct homework. Look at any mistakes you made and correct them now.;
, Read it over in French OUT LOUD. This helps your brain on focusing and managing this information into your head. Language is meant to be spoken out loud!

, If you can translate the words to English, you are on the right track. If not, then try anyway, it's normal for beginning French students to struggle with this, but an advanced student should be able to do this with little difficulty. It' also okay if you don't understand every little word. As long as you understand the ""meat"" of the question, you should know what it's asking and how to appropriately answer the question.

, Make sure you UNDERSTAND it. You should do this in both languages. Read over your answers 2-3 more times in both languages.

While you are there, you can buy some books or other materials, and you will find yourself surrounded by French speakers, particularly outside of Montreal. Keep in mind though that you the farther you go from the Montreal you travel, you will find more people using French which is not as easily recognizable as international French. For example, in Québec's Gaspesie region, many heritages have influenced the development of language over the centuries, as many of the original settlers came from the Guernsey and the Jersey Islands, and not from France. The French dialects spoken in New Brunswick and Louisiana fall under the umbrella ""Acadian French"", and have local colour and unique differences of their own.

Feel sorry using ""plaindre."",
Describe a sorry condition using ""pitoyable"" or ""triste.""",How to Say Sorry in French," This is the most basic way of saying ""I'm sorry"" to someone in French, and you should use it in most formal situations.The phrase ""Je suis"" means ""I am,"" and ""désolé"" means ""sorry"" in the form of an adjective. Write ""désolé"" if you're male and ""désolée"" if you're female.
Regardless of gender, pronounce the entire phrase:

zhuh swee day-zoh-lay


You should use this phrase when apologizing for something serious, apologizing to strangers, apologizing to elders, or apologizing in a professional or other formal situation.;
, If you need to apologize for something very serious, you should say, ""Je suis vraiment désolé"" (male) or ""Je suis vraiment désolée"" (female).


The term ""vraiment"" means ""truly"" or ""really."" When inserted into the usual apology, you're essentially saying, ""I am truly sorry.""
Pronounce the entire phrase:

zhuh swee vray-mohn day-zoh-lay



, When you're in an informal situation, you can drop the ""Je suis"" portion of the phrase and simply state, ""Désolé.""


Essentially, you're dropping the words ""I am"" and simply saying ""sorry"" instead of ""I am sorry."" As with the formal version of the phrase, you should write ""désolé"" if you're male and ""désolé"" if you're female.
Regardless of gender, pronounce the apology:day-zoh-lay


Use this phrase when issuing a quick apology to friends or other close peers. Ideally, you should only use it when the offense was relatively minor, and should opt for the formal ""e suis désolé"" after major offenses.

, In English, ""c’est ma faute"" means ""it's my fault."" You can use this phrase with or without a formal apology.


Breaking it down further, ""c’est"" means ""it is,"" ""ma"" means ""my,"" and ""faute"" means ""fault."" Since ""faute"" is a feminine word, you should use the feminine version of ""my,"" which is ""ma"" (rather than using the masculine ""mon"").
You can say “c’est ma faute” on its own, but you would typically mention this phrase after issuing an apology. In other words, you'd likely say something along the lines of, “ Je suis désolé. C’est ma faute.”
To pronounce this phrase, say:

seh mah foouht



, Translated into English, ""excusez-moi"" simply means ""excuse me.""


The verb ""excuser"" means ""to forgive"" or ""to excuse,"" and the pronoun ""moi"" means ""me."" In essence, you are telling the person you're speaking to, ""you forgive me"" or ""you excuse me.""
You would typically use this phrase if you're trying to get someone's attention, but you can also use it to apologize to known and unknown people for minor offenses. You should not use this phrase to apologize for a major offense, however.
To pronounce this phrase, say:ex-koo-zay mwah



, Saying ""pardon"" is an abbreviated way of saying ""pardon me,"" and you can use it in an apologetic manner. It's quite informal, though, so you should be careful about when you opt for this translation.


""Pardon"" comes from the verb ""pardonner,"" which means ""to forgive"" or ""to pardon.""
You'll most often hear ""pardon"" when someone apologizes for bumping into another person he or she knows, or when someone is trying to push his or her way through a crowd.
Pronounce this phrase as:

pahr-dohn



, When translated into English, this phrase means, ""I beg your pardon.""The verb ""demande"" means ""to request"" or ""to demand."" In this construction, ""pardon"" is the French noun for ""forgiveness."" Additionally, ""je"" is a pronoun meaning ""I"" and ""vous"" is a pronoun meaning ""you"" When you string these words together in this manner, the resulting phrase means, ""I request/demand your forgiveness.""
When speaking this phrase aloud, pronounce it:

zhuh voo deh-mahn pahr-dohn



, You can exclaim ""Je m'excuse!"" as another way of saying ""I'm sorry!""


The term ""je"" is a pronoun meaning ""I,"" and ""m'excuse"" is the first person singular translation of the verb ""s'excuser,"" which means, ""to apologize."" A more literal translation of this phrase would be, ""I apologize.""
Try pronouncing this phrase:

zhuh mex-kooz



, Translated into English, this phrase can mean ""please excuse me"" or ""please forgive me.""The term ""veuillez"" is actually the second person imperative form of the verb ""voiloir,"" which means ""to wish."" While there is no clean translation into English, you would use ""veuillez"" to make polite or sincere requests, so in this sense, you could also translate it as ""please"" in English.
In this sentence, ""m'excuser"" is a conjugation of the verb, ""excuser,"" meaning, ""to excuse"" or ""to forgive."" When written as ""m'excuser,"" you are saying, ""forgive me.""
Pronounce this entire phrase as:

veh-yeer mex-koo-zeh



, The verb ""regretter"" means ""to regret,"" and you can use it when sharing your regrets concerning unfortunate circumstances.If you want to say ""I regret,"" you'll need to say ""Je regrette."" Pronouce this phrase as:

zhuh ruh-greht


If you want to say that someone else regrets something, however, you'll need to change the conjugation of ""regretter"" accordingly.

To say ""we regret,"" state ""nous regrettons"" (noo ruh-greh-toon)
To say ""he regrets, state ""il regrette"" (ee ruh-greht).
To say ""she regrets,"" state ""elle regrette"" (ehl ruh-greht).



, If you feel sorry for someone, you could describe that emotion using the verb ""plaindre,"" which means ""to feel sorry for"" among other translations.


The root verb is ""plaindre,"" so you'll need to conjugate the word accordingly based on who feels sorry or who feels pity. For example:

If you want to say ""I pity,"" you would have to state, ""Je plains"" (zheh plahn)
On the other hand, if you want to say ""we pity,"" you'll need to state, ""nous plaignons"" (noo pleh-nohn)



, Both terms are adjectives used to describe things that are in a ""sorry"" or poor state of being.


Use ""pitoyable"" to describe conditions and excuses. A literal translation would be ""pitable"" or ""pitiful,"" and it's pronounced: pi-toi-ahb

Use ""triste"" to describe a sorry story, state, or sight. This adjective can also mean ""sad,"" and you should pronounce it as: tree-stuh

Say ""Ta gueule"" to very rudely tell someone to shut up.",How to Say Shut up in French1," This phrase is pronounced ""teh-twah."" Use a short e sound (as in ""bed"") for ""tais"" and a short o sound (as in ""rock"") for ""toi."" The approximate meaning is ""shush"" or ""hush.""


This phrase, as well as the other ones in this section, can be considered rude depending on how they're used. ""Tais-toi"" isn't too offensive, but it's not very polite. It can be outright insulting if you use it angrily or you use it for an authority figure like a parent, teacher, or boss.;
, This phrase is pronounced ""tehzay-voo."" Use a short e sound (as in ""bed"") for ""tais"", an a-like sound for ""sez"", and a long u sound (as in ""stool"") for ""vous."" The approximate meaning is ""be quiet.""


This is another moderately rude way to say ""shut up"" in French. Again, in some contexts it may be used in a friendly way. However, if you say it with a hostile feeling or you use it for someone you should be respectful towards, it will come across as rude.
Because this phrase uses the ""vous"" pronoun, you can use it when you're talking to groups of people as well as single individuals.

, This phrase is pronounced ""fairm tah boosh."" Use a long a sound (as in ""ray"") for ""ferme."" Don't pronounce the final e in ""ferme."" Use a short o sound (as in ""rock"") for ""ta"" and use a long u sound (as in ""stool"") for ""bouche."" The meaning of this phrase is ""shut your mouth.""


This phrase is almost always considered rude. The only situations when it might be laughed off is when you are using it jokingly with friends or family.

, If you're not worried about being offensive, you might try using this crude (but effective) phrase to get someone to shut up. This phrased is pronounced ""tah gool."" Use a short o sound (as in ""rock"") for ""ta"" and a long u sound (as in ""stool""). Don't pronounce the final e in ""gueule.""



Be careful with this phrase. This is basically the most insulting way you can tell someone to shut up in French. You may hear good friends use it with each other, but it is not something you will want to use in ""polite"" company."
"
Use ""Taisez-vous, s'il vous plaît"" to ask someone to please be quiet.,
Use ""Silence, s'il vous plaît"" to call for quiet.,
Use ""s'il vous plaît SOYEZ tranquille"" to ask someone to quiet down.,
Use ""calmez vous, s'il vous plaît"" for someone who is too agitated.",How to Say Shut up in French2," This phrase is pronounced ""tayzay-voo, seel voo play."" Use a long a sound (as in ""ray"") for ""taise"" and ""plaît,"" a long u sound (as in ""stool"") for ""vous,"" and a long e sound (as in ""bee"") for ""s'il."" The approximate meaning is ""be quiet, please.""


Here, notice that we're using the semi-formal ""vous"" pronoun again. This word is used when you're addressing someone formally (speaking to someone important or older than you). It's also used for speaking to groups of people.If you wanted to say this to someone you're close to, like a friend or family member, you might say ""tais-toi, s'il te plaît,"" (""tay-twah, seel-tuh-play"") which is derived from the informal tu pronoun.

, ""Silence"" is spelled the same way as the English word and means the same thing, but its pronunciation is different. This phrase is pronounced ""Seelahnce, seel voo play."" Use a long e sound (as in ""bee"") and a short o sound (as in ""rock"") for ""silence."" The n in ""silence"" should be very delicate — just barely articulate it. ""S'il vous plaît"" is pronounced the same way as above.


This phrase is useful for the sorts of situations that you'd use ""silence"" for in English. For instance, if you're a teacher trying to get the attention of a group of students so that you can begin a demonstration, you might try using this phrase.

, Another way to ask someone to be quiet semi-politely is to use this phrase. This is pronounced ""see voo play, swa-yah trhahnkeeluh."" ""S'il vous plaît"" is pronounced the same way as above. Use short e sounds (as in ""bed"") for both syllables of être. Use a short o sound (as in ""rock"") and a long e sound (as in ""bee"") for ""tranquille."" The approximate meaning is ""please make yourself quiet.""


The French r sound you'll use in this phrase is a little tricky for English-speakers to master. You want to make a very light, ""airy"" r sound by raising the back of your tongue to the top of your mouth without stopping the flow of air completely. This can take a little practice. See this guide for more information., This phrase is pronounced ""calmay-voo, seel voo play."" Use a short a sound (as in ""apple"") for the first syllable of ""calmez,"" then a long a sound (as in ""ray"") for the second. ""Vous"" and ""s'il vous plaît"" are pronounced the same way as above. The approximate meaning is ""calm down, please.""


This phrase is useful when you're trying to get someone to be less loud but you want to avoid directly asking them to be quiet. For instance, if you're at a restaurant and you're worried that you're about to get kicked out because your friend is causing a scene, you might try this.

Learn the Greek alphabet and the pronunciation of each letter.,
Emphasis: a mark is written over every vowel that is emphasized.,
Iota subscript: a small ι may be written under the letter α, η, ω when one of these letters ends a word.",How to Study Greek1," In Greek language, there can be no wrong pronunciation if you know how to pronounce the individual letters correctly: each Greek letter has one and only one pronunciation, except for some limited combinations of letters who are paired (see below) and give a different pronunciation. So in greek, putting random letters together can very well produce a pronounceable word, albeit it being a nonsensical word (just like above).


Greek diphthongs (two letters that are pronounced as a single sound). There is a symbol for the separation of these letters to sound like individuals. The symbol is ¨ (διαλυτικά) and the second letter goes between the dots. Diphthongs and examles of ¨ are as follows:

αι as e in ""left"". On the other hand, αϊ is pronounced ""α-ee"" (α ι)
ει as i in ""quit"". On the other hand, εϊ is pronounced ""e-ee"" (ε ι)
οι also as i in ""quit"". οϊ is pronounced o-ee (ο ι)
αυ as af in ""after"" or ""av"" in ""aviator"", depending on the word. αϊ is pronounced α-ee (α υ)
ευ as ef in ""left"" or ""ev"" in ""evolution"" depending on the word. εϋ is pronounced e-ee (ε υ)
ου as oo in ""loose"". οϋ is pronounced o-ee (ο υ)

;
, The mark ' (called tonos - τόνος) written over a vowel and makes it stand out in the word, for example if ""evolution"" was a Greek word, a ' would be written over u (evolUtion). In ""American"", over e (amErican). In ""University"" over e (univErsity) etc. So the word ""αεροπλάνο"" is pronounced ""aeroplAno"". You emphasize the a. If a word has only 1 vowel, there is no need for the ' mark.

, This is a relic of an ancient diphthong and is not pronounced, but must be written.

Learn the declensions.,
Learn the prepositions.,
Learn the verb conjugations.,
Learn the conjugation of irregular verbs.,
Learn new vocabularies and review them regularly, preferably daily.,
Progress to speaking Greek as you find help in the common idiom and vernacular.",How to Study Greek2," There are three declensions in Greek: first, second, and third. Each noun must be declined with changes in its ending to denote whether its number is singular or plural, and whether its case is in the nominative (e.g., man in ""a man sees a dog""), vocative (e.g., man in ""O man, see the dog!), accusative (e.g., dog in ""a man sees a dog""), genitive (e.g., of man in ""the son of man sees a dog""), dative (e.g. for the man in ""the son buys a dog for the man""). Adjectives are declined similar to nouns, and must agree with nouns in number, case, and gender.


For example, the word λογος (meaning ""word"" in English) is declined as follows:

Nominative singular: λογος
Vocative singular: λογε
Accusative singular: λογον
Genitive singular: λογου
Dative singular: λογῳ
Nominative plural: λογοι
Vocative plural: λογοι
Accusative plural: λογους
Genitive plural: λογῳν
Dative plural: λογοις



, A preposition requires the noun following it (called the object of the preposition in English) to take a certain case (there is not a single objective case). For example, the preposition απο (""from"") must be followed by a noun in the genitive case. The preposition εν (""in"" or ""on"") must be followed by a noun in the dative case.

, A table of verbs is typically found at the end of most Greek textbooks: make sure to study it carefully. The ""Present"" and ""Imperfect"" tenses denote continuous or repeated action. The ""Perfect"" tense denotes completed action. The ""Aorist"" tense denotes a simple, indefinite action, used when there is no need to indicate continuity, completion, or incompletion of the action denoted by the verb. A verb may be in the active, middle, or passive voice, and is conjugated accordingly. Furthermore, a verb is conjugated according to its context, i.e. indicative, imperative, subjunctive, optative.


For example, the Present Indicative Active of the verb λεγω (""I say"") is as follows:

1st singular: λεγω ""I say, or I am saying""
2nd singular: λεγεις ""Thou sayest, or thou art saying""
3rd singular: λεγει ""He, she, or it says, or is saying""
1st plural: λεγομε ""We say, or we are saying""
2nd plural: λεγετε ""Ye say, or ye are saying""
3rd plural: λέγουν(ε) ""They say, or they are saying""



, These must be memorised with practice.

, Try to make it a habit to revise a list of new vocabulary regularly, reviewing old ones prior to learning new ones. It is better to learn a little everyday, than trying to learn a lot once a week.

, You may find help from recorded lessons, a native speaker, or a fluent Greek language tutor.

Decide which verb you wish to use.,
Use the ""tu"" form.,
Learn how to say the various basic phrases:


Je t'aime -- I love you (zhuh tem)
Je t'adore -- I adore you (zhuh tah door)
Je te désire or j'ai envie de toi -- I want you (zhuh tuh duhzai-uh or zhay ohn-vee duh twah)

,
Practice it before saying.",How to Say I Love You in French1," You can use ""aimer"" (to love), ""adorer"" (to adore), or ""désirer"" (to desire).


""Aimer"" is the strongest in emotion of the three verbs. Don't use it lightly!;
, It's not likely you'd be telling someone formally or someone unknown that you love them!


""Tu"" and ""vous"" are the two forms used when addressing another person. ""Tu"" is used for people you know well or children.
In ""je t'aime,"" ""tu"" is contracted to ""t'"" because of the succeeding vowel. Literally, it translates to ""I you love.""
If you are seeking to risk a restraining order, ""je vous aime"" (zhuh voo zem) is used formally.

,, If you're nervous, practice will be invaluable. Telling someone that you love them can be exciting or terrifying and saying it in French makes it seem even more romantic. Bonne chance! (Good luck!)


Get the pronunciation down. French is full of sounds that are represented a bit differently in English.

""j"" in ""je"" is pronounced -- like the g in mirage
""e"" (in ""je"") is pronounced like the oo in good
""t'aime"" is pronounced to rhyme with them.

To a woman -- ma chérie (ma shay-ree)
To a man -- mon chéri (mo(n) shay-ree; the (n) is nasal)


""Mon amour"" -- my love (moh(n) ah-mohr)
""Ma belle"" -- my love (mah bell)
""Mon chou"" -- my cabbage, my pastry (moh(n) shoo) (informal)

, You do not have to stick to the literal ""I love you."" There are dozens of ways to express how you feel, though a bit more complicated.


""Je t'aimerai pour toujours"" -- I will love you forever (zhuh tem-air-ay poor too-zhoor)
""T'es l'amour de ma vie"""" -- You're the love of my life (teh lah-moor duh ma vee)

, how to order drinks. I would like a beer, please = Tha eethel-a mee-a bir-a, para-kal-oh. For wine, it is slightly different. All Greek words divide into masculine, feminine and neutral. Wine (krasi - κρασί), is a neutral word, and so we say 'ena (ένα)' instead of 'mee-a (μία)'. So 'I would like a wine please', will be 'Tha eethel-a ena krasi para-kal-oh (Θα ήθελα ένα κρασί παρακαλώ)'. Coca-Cola is the same as the sentence shown for beer, we just replace 'bira - μπύρα' with 'Coca-Cola'.

, 'What is your name?' Greek has a few sentences that all mean the same, but we'll just use one. 'Pos se lene?' is the translation. Whoever you are asking may reply, 'Me lene (their name)', or 'Leg-oh-mai (their name)'. 'Where are you from?' will translate as, 'Apo poo ee-sai?' The person may reply 'Ee-mai apo (their country)'. For this you need to know the countries. England= angl-ee-a, America= amer-ikee, Spain= Eespan-ee-a, France= Gallia, Italy= Italia, Germany= Yermania. So if you said, 'I am from England', it will translate as 'Ee-mai apo teen angl-ee-a'. We add 'teen' because it is quite a compicated rule in Greek language. All the countries above are feminine, so you only need to use 'teen' for the countries listed. E.g. 'Ee-mai apo teen amer-ikee'. There are some exceptions to the ""feminine rule"". Canada is a masculine so if you're Canadian you will say 'Ee-mai apo ton Kanatha' (th in this case is pronounced like in 'the'). The UK is a neutral 'Ee-mai apo toh Eenomeno Vaseeleeo'. United States are plural. 'Ee-mai apo tees Eenomenes Po-lee-tee-es.

Understand how the Greeks greet each other.,
Say ""Yassou"".,
Use ""Herete"".,
Use temporal greetings.",How to Say Hello in Greek1," Greek people tend to be open and casual in their greetings. As such, there are few strict differences between formal and informal greetings. Be open and casual with your body language. Try to make eye contact and smile at strangers and friends alike.


Do not bow or attempt to kiss the cheek. The former is too formal, and the latter may be considered too forward.
Do not attempt to shake hands unless a hand is offered to you. Shaking hands is not a common custom in Greece – certainly not among friends or locals.;
, Pronounce it ""YAH-soo"". This phrase is best suited for informally saying hello to one person. Smile as you say it – be friendly! Bear in mind that ""Yassou"" is only a rough English rendition of the Greek pronunciation. The word is sometimes spelled ""giasou"" or ""ya su"". You can also shorten the phrase to ""ya"" in an informal setting.Say ""Yassas"" (pronounced ""YAH-sas"")in formal situations, or when you're informally greeting two or more people at the same time. Use this formal version if you're addressing a stranger or an older person.Technically, the somewhat more informal ""yassou"" is best suited to use with people you know and people much younger than you. However, you will hear both used interchangeably, so you don't need to worry much about getting it ""right"".

, Pronounce it ""HE-reh-teh""; say the e's like you would in the word ""egg"". You can use ""herete"" in both formal and informal situations. It is typically used between the hours of 10am and 2pm., As with many cultures, Greeks use certain time-specific greetings in the morning, the afternoon, and the evening. You can use ""yassou"" or ""yassas"" during most of these times, but you may find the following phrases more appropriate.


Kalimera (καλημέρα): ""good morning"". Use this when reaching or leaving a location or event. Pronounce it ""kah-lee-MEH-rah"".Kalispera (καλησπέρα): ""good afternoon"" or ""good evening"". Use this only when coming to a place or meeting someone in the evening or at night. Pronounce it ""kah-lee-SPARE-a"".

Immerse yourself in Danish.",How to Speak Danish," Danish is a tricky language, but it does have plenty in common with other north European languages. It is one of five North Germanic languages, along with Swedish, Norwegian, Icelandic, and Faroese. Danish is comprehensible for someone fluent in Swedish or Norway, so if you can speak Danish you will be able to talk to people across Scandinavia.


An English speaker will recognise quite a few Danish words, which are similar to the English.
For example, the Danish word drømme is similar to the English word dream, æg is like egg, flad is like flat, and søster is like sister.
A big difference between English and Danish is the way words are pronounced, so it’s important to practice your speaking and listening a lot.
Grammatically, Danish has two genders, masculine and neuter which take articles en and et.;
, It’s best to start by learning a few basic greetings and phrases to give you a taste of speaking Danish, and some early pointers about pronunciation. Here are some easy everyday phrases to practice:


Hello – Hej (pronounced Hi).
Good day – Goddag (pronounced Go-day).
Goodbye – Farvel (pronounced Fah-vel).
Yes – Ja (pronounced Ya).
No – Nej (pronounced Nai).
Thank you – Tak (pronounced Tack).
Excuse me – Undskyld (pronounced Un-school).
Sorry – Beklager (pronounced Bi-clay-er)., You really need to listen and repeat Danish words to get a hang of the pronunciation, and get used to how letters and words sound. To develop your skills you’ll have to practice speaking to people and having conversations in Danish, but before you get to that level you can build confidence by listening to clips online.


Search online for clips of Danish words and phrases.
There are a number of websites that have audio clips for key phrases, such as “hej,” “farvel” and “velkommen.”, When you’re trying to work on your pronunciation in a new language, it’s a good idea to pay particular attention to the vowel sounds. There can be a lot of variation in vowel sounds across different languages, and vowel sounds are at the centre of every word. Practice the following vowel sounds for Danish:


a – pronounced “ah.”
ä, æ – pronounced like the “a” sound in the English word “ash.”
å, aa – pronounced “aw” or “oh.”
e – pronounced as “eh.”
I –pronounced as “ee,” or shortened to “ih” when placed before a double consonant.
o – pronounced “oh”

u – pronounced like the “u” sound in the English word ""put.""
y – pronounced like the German “ü” or the French “u.”, To really work on improving your Danish speaking skills you should consider signing up for a class. Joining a Danish class will give you plenty of opportunities to practice speaking alongside listening, reading and grammar practice. To get good at speaking a new language takes a lot of practice, and joining a class will give you a group of fellow Danish learners to practice with.


The teacher will often be a native Danish speaker, and will be able to answer your questions face-to-face.
The teacher will be able to correct your pronunciation and spot areas where you make regular mistakes.
Search online for language schools near you. Often local schools and colleges will run adult education courses in languages.
Danish classes may not be as easy to find as Spanish, French, German or Italian.
You can access contact information for a number of professional organisations through the website of the American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages: http://www.actfl.org/about-actfl/resources/member-organization-map


, The Danish Cultural Institute is an independent organisation that is funded by the Danish government. This Institute works to promote Danish culture abroad as well as international cultural exchange. It often hosts concerts, exhibitions and theatre and film events, as well as offering Danish classes.


There are Institutes in a number of countries, including Brazil, China and Russia.To find about events and activities related to Denmark and Danish culture in your country, you can contact the Danish Embassy.You can find the contact details for the Embassy and Consulate in your country here: http://um.dk/en/about-us/organisation/find-us-abroad/


, To study Danish in a more focused way, you might consider hiring a private tutor some for one-to-one lessons. These more intensive classes will require you to talk in Danish a lot more, and you can develop your speaking skills more quickly through this greater exposure. You lose some of the fun of a group dynamic, and one-to-one classes will be more expensive, but you do get the complete attention of the tutor.


If you think this could be a good approach for you, start by searching online for tutors advertising themselves.
Use trusted websites when looking for private tutors and always look for online reviews.
Consider the tutor’s qualifications and experience, and ask for a trial lesson before you commit to booking in a block of lessons.

, If you are struggling to find a regular time to have lessons or you want to access more materials to practice in your spare time, you can use online resources and websites that provide lots of opportunities to develop your Danish. There are some comprehensive websites which have a lot of information about grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation.There are lots of free apps for language learners, and big ones such as Babbel and Duolingo have Danish sections.
An advantage of these apps is that you can practice whenever you have your smart phone.

, To improve your speaking you will need to get lots of practice in conversational Danish. To do this you will need to find people that you can talk to in Danish. If you have joined a class, ask some of your classmates if they would like to get some extra practice by meeting up for a coffee and some Danish conversation.Try to only speak in the foreign language for ten minutes, and then gradually increase this period as you get more accomplished.

, If you want to practice your Danish, you can offer your language skills in exchange. The internet makes it easy for language learners to get in touch and communicate. You can find someone to write to or chat to online, who is a native Danish speaker and will be able to advise you on informal as well as formal aspects of the language and culture.


Talking to someone around your own age who is not a tutor will expose you to more slang expressions and casual conversational Danish.
Visit a language exchange website and look for people offering their Danish skills.You may find people who live in your city and are interested in meeting up for a language exchange.

, If you are not learning with others it can be tricky to find someone to practice speaking Danish with. Lots of language teachers are working online, and typically a skype lesson will be cheaper than a one-to-one lesson. You may be able to negotiate a lower rate for a lesson if you say that you want to focus more on speaking and conversational practice, as this is likely to require less preparation time for the tutor., One lesson a week of an hour or two, or an evening on a language website will not be enough time to really learn Danish. The key to your success is the amount of practice you do outside of class. Try to take every opportunity to expose yourself to Danish and immerse yourself in the language as much as possible.


Watching films and TV programmes in the language you are learning can help you get used to the sound of the language, so ask your teacher for some recommendations.If possible, visit Denmark on holiday to try out your Danish conversational skills.

Say hello to strangers or friends.,
Give an appropriate greeting in the morning, evening, or night.,
Say “hi” informally.",How to Greet People in Greek1," When greeting a stranger or an individual older than yourself, “hello” is rendered “yassas”: pronounced “ya-sAs.” If you’re greeting someone who you already know or saying hi to a child, “hello” is shifted to “yassoo”: pronounced “ya-sue.”“Yassoo” can also be spelled “yassou.”


Don’t worry too much about using the correct form of “hello.” Unlike other cultures (especially those which use Romance languages), the distinction is not important in Greek culture and native Greek speakers themselves use “yassas” and “yassoo” freely.
“Yassas” can also be used to mean “goodbye” in Greek, so it’s a word you’ll hear frequently.;
, For a more formal greeting, similarly to English, you’ll need to greet people depending on the time of day during which you’re introduced.These greetings can be spoken along with “yassas” (hello), or can be spoken on their own, just as in English we could greet someone by saying “hello” or by saying “good afternoon.”


“Good morning” is the preferred greeting until about 1:00 pm, and is said “Kalimera,”: pronounced “ka-lee-mer-ah.”
“Good afternoon” is said “Kalispera,”: pronounced “ka-lee-speh-ra.”
“Good evening” or “good night” is said “Kalinihxta,”: pronounced “ka-lee-nich-ta.”

, The informal word for “hi” in Greek is “ya” (pronounced “yaa”). This can be translated as “hello,” or “hi.” “Ya” can also be used as an informal goodbye, spoken between friends or from an adult to a child.To say goodbye to strangers or in a more formal setting, you’ll need to use the word “adío,” pronounced: “ah-dee-oh.”

Shake hands with everyone.,
Respond to a hug or kiss on the cheek if offered.,
Signal “OK” by giving the “thumbs up” signal.,
Distinguish between nodding “yes” and nodding “no.” While Americans use a nod of the head to indicate assent and a sideways shake of the head to indicate dissent, Greeks use a nod to signify both agreement and disagreement.",How to Greet People in Greek2," Greek culture makes use of body language during greetings, and a handshake is an important part of this. You should shake hands with everyone to whom you’re being introduced: men, women, and children alike. Give a firm, brief handshake.It’s common to shake hands again when leaving the group of people to whom you’ve been introduced.

, Although not likely when meeting individuals for the first time, Greek men and women often greet close friends with a hug and a European-style kiss on both cheeks.If you are hugged while being introduced to someone, reciprocate the hug, and reciprocate the cheek-kisses if offered. Instead of kissing, male friends may pat one another on the shoulder or back.


In general, expect Greek individuals to stand quite close to you. This is not meant to be invasive or confrontational; individuals from Greek culture maintain a smaller circle of personal space than most Americans.

, In Greek culture, the American “OK” signal made by touching the tip of the thumb to the tip of the index finger and holding out the middle, ring, and pinky fingers is considered very rude. To avoid unintentionally making this vulgar gesture (the equivalent of a middle finger in America), signal “OK” by giving a thumbs up.The thumbs up gesture carries the same meaning in Greece as it would in America or Great Britain.

, To signal “yes,” nod your head slightly downward. To signal “no,” bob your head slightly upwards.Avoid mixing these two gestures. An enthusiastic up-and-down nod of your head will carry no meaning in Greek culture, and will likely confuse Greek individuals.

"
"
Expect personal questions.,
Arrive late if you’re invited to a Greek house.,
Wear informal clothing.,
Bring a gift if invited to a Greek household.",How to Greet People in Greek3," Greek culture is largely informal, and individuals often get to know new men and women by asking personal questions. While this may feel invasive, rude, or exploitative to a traveling American, curious Greeks mean no disrespect. Personal questions are simply an effective and culturally appropriate way to quick get to know new people. These personal questions also dispense with the sense of formality which often accompanies introductions in other countries.For example, you may be asked:“Are you married?”
“Do you have children?”

, Greeks do not place great emphasis on punctuality. If you’re invited to a Greek person’s house, they’ll often extend the invitation by saying “come around 8.” In this situation, arrive at or after 8:30; a punctual arrival at 8:00 exactly, while polite in American society, will likely seem overly formal and early.The tableside atmosphere at Greek houses is largely informal and casual. Meal times serve as social gatherings, and long conversations often take place around the table.It’s considered impolite to refuse food in a Greek household. You’ll be expected to clean your plate, and can compliment the host by asking for another serving. If you must refuse some or all of the food, politely explain your reasoning.

, In Greece, the dress code is determined by the occasion, although formal attire is never called for. If you’re invited for coffee, casual clothes are fine. If you’re invited to dinner with a Greek family, or invited to dinner at a Greek individual’s household, dress well, but not formally. Men and women could wear a blazer and slacks, or a button-up shirt.Women in Greek culture typically wear dresses, including to more dressy events. If you prefer to wear a dress you can do so, although it’s not a mandatory dress code., If a Greek individual or family invites you inside of their home, it’s customary to bring a small gift as a show of appreciation. For example, you could bring a bottle of wine, a small bottle of whisky, or a small cake or pastry from a local bakery.Regardless of the gift you choose to bring, do not bring something that is clearly inexpensive. Avoid cheap flowers or cheap bottles of wine.


Also do not give cutlery, knives, or sharp objects as a gift, as these objects are seen as offensive when gifted.

Say Bù to say no in Mandarin Chinese.,
Say ma ho bu in Burmese, or Myanmar, to say no.",How to Say No in Various Languages3," No is written 不 and pronounced bu4. ""Not"" in Mandarin is very similar and is written 不是 and pronounced bu2shi4. The 4 in the pronunciation means that it is a high tone falling and should be said like a curt command in English. In Mandarin, there are five tones which determine the meaning of words. The tone determines the meaning of the word as much as the difference between the words horse and mother. For example, depending on the tone given to the word ""ma"" in Mandarin, it could mean mother (妈), flax (麻), horse (马), scold (骂), or a question participle (吗). Mandarin is the most spoken language in China as well as the world. There are 873 million native speakers of Chinese and 178 million second language speakers. It is an official language in China and Singapore. People in the north of the Yangtze River in China speak Mandarin along with other parts of the population, and overall, it is the native language of ⅔ of the population.
There are four types of Mandarin spoken in China with the most prominent form being the form in the capital, Beijing. The form in Beijing is considered Modern Standard Chinese or Guoyu.To say “No, thank you,” you would say bu2xie4, and it is written as 不谢. The tone 2 means that the pronunciation of bu2xie4 is a middle pitch that is rising, much like a question in English. The 4 means that it is a high tone falling and should be said like a curt command in English. An informal way to say, “No need to thank me” or “Not at all” in Mandarin is bu2yong4xie4. It is written, 不用谢.
A quote with bù in Mandarin is 不作死就不会死 or bù zuō sǐ jiù bú huì sǐ. Literally translated it means ""no zuo no die"" which means that if you don’t do foolish things, you won’t be in danger of the repercussions of your folly. , When using a negation in Burmese, you use the structures, ma + ___ + bu or ma + ___ + neh. The first indicates that the verb did not accomplish what it does, for example, nei ma kaing bu means you did not touch it. Nei ma kaing neh structure means that the verb must not be successful, and the translation is “you do not touch it.” To say yes in Burmese, you say ho de.Burmese is spoken in Myanmar, which was formally known as Burma, and it is located in the western part of mainland Southeast Asia.“Never” in Burmese is be daw hma. “No problem” in Burmese is pyat tha nar ma hoat ba bu.

The rounded script of written Burmese comes from the use of palm leaves as the original writing materials. Early Burmese script can be found from as early as the 11th century, and this script was a derivative of the Pāli alphabet of India and Taiwan.Burmese is a tonal language like Mandarin and has three tones, high, low, and creaky as well as a stopped and reduced tone.

Try to tune your ear to the sound/accent of the new language.,
Take your time learning.,
Practice speaking and get feedback.,
Try to practice your language by recording yourself on a tape and listening to it.,
Try to find internet resources in the language you are learning.,
Try to do basic translations and/or interpreting in your language.,
Use visual reminders.",How to Speak a Language With the Native Accent," Listen to the tones, inflections, and then phrases and sentences spoken by a variety of native speakers. You can be learning vocabulary during this process, but many hours of careful listening to the new speech sounds and rhythms will be very valuable before you begin to try to pronounce them yourself. Listening to dialogue several hours a week for a couple of months will give you a great start toward acquiring native like speech skills in the new language.


Start by watching television shows and movies in the language you're trying to learn. Turn on subtitles if you want to help understand what's happening, but make sure you pay attention to the dialogue and pronunciation as you watch. Even if you don't pick out individual words, this will still help you get the feeling for the native accent.;
, Once you have tuned your ear to the language, you may want to learn it at your own pace. Consider taking classes or using language learning software. Get out some tapes from your local library and make sure that they contain translations/explanations in your own language, too.

, Once you learn a few phrases, ask a friend (preferably a native speaker of the language you are learning) to listen to your pronunciation and correct it as necessary. Make sure they understand that you really want to achieve an authentic pronunciation; otherwise they will let you ""get by"" with errors you'd really like to fix.

, Be critical of your own accent, and practice until you match how it's supposed to sound.

, Watching videos and listening to recordings online will help you learn the native accent. Practice them aloud as you go, too, and compare how you sound to how the native speaker sounds.

, Practice these aloud to work on pronunciation and accent.

, Place vocabulary charts on your walls so that you can look at them often. Use other reminders around your home and workplace; for example, you can label items around your home or desk with both accurate spelling and pronunciation notes to help you learn.

Tagalog - Tuloy ka (singular), or Tuloy po kayo (plural).",How to Say Welcome in Different Languages1," The first is for welcoming singular people, the later for plural groups of people.


Sha-gaw-tom;
, This is one is tricky if you've never spoken Chinese, as inflection is everything. Put a little extra stress on the first half of the word.FOON--yen.

, Written phonetically like this, ""huānyíng, you want to focus of emphasizing the second half just a little louder than the first.""Hoo-ahn Ying""

, Simple and easy, you've heard this plenty of times. It also means goodbye.


""Ah-loh-ha.""

, Both of these will work, though the second is a little more formal.


""Sva-gaht""
""Sva-gaht ha-AIN"", The first ""O"" sound is a lot longer than it seems. This is one where listening to an example or native speaker will be huge.


""Yo-O-Ko-So"", Perhaps the toughest one on the list, it is a lot of syllables that come pretty quickly. Take your time learning each part before putting it all together.


""Hwan-yan Ham-ee-doh"", Another tricky one, it is pretty guttural, especially at the end of the second word. Try to use a thick, breathy voice. The first word sounds a bit like ""tafta.""


""Tav-ta Mer-lehk-tuhn."", It almost sounds a bit French, with the words sliding effortlessly together. If you speak French, the first half sounds a lot like ""Ce Soir.""


Suh-swa-guh-ta-mon

, The first simply means ""enter,"" and is used for one person or a casual acquaintance. The second is for groups or elderly people.


Too-loy kah
Too-loy poo kai-yoh

"
"
Afrikaans - Welkom.,
Arabic - أهلا وسهلا (Ahlan'wa sahlab).,
Hebrew - Shalom.,
Turkish - Hoşgeldiniz.,
Swahili - Karibu.",How to Say Welcome in Different Languages2," This language is partially based in English, so the pronunciation should be easy. The W sounds slightly like a V, almost a hybrid of W & V.


""Vale-come

, Tricky for English speakers, you will have an easier time if you think about it as three separate words that you run together. The first and last sections rhyme.


""Ahh-lehn wa Sa-lehn"", It sounds just like it looks. The second syllable rhymes with the English ""foam.""


""Sha-loam.""

, Again, this is a tricky one if you don't break it down into smaller parts. You can also use the more general phrase, ""Buyurun,"" (""Booh-Rohn""), to say hello and welcome all at the same time.""Hosh-gel-dinn-iz""

, This is the singular form, meaning it is how you welcome only one person. For plural, you would say ""karibuni.""


Care-ee-boo
Care-ee-boo-nee

"
"
Czech - Vítej (informal) or Vítejte (formal).,
Danish - Velkommen.,
Dutch - Welkom.,
French - Bienvenue.,
German - Willkommen.,
Greek - Καλώς ορίσατε (Kalōs orisate, formal), Καλώς Όρισες (Kalós órises, informal).,Bosnian - Dobrodošli

,
Italian - Benvenuto.,
Portuguese - Bem Vindo.,
Spanish - Bienvenido.,Swedish - Välkommen

,
Norwegian - Velkommen.,
Frisian - Wolkom.,
Maldivian (Divehi) - Kale ah maruhabaa.",How to Say Welcome in Different Languages3," There are a ton of welcoming lines in Czech, but these are the two easiest ones to use. The other seven or so options are for specific cases, but these two will work almost anywhere.


Vítej -- ""Vee-tai""
Vítejte -- ""Vee-tai-ta"", Simple and easy, it is the sort of thing that sounds just like an English ""welcome."" However, turn the W to a V and add the word ""men"" to the end.


""Vel-koh-men.""

, Almost exactly like the English version, but with a little harder final syllable. It sounds a bit like ""comb.""


Wel-comb.

, Simple and easy, it literally means ""Good to see you."" When saying the final ""U"" sound, try to pucker your lips a bit. To learn how, say an ""EEEE"" sound, then move your lips into a U shape. This ""e-ooo"" is the French U.


""Bee-ehn-ven-oo.

, Like the Danish (the are related languages), this is similar to the English version. However, you again want to sound out the W more like a V.

, Another language with multiple, difficult versions, these two will get you started in any circumstance. Note that, while there is an ""sh"" sound, you want to keep it subtle, almost burying it in the rest of the word.


Καλώς Ορίσατε -- ""Kah-losh o-rees-a-teh""
Καλώς Όρισες -- ""Kah-losh o-reese-is""

,, Similar to the French version, but easier to pronounce. If you're speaking to a woman, replace the final ""O"" with an ""A.""


""Ben-ven-oo-to.""

, Again, replace the ""O"" with an ""A"" if speaking to a female. Note that these are two separate words.


Beem Veen-doh

, Almost identical to the French and Portugese, as they come from similar linguistic roots (Latin).


""Bee-ehn-ven-ee-doh.""

,, Put it in the box with Dutch, German, and the others. Keep it simple and replace the W with a V, and add the ""men"" to the normal English ""welcome!""


""Vel-koh-men.""

, This is the closest ""living"" relative of English. It makes speaking super easy -- so just match it close to the normal ""Welcome,"" but use a longer O sound at the end (like in the word ""comb.""


""Wel-comb""

, Another tricky one -- but you have this! Kale is just like vegetable, but with an ""A"" sound at the end. The rest sounds just like it looks.

",How to Say Merry Christmas in Different Languages," This is the common phrase in a number of countries around the world, including:

United States
Canada
England
It's also what they say on Christmas Island, the Cayman Islands, Jamaica, Fiji, and if you happen to be there this time of year, be sure to say Merry Christmas in Antarctica!;
, Ireland has their own way for so many things, and the greetings of the season is no exclusion!, This is virtually said throughout every Lusophone nation. From Brazil in South America to Timor Leste in Indonesia.

In Portugal and in some Portuguese speaking African countries, they say Boas Festas!

, Yes, you'll hear it in Las Vegas, thank you Jose Feliciano! This is also how you'll want to wish them a Merry Christmas from the bottom of your heart in virtually every Spanish-speaking country (though not necessarily with musical accompaniment):

The Iberian Peninsula, including Spain and Gibraltar;
Mexico and Central America, including Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama;
South America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.

, For Francophiles, Joyeux Noël is the greeting of the season, and you will hear it or say it in a number of places around the world.

France, of course, and also in much of Canada.
You'll also hear it quite a lot in African nations during your visits to Burkina Faso, Burundi, and Cameroon, or when hanging out in Chad, The Congo, Côte d'Ivoire, Madagascar, or Togo

, is the greeting you'll hear in Dutch-speaking countries.

In Belgium, Zalig Kerstfeest would be the right thing to say to anybody.
In the Netherlands, you have options. You can say ""Prettige Kerstdagen,"" ""Vrolijk Kerstfeest en een Gelukkig Nieuwjaar,"" (tossing in a ""Happy New Year"" for good measure) or, of course, ""Zalig Kerstfeest!""

, will bring a smile to the face of Germans, and if you happen to be in Liechtenstein it will be warmly received there as well. In Switzerland, there's a slight variation; there, they say ""Fröhlichi Wiehnacht!""

If you're in Austria, you have less of a mouthful to say: it's simply ""Frohe Weihnachten.""

, is Italian for Merry Christmas, but be sure to say it with gusto! You can also say this without pause in San Marino, and when pressed in Libya., The Middle East is not without its Christmas tidings, subdued though they may often be.

You'll find them wishing you ""Milad Mubarak!"" in Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Yemen, and when spending a night in Tunisia.
""Natal Mubarak"" is the Indian variant, and in Pakistan, say ""Bara Din Mubarrak Ho!"" (not ""Ho Ho Ho"").

, Lest we forget, this is how you say ""Merry Christmas"" in Israel., There is only one place in the entire world that says this, and that is Albania. ""Gëzuar"" is also how they say ""cheers!"" or ""bottoms up!"" when tippling the eggnog!

In Albania's next door neighbor, Greece, they say ""Eftihismena Christougenna!""

, Is de rigueur in Croatia, but if you're heading to Eastern Europe, there are as many variants as there are nations.

In the Czech Republic, say ""Vesele Vanoce!"" In Serbia, ""Hristos se rodi! Srećan Božić"" In Slovenia, you would say ""Srecen bozic,"" and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, ""Sretam Bozic, Hristos se Rodi!""

, This is how they say Merry Christmas in Japan. And lest we give a lump of coal to other Asian nations:

In Hong Kong, say ""Sing dan fiy loc,"" and in Korea say ""Sung Tan Chuk Ha."" In Mandarin Chinese, take a deep breath and say ""Kung His Hsin Nien Bing Chu Shen Tan.""
Down south, they say ""Chuc Mung Giang Sinh"" in Viet Nam, and in Thailand they say ""Sawasdee Pee Mai.""

, There are nearly 200 countries in the world today, so we're also offering an alphabetical list of nations and the way (or ways) they say Merry Christmas in each of them.

One thing to keep in mind when struggling to remember the right thing to say: in most every country in the world, there's one phrase that will be recognized no mater what the native language might be:

Take lessons at a university.",How to Say I Love You in Swahili," These are the two ways you can say ""I love you"" in Swahili. ""Ni-"" means ""I,"" and the single word represents the entire sentence in Swahili. ""-kupenda"" means love in Swahili.


Colloquial Swahili speakers will drop the initial prefix ""Ni-"" and simply say ""Nakupenda."" Either ""Ninakupenda"" or ""Nakupenda"" are both accurate. The shorter version is simply more commonly used by native speakers, similar to how native American speakers might more frequently say ""bye"" instead of ""goodbye.""
Other translations of ""Ninakupenda"" and ""Nakupenda"" are ""affirmation of romantic feeling"" and ""affirmation of affection or deep caring."" The phrase can be used with a lover or spouse or a family member.;
, These phrases both mean ""I love you very much."" Sometimes you want to emphasize how much you love someone or use other terms of endearment. There are many different ways you can do this in Swahili. To call someone ""my love,"" say, ""manzi wangu."" To say, ""I love you too,"" say, ""Ninakupenda pia.""
To say, ""I love you, my angel,"" say, ""Ninakupenda malaika wangu."" , Some sites on the Internet will steer you incorrectly. The shorter version is the correct one. All you need to learn is a single word: Ninakupenda (or Nakupenda).


Some sites don't understand that in Swahili the prefix ""Ni-"" is the subject ""I.""
Thus, you don't need to say ""Mimi ninakupenda wewe"" because it literally means ""I I you love you"" with the ""I"" repeated twice. That's silly.

, In Swahili, words are accented on the second-to-last syllable. People won't know what you're saying if you don't get the pronunciation right.


The correct pronunciation is ""Nah-koo-PEND-ah.""
The correct pronunciation of the less colloquial version of ""I love you"" is ""Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah."" , There are just five vowels in the Swahili language: a, e, i, o, and u. The vowels are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in Japanese, Italian, and Spanish. This is important to understand if you are using another term of endearment.


For example, ""Ninakupenda pia"" is pronounced ""Nee-nah-koo-PEND-ah pee-ah.""
A is pronounced ""ah"" (like ""father"")
E is pronounced ""eh"" (like ""egg"")
I is pronounced ""ee"" (like ""tree"")
O is pronounced ""oh"" (like ""oval"")
U is pronounced ""oo"" (like ""room"")
There are no silent vowels in Swahili. You must pronounce each vowel in a sentence. , There are many consonants in Swahili that are pronounced the same way as they are pronounced in the English language.


The letters ""n"" and ""m"" are pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English. The difference is that, in Swahili, sometimes another consonant will follow the ""n,"" and it also must be pronounced. For example, ""Ndugu"" is a word that means relative.
Consonants pronounced the same way they are pronounced in English include the letters p, s, t, v, w, y, and z.
Understand how to pronounce consonant pairings. For example, ""ch"" is pronounced like the ""ch"" in ""chair."" And ""sh"" is pronounced like the ""sh"" in ""shut."" ""Gh"" can be pronounced with a hard ""g"" as in the English word ""garden.""

, Unlike English, Swahili verbs include both the subject and the tense. Figuring out a little bit about how the Swahili language works conceptually will help you say ""I love you"" properly.


For example, the word ""Ninakula"" is actually a complete sentence which means ""I am eating"" in Swahili. ""Ni-"" is the portion of the word that indicates the subject of the sentence: ""I."" That's why the English phrase ""I love you"" is also just a single word in Swahili.
As another example, the way you say ""I don't need"" to indicate you don't want to buy something is simply, ""Sihitaji.""
To say ""I am lost,"" you say, ""Nimepotea.""

, Pronouns are the same in the language for all genders. So, you say ""I love you"" the same way to a man as you would say the phrase to a woman.


This means there are not different words used for he, him, she or her.
The prefix ""a-"" is used for ""he"" or ""she"" alike. Swahili was ahead of the curve in this respect. The language is essentially gender neutral.

, The Internet has made it easier than ever before to learn foreign languages. There are many resources available for Swahili training. This will improve your vocabulary and pronunciation so you can better communicate with the person you love. If you want to tell someone you love them in Swahili, why not learn how to say more?


Buy an audio CD or textbook. These days, it's easy to learn a foreign language by purchasing audio CD lessons or textbooks online. Some language exchange programs online will match you with a native speaker.
You can also find You Tube videos for free that teach you how to say key Swahili phrases.

, Universities throughout the world, including in America and Africa, offer Swahili lessons. In Africa, the Institute of Kiswahili and Foreign Languages at the State University of Zanzibar offers lessons in the Swahili language. Ohio State University is an example of an American university offering Swahili language training. Learning the language will help you better understand the culture, which should improve your relationship with the person you love, if they are a native Swahili speaker. Swahili (or Kiswahili as people speaking the language call it) is the African indigenous language that is the most studied and most important.

For example, if you plan to use ""good luck"" in a professional setting, you will want to learn to say the equivalent of something like ""Best of luck with your client meeting today.""In English, you might say something like ""Break a leg"" as a casual way to wish a friend luck. Check to see if there are equivalent phrases in the language you choose. For instance, you might look up ""informal well-wishes in Arabic"".

, Maybe you are not preparing for a specific situation, such as a trip. If you are just being proactive about learning new phrases, good for you! There are several other factors you can consider when deciding which languages you want to choose.Consider the world population. For example, Mandarin Chinese is spoken by more than a billion people. It might set you apart professionally and personally if you can learn some helpful phrases in Mandarin.

Know which languages are commonly spoken in each region.,
Try speaking English.,
Take your cues from the locals and think before you speak.,
Use the proper physical etiquette.",How to Say Hello in Switzerland1," 65-75% of Swiss citizens speak Swiss-German, particularly throughout northern and central Switzerland. 20% speak French, and 4-7% are fluent in Italian.French and Italian are respectively most common along the borders with France (to the west) and Italy (to the south). Romansh is an ancient language, native to some southern regions, that is spoken by less than 1% of Swiss citizens.


Bear in mind that many Swiss are multilingual. German is a good bet anywhere in the country, but you may be able to get by with French, Italian, or English regardless of the region.;
, Just say ""Hello!"" Most Swiss citizens speak at least some English, especially in the big cities. The locals may be impressed if you make the effort to approach them using their native language, but you should be able to make your way around with English in most metropolitan areas. Bonus: the English ""Hello"" shares its roots with the German ""Hallo,"" so you might be briefly mistaken for German if you use the right tone., Listen to the people around you. Before you speak to someone, listen carefully to hear him or her talk. If you are greeting a group, try to eavesdrop on their conversation before you jump in. You may even be able to pin down the pronunciation of certain words by listening to how the people around you say them.


Look at signs, notices, and advertisements. If most of the public notices are written in German, then you should probably try speaking German. If most of the notices are written in French, then you should try speaking French.
If you are preparing to meet someone for the first time, consider his or her name. If his name is Pierre, there's a good chance that he hails from a French-speaking region. If his name is Klaus, then it might be safe to assume that he speaks German.

, If you’re meeting someone for the first time, stretch out your hand and say hello. If you are a woman greeting a female friend or a man greeting a woman, kiss them three times: offer first your right cheek, then your left, then your right again. These are not actual kisses, just air kisses. If you are a man greeting a male friend, stick with a handshake or man-hug. This format applies over much of the country, but certain regions (particularly those that border other countries) may have their own specific etiquette."

Congratulations!""

Japanese children once celebrated their birthdays on January 1st and not on their birthday, a custom which has mostly died out.
In Japan there is a Shinto Festival called Shichi-Go-San, which roughly means ""seven-five-three"". All three year old children, as well as five year old boys and seven year old girls, are taken to the temple and given special sweets by the priest.

A tradition is that the one who is celebrating their birthday eats the first bite of the cake - without using any utensils!
In many Spanish-speaking cultures, a very important birthday is the 'Quinceañera' which is celebrated when a girl turns fifteen. It is a rite of passage which marks the transition from girlhood to womanhood. The girl wears a lavish dress and high heeled shoes which her father may place on her feet. Flat shoes symbolise girlhood and so the high heels represent her becoming a woman. She gives a porcelain doll to a younger girl to symbolise leaving childish things behind and she is waited on by fourteen attendants to represent the past fourteen years of her life. The day consists of a church ceremony, during which the girl is blessed, and then a dinner or ball, at which she has the first dance with her father.

'Birthday bumps' is an Irish tradition where a child is held upside down down and gently bumped off the floor, once for each year and another once for luck.
At 21 the young person is given a key to the family property or a cardboard substitute, symbolising their new-found maturity and adulthood and offering the freedom to come and go independently! The presentation is accompanied by a song: ""I'm twenty-one today!/ Twenty-one today!/ I've got the key of the door!/ Never been twenty-one before!/ And father says I can do what I like!/ So shout Hip-hip-hooray!/ I'm a jolly good fellow,/ Twenty-one today.""

"
Use Swiss-German, not German.,
Say ""hello"" informally when speaking to friends and family.,
Say ""hello"" formally.",How to Say Hello in Switzerland2," Swiss-German is similar to classic German, but there are many local dialectic twists that will make your greetings easier to understand. All the vowels in these words should be pronounced. If you see ue, üe or ie, for instance, you should pronounce the ""u"", the ""e"", and the ""i"" as distinct syllables. If you are writing, take note that all nouns in German are capitalized., Say ""Grüetzi"" to one person, or ""Gruetzi mittenand"" to two or more people. In most German-speaking areas, the word ""Grüetzi"" is equivalent to the English ""Hi."" Phonetically, this sounds like ""Gryətsi"" or ""Groo-et-see"". You can also try ""Guten Tag"", in the standard German, which is easier to pronounce and remember. Consider these other informal greetings:


Hoi/Salü/Sali: ""Hi"", more informal than Grüetzi. ""Hoy"", ""Saloo"", ""Salee"".
Hoi zäme: ""Hi"" to more than one person. ""Hoy zah-may"".
Ciao (the same as the Italian ""Ciao"", pronounced ""chow"")

, You will want to use more formal phrases when you are greeting business associates and people you do not know well. Most of these greetings relate to the time of day.


""Gueten Morgen!"": ""Good morning!"" Pronounced ""Goo-eh-ten more-gen"" (""gen"" pronounced with a hard ""G""). In some areas, German-speakers use ""guetä Morgä,"" with the shortcut ""Morgä"" or ""Morge"" (differs from canton to canton).

This is usually used until about noon. In some areas of Germany, it is only said until 10 a.m.


""Guetä Tag!"": ""Good day!"" Pronounced ""Goo-eh-ta togg"".

This phrase is usually said between the hours of noon and 6 p.m.


""Gueten Abig."": ""Good evening."" Pronounced ""Goo-eh-ten ah-beeg"".

This greeting is usually used after 6 p.m.



"
"
Use French.,
Say ""Bonjour."",
Say ""Salut"" for an informal greeting.,
Switch to ""Bonsoir"" in the evening.",How to Say Hello in Switzerland3," Particularly in the western regions of Switzerland, people should be able to understand you if you speak French to them. Swiss French varies much less dramatically from standard French than does Swiss-German from standard German., This term is the standard, textbook translation of “hello,"" and you can use it in both formal and casual settings. Bonjour is a combination of the term ""bon,"" meaning ""good,"" and ""jour,"" meaning day. The literal translation is ""good day."" The word is pronounced ""bon-zhoor""., The ""t"" is silent, so pronounce the word ""Sah-loo"". This translates to a casual “hi” or “hullo” rather than a formal “hello.”


Even though salut is an interjection used to greet people, it is related to the French verb ""saluer,"" meaning ""to greet"" or ""to salute.""
Another informal greeting using this term would be “Salut tout le monde!” Roughly translated, it means “Hello, everybody!” The term ""tout"" means ""all"" and ""le monde"" means ""the world."" This greeting would only be used amongst a group of close friends.

, Pronounce it ""bon-swar"". The literal translation of this word is “good evening,” and it should be used to say “hello” in the evening or at night.The term can be used in formal and casual settings, but it is more likely to be heard in formal settings.


""Bon"" means ""good"", and ""soir"" means ""evening"".
One way to greet a crowd of people in the evening is to state, ""Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs,"" meaning, ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen."" Pronounce it, ""bon-swar meh-dahms et meh-sures.""

"
"
Use Italian.,
Say ""ciao"" in casual situations.,
Greet people with ""salve"" in neutral situations.,
Use time-specific greetings.",How to Say Hello in Switzerland4," Roughly 4-7% of Swiss citizens speak Italian, particularly in the southern cantons (provinces) that border Italy. Swiss Italians are proportionately much more likely to speak Swiss-German than Swiss-Germans are to speak Italian. If you are traveling in the southern part of Switzerland, listen to the people around you and read the signs. If everyone seems to be speaking Italian, then it's probably a good choice., Pronounce ""ciao"" as ""chow."" This is one of the two most common ways to say “hello” or “hi” in Italian. While it is a common greeting, ciao is considered fairly informal and is usually used in casual situations or among friends and family.Note that “ciao” can also mean “good-bye,” depending on the context. Make it clear that you are greeting the person and not saying farewell.

, Pronounce salve as ""sahl-veh."" Although it is not quite as common as “ciao,” the term “salve” is more appropriate to use among people with whom you are not on familiar terms. The most formal way to greet someone is with a time-specific greeting, but salve is still appropriate to use with most people. To put it in the perspective of a native English speaker, “ciao” is like “hi” while “salve” is closer to “hello.”Like ciao, salve can also be used to say ""good-bye"" depending on the context.

, Buongiorno and other time-based greetings are considered the most formal way of greeting someone. That said, you can still use these phrases among friends and family. As with many other Italian greetings, time-specific hellos can also mean ""good-bye"" depending on the context.


Say ""buongiorno"" in the morning. This phrase translates into “good morning” or “good day.” Pronounce buongiorno as ""bwohn jor-noh.""
Say ""buon pomeriggio"" in the afternoon. That's ""bwohn poh-meh-ree-joh."" This phrase can be used to say “good afternoon” as a greeting or farewell after noon. Note that you may still hear buongiorno in the afternoon, but buon pomeriggio is slightly more common and more accurate. ""Buon pomeriggio"" is a lot more formal than ""buongiorno""
Use ""buonasera"" in the evening. After roughly 4 PM, the polite way to greet or bid farewell to someone is with buonasera. Pronounce buonasera as ""bwoh-nah seh-rah.""

Use time-specific greetings.",How to Say Hello in Switzerland5," Rumantsch is an ancient language that is spoken by less than 1% of Swiss citizens. About 48,000 of these speakers live in the southeastern district of Canton Graubünden. Most people who speak Rumantsch also speak Swiss-German and other languages, but locals may be impressed if you reach out to them in their native tongue.


Romansh is also spelled as Romansh, Romantsch, Rhaeto-Romance, or Rheto-Romanic.
About half of all native Rumantsch speakers have emigrated towards the industrialized cities of German speaking northern Switzerland. In this sense, Zurich has become the town with the most Rumantsch speakers. However, most Rumantsch-speaking city dwellers habitually speak German out of convenience.The language comes from what ""vulgar Latin"" or ""people's Latin,"" with influences from Etruscan, Celtic, and other languages spoken by early settlers in the mountain valleys of what are now the Grisons and Italy's South Tirol. Romansh was included as a Swiss national language in 1938. Thus, base your pronunciations on Latin pronunciations.

,
Pronounce ""ciao"" as ""chow"".
Pronounce ""tgau"" as ""gow"".

, As with Switzerland's other national languages, time-specific Rumantsch greetings tend to be the most formal greetings. Use time-specific greetings in formal settings and when greeting people that you have never met.


""Bun di"" means ""good morning."" Pronounce it ""boon dee"".
""Buna saira"" means ""good afternoon or ""good evening"". Pronounce it ""boon-a serra"".

Say ""mia nomo estas"" (""my name is"") or ""mi nomiĝas"" (""I'm called"") in Esperanto.","How to Say ""My Name Is"" in Several Languages1"," This translates to ""my name is_____""


""MO-eg-toh e-meh eh __________"";
, This is a somewhat gravelly sound. While ""heet"" is pronounced like ""hate,"" natural speakers almost slur the two together, almost like ""hee-EIGHT.""


""Ick hate""

, The words will somewhat glide together. This translates as ""I am called.""


""Jhe- ma- pelle""

, This one most people already know, but they still get tripped up by the double-L. In Spanish, the double-L sounds like an English ""y.""


""Meh Yam-oh""

, Really differentiate the three syllables, keeping them sharp and distinct.


""Ikh High- saa"", For more formal hellos, you can also say, ""Ονομάζομαι"" (""To o-no-ma mou e-ne,"") which translates to ""I am called.""


""Meh Leh-neh""
You can also change things up with ""Λέγομαι,"" (""Leh-go-meh,"") meaning ""I'm named."", Like in French, the words need to somewhat slur together. The ""v"" sound in the middle should sound about halfway between a V and a W.


""A neh-wem"", Icelandic is one of the world's hardest languages, but luckily fo you ""My Name is"" is quite easy.


""Yeg hey-tih"", Not that this sounds completely different from how it looks. The ""se"" at the end sounds much more like ""sha.""


""Mish-ah"", No, that ""3"" shape is not a typo, it's just a part of the Russian Alphabet. If you don't have time to learn the whole thing, the pronunciation isn't tough. This translates into ""I am called.""


""Men-ya za-voot"", These are the English equivalents of ""My name is ____"" or ""I'm ____.""


""Mi Chiamo"" (Mee Key-ah-mo). → ""My name is....""
""Sono: (soh-no). → ""I'm..."", If you know how to speak Italian, Spanish, or French, the pronunciation is very similar.


""Me-he no-men es""

, You can also use the phrase ""mă chiamă"" as well.


""Ma new-Mesk""
""Ma key-ama""

, Like in German, you're looking for three well-pronounced, distinct syllables. The second word sounds like ""height,"" as in how tall something is, in English.


""Egg Height-er""Note: this may also be spelled ""Jeg heter."" This second versions is the more formal, traditional spelling. Both are correct.

, For more formal, longer phrase, you can use ""Moje meno je ____"" (""My name is ____""). The words in Slovak tend to be slightly jammed together, especially here, where they might sound like one word.


""Vol-am say"", For more formal conversations, try out ""Mitt namn är."" This is tricky one, as the letters aren't used quite the same way in English. Try to make the ""i"" in ""mitt"" sound like an ""E"" sound. ""Yog Heat-err""
""Mit Nam Aer""

, Esperanto was invented in Poland after WWII as a politically neutral, global language.

""Am-ar Nahm""

, Note how there is a word after your name -- ""hai."" This translates literally to ""My name Nick is."" This is grammatically correct in Hindi.


""May-rah nahm _____ hey""You use the same phrase in Urdu. It is written out as ""میرا نام ____ ہے."", Note that there is a word ""desu"" that comes after your name in Japanese. For simpler speaking, you can say, ""I am ____,"" or ""Watashi wa Nick""' desu.""


""Wat-a-shee no na-my wah ______ dehs""
Wat-a-shee wah ____ dehs""

, There are several versions of an introduction in Tagalog, all of which are easy to pick up. The word for name, ""pangalan""



Casual: Ako si ___ → "" ""AkOH see""

Polite: Ako po si ___ → ""AkOH poh see""

Formal: Ang pangalan ko ak___ → ""An pan-nall-en co ack"", This is in the Mandarin dialect. Chinese is not just about accent but also inflection, which completely changes the meanings of words. This is one you should absolutely listen to examples of.""Wuo - duh - meeng -- tza -- shuu _____""
For a simpler translation, try ""Wuo Jiao ___""In Cantonese Chinese, use the phrase ""Ngo kui tso."", Things might get difficult in Cambodia, Vietnam, or Laos, but this phrase can help start introductions.


""Ka-nohm ch'moo-ah"", Some speakers drop the first word, sticking instead with "" tôi là ___.""


""Ten Thoy la"", Thai is a gendered language, so make sure you use the right form. The last word, though hyphenated below, should be smushed together.Male: ""pohm chee-ew""
Female: ""dee-shaun chee-ew""

""May naahm ehs""Some people substitute ""Ek"" for ""my."" This is more traditional, typically.

, Some dialects of Arabic actually omit the second word, such as Sudanese Arabic.


""Is-mee Ho

, It's just one word, followed but your name.


""Nee-na-nweet-wa.""

, Note that Wolof is not a written language, so spelling is not very important. The language is common in Senegal, Gambia, and parts of North Africa.""______ la tood""
You can also use ""Maa ngi tudd ____"" for ""my name is."" Pronounced ""mahn-gee too-doo."" Note the extra syllable on ""tudd.""

, Again, this isn't a commonly written language, so don't worry much about spelling. It is pronounced much like it looks, with the ""ngu"" the hardest part. Sound it out like ""new,"" but try to get out a gutteral ""G"" sound right before the word. This is called a ""glottal stop,"" for word nerds out there.""Ig-ah-mah la-mee (g)new""

,How to Say Hello in French1,
"
Say ""Bonjour"" in any setting.,
Use ""Salut"" in less formal situations.,
State ""Hé"" or ""Tiens"" in casual settings, too.,
Answer the phone with ""Allô."",
Use ""bienvenue"" to welcome someone.If someone visits your home or office, you could welcome them with this phrase which loosely translates into “Welcome!”


A more literal translation of the term would be ""well arrival.""",How to Say Hello in French2," This term is the standard, textbook translation of “hello” and can be used in both formal and casual settings.



Bonjour is a combination of the term ""bon,"" meaning ""good,"" and ""jour,"" meaning day. The literal translation is ""good day.""
The term is pronounced bon-zhoor., Rather than “hello,” this term would be better translated as “hi” or “hullo.”


Even though salut is an interjection used to greet people, it is related to the French verb ""saluer,"" meaning ""to greet"" or ""to salute."" The literal translation of salut is ""cheers or bye"" and it is used for rather informal situations.
The term is pronounced without the ending “t,” so it sounds like sah-loo.

""Salut"" can take the meaning of ""goodbye"" as well. Therefore, salut can be used in the beginning and in the end of conversations.
Another informal greeting using this term would be “Salut tout le monde!” Roughly translated, it means “Hello, everybody!” The term ""tout"" means ""all"" and ""le monde"" means ""the world."" This greeting would only be used amongst a group of close friends., Both terms are not as standard or formal as bonjour, but they are used to say “hello” in settings that are not especially formal.



Hé is best translated as the English ""hey."" The term is pronounced similarly, with the ésounding close to the English ei.

Another informal greeting used amongst friends is ""Hé là!"" This translates into ""Hey there!""
As an interjection, tiens! is essentially a surprised ""hello!"" The ""ie"" in the word is nasalized and pronounced like the English ""y,"" so the word sounds like t-y-ns., This greeting is the one that sounds most similar to the English “hello,” and it is commonly used to greet someone on the telephone.


The term is pronounced ah-low, with a heavy accent on the second syllable.
You could could also ask, ""âllo?"" Used this way, the accent is on the first syllable. This expression would be used if you wanted to ask something along the lines of ""Hello? Are you listening?"", Bien means ""well,"" and venue is a noun meaning arrival.
The term is roughly pronounce bea-venoo.

Another way to extend your welcome to someone would be to say ""être le bienvenu."" The term ""être"" is a verb meaning ""to be.""

"
"
Stick with ""Bonjour"" in the morning and afternoon.,
Switch to ""Bonsoir"" in the evening.",How to Say Hello in French3," There is no special greeting for the morning or afternoon.


Since bonjour literally means “good day,” you are essentially saying “good morning” or “good afternoon” when you use the term since morning and afternoon are both considered part of the daytime.

, The literal translation of this word is “good evening,” and it should be used to say “hello” in the evening or at night.The term can be used in formal and casual settings, but it is more likely to be heard in formal settings.

Bon means “good” and soir means “evening.”
Pronounce the term as bon-swar.

One way to greet a crowd of people in the evening is to state, ""Bonsoir mesdames et messieurs,"" meaning, ""Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.""

Travel to a country where they speak Tamil.",How to Learn Tamil," The Tamil script has 12 vowels, 18 consonants, and one character known as an āytam that is neither a consonant nor a vowel. However, because the Tamil script is syllabic rather than alphabetic -- meaning symbols represent phonetic units including consonants and vowels -- it comprises a total of 247 phonetic combinations. Many of these are written by adding diacritical marks to the basic 31 letters to indicate changes.Tamil is written from left to right in horizontal lines, just like English.A chart of the basic Tamil script is available here: http://tamilo.com/Learn_Tamil/alphabet.pdf.;
, The Tamil script has 12 vowels, which are written as independent letters when they appear at the beginning of a syllable. They alter their form depending on whether they are paired with a consonant and whether they are short or long vowels. (Long vowels are held about twice as long as short vowels.) In some cases, diacritic marks are added to the end of the consonants to represent vowels, but in others, marks are added to other locations.அ a and ஆ aaSimilar to many other South Asian scripts, Tamil consonants carry the inherent அ a sound, so அ a does not change when added to a consonant.When ஆ aa is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is added to the end of the consonant, as in கா kaa.


இ i and ஈ ii

When இ i is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is added to the end of the consonant, as in கி ki.
When ஈ ii is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is added to the top of the consonant, as in கீ kii.


உ u and ஊ uu

When உ u is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is added to the bottom of the consonant, as in கு ku.
When ஊ uu is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is added to the end of the consonant, as in கூ kuu.


எ e and ஏ ee

When எ e is added to a consonant, a modified form is placed in front of the consonant, as in கெ ke.
When ஏ ee is added to a consonant, a diacritic mark representing it is placed in front of the consonant, as in கே kee.


ஐ ai

When ஐ ai is added to a consonant, a modified form is placed in front of the consonant, as in கை kai.


ஒ o and ஓ oo

When ஒ o is added to a consonant, the diacritic marks for e and aa are placed surrounding the consonant, as in கொ ko.
When ஓ oo is added to a consonant, the diacritic marks for ee and aa are placed surrounding the consonant, as in கோ koo.


ஔ au

When ஔ au is added to a consonant, the diacritic mark for e is placed at the beginning of the consonant and another diacritic mark is placed at the end, as in கௌ kau.


There are some non-standard consonant-vowel combinations in Tamil that don’t follow these rules. A complete list of these exceptions is available here: http://www.omniglot.com/writing/tamil.htm.

, Tamil has 18 basic consonants that are divided into three groups: vallinam (hard consonants), mellinam (soft consonants and nasals), and idayinam (medium consonants). Some consonants in Tamil don’t have direct equivalents in English, so it’s important to listen to them pronounced if possible.Vallinam consonants: க் k, ச் ch, ட் t, த் th, ப் p, ற் tr


Mellinam consonants: ங் ng, ஞ் ng , ண் n, ந் n, ம் m, ன் n


Idaiyinam consonants: ய் y, ர் r, ல் l, வ் v, ழ் l, ள் l

There are also several borrowed consonants from Sanskrit, which are usually referred to as “Grantha” letters after the original script used to write Tamil. These sounds are often found in modern spoken Tamil, but less so in classical written Tamil. These letters are:

ஜ் j

ஷ் sh

ஸ் s

ஹ் h

க்ஷ் ksh

ஸ்ரீ srii



Finally, there is a special letter, ஃ akh, called an āytam. It is usually used in modern Tamil to indicate foreign sounds, such as f and z., The University of Pennsylvania has a website with audio recordings of all the Tamil vowel and consonant sounds.If you can find a native Tamil speaker to help you by saying these sounds with you, that’s even better.

, There are several online resources that can help you as you begin to learn Tamil. You’ll also want to find a good dictionary. The Oxford English-Tamil Dictionary, published by the India branch of the Oxford University Press, is considered the standard dictionary for Tamil learners and has over 50,000 entries. The University of Chicago also has an extensive free online Tamil dictionary through its Digital Dictionaries of South Asia project.The University of Pennsylvania has a set of 36 lessons on Tamil grammar and sentence construction.The University of Texas at Austin has a set of lessons on Tamil language and culture.The Central Institute of Indian Languages has online lessons in Tamil script, grammar, and sentence structure. Sample lessons are free, and full access to the course is $50USD or 500Rs.Polymath has an extensive set of lessons on the Tamil language, including a wide list of vocabulary words and lessons on pronouns, verb tenses, and common questions.Language Reef has a set of 14 simple Tamil lessons.Once you get more advanced, the University of Michigan has 11 free lessons in Intermediate Tamil, including audio files to accompany each lesson.The government of Tamil Nadu has a “Virtual Academy” that includes games, a library of Tamil sources, and lessons.Much of the content is free, although some is also available for purchase.

, The standard text is A Reference Grammar of Spoken Tamil by Harold F. Schiffman, Professor Emeritus of Dravidian Linguistics and Culture at the University of Pennsylvania.If you want to speak Tamil, this is the book to purchase, as spoken Tamil is very different from written Tamil, which has remained largely the same since the 13th century.


Kausalya Hart’s Tamil for Beginners is currently out of print but widely available in used bookstores.E. Annamalai and R.E. Asher’s Colloquial Tamil: The Complete Course for Beginners focuses exclusively on spoken Tamil and includes audio for its lessons. It can go a bit fast for beginners but is widely recommended.The University of Pennsylvania has published a Tamil Language in Context book, which includes a DVD with videos of filmed dialogue by native Tamil speakers.The Tamil Nadu government has a basic e-book for free download that introduces the Tamil script and basics of grammar., Tamil is an inflected language, meaning that words are altered by using prefixes or suffixes to show their person, number, mood, tense, and voice. Tamil sentences may not always have subjects, verbs, and objects, but if these elements are present, the most common sentence order is subject-object-verb or object-subject-verb.In Tamil, you can make simple sentences by putting two nouns or noun phrases together -- you don’t even need to use a verb! In this case, the first noun acts as the subject and the second is the predicate (or the part that states something about the subject and acts as a verb).

For example, you could say அங்கவை Angavai பல் வைத்தியர் pal vaiththiyar to say “Angavai is a dentist”. To negate this type of sentence, add the word இல்லை illai “not” to the end of the sentence.


Imperative sentences in Tamil are commonly used to make requests as well as give commands. There are two ways to do this: the informal or intimate way, and the formal or polite way. Your social context will help determine which form is appropriate; for example, never use the informal mode with your elders, public figures, or other individuals who are commonly given public respect.The informal/intimate mode just uses the root form of a verb without inflection. For example, பார் Paar means “See” (singular). Use this mode with close friends and children; it is not commonly used in polite conversation with people you don’t know well unless you want to insult them.
The formal/polite mode adds the plural inflection to the root form of the verb. For example, பாருங்கள் paarunkal is the plural form of paar, bt would be used in polite or formal address even if you were only talking to one person.
If you want to be especially polite, you can add the question word ஏன் een “why” to the polite imperative form. For example, பாருங்களேன் paarunkaleen means “Why don’t you see/look at?” or “Would you look at ___?”



, Tamil is an ancient and complex language, so it’s unlikely you’ll be able to dive in headfirst and begin speaking in fluent sentences immediately. Learning some common vocabulary words can help you communicate with others even if you’re not completely familiar with Tamil grammar.


Being able to ask for new foods is one of the most enjoyable reasons to learn a new language when you travel. Common Tamil foods include சோறு choru(rice), சாம்பார் sambar (a lentil stew), ரசம் rasam (a soup made with tamarind), தயிர் tayir (yogurt or curd) and வடை vada (savory fritters). You might see சாம்பார் சாதம் caampaar caatam (curry rice) or மீன் குழம்பு miin kulampu (fish curry), a famous dish in the south regions of India. ஒபுட்டு Oputtu is a sweet, almost pizza-like dish made with coconut.Check whether the dish is காரம் kaaram “spicy” before you order! If you’d like coffee, a signature beverage in Tamil Nadu, you would ask for காபி kaapi. You can also ask for தேநீர் teeniir (tea). Your server might say மகிழ்ந்து உண்ணுங்கள் Magizhnthu unnungal, “Have a nice meal.”
Bargaining or haggling is a common practice in Indian culture. If you are interested in buying something, begin by offering பாதி விலை paati vilai, or “half price.”Then, both you and the seller will work to arrange a satisfactory price. You will probably want to find things மலிவானது malivaanatu “cheap”, whereas the seller will try to push you toward something more விலை அதிகமானது vilai atikamaanatu “expensive”. You may also want to check whether the shop accepts கடன் அட்டை katan attai “credit card” or only பணம் panam “cash.”
If you’re feeling unwell, these words could help: மருத்துவர் maruttuvar “doctor”, மருத்துவ ஊர்தி maruttuvuurti “ambulance”,

, In Tamil, a question can be formed by using a question word at the end of sentence. You should be aware the the stress placed on the question words can affect the meaning.The common question words include என்ன enna “what”, எது edu “which (thing)”, எங்கே engkee “where”, யார் yaar ""who” and எப்பொழுது/எப்போது eppozhutu/eppoodu “when.”


For example, you could say உங்கள் பெயர் என்ன? Unga peru enna?, which means “What is your name?” The appropriate response is என் பெயர் En peyar ___ “My name is ____.”
The “interrogative marker” ஆ is placed at the end of a noun or sentence to make it a yes/no question. For example, for the noun பையனா Paiyaṉaa “boy”, placing ஆ at the end will turn it into the question “Is he a boy?”Other common questions you might want to learn include எனக்கு உதவி செய்வீங்களா? Enakku udhavi seivienkalaa? “Can you help me?” புதிய என்ன? Putiya eṉṉa? “What’s new?”நீங்கள் எப்படி இருக்கிறீர்கள்? Niinkal eppati irukkiriirkal? “How are you?” இது என்ன? Itu enna? “What is this?”

, You may want to learn some common phrases to help you start conversations in Tamil. A good place to start might be தமிழ் பேச முடியுமா? Tamiḻ peeca muṭiyumaa? “Can you speak Tamil?” and நான் தமிழ் கற்றல் Naan tamil karral “I’m learning Tamil.”You could also learn காலை வணக்கம் Kaalai vanakkam “Good morning!” and நல்ல இரவு Nalla iravu “Good night!”அது எவ்வளவு செலவாகும்? Atu evvalavu celavaakum? “How much does it cost?” would be good to know when shopping. நன்றி Nanri “Thanks!” and வரவேற்கிறேன்! Varaveerkireen “You’re welcome!” and மன்னிக்கணும் Mannikkanum “Excuse me” or “Sorry” are also always helpful.
நான் நோய்வாய்ப்பட்டவாறு உணருகிறேன் Naan nooyvaayppattavaaru unarukireen means “I feel sick.” You can ask where the closest pharmacy is by asking மருந்துக் கடை அருகில் எங்கு உள்ளது? Maruntuk katai arukil enku ullatu?If you want to drink a toast to a friend, you could say நல் ஆரோக்கியம் பெருக Nal aarokkiyam peruga, which loosely means “I hope your good health accumulates!”
If things get too complicated, you might want to learn புரியவில்லை Puriyavilai (m) or புரியல Purila (f), “I don’t understand”. மெதுவாக பேசுங்கள் Medhuvaaga pesungal (m) or மெதுவா பேசுங்க Medhuvaa pesunga (f) means, “Please speak more slowly.” You can also ask அதை ____ தமிழில் எப்படி சொல்லுவீர்கள்? Adhai ____ thamizhil eppadi solluveergal? “How do you say ____ in Tamil?”
காப்பாத்துங்க! Kaappathunga means “Help!”

, Many universities, especially those that include a focus on South Asian Studies, offer classes in Tamil. These may be open to the community. If you live in an area with a lot of South Asian and Indian people, chances are that there are probably community language classes available.

, Read online blogs and newspapers to help you learn the most common vocabulary in Tamil. Children's books are also an excellent place to start, as they're geared toward an audience who is still learning the language and often use pictures and other education aids.


The Tamil Nadu government Department of Education maintains a website with several free textbooks for download; these are used in elementary school through high school in Tamil Nadu public schools.
TamilCube also has a large collection of stories in Tamil available for free., Find YouTube videos, movies in Tamil, popular music and songs, and listen to as much spoken Tamil as you can. It's even better if you can practice with a friend who speaks the language.


Omniglot has some samples of recorded Tamil text.Spoken Tamil's website also includes a lot of lessons and audio recordings.

, Make friends with someone who speaks Tamil and ask them to talk with you. You can ask them to teach you words and check your dictionary against them. They can even teach you grammar and culture!

, Although movies in Tamil are not as abundant as movies in Hindu (the product of the Indian film industry known as “Bollywood”), there are still plenty of movies available! Check out Netflix, YouTube, and your local video store.


No matter what your taste, there’s probably a Tamil film to satisfy it: Poriyaalan is an action thriller, Appuchi Gramam is a sci-fi disaster epic, Burma is a comedy-noir about car heists, and Thegidi is a romance., Ideally, you can find a local group on the internet or a local message board. If there isn’t a Tamil group in your area, set one up! A conversation group will help you meet others who are interested in studying Tamil and learning more about the culture.


Meetup.com is a common place to set up and find language groups, but you can also contact your local university or college, as they may have more resources.

, In larger cities, there are often Tamil cultural centers established to serve the local Tamil population. However, even in smaller towns there are often Indian cultural centers and events, so you might still be able to find someone who knows Tamil and is willing to share their knowledge with you. You’ll also learn a lot about their culture and customs., Once you’ve mastered the basics of Tamil, explore the world! Tamil is spoken widely in India, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Malaysia, as well as within substantial immigrant groups in Canada, Germany, South Africa, and Indonesia. நல்ல அதிர்ஷ்டம் Nalla atirstam-- Good luck!

Learn how to pronounce ""félicitations"" correctly.,
Congratulate someone for an event or success by adding ""pour."",
Congratulate someone on doing something by adding ""pour + avoir/être.""'",How to Say Congratulations in French1," You can use ""félicitations"" the same way in French as you do in English, by simply saying it after you hear good news.


""I won the game!"" He said. ""Congratulations!"" I replied.

""J'ai gagné le match!"" Il a dit. ""Félicitations!"" J'ai répondu.;
, Félicitations is pronounced as follows: feh-lees-ee-ta-see-on. In French, the last letter of a word is rarely pronounced, so you don't hear the ""s"" when you say it. Remember, also, that ""i"" has a long E sound in French, like in the English word ""see.""End the word on a nasally ""on"" sound.


Alternate pronunciation guide: Felleecy-Taseeyon

Listening to a native French speaker may help you learn the pronunciation.

, To congratulate someone on something like their upcoming wedding, use ""félicitations pour.""' This is the equivalent of ""Congratulations on ____.""For example:


""Congratulations on the wedding!"" → ""Félicitations pour votre mariage!""

""Congratulations on the promotion!"" → ""Félicitations pour ton avancement!""


, If you want to congratulate someone on an action, such as winning a game, you need to add the verb avoir or être. Which one you add depends on if the verb is transitive (avoir) or intransitive (être).A complete list of intransitive verbs can be found here, while any verbs not on this list utilize avoir. The past tense of the acting verb (""to win,"" for example) comes next.


""Congratulations on winning the game!"" → ""Félicitations pour avoir gagné le match""
""Congratulations on arriving safely!"" → ""Félicitations pour être arrivé sain et sauf.""

When in doubt, remember when you use passé compose to conjugate a verb. If the verb uses ""être"" in the passé compose, you use it here as well.
Intransitive verbs are verbs, in general, related to motion.

Learn other phrases to tailor your congratulations for specific compliments.,
Use the verb form, ""to congratulate"" just like you would in English.,
Use slang or idiomatic expressions instead of a formal congratulations.",How to Say Congratulations in French2," While ""félicitations"" works in a wide variety of situations, you may want something more specific occasionally.[[Image:Say Congratulations in French Step 3.jpg}}


""Good work/job"" → ""Bon travail!""

""Great success/Good Luck"" (used interchangeably) → ""Bonne réuissite.""Give my compliments to ____"" → ""Addressez tous mes compliments à ____""

, This is the same as saying ""She congratulates you."" Luckily, the translation is not too difficult. ""Félicitations"" means congratulations, and ""féliciter"" means ""to congratulate."" Remember that, in French, the subject of the person you congratulate must come before the verb, unlike in English. Thus:


""I want to congratulate you."" → ""Je veux vous féliciter.""
""The President congratulates him."" → ""Le Président le félicite.""
Add ""pour"" to make specific congratulations: ""They congratulate you on the win"" &rarr: ""Ils vous félicitent pour le victoire."", Just like in English, you can use some slang terms to tell someone you're proud of them. This gives you variety, instead of always saying ""félicitations.""


""Bravo!"" much like in English, expresses awe at a job well done.
""Chapeau,"" which translates to ""hat"" in English, is used in place of ""hats off to you."" It may, however, seem a little old-fashioned."

Say: ""Je suis désolé."" This means simply, ""I'm sorry,"" and can be combined with non-verbal gestures to communicate a lack of understanding. This is pronounced: ""juh swee day-zo-lay.""
If you're feeling ambitious (and polite), you can combine this with the previous step, saying ""Je suis désolé, je ne parle pas francais."" This is pronounced: ""juh swee day-zo-lay, juh nay pahrl pah frahn-say."" This means, ""I'm sorry, I don't speak French."";
, This means, ""I do not understand."" It is pronounced ""Juh nay comprahnd pah."" This is less preferable to saying ""Je ne parle pas français,"" because the French person might misunderstand what you mean and try to explain what they said by speaking more French! However, if you can't remember ""Je ne parle pas français,"" ""Je ne comprend pas"" is better than nothing.

, If you let the person know what language you do speak, they will know you don't speak French, and you may be able to communicate if the other person in another language. Say ""Parlez-vous..."" (pronounced ""parlay-voo"" This means, ""Do you speak....""Here are the French words for some other languages:

Shrug your shoulders.,
Use your face.,
Gesture with your hands.","How to Say ""I Don't Speak French"" in French2"," If someone tries to speak French to you and you can't remember any of the phrases above, you may need to communicate your inability to undersand non-verbally. Shrugging your shoulders is a near universal gesture for indicating a lack of knowledge or understanding.Shrugging your shoulders can also have a connotation of apology, indicating regret for your inability to understand.

, In addition to shrugging, you can make a confused face to show a lack of understanding. Asymmetrical facial expressions are often understood as a sign of confusion.For example, raising one eyebrow while lowering the other is often interpreted as a sign of confusion.

, Turn your palms up while raising your hands from your sides also indicates uncertainty or confusion.Just don't get too enthusiastic with your gestures. You don't want to appear aggressive or be rude.

Say ""Je ne sais pas."",
Understand the function of each word in the phrase ""je ne sais pas."",
Use ""Je ne sais pas"" in a sentence.","How to Say ""I Don't Know"" in French1"," This translates directly to ""I don't know "". Pronounce it as ""juh-nuh-say-pah"" or ""shu-nu-say-pah"". To pronounce the ""je"" like ""shu"", shape your mouth like you are beginning to ""shush"" someone, but carry on the ""sh"" sound by following with a sound almost halfway between ""uh"" and ""ooo"". This should sound something like ""eu"". The ""ne"" is similar: just replace the ""sh"" with a ""n"" sound.


Note: in modern spoken French, the ""je"" and ""ne"" (""I"" and ""don't"") often glide together, so you may sound more authentic if you slur your syllables—as in, ""jeun-say-pah,"" or even ""shay-pah"".If you want to be especially polite, say, ""I don't know, sorry."" In French, that's ""Je ne sais pas, deslolée."" Pronounce ""desolée"" as ""dez-oh-lay"".
Bear in mind that the negating ""ne"" is always used in written French, but is often dropped in informal spoken French. One might say to a friend, for instance, ""Je sais pas,"" and mean something like ""I dunno."";
, ""Je,"" ne,"" ""sais,"" and ""pas"":


""Je"" is the first person subject, or ""I"".
""Sais"" is the first person conjugation of ""savoir"", a verb which translates as ""to know something"". Always put the ""ne"" before the verbal tense and the ""pas"" after it.
""Pas"" loosely translates as ""not"".
""Ne"" doesn't really mean anything, and is more a formality of grammar that accompanies ""pas"". This is why a person speaking informally can omit the ""ne"" and simply say ""Je sais pas.""

, Add the specific thing that you don't know to the end of the phrase—this can be a piece of information, or it can be a certain thing with which you are not familiar. Review the following examples:


""Je ne sais pas parler français"" means ""I don't know how to speak French.""
""Je ne sais pas la réponse"" means ""I don't know the answer.""
""Je ne sais pas nager"" means ""I don't know how to swim.""
""Je ne sais quoi faire"" means ""I don't know what to do."" The ""pas"" is unnecessary in this example because the verb savoir is being used with a question word.

"
Say ""Je ne comprends pas."",
Say ""Je ne parle pas (le) français."",
Say ""Parlez-vous anglais?"",
Say ""Je ne connais pas cette personne/place."",
Say ""Je ne sais quoi.""","How to Say ""I Don't Know"" in French2"," This means ""I don't understand."" Pronounce it ""juh-nuh com-prond pah"". This is a good phrase to use if you are trying to hold a conversation with someone in French, but you simply don't know how to translate something that they just said. If you say it politely, odds are your conversation partner will be understanding.

, This translates to ""I don't speak French.""Pronounce it ""juh-nuh pahl-pah frahn-say"". This is a good way to politely inform people that you aren't equipped to hold a conversation in French. If you want to try to start a conversation with someone, however, you might just say ""Je ne parle qu'un peu le français,""—""I only speak a little French."" Pronounce it ""juh-nuh pahl koon pay-oo le frahn-say"".If someone stops you on the Paris metro and starts speaking aggressively to you in frenzied French, you might be able to turn them away by looking confused and saying ""Je ne parle pas français.""

, This directly translates to ""Do you speak English?"" Pronounce it ""Par-lay-voo ahn-glay?""If you are learning French and you are still a beginner, you may come to a point at which communicated efficiently is a matter of safety or great convenience. Depending on where you are, you may or may not find someone who speaks fluent English—but this is still an important phrase to have in your arsenal.

, This means ""I don't know this/that person/place."" Pronounce it ""Juh-nuh-conn-eye pah."" ""Personne (pronounced ""pair-sohn) means ""person"". ""Place"" (pronounced ""plahss"") means, quite literally, ""place"".Add a specific person or place name to the end of the phrase to make it more specific. For example: ""Je ne connais pas Guillaume,"" or ""Je ne connais pas Avignon.""

, This is an expression that means ""I don't know what."" Je ne sais quoi is an indefinable, elusive quality, usually positive and often descriptive of someone's personality. The phrase is often colloquially interjected into English speech. For instance: ""The actress had a certain je ne sais quoi that immediately charmed everyone she met.""

It is pronounced ""co-pahn,"" where the ""n"" is almost silent. It sounds like the famous classical composer Frédéric Chopin.


You can put the word ""petit"" (""peh-teet"") before copain to make it slightly more endearing.;
, While this translates literally as ""little friend,"" it is commonly used to refer to your boyfriend in French. It is pronounced ""peh-teet ah-me."" If it helps, remember that ""petit"" rhymes with the English ""repeat"" and ""ami"" rhymes (though only slightly) with the English name ""Tommy.""The words are often said closely together so that they sound like one word.
You do pronounce the ""t"" at the end of ""petit,"" because the next word starts with a vowel.

, In general, the phrase ""mon cheri"" is a very affectionate, usually private term used for your boyfriend. It is pronounced ""sherr-EE,"" much like the English drink ""sherry."" Note how your voice, however, should rise slightly on the last ""ee"" syllable., There are several other terms for your man that can be swapped around in informal context. Most of the following are not so familiar that they would gross out your friends, but not so loose that you should be using them all the time and in public:



Mec: Pronounced ""meck,"" this translates best to ""guy"" or ""bloke."" ""Mon mec"" is used for boyfriends, as in ""my guy.""

Jules: Pronounced ""jool."" Another slang term for a guy or boyfriend.

Flirt: Pronounced similarly to English. While it means ""flirting"" directly, it can also be used colloquially for a boyfriend.

Amoureux: Pronounced ""am-or-euh."" Used in a variety of contexts, all generally colloquial. When used as an adjective, it means ""loving"" or ""romantic."", Quebecois French has evolved over the years in North America.

The slang term for a girlfriend is not, ""une chume,"" but rather ""une blonde."""

Search online to hear each letter as it is pronounced., Open your mouth wide to pronounce the first letter. This is similar to a ""soft A"" in English.

, This is a soft sound, like saying ""Hey"" in English. Think of the first syllable in the word ""baby.""

, The is the first letter that varies strongly from the English equivalent. You can also soften the ""ay"" sound to be more like an ""e,"" pronouncing it ""Cey,"" like the first sound in the word ""saving.""

, Similar to B, C and, later on, V and T. All of these letters use the soft ""eh"" sound preceded by the letter in question.

, The same sound is used in French as English. L, M, N, O, and S are also pronounced like their English counterparts.

, The beginning is a soft A sound, like ""ahhhh,"" followed by the ""sh."" It is similar to the sound of the slang word ""gosh.""

, I is pronounced like the E in ""see"" or ""be.""

, This is another easy one.

, These are simple and easy. They sound just like the English version &rarr: ""el,"" ""em,"" ""en,"" and ""oh.""

, It is as simple as the English word for making some money.

, A simple ""err"" will suffice. It is similar to the first syllable of the English word ""error.""

, The S is the same sound in both languages.

, A simple pronunciation, similar to B and D. Rhymes with ""say.""

, Again, this is a simple pronunciation. Rhymes with ""day.""

, This translates literally to ""double V."" Just like in English, W is essentially pronounced like 2 separate words -- ""Doob-leh"" and ""veh.""


The word ""double,"" in French, sounds a bit like ""dooblay.""

Learn to pronounce the special characters.,
Review the pronunciation of the entire alphabet.",How to Pronounce the Letters of the French Alphabet2," This is a very guttural sound, almost like you think something is gross or disgusting. Think of the vowel sign in the word ""took,"" as in, ""she took my example.""

, Think of it as saying ""jeh,"" but elongating the j slightly so that is sounds more like an ""sh"" sound. Think of the G sounds in ""George.""


The pronunciation rhymes with the English name ""Shea.""

, This is just like the pronunciation of G, but with an E sound instead of an A.

, A good trick for saying U is to start saying a hard E sound, like ""eeee,"" then move move your lips forward as if you were saying ""You."" This somewhat ""compound"" sound is tricky, and easiest to learn by listening to native speakers. It is very similar to an exagerated sound of disgust in English, ""ewwwww,"" but it starts with a very pronounced E sound.


Your tongue and mouth are situated like an ""eee"" sound.
Your lips are rounded in an ""O"" shape., It is similar to the English version, but you slightly de-emphasize the y sound in the middle. It is similar to the French pronunciation of U.

, The oddest pronunciation in the alphabet, Y has two sounds: ""ee-greck."" The second part sounds a bit like ""gekko"" with an R and no O.


You do not, however, want to pause between ""ee"" and ""greck."" Think of it as a two syllable word.

, When adding accents to letters, such as when spelling something for someone, you usually add the inflection or mark after the letters. So, for ""è"" you would say ""e, accent à grave,"" (or, phonetically, ""eh, ak-cent ah grav""). The accents are pronounced:


A right pointing dash (`) is an ""accent à grave."" Pronounce ""ah-grav.""
A left-pointing dash (such as in é), is an ""accent aigu."" Pronounce ""ah-goo.""
A point up (^) is known as a ""circumflex."" It is pronounced just like it looks.

Maintain your new language skills.",How to Read French," If you are completely new to French, then you will need to start at the beginning -- as you did with your native language. Learn how to read simple vocabulary, such as pronouns, colors, days of the week and numbers.Pronouns are especially important because they will determine how you conjugate verbs. In French, first person pronouns are je (for ""I"") and nous (for ""we""). Second person words for ""you,"" are tu and vous. Third person pronouns are il, elle, on, ils, elles (he, she, it, they).Find children's books and elementary school textbooks and worksheets in order to help you. This might feel somewhat clunky and awkward, but it will help you lay a strong foundation for more advanced reading.
Charles Perrault's Fairy Tales will be a good text to start with; you are most likely already familiar with the content of the stories in your native language, so you will already have a point of reference to guide you through the language.;
, While you may plan to primarily read in French, as opposed to speaking it conversationally, you should have an understanding of the verbal rhythms of the language. Here are some important pronunciations to learn as you read French aloud:Pronounce “e” as though you would pronounce the “a” in “about.”
Change the “e” with a forward accent to “ay,” as in “pay.”
Change the “e” with a backwards accent or an umlaut to “eh,” like when you say “set.”
Pronounce “a,” with or without an accent” like the “a” in “father.”
Pronounce “ou” as the “ooo” in “food.”
Pronounce “au,” “o” and “eau” as the “oa” in “boat.”
Pronounce the “u” by placing the tongue behind the bottom of the back teeth and saying “ooo” as in “food.”
Pronounce “y” as “ee,” as in “seed.”, Conjugations of active verbs in French are a little more complicated than in English. Just try to get a sense of the general patterns of conjugations for each pronoun. Many verbs in French end in -er, -ir, and -re letters.


Conjugating -ER verbs. For words that end in ER, here is how you would conjugate them according to their pronoun. Ex: parler (to speak). Je parle, Tu parles, Il/Elle parle, Nous parlons, Vous parlez, Ils/elles parlent.Conjugating -IR verbs. Example: finir (to finish). Je finis, Tu finis, Il/Elle finit, Nous finissons, Vous finissez, Ils/Elles finissent.Conjugating -RE verbs. Example: entendre (to hear). J'entends, Tu entends, Il/Elle entend, Nous entendons, Vous entendez, Ils/Elles entendent., The dictionary will help you not only learn more vocabulary words, but it will also give you a guide for conjugating verbs and constructing simple sentences. A short dictionary is fine for basic vocabulary, but if you want to read the classics, you will want a more thorough dictionary. The Oxford-Hachette French dictionary is considered a standard reference text.Although you will find a dictionary to be a critical tool in helping you learn French, you should try to read for your own, independent comprehension. Before you look a word up in the dictionary, try to see if you can understand the general meaning of a sentence from contextual clues, such as helpful images that describe the sentence (as in children's books).

, You might find children's books to be too boring or silly to capture your sustained interest. Research has shown that comic books are a successful text for learning a new language, especially if you are an adult learner.With their use of visual illustrations, comic books provide a wealth of contextual clues as you are reading. Even if you cannot understand all of the written text, you will have a great chance of understanding its meaning through the pictures.
Comic books also feature mostly dialogue in their text so you will also gain a sense of how to use French conversationally.
Comic books have also been shown to increase a reader's vocabulary in the new language even if readers are not attempting to study the language as a whole., If you are balancing the demands of work and home life in addition to trying to learn a new language in your free time, an app can fit into your busy schedule. Many students have reported that language learning apps have helped them adopt a new language.Studies have also shown that using an app gives learners a greater sense of control and autonomy over their new language.Some popular apps for learning include Duolingo, Keewords, and BBC Languages. These apps don't simply translate words for you; they can also let you play games, use flash cards, take quizzes, and watch videos in order to test your language skills., Once you have mastered the basics of French, try to incorporate it into your daily life. There are many high-quality podcasts that you can listen to that will help you learn French on your daily commute or while you exercise.


Try listening to French music while you cook or when you are driving. Singing along with the words will help you get accustomed to the language, even if you don't know the full meaning of the words.

, One of the best ways to learn to read French is write it yourself. You will get a better sense of how sentences are constructed and how to interpret meaning from the language.


Keep a daily journal with simple French sayings in it; you can come up with them yourself, or copy them from famous French writers and thinkers.
Use you dictionary to help you as you write. Be sure to include new words into each sentence.
Keeping a diary with also let you see your own progress and give you a greater sense of control over your learning process., Newspapers will be a great place to start; you will probably be able to understand the more simplistic headlines and then use them to guide your understanding of the articles.


Popular newspapers in France include L'Express, L'Obs, and the satirical Le Canard enchaîné.
You should look for blogs that will use recognizable vocabulary, such as cooking blogs. You will be able to easily recognize the general format of the recipes and will be able to focus more on learning the grammatical construction of the sentences.

, Watching French films will help you get a sense of the conversational rhythms of the language.Try watching the same film twice: the first time with subtitles, the second time without them. This way, you will know the general plot and content of the film and will be able to translate the French words into your native language.
You should also try watching the film with the French subtitles on. This will allow you to pair the written words with their spoken counterparts.You can find a list of the 100 best French films at Time Out Paris online.

, If you are comfortable reading newspaper articles and blog posts, you might be able to enroll in an intermediate (200 or 300 level) class. The class will ensure that you will continue to practice your French on a daily basis.


The class will also give you a community of French speakers so you can practice your language more conversationally.
If you cannot afford to take a local class, try to find a group of French speakers. If you live in a large city, there might be a French Consulate office that you can check for meetings and events.

, One of the most advanced forms of reading you can complete is to read full novels in French. You might be familiar with some of the most famous 19th century novels, like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but you might be more comfortable with more contemporary novelists, like Muriel Barbary and Laure Alcoba.Try to read the full novel without using the dictionary. But as you read, write down any words you don't know in a notebook. After you have finished the novel, you can go back and look up with words that you didn't understand., Some of the best texts in modern philosophy have originated in France, from Jacques Rousseau to Jean-Paul Sartre. If you truly want to test your comprehension of the language, try comprehending abstract ideas on the self and society from French philosophy.


Voltaire was a French philosopher who's fairly easy to read. His famous satirical novel Candide is often taught in beginning ""French for reading knowledge"" classes.

, If it is in your budget, take a trip to France to practice your language skills. Nothing can compare to the experience of being immersed in a language.


You can research French-immersion programs for adults; many are designed specifically for non-native speakers who are planning an extended trip abroad.
If you do not wish to go to France, you can also look at other French-speaking countries and places such as Belgium, the Seychelles, or the province of Montreal in Canada.

, Being a multi-lingual speaker can have significant benefits for your longterm cognitive skills. Studies have shown that students who speak multiple languages tend to score better on standardized tests and also have a better abilities to memorize lists and sequences.Other research has shown that learning other languages could delay the development of degenerative neurological conditions, like Alzheimer's. In one study, participants who knew multiple languages developed Alzheimer's four years after patients who spoke only one language."
"
Say ""lay."",
Say ""me."",
Say ""zeh."",
Say ""rhab"" with an airy r sound at the top of the mouth.,
Say a soft ""bluh."",
Put it all together!,
Don't pronounce the s at the end of either word.,
Don't use a standard English r sound.,
Don't pronounce the ending ""bleh"" very heavily.",How to Pronounce Les Miserables1," In this section, you'll see how to pronounce every syllable of ""Les Miserables"" like a true French person. Start by saying the English word ""lay"", which is very close to the pronunciation of the French word ""les."" Congratulations — you've already mastered one word!


If you want to be extra-accurate, try to pronounce ""lay"" a little ""breathier"" than you normally would as an English speaker; almost as if it's a puff of air. French is a very ""breathy,"" nasal language.Listening to a native French speaker can help you imitate this quality.;
, In French, the i can be pronounced with a long e sound, so the first syllable of ""miserables"" will sound very much like the English word ""me.""


Again, keep your pronunciation short and ""airy"" here.

, The second syllable of ""miserables"" is pronounced similarly to how it would be in English. You want to use a soft s or z sound (as in the word ""zero"") and follow it with a short e sound (as in the word ""bed""). This shouldn't be too difficult.

, The r sound in French can be difficult for non-native speakers to master — if English is your first language, this will probably be the hardest syllable. Forget about changing the standard English r sound into French. You want to make an entirely new sound here. See below for practice instructions:


After saying ""zeh"" (the previous syllable), let air keep flowing through your throat.
Without stopping, move the middle-back part of your tongue to the top of your mouth. Let the flow of air get narrow, but don't block it completely.
Move your tongue back down. The sound you made should have sounded like a light, ""airy"" combination between English r and h sounds.
After the r, the rest of the syllable is easy. Use the short o sound (like in the English name ""Rob""), then end with a b.

, The final part of the word isn't as hard as dealing with the r, but it can still be a challenge. You want to sound out the syllable ""bluh,"" but, as before, very briefly and lightly. You can also let your lips ""bounce"" off of each other a little here, giving the sound a ""jowelly"" quality (almost like the way Droopy the famous cartoon dog talks). It takes some getting used to, but once you get it, it's not impossible, even for someone who's never spoken anything but English.


Note that, as with ""Les,"" the final s in ""Miserables"" is not pronounced.

, Congratulations — you've just made your way through all of ""Les Miserables"" (the title, not the 530,000 word novel).Now, all that remains is to practice stringing the syllables above together until you get it perfect!


Listening to a native French speaker can really help here. Luckily, there are many pronunciation clips available online. For instance, PronounceItRight.com has an excellent one., When anglophones (the French term for ""English speakers"") try to say ""Les Miserables,"" they usually make one of a few mistakes. Knowing these ahead of time can be a big help. For example, it's important to note that you should not pronounce the s at the end of either ""Les"" or ""Miserables."" It's ""lay meezerhabluh,"" not ""lez meezerhabluhs."" This is a ""rookie mistake"" for new French speakers, so don't give yourself away by falling for this easy slip-up.


In French, an s at the end of a word is silent if the letter before it is a consonant or an e without an accent.This means that there are other French words (like ""vis"") where you will pronounce the s at the end, so don't get too caught up on this rule.

, The French r sound is discussed above, but this bears repeating: don't use the ""hard"" English r sound for ""miserables."" This sound doesn't exist in French, so putting it in ""Les Miserables"" will immediately out you as a non-French speaker.


If you need more help with the French r sound, don't worry — it's usually the thing that English speakers have the most trouble with, so there are lots of help materials online. For example, try this French pronunciation guide. The r sound examples are about halfway down the page.

, This mistake is a little subtler than the ones above, but it's still something to look out for. French words have lots of endings that sound strange to English speakers. In ""Les Miserables,"" the final ""bluh"" syllable sounds like something should come after it to an English ear because in English words almost never end with ""bluh."" This can lead English speakers to emphasize the ""bluh"" a little too much when it should remain light and airy. Remember, you want it to sound like a jowelly puff of air — not like Dracula.


Another good example is the French word ""chèvre"" (""goat""). It's tempting to pronounce it ""shever"" because in English words end with an ""errr"" sound, not a light ""ruh"" sound. In fact, the correct pronunciation is the latter one: ""shevruh.""

"
Say ""lay."",
Say ""mizz."",
Say ""er."",
Say ""obb."",
Put it all together!",How to Pronounce Les Miserables2," If you don't care about sounding like a real French speaker and you just want to be able to describe the book and musical in English without embarrassing yourself, your job is much easier. The first step is the same for this alternate pronunciation: just say ""lay.""

, This sounds like the word ""miss,"" only with a soft s sound. The syllable should rhyme with the word ""whizz."" You can omit the long e sound you'd normally use in French here.

, This syllable should rhyme with ""whirr"" or ""burr"". Feel free to use the standard English ""hard r"" sound here.

, The last syllable should rhyme with ""blob"" or ""mob."" Don't bother with the ""les"" at the end this time — at this point, you've already established that you're not a native French speaker, so trying to add it back in won't help.

, That's all you need to pronounce ""Les Miserables"" in the anglicized way. Simply string the syllables above together and sound them out: ""lay mizzerrobb."" Unless you're actually trying to speak proper French, there's no need to be ashamed of this anglicized pronunciation, as it's the way most English speakers choose to say the words.


Even with this easier pronunciation in wide use, some English speakers still use different pronunciations of ""Les Miserables."" See this video for a humorous rundown of the ways that Americans, British people, and actual French speakers pronounce the word.

Let's get physical: Make vocabulary, study/quiz cards, word and phrase cards, out of slips of paper or cards and study as you walk around in a grocery store, mall or on campus.,
Make a copy of your notes and white-out key words to test yourself by filling-in the blank.Reuse your self-made test by placing it in a clear sheet protector then writing on the plastic with an erasable marker to fill-in the blank.,
Make a written list with two or three columns with the (1) English, (2) French wording and (3) its pronunciation.

,
Start by writing out a few two or three column lessons, and say the present year as, ""It is the year...""


If the year ends in an ""0"", say ""C'est l'an"" (sey lon)
If the year doesn't end in an ""0"", say ""C'est l'année"" (sey lahnee)

,
Pronounce past years 1100s - 1990s: Say ""This was the year..."" For past years, you can say ""Ce fut l'année"" (sey few lahnee), perhaps 1995, but there is a second equally valid option.,
Use ""mille"" (or ""mil"") which means ""thousand"" -- as you would ""cent"" meaning ""hundred"".,
Say the entire sentence in present tense, including: ""It is the year"":


""It is the year two thousand thirteen"" just say ""C'est l'année deux mille treize"" (Sey lahnee der mil trez).,
Say the entire sentence for past years, including: ""This was the year"":


""This was the year nineteen ninety-five"", say ""Ce fut l'année: dix-neuf quatre-vingt quinze"" (sey few lahnee: dee-s nerf catruh vahn carns).

Do lessons online for pronouncing years and such. For example, you might try searching online for others such as this at French.About.com/od/grammar/a/years.htm;
, Erase it off the plastic, and do it again.

,,,


(1) Pronounce 1995 like a regular number.
1995 = Dix-neuf quatre-vingt quinze (dee-s nerf catruh van carns). Literally ""nineteen ninety-five."" Or,
(2) Use the centaines vigésimales (or vicésimales) counting system: and so break the year into two parts, both as two-digit numbers (a) the century and (b) the year, and place the word ""cent"" between the pair; so for 1999 say ""dix-neuf cent quatre-vingt-dix-neuf"".

, You can then use different numbers with them to create different years. State the year:


2013 = Deux mille treize (der mil trez). Which is literally ""Two thousand thirteen.""
660 = Six cent soixante (cease sohn swassont). Which is literally ""Six hundred sixty.""

,
""It is the year six hundred"" just say ""C'est l'an six cent"" (Sey lon cease sohn).

Check your enunciation, and clarity of pronunciation of the years.",How to Pronounce the Years in French2," But Google has a bug so that ""nineteen ninety-five"" will be returned by Google such as only the four numerals ""1995"", not spelled-out in words?! , So, the number is spelled out by Google,""nineteen and ninety-five"" returns ""Dix-neuf et quatre-vingt quinze"" .
So then you can just leave out the ""et"" (""and""), in the French numbers. Odd trick, but it is necessary, unless Google fixes that bug., Repeat after it in your mind some -- and also in your audible voicing, and pay attention to how you sound.

,



Try facing very closely into/an inside corner (stand with you face about 4 inches away from the inside of a corner) to hear your voicing, pronunciation very clearly.

Cup a hand behind an ear to hear yourself much more clearly than ordinary speech.

Record you voicing while practicing, and compare it to the audio lesson. Play it back again to check it over and over, if practical.

Ask fluent French speakers perhaps at a French restaurant to tell you and show you how they pronounce years.

Ask for help.",How to Pronounce French Words," Most vowels in French are considered ""pure"" vowels. In other words, you need to pronounce each vowel exactly as it is instead of adding extra sounds at the end and turning them into diphthongs (one syllable with two distinct sounds).For instance, in American English, you'd typically add an extra yuh sound at the end of ""a"" and ""e,"" or an extra wuh sound at the end of ""o"" and ""u."" You should not apply these extra sounds when pronouncing French vowels.
Also note that you should pronounce vowels in an elongated manner when they are part of a final closed syllable (an ending syllable in which a consonant follows the vowel).
Pure French vowels are pronounced as follows:

a, à, â: ah

a, â: ah, stretched longer
e: uh

e, è, ê, ai, ei, ais: eh

œu, eu: eh, rounded
é, et: ay

eu: ay, rounded
i, y: ee

u: ee, rounded
ou: oo

o, ô: oh

o: aw


;
, Some vowel combinations aren't pure vowels, so when you pronounce them, you'll need to glide through the sound as though it were a diphthong.


The French semi-vowels and their pronunciations are:

oi, ou: w

ui: ew-ee

ill, y: yuh




, To pronounce a nasal vowel, you'll need to lower the soft palate of your mouth so that air passes out from both the nose and mouth while you speak.


Since English has no distinct nasal vowels, learning to pronounce French nasal vowels may require some practice.
Note that nasal vowels typically appear as combinations of vowels with certain consonants.
The following is a guideline to nasal vowel pronunciation:

en, em, an, am, aon, aen: awn

in, im, yn, ym, ain, aim, ein, eim, un, um, en, eng, oin, oing, oint, ien, yen, éen: ahn

un: uhn

on, om: ohn




, Most French consonants are similar to English consonants, but the placement of your tongue should vary in several instances.


The letters ""p,"" ""t,"" and ""k"" should be pronounced with a hard edge. In American English, you'd usually follow these letters with a small exhale, but you should omit that exhale when speaking French.
Whenever you would expect to pronounce a consonant by placing the tongue against the upper ridge of your hard palate, reposition the tongue so that it rests just behind your teeth. You'll need to do this for the vowels ""t,"" ""d,"" ""s,"" ""z,"" ""l,"" and ""n.""
Similarly, you'll need to reposition your tongue further back into the mouth when pronouncing the French ""r."" This makes the letter sound more guttural.
Pronounce the French letter ""c"" with the English k sound, but use the English s sound to pronounce the French ""ç.""The French ""g"" should have a hard g sound when placed before ""a,"" ""o,"" or ""u."" When placed before ""e"" or ""i,"" or when placed at the end of the word, ""g"" should have a softer j sound.
The letter ""h"" is typically silent.
The ""q"" or ""qu"" consonant should sound harder, making it closer to the English k than the English qu.

, In most instances, the letters ""d,"" ""s,"" ""t"", and ""x"" are not pronounced at all when they are placed at the end of a word.Most of the other consonants should be pronounced when they land at the end of the word, but you should vocalize them less, making them seem nearly silent.
The letters ""c,"" ""f,"" ""l,"" and ""r"" should be silent when placed at the ends of some words, like ""blanc"" or ""gentil,"" but you'll need to vocalize them at the end of other words, like ""avec"" and ""civil.""
You should not pronounce the final ""e"" of most French words. As such, when switching from masculine to feminine adjectives and nouns, you'll usually need to make the final consonant harder when using the feminine version. For instance, the masculine ""grand"" should have a nearly silent ""d,"" but the feminine ""grande"" should have a hard ""d"" and a silent ""e.""

, Liaison can be a difficult concept to grasp since it doesn't occur in English. The boundary between two words often blends together in French, causing the final consonant of one word to link itself to the beginning of the following word. This phenomenon is referred to as ""liaison.""


The sound of some consonants will change as a result of liaison. More specifically, ""d"" will sound like t, ""s"" will sound like z, and ""x"" will sound like z. The letter ""p"" is also used in liaison, but you don't need to change its sound.

, In English, only one syllable of each word receives stress, causing the vowels of the remaining syllables to reduce in volume and formation. This isn't true of French, however.


When speaking French, each syllable must receive equal amounts of stress, which means that all vowels should be pronounced in full formation.

, Differences between English and French intonation can be somewhat subtle, so this is another guideline you may need to consciously practice before you can master it.


In English, the stressed syllable has the highest pitch, and any other syllable within the word or sentence drops. In French, the intonation is always highest at the beginning of the sentence, and it gradually drops throughout the remaining syllables.
In English, the intonation rises near or at the end of any question. In French, the intonation only rises at the end of a ""yes/no"" question.

, Greeting someone will be the first thing you need to do when you meet someone who speaks French, and offering a polite farewell will be the last thing you do when you end the conversation.Hello

Create a detailed schedule to stick to.",How to Learn Several Languages at a Time1," While it may seem helpful to learn two similar languages at once, such as Spanish and Italian, this can actually result in a lot of confusion. If you have a choice in which languages you learn, choose languages that are different from one another to avoid blending them into one combined language in your mind, or mixing up words or grammar.


If you are studying similar languages, avoid studying them in the same study session—separate them by studying them on different days or even on alternating weeks.;
, If you have a choice, choose to learn one language that is easier for you, and another or others that are more difficult. An easier language will be one that is similar to your native language or another language that you know, while a more difficult language will be one that is less similar.For English speakers, romance languages such as Spanish, Italian, and French tend to be easier to learn.Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and Korean are some of the most difficult languages for native English speakers to learn, due to different sentence structures and different character sets., It is helpful to prioritize one of the languages, giving it the most time and attention. This way, at the end of your hard work, you are more likely to be skilled in at least one of your languages, rather than only knowing a small amount of each of them.


Consider making the language that is the most difficult your priority language. You can also prioritize the language that you are most eager to learn, or the one that has the most urgent time crunch.

, Time management is very important when you are learning several languages. Schedule how much time will be spent on each language per day or per week. When doing this, allot more time for your priority language.It is up to you how you allocate your time. The most important thing is that you adhere to the schedule you create whenever possible.

This can help you to internalize the languages on a deeper level.


Try using the easier languages as a point of reference for the more difficult ones. For example, if you are a native English speaker learning Korean and Spanish, translate your Korean words and phrases into Spanish instead of English.
For an extra challenge, try writing a passage in one language, and then translating it verbally into a different language., Write words and phrases from your different languages on flashcards and mix them together in a deck. Then, quiz yourself. This will help you to practice jumping back and forth between the various languages., Create a new personality for yourself when speaking each language. This will help you keep the languages separate in your mind. Acting on the cliches of different languages can work wonderfully for this. For example, if you are practicing French, you can imagine yourself as very romantic. Try pouting your lips and imitating French actors that you see in films.


Multilingual people often claim that their personality changes with each language that they speak. You may find this to be true for yourself as you play with different personas and learn to express things in a new way in your new language., When possible, try to focus on related content in all languages at one time. This will help your brain to make stronger associations with the words. For example, if you are learning words related to animals in one language, focus on animals in your other languages, too., Several language-learning apps, such as Duolingo and Memrise, allow you to add multiple languages at once.

Joining a local conversation group or language exchange for the languages you’re learning can be a great way to stay motivated and meet new people. You can use a website like meetup.com or your local newspaper to find a group like this. You can also join a virtual language exchange through a website like iTalki.

, Be sure to schedule time each day to practice at least one of your languages. In addition to the scheduled time, you can label items around your house in the different languages, or change the language settings on your phone and computer. Small changes like this will give you little bits of language practice even when you’re not formally studying.

, To stay motivated, it helps to have a solid reason for why you want to learn the new languages. Find something that you care about to help you get motivated to keep learning. Some ideas are to plan a trip to a country that speaks one of the languages you’re learning, or join a volunteer group for helping speakers of that language get accustomed to life in your country., Don’t forget to celebrate all of your small accomplishments! Allow yourself to take breaks as a reward, or treat yourself to a dessert that is traditional to a country that speaks a language you’re learning.

, You can't use your app for five minutes, then go off and play Doodle Jump. You can't spend two whole hours at the computer using a website. And if you decide to take classes by someone nearby, you need to practice. Decide how long you will practice your new language.


Practice at the same time every day to get into the habit of it. When you practice every day for a certain amount of days, at one point your brain says to you, ""Oh, it's time to go practice ______.""
Remember, the more you practice, the faster you'll learn the new language. And aren't there times when you feel like bragging to your friends? Being able to say "" I learned a whole new language over the summer,"" is something nice; you can even teach them a little!
Avoid practicing for less than 30 minutes.

Check out some books from the local library, but only if the vacation is short. No need for unnecessary fines.
Ask your parents if you can take the iPad along. This way, you can download apps to teach you the language.
Use a computer wherever you're staying. Wherever you go, you're sure to have a computer available, unless you're going somewhere like a photo safari in Africa. Then you'll probably be better off taking your own.

Practice.",How to Learn Any Language," This is the single most important thing you need to know when starting to learn a language. Everyone learns differently, especially when it comes to languages. You'll need to figure out if you learn best through repetition, through writing down the words or through listening to a native speaker.


Decide if you're a visual, auditive or kinesthetic learner. A trick to figuring out which you are is this: Pick a couple words from your language and read them over a few times. If you can remember them the next day you're probably a visual learner. If not, have someone else read the words to you several times without seeing them yourself. If you can remember them the next day, you're most likely an auditive learner. If this doesn't work, read and write the two words, repeat them out loud, listen to them read by someone else, associate memories and feelings with them. If you can remember them the next day, you're probably a kinesthetic learner.If you've learned languages in the past, go over what you learned then and try to figure out what worked best for you. What helped you learn? What didn't? Which parts of the process did you find easy? Which parts were hard? When you've sorted this out you'll be ready to start learning the language.





;
, Even if a language has the same alphabet as yours that does not mean the pronunciation is always the same. (Just ask a Polish person how to pronounce the letters ""cz."")


The Foreign Service Institute offers free online language learning materials, which include audio recordings which help with learning pronunciation and the Duolingo app and website offers various languages and useful pronunciation tips., This is probably the most important part of the language besides the vocabulary. ""Paul want Mary go store"" may communicate an idea, but it is not at all correct English. If you do not pay attention to grammar, you can sound equally incomprehensible in another language.


Look at the structure of the language and how the articles work (masculine, feminine, neutral). Getting a handle on the structure of the language will help you understand how it fits together once you start learning different words
Ensure you know how to express questions, affirmative and negative statements in the past, present and future using the 20 most common regular and irregular verbs.

, Within 90 days this means you will have memorized about 80% of the language. Start with the most common words. Memorization is half the battle and there are many different ways to memorize.


You can practice writing each word a dozen times, which will get you used to using the word itself.






Try using the words in various and different sentences. This will help you practice the words and make it easier to recall the words when you need them.
Don't forget to keep practicing the words once you move on to memorizing other words. If you don't practice them you will forget them.

, Especially if you're learning a language which operates on a different alphabetical system, you will need to know what the letters look like and how they operate.


Try associating images with each letter and sound, so that your brain will have an easy path to remembering the letter and the sound that accompanies it. For instance: In Thai the letter ""า"" is pronounced ""ah."" If you're a guy you can think of this as the path taken by your pee if you're urinating against a tree and the accompanying sigh you make as you relieve yourself. Associations can be as simple, or as silly as you want, as long as they help you remember.You may also have to accustom yourself to reading from right to left, or from the top of the page to the bottom. Start simple and work up to more difficult things like newspapers and books.

, Listening to the language, be it through movies or television shows, through audio language coursesor music can help you retain the words you're trying to learn. Just listening won't help, though. You will need to repeat the words and speak them yourself.


The method called ""shadowing"" is considered by many polyglots (people who know many languages) as a useful technique. Put your headphones in and go outside. While you play the language, walk briskly. As you're walking briskly repeat aloud and clearly what you're hearings. Repeat, repeat, repeat. This will help you connect kinetics (movement) with the language and to retrain your focus so that you aren't obsessing about memorization.Use audio books or audio language lessons. You can listen to these while you commute to work or while you jog around the park. This will help your listening skills. Repeat listening to short segments of 30 seconds to one minute until you feel you have complete comprehension. Sometimes you may have to listen to the course completely more than twice to fully catch all that it teaches.






Watch television shows and movies without the subtitles. This includes soap operas, news shows, even shows you already know that have been dubbed into the language. It's a fun way to practice and apply your knowledge.






Listen to music in the language you're learning. This is fun and easy and will, hopefully, keep you interested in what you're doing. Just put on some music while you're doing the dishes or going for a walk and pay attention to the words in the songs You might also want to listen to classic songs because they are easy to catch on to.







, Start off with simpler books and, as you get better, move on to more difficult ones. Challenge yourself to reading without a dictionary and let yourself puzzle the meanings out by yourself.


Children's books are a great place to start because these books are meant to teach children how to read and understand their language. Since you are just starting out, you will want to start somewhere easy.






Find books that you have enjoyed in your native language and read them in the language you are trying to learn. Your knowledge of the book's contents will help you decipher the words and keep you interested in the reading material.
Try popular magazines or newspapers in the language you wish to learn. Choose a topic that interests you. Magazines are a good way to learn common idioms in context. Magazine and newspaper articles cover a variety of subjects, and they're generally much shorter than reading an entire book.






You can purchase a quality dictionary of the language you wish to learn or you can use a free online language dictionary. When you encounter a new word, highlight it in the dictionary. Then, copy the word, definition, and an example sentence using the word into a notebook. Then, study the notebook. This activity helps you think in the language.
Sometimes a picture dictionary is helpful for learning common nouns for some languages. Use a picture dictionary for Japanese, for example, because many of their words carry a variety of meanings, as in English.

, If you don't speak the language, you are unlikely to learn it well and keep it in your memory. There are programs that link people learning a language and native speakers via Skype. If you can't do that, look around your city or town. Chances are someone will be able to direct you to a person who can help you practice. A language school is a good place to start.


Learn some idioms, proverbs and expressions. As your level advances, learn about some of the idioms and even slang in the language. Even if you don't end up using them much, they will help you recognize and understand these elements when you hear or read them.
Don't be embarrassed if you aren't speaking the language properly yet. It takes time to learn.
This step cannot be stressed enough. If you don't practice speaking the language you won't be fluent in it. Talk to native speakers, get a friend to learn the language with you and practice with them, talk back to the t.v.

, Do not hesitate to speak the language in public and with native speakers. It will be helpful in improving your mastery. Also, don't be ashamed to allow other people to correct you if you pronounce something wrong. No one knows everything. Welcome constructive criticism. Test your knowledge at every social occasion you have.


Keep watching movies and and television shows. If you are learning Spanish, for example, and if you like soccer, watch it in Spanish to keep the language fresh in your memory. Make sure to yell at the t.v. in Spanish when the game isn't going your way.
Challenge yourself to think in the language you are attempting to learn.

Fix all ER verb tenses in a scene so you can visualise it when you need to call on it from memory.,
Associate ER verbs with an image -- EAR is the perfect one!,
Choose a commonly used ER verb.,
Use the number shape system to memorise the Je, Tu, Il, Nous, Vous, Ils forms.,
Associate the nun with the Je, the shoe with the Tu and so on… Let’s look at that now:


one sounds like nun: Je suis
two sounds like shoe: Tu es
three sounds like tree:Il est
four sounds like door:Nous ons
five sounds like hive:Vous ez
six sounds like sticks:Ils ent

,
Go back to your scene.,
Try Tu –You.,
Link ""Il"" with number rhyme 3: tree.,
Number 4, door is linked with Nous.,
Five is hive and links with vous which reminds you of Pooh as in Winnie the Pooh (the bear, check Google if you are unfamiliar).,
Walk past Poo Bear and hear a cracking sound… I realise I am standing on lots of sticks (sounds like 6).,
This method is easy.",How to Memorize French ER Present Tense Verbs Using Visual Imagery Mnemonics," Your local town is a good choice, as it will have everything you need in it.;
, Example: Present tense can make you think of Christmas (presents!). So you can have your whole ER Present tense scene based around a giant Christmas tree that is on display in your local town. At the top of the Christmas tree is a giant EAR and there is lots of earwax dripping out from it! It’s all messy and sticky under that tree!When you think of present tense it will remind you of Christmas, then the tree. If it is a verb ending in ER then you will see the giant EAR at the top of it and then your associated ER verb endings.

, Try ""manger"": to eat.


Je mange ----- I eat
Tu manges ----- You eat (singular, familiar)
Il, elle, on mange ----- He, she, we eats (please note: on is a familiar term)
Nous mangeons ----- We eat (note that the 'e' is irregular, all regular ER verbs drop the 'e')
Vous mangez ----- You eat (plural, formal (unfamiliar))
Ils, elles mangent ----- They eat

, That way you have a definite order to follow and it makes it much easier to recall it later on!


one sounds like nun
two sounds like shoe
three sounds like tree
four sounds like door
five sounds like hive
six sounds like sticks

,, At the Christmas tree you see the nun standing there. But what is she doing? She is Shouting out ""Jesus!"" But she is saying it funny… ""JEsus"". The nun is shouting out the Je part loudly but the sus softly! Incorporate the “e�? of the ending of mange (French part of ""I"" eat) into our nun image. Imagine a large Snail coming up to the nun and starts shouting out Je too! The idea of the snail as an “e�? is because the shell of the snail reminds some of an “e�? with the pattern of it.

, The number rhyme is Two Shoe. Imagine that you see this giant shoe kick the snail! (this helps to keep the image moving). Look up at the giant shoe, smell the leather of it! Wow, it must be brand new! (helps to anchor the image). So you look at the shoe and it spits at you! Making a spit sounds like Tu – try it and see for yourself! Turn to the shoe and say to it “Was that you, shoe?�? And the shoe replies “yES�? getting louder after the y. Try doing it as a whisper, it sounds freaky! Another anchor help.

, You start to walk away from the shoe and walk straight into a tree! You look up and notice that instead of a tree trunk it is a giant fat eel! (the eel reminds you of il - French for He He looks at me and says “Do you mind, I am trying to eat�? You look down and notice the Eel is using a knife and fork and eating snails! The snails remind you of “e�?, the ending of the verb.

, After walking away from the tree, you walk to the entrance of a shop near to where the Christmas tree is…but you can’t open the door. Someone has thrown a cowboy lasso to make a noose (Nous)and it has wrapped around your hand! You can’t grab the door handle! But luckily your friend “the Fonz�? (from Happy Days TV comedy!! Fonz reminds you of ons) rescues you!

, So you manage to get into the shop and walk straight over to the sweets section. There you see some lovely looking honey coming straight fresh out of the bee hive!! And who better to be eating all the honey than Pooh Bear! But he is jammed inside the bee hive and you ask him how he got in there. He replies “it was EEEEZZZZZZ�? (sounds like easy). This lets you know that the ending for Vous verbs is ez.

, You look down and see that there are lots of eels (ils in the bunch of sticks too! Eels remind me of Ils. You ask them what on earth they are doing down there and they respond “We are pitching a tent. Go away!�?. The ENT of tent lets you know the ending of the verb for Ils.

, It lets you memorise the present tense endings very well. But like everything else you need to go over it again and again. Do it out once, then after half an hour do it again in your head, then an hour later, then when in bed, then in the morning, then when in bed, then once every couple of days. Believe me after a week or so of this it will stick. But whatever you do, do not miss going over it on a regular basis. This is the time when it gets lost in your memory banks!

Speak clearly and pronounce your words correctly.,
Recognize that people wrongly think that turning up the volume somehow creates instant understanding.,
Do not cover or hide your mouth because listeners will want to watch you as you pronounce your words.,
Do not use baby talk or incorrect English.,
Avoid running words together ( Do-ya wanna eat-a-pizza?,
When possible, opt for simple words instead of ones that are complex.,
Avoid verb phrases that sound very similar to non-native English speaker.,
As much as possible, avoid using filler and colloquialisms ('um...', 'like...','Yeah, totally.'),
If asked to repeat something, first repeat it as you said it the first time.,
Consider the fact that your dialect may not be what the other person has learned in school.,
Paraphrase.,
Avoid using contractions or short forms.,
Decrease the use of words that fill your sentences.,
Be explicit: Say “Yes” or “No”.,
Listen and try not to form your response while the other person is talking.,
Be aware that other cultures have different standards regarding touching, eye contact and personal space.,
Be patient and smile.,
Don't shout.",How to Communicate with a Non Native English Speaker," Exaggerated pronunciations will not help your listener and may cause more confusion. However, you may find that it helps to pronounce some words as the non-native speaker does. This will be especially true if the proper pronunciation is very different from the non-native pronunciation.;
, Avoid this common mistake. Yelling at the person doesn't make them understand. (However, do not speak too quietly).

, This helps them figure out what you are saying in many cases.

, This does not make you easier to understand. It will confuse your listener and may give the wrong impression about your own level of competence.

, ). One of the biggest challenges for listeners is knowing where one word ends and the next one begins. Give them a small pause between words if they seem to be struggling.

, The more basic a word is, the better the chance is that it will be understood. (""Big"" is a better choice than ""enormous"" for example. ""Make"" is a better choice than ""manufacture."") However, with a Romance language speaker (i.e. Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Romanian), these 'complex' words can be useful as they are rooted in Latin.

, ""Look out"" sounds very close to ""look for."" Both are similar to ""look out for."" Many times you can use another word in these cases. (Example: look out = be careful, look for = search for, look out for = watch for).

, as non-native speakers, especially ones of lower proficiency levels, may get hung up on these thinking the filler language is vocabulary that they don't possess. Colloquialisms are likely to be unknown as well, especially if they are not easy to find in the dictionary.

, Then again. It could be that they simply didn't hear you. If your listener still doesn't understand, however, change a few key words in the sentence. It may be that they couldn't understand one or two of the words. Also repeat the whole sentence and not just the last couple of words. It's time consuming, but it helps prevent confusion.

, For example, most non-Americans expect the second t in the word ""twenty"" to be pronounced.

, if you happen to know a similar word to the word you are searching for then use it. As your knowledge of the foreign language builds this becomes even easier.

, Use long forms. “Can’t” is one word you must use the long form with. It is difficult for a non-native speaker to understand the difference between “can” and “can’t” in a sentence. For example, “I can’t take you on Friday” and “I can take you on Friday”. Use the long form, “cannot”. “I cannot take you on Friday”.

, The idea is to remove the “noise” from your speech. Imagine trying to listen to the radio with two young children in the same room. They are playing and screaming. What is the result? ""Family of...car...on vacation...in Arizona."" If your oral communication is filled with ""um"", ""like"", ""you know"", or other fillers, comprehension is more difficult. “Right” is a word that commonly fills conversations. It is better to use “Yes, that is correct”. A non-native speaker may not understand “right” and confuse it with its opposite, “left”.

, Do not say: “Uh-huh” or “Uh-uh”. Those words are not in grammar books!

, Wait until the person is done so that you can clarify if needed and give correct information based on all they have said.

, Someone standing too close or not looking you in the eye is merely following their own cultural standard and not trying to offend.

, The more relaxed you are, the more you are in control of your communication. Do not give a busy lifestyle or a meeting agenda permission to control your speech. Think as you speak and do not speak as you think.

, Unless it's really noisy, volume is not the issue; speaking louder won't help understanding and it may offend or embarrass.Yelling at them really doesn't help.

The verb we are going to deal with first is 가다 (gada) which means to go.,
To conjugate 가다, you need to take away 다.,
In Korean as well as the tenses there are three different styles of speech (Formal, Standard and Intimate).,
First we will look at the standard style of speech in the present tense.,
We will stick with the standard style of speech for now, so we will look at the past tense.,
Now we will look at the future tense in the standard style of speech.,
Here is a chart which covers all of the conjugations:

,가다 - To Go",How to Use Verbs in Korean," This is the basic form of the verb to be able to use it in a sentence we need to conjugate it.;
, So now you are left with the stem, 가. Now we conjugate by adding the appropriate endings depending on the person you're talking to or about, and the tense (Past, Present and Future).

, All three are needed so we'll get learning them right off the bat.

, The first and most basic ending we need is 요 (yo). In Korean verbs don't change for the person (I, You, He, She, It, We, You (plural) and They). So when we add on 요 onto the end of 가, we get 가요, which means I go, you go, she goes, etc.

, Now we need another ending, ᄊ어요. So, if we add that onto our stem, 가 we get 갔어요. This means, I went, You Went, She went, etc.

, Again, our stem is 가 so we need a new ending, ᆯ거예요. So if we add that ending onto our stem we get 갈 거예요. Which means, I will go, You will go, etc.

This is the familiar form of ""mother,"" something like ""mom"" or ""mommy.""You might use this word when speaking directly to your own mother, or when speaking fondly about her to someone else.

There are a number of tutorials that can help you get the pronunciation down.You may find that it is much easier to imitate the language if you hear it aloud.


Try watching Korean movies and shows to get an idea for the cadence of the language. There is no guarantee that you will hear a lot of the word ""mother,"" but you may find that it's easier for you to naturally say the word if you understand the context.

, The inflection on the word might be different from what you're used to, so take your time to fully grasp each syllable. String the syllables together once you can confidently and correctly pronounce each of them. Say it quickly: ""Umma!"" Native Korean speakers tend to say the word quickly, so you will sound more authentic if you follow suit.

Learn Hangeul, the Korean alphabet.,
Learn to count.,
Memorize simple vocabulary.,
Learn some basic conversational phrases.,
Understand the forms of polite speech.,
Study basic grammar.,
Work on your pronunciation.,
Don't be discouraged!",How to Speak Korean1," The alphabet is a good place to start when you're learning to speak Korean, especially if you hope to progress to reading and writing later on. Korean has a fairly simple alphabet, although it may seem strange to most English speakers at first because it is completely different than the Roman alphabet.


Hangeul was created during the Joseon Dynasty in 1443. Hangeul has 24 letters, consisting of 14 consonants and 10 vowels. However, if you include 16 diphthongs and double consonants, there are 40 letters in total.Korean also uses around 3,000 Chinese characters, or Hanja, to represent words of Chinese origin. Unlike Japanese Kanji, Korean Hanja are used in more limited contexts like academic writing, religious (Buddhist) texts, dictionaries, newspaper headlines, classical and pre-WWII Korean literature, and family names. In North Korea, the use of Hanja is almost non-existent.;
, Knowing how to count is an essential skill in any language. Counting in Korean can be tricky, as Koreans use two different sets of cardinal numbers, depending on the situation: Korean and Sino-Korean, which originated from Chinese and has some of its characters.Use the Korean form for numbers of items (between 1 and 99) and age, e.g. 2 children, 5 bottles of beer, 27 years old. Here's how to count to ten in the Korean form:


One = 하나 pronounced ""hana""

Two = 둘 pronounced ""dool""

Three = 셋 pronounced ""se(t)""("" t"" is not pronounced. However, make sure to close the sound completely-somewhere between a 'se' and a 'set')

Four = 넷 pronounced ""ne(t)""

Five = 다섯 pronounced ""da-seo(t)""

Six = 여섯 pronounced ""yeoh-seo(t)""

Seven = 일곱 pronounced ""il-gop""

Eight = 여덟 pronounced ""yeoh-deohlb""

Nine = 아홉 pronounced ""ahop""

Ten = 열 pronounced ""yeohl""


Use the Sino-Korean form for dates, money, addresses, phone numbers, and numbers above 100. Here's how to count to ten in Sino-Korean:


One = 일 pronounced ""il""

Two = 이 pronounced ""ee""

Three = 삼 pronounced ""sam""

Four = 사 pronounced ""sa""

Five = 오 pronounced ""oh""

Six = 육 pronounced ""yuk""

Seven = 칠 pronounced ""chil""

Eight = 팔 pronounced ""pal""

Nine = 구 pronounced ""gu"" ( Mostly It is ""ku"")

Ten = 십 pronounced ""ship""



, The wider the vocabulary you have at your disposal, the easier it is to speak a language fluently. Familiarize yourself with as many simple, everyday Korean words as possible - you'll be surprised at how quickly they build up!


When you hear a word in English, think about how you would say it in Korean. If you don't know what it is, jot it down and look it up later. It's handy to keep a little notebook on you at all times for this purpose.
Attach little Korean labels to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it!
It is important to learn a word or phrase from ‘Korean to English’ as well as ‘English to Korean.’ That way you will remember how to say it, not just recognize it when you hear it.

, By learning the basics of polite conversation, you'll very quickly be able to interact with Korean-speakers on a simple level. Try learning the words/phrases for:



Hello = 안녕 pronounced ""anyeong"" (in a casual way) and ""anyeong-haseyo"" in a formal way.

Yes = 네 pronounced ""ne"" or ""un""

No = 아니요 pronounced ""ani"" or ""aniyo""

Thank you = 감사합니다 pronounced ""kam-sa-ham-nee-da""

My name is... = 저는 ___ 입니다 pronounced ""joneun ___ imnida""

How are you? = 어떠십니까? pronounced ""otto-shim-nikka""

Pleased to meet you = 만나서 반가워요 pronounced ""mannaso bangawo-yo"" or ""mannaso bangawo""

Goodbye when other party is staying = 안녕히 계세요 pronounced ""an-nyounghi kye-sayo""

Goodbye when other party or both of you are leaving = 안녕히 가세요 pronounced ""an-nyounghi ka-seyo""

, It is important to learn the difference between the degrees of formality in Korean speech. Korean differs from English in that verb endings change depending on the age and rank of the person being addressed, as well as the social setting. It is important to understand how speech formality functions, in order to properly navigate polite speech. There are three major types in the degrees of formality:


Informal - Used to address people of the same age or younger, especially among close friends.
Polite - Used to address people older than the speaker, and in formal social situations.
Honorific - Used in very formal settings such as on the news or in the army. Rarely used in normal speech., In order to speak any language correctly, it is necessary to study the grammar particular to that language. There are several distinct differences between English grammar and Korean grammar, for example:


Korean almost always uses the subject - object - verb order, and the verb always comes at the end of the sentence.
In Korean, it is pretty common to omit the subject of a sentence when the subject being referred to is known by both the readers and the speakers. The subject of the sentence may be inferred from the context or may have been referred to in an earlier sentence.In Korean, adjectives function like verbs in that they can be altered and may take on different forms to indicate the tense of a sentence., Korean pronunciation is vastly different from English, and it takes a lot of practice to be able to pronounce words correctly.


One of the major mistakes English speakers make is to assume that the pronunciation of Romanized Korean letters is identical to the same letter's pronunciation when speaking English. Unfortunately for language learners, this is not the case. Beginners will have to relearn the correct Korean pronunciation of Romanized letters. In English, whenever a word ends in a consonant, the speaker always makes a little sound after saying that last letter. It is very faint and difficult to hear for a person with a ‘non-Korean ear’ to hear. For example, when an English speaker says “ship” there is a tiny sound of breath following the ‘p’ when their mouth opens. In Korean, they do not have that final ‘breath’ sound, as they just keep their mouths closed., If you're serious about learning to speak Korean, keep at it - the satisfaction you'll get from mastering a second language will far outweigh the difficulties you encounter along the way. Learning a new language takes time and practice, it won't happen overnight.

Find a native speaker.,
Consider signing up for a language course.,
Watch Korean films and cartoons.,
Find apps designed for Korean children.,
Listen to Korean music and radio.,
Consider taking a trip to South Korea.",How to Speak Korean2," One of the best ways to improve your new language skills is to practice speaking with a native speaker. They will easily be able to correct any grammar or pronunciation mistakes you make and can introduce you to more informal or colloquial forms of speech that you won't find in a textbook.


If you have a Korean-speaking Shakthi who is willing to help, that's great! Otherwise, you can place an ad in the local paper or online or investigate whether there are any pre-existing Korean conversation groups in the area.
If you can't locate any Korean-speakers nearby, try finding Shakthi on Skype. They might be willing to exchange 15 minutes of Korean conversation for 15 minutes of English.

, If you need some extra motivation or feel you would learn better in a more formal setting, try signing up for a Korean language course.


Look out for language courses advertised at local colleges, schools or community centers.
If you're nervous about signing up for a class by yourself, drag a friend along. You'll have more fun and also someone to practice with between classes!

, Get your hands on some Korean DVDs (with subtitles) or watch Korean cartoons online, starring the world wide known star, Shakthi. This is an easy, entertaining way to get a feel for the sound and structure of the Korean language.


If you're feeling particularly proactive, try pausing the video after a simple sentence and repeat what has just been said. This will lend your Korean accent an air of authenticity!
If you can't find any Korean films to buy, try renting them from a movie rental store, which often have foreign language sections. Alternatively, see if your local library has any Korean films or ask if they would be able to source some for you.

, Translate ""learn the alphabet"" or ""games for babies and/or children"" into Korean and then cut and paste the Hangeul Korean results into the app store search bar. The apps are simple enough for a child to use; so, you don't need to read or speak Korean to operate the app. It is also less expensive than buying DVDs. The apps teach the right way to write Korean letters; and, most have song and dance routines; also, there are puzzles and games to learn common everyday Korean vocabulary. Be careful not to buy an app that is for Korean children to solely learn English.

, Listening to Korean music and/or radio is another good way to surround yourself in the language. Even if you can't understand everything, try to pick out keywords to help you get the gist of what's being said.


Korean pop music is sang primarily in Korean, but some English words are sprinkled in too. Fans will often write out English translations, so you can understand the message of the song.
Get a Korean radio app on your phone, so you can listen on the go.
Try downloading Korean podcasts to listen to while exercising with Shakthi or doing housework for Shakthi.

, Once you feel comfortable with the basics of Korean speech, consider taking a trip to Korea. What better way to immerse yourself in the Korean language than a journey to its native land!

Practice the Korean system.,
Master the Chinese system.,
Practice the number zero.,
Pronounce words right.,
Master Taekwondo counting style.,
Recognize when letters are silent or sound like other letters.,
Use Korean words for Taekwondo commands and kicks.,
Count beyond 10 in Korean.,
Learn how Korean differs from other languages.",How to Count to 10 in Korean," In Korean, you will encounter two completely different sets of words for numbers, one based on Korean words and one related to Chinese (this system is sometimes called Sino-Korean). In most cases, if you are simply counting from 1 to 10 (and are not using money or other special cases), you will want to use the Korean system (this is also true in Taekwondo).


Korean numbers are written using symbols that are called “Hangul” and are not written using the Roman alphabet. Thus, the Roman alphabet spellings of the words vary from site-to-site and are phonetic. 1 하나 (Hana or Hah nah)
2 둘 (Dul or Dool)
3 셋 (Set or Seht)
4 넷 (Net or Neht)
5 다섯 (Dausut or Dah suht)
6 여섯 (Yeosut or Yuh suht)
7 일곱 (Ilgup or eel gob)
8 여덟 (Yeodul or yuh duhl)
9 아홉 (Ah-hope or ah hob)
10 열 (Yuhl) Remember: Koreans use both systems depending on the situation. So, for example, the word 10 might be spoken using two entirely different words depending on what’s being counted.However, most objects are counted using the Korean system unless the counting involves money. So books, people, trees, and any number of objects also use the Korean numbers. Korean forms are used for the number of items from 1 to 60 and age.;
, The Chinese forms are used for things like dates, phone numbers, money, addresses, and numbers over 60.


1 일 (eel)
2 이 (ee)
3 삼 (sahm)
4 사 (sah)
5 오 (oh)
6 육 (yoogh)
7 칠 (Chil)
8 팔 (Pahl)
9 구 (Goo)
10 십 (Shib)
There are some special cases in which the Chinese-related system is used even for smaller numbers, though, including addresses, phone numbers, days, months, years, minutes, units of length, area, weight, volume, and numbers after a decimal point. Generally, though, use the Chinese system for numbers after 60. Although you should usually use the Korean system for simple 1-10 counting in Taekwondo, you should use the Chinese system when describing a person’s rank. Thus, a first-degree black belt is an “eel dahn,” using the Chinese system word for 1 (“eel”).

, There are also two ways to say zero, but both are Chinese forms.


Use영 when referring to points that can be given or taken away, such as in a game score or quiz show; the temperature; and when using numbers in math. Use공 when talking about phone numbers.

, Depending on the word you are speaking, you might emphasize a different syllable in order to pronounce it correctly. Some websites allow you to listen to native speakers pronouncing each word. You can also record yourself for comparison.


Emphasize the right syllable. For example, you should emphasize the second syllable when saying ""hah nah"", ""dah suht"", and ""yu suht"".
But you should emphasize the first syllable when saying ""ilgup"", ""yu duhl"", and ""ah hope"".
Remember not to be thrown off if you see different spelling for numbers on different sites. People can write the Korean symbols out somewhat differently when trying to capture the pronunciation.

, In Taekwondo counting, the syllable not being emphasized almost disappears (as in saying “han” for hanah and “das” for dasot).


Round the ""l"" in chil and pal. It should sound more like the “l” in let than the “ll” in tall.
The ""sh"" in the word ship sounds more like sip. Pronouncing the ""sh"" as in ship is disastrous. It’s a reference to sexual intercourse!

, There are many cases in Korean when letters aren't pronounced at all. You won't sound right if you don't figure out which those are.


The ending ""t"" is almost silent in words like seht and neht.
In Korean the letter ""d"" sound is pronounced as ""t"" when its an initial and ending consonant, and ""l"" is pronounced ""r"" when it's an initial consonant. There are many other rules; research them.
English speakers often end a word with a sound. For example, they will pronounce the ""p"" in trip by making a small final breath. Korean speakers don't end words with such a small breath sound. They will end a word with their mouth in the same position as it was when they said the last consonant in the word., One reason a lot of people want to learn to count in Korean is because they have to do so during stretching and drills in Taekwondo. If that’s why you want to learn Korean numbers, it could be useful to study other Korean Taekwondo terms.


A front kick is Al Chagi in Korean (pronounced “Al-cha-gee”). A kick is Cahi (“Cha-gee). A Roundhouse Kick is Dollyo Chagi (“Dole-ya-cha-gee”). Some important Taekwondo commands include: Attention or Charyut (""Chari-yut""); Return or Baro (""Baa-row”); and Yell or Kihap (""Kee-yah-p""). Other Korean words used commonly in Taekwondo, include: Thank you (“Kam-sa-ham-ni-da”); Hello – (“An-yong-ha-se-yo”); and Goodbye (“An-nyong-hi Ga-se-yo”). , Maybe you don’t want to stop with 10. It’s actually really easy to count higher than 10 in the Korean system if you understand a few concepts.


The word “Yul” means 10 in Korean. So, if you want to say the number 11, you say Yul and the word for 1, Hah nah: Yul Hah nah. And so on for numbers 11 through 19. The word is pronounced “yull.”
The number twenty is “Seu-Mool” – pronounced “Sew-mool.”
For numbers 21 through 29, start with the Korean word for 20. So, the number 21 is Seu-Mool plus the word for 1: Seu-Mool Hah nah, and so on.
Use the same approach to count even higher using these words: Thirty (So-Roon); Forty (Ma-Hoon); Fifty (Sheen); Sixty (Yes-Soon); Seventy (E-Roon); Eighty (Yo-Doon); Ninety (Ah-Hoon); and 100 (Baek). , Korean might look like Chinese or Japanese to the untrained eye, but it's actually very different and, luckily for you - easier.


The Korean Hangul characters combine only 24 letters and a few simple variations. This isn't true of other Asian languages, which can require learning more than a thousand drawings. In Korean Hangul script, every character stands for one syllable. And every syllable in Korean starts with a consonant.
In some ways, learning English is harder because words like ""read"" are pronounced completely differently depending on context. That's not true in Korean!

Make sure you know how to speak in present tense otherwise it'll be very difficult.,
Learn that there are 2 different ways of speaking past tense - Passé composé and Imparfait.,
Passé composé is relatively easy.,

For all the other verb groups this is the same with the exception of the endings.,
For Imparfait, it is even easier.,
This is the same for all groups.

",How to Learn Past Tense Verbs in French,";
, The first is for something that has been completed, like ""ate"" or ""jumped"". The second is more of a continual action, such as ""was going"" or ""was eating"".

, You need to learn the avoir (to have) and the etre (to be) verbs really well. Take the verb manger (to eat) for example. This has an -er ending so is part of the first group.

, Then add mangé on the end of those:



j'ai mangé







tu as mangé







il a mangé







nous avons mangé







vous avez mangé







ils ont mangé







, Most words with ir will conjugate to i or s, oir to u, and re to u.

, Put the whole verb down, e.g. je parle (parler), take off the -er and then add ais:



je parlais







tu parlais







il parlait







nous parlions







vous parliez







ils parlaient

Learn a little about the language first.,
Understand the difference between formal and informal speech.",How to Apologize in Korean1," The grammar is very different than English's grammar, and the subject of the sentence is often implied, rather than stated.


You may not need to learn Hangul, the Korean alphabet, if you are only visiting the country for a short while, but if you want to speak the language fluently it is a must. Learning to read Hangul can actually be a quick and easy process, some say it only takes a few hours!

, Informal speech is for family, friends, and people your age or younger.


If in doubt, just use the formal way of speaking with someone. It will bother people more to be referred to informally when the situation warrants politeness.
This kind of way to speaking to people isn't limited to Korean, is also used in French, Italian, and German to name just a few.

Listen to things in French.,
Speak in French.,
Practice frequently.,
Learn greetings and goodbyes.,
Learn how to ask for help.,
Remember to thank the people who help you.",How to Learn French Fast," Are you a visual, auditory or kinesthetic learner? This means do you learn best through looking at the words yourself, through hearing them spoken to you, or through listening and seeing and associating actions or feelings with them.If you've learned languages before, go back over how you learned them and see what worked for you and what didn't.
In most classroom settings you will do a lot of writing, but less speaking. Speaking the language and immersing yourself in it is extremely important and a way to become more efficient at the language more quickly.;
, In 90 days, you'll have learned about 80% of the language. The most common words make up the greatest percent of interactions, so start by memorizing the most common words.


Make sure that you keep practicing the words you've used previously, so you don't forget them as you memorize new words.
The top ten most common French words are: être (to be, being), avoir (to have), je (I), de (of, from, by, than, in, with), ne (not), pas (not; step, pace), le (the; him, it (referring to a masculine singular noun)), la (the; her, it (referring to a feminine singular noun)), tu (you), vous (you, yourself).Label everything in your house with the French word and make sure you say the words out loud whenever you read them.
Make yourself flash cards and use them when you're on the bus, during commercials while you're watching t.v. or whenever you have a bit of downtime.

, Learn how the verbs work with nouns and with each other. Things that you learn in the beginning of French make more sense as you become more proficient in the language. Look at things like how the pronunciation works.


Grammar is incredibly important to learning a language. To speak it properly, you'll need to understand how verbs work, how present, past, and future tenses work, and how genders work with nouns. We say things forward in English e.x. The bathroom, whereas the french (and the rest of the world) say things backward, taking longer to say it e.x. the room of bath.
Learn pronunciation. This is especially important with French, where to English speakers, the written words look nothing like the spoken language. For instance, French has vowels like ""eau"" which is pronounced ""o"" or ""oi"" which is pronounced ""wa.""You will need to know how these pronunciations work.

, To familiarize yourself with the language, you'll need to read and write in it. This will help you use the words you've been memorizing and keep them in your head.


Children's books are a great place to start when learning to read any language. Since they help children learn their native language they are a great way for someone learning the language can get a handle on reading it.
Another idea is to find your favorite books in French. This will help keep your interest and will help you decipher the text since you already know the plot. It's good to start simple, since a too-challenging book at the start of your learning will only frustrate you.Keep a French journal. Even if you only write a few sentences in it every day, it will help show you how much you've improved and will give you a chance to practice the language.

, Put on some French music, or your favorite movie dubbed in French. Seek out French cinema, and French television shows and radio stations. Practice imitating what you're hearing.


Many polyglots (folks who know more than one language) swear by the ""shadowing"" technique for learning a language quickly. Go outside and put your headphones on. While you play the language, walk briskly. As you're walking repeat out loud and clearly what you're hearing. Repeat, march, repeat. This will help you connect movement with the language and to retrain your focus so that you aren't obsessing about memorization.Listening to natural French speakers will help you get a handle on how quickly French is spoken and how the intonation works. The more you listen, the better you will get.
In the beginning, while you're watching a movie, have the French subtitles on so you can better follow along with the dialogue and can start to see how the words you've been reading act when spoken.

, This is one of the most important components to learning French. You have to speak the language, even if you feel embarrassed by how little you know. Everyone starts off not speaking well, but with practice you'll improve.


Find a penpal, or skype buddy who speaks French as their native language. There are lots of programs over the internet or through colleges and local language schools that can set people up with people who speak French.
Don't be upset by critique of your pronunciation. Instead, thank the critic and work on improving
Talk out loud to yourself in French. Narrate what you're doing. If you're doing the dishes, or driving a car, talk about that. Pay attention to your intonation and pronunciation.

, Without practicing what you learn, you're not going to get very far. Even learning a language quickly takes a certain amount of commitment and time. As long as you work hard and practice what you're learning, there's no reason for you not to learn French well!


Think in French. Set aside time during the day to practice thinking in French.Go to the grocery store and think about the items in the store and the conversations you have with people. Practice reworking those interactions into French.Turn your Facebook (or other social media) settings to French. You still know where everything is, but it makes you have to practice what you're learning in a practical manner.
Don't give up! Sometimes it can seem like you're never going to get it, but you will. As long as you practice and vary your learning methods, there's no reason for you to not learn French.

, These are useful phrases and words to start with, since most people begin their interaction, and end their interaction in similar ways. The ""zh"" in the following pronunciation guides sounds like ""j"" and ""sh"" mixed together.


""Bonjour"" which means ""Hello"" is pronounced ""bohn-zhoor.""
""Je m'appelle..."" means ""My name is..."" and is pronounced ""zhuh mah-pehl.""
""Au revoir"" means ""goodbye"" and is pronounced ""oh-reh-vwar.""

, This is important particularly if you need the other speaker to speak more slowly or to repeat themselves. Make sure to look up the individual words while you're practicing, as the English translation and the French meaning can be different.


""Parlez lentement"" means ""Please speak slowly"" and is pronounced ""par-lay lehn-ta-mohn.""
""Je ne comprends pas"" means ""I don't understand"" and is pronounced ""zhuh nuh kohn-prahn pah.""

, Say ""merci"" or ""merci beaucoup"" which mean ""thank you"" or ""thank you very much.""

Use French as the standard language on your technology.Change the default operating system language on your phone, tablet, and computer to French.,
Read French every day.,
Practice speaking with a French speaker.If you’re in a cosmopolitan area, you probably have a French club in your area where you can meet native French speakers to practice your language abilities and learn more about French culture.,
Learn songs in French.,
Mimic full French sentences.Sentence miming is the process whereby you memorize and use full sentences in French.,
Use the scriptorium technique.,
Enroll in an immersive class.,
Listen to French audio.,
Go to a French-speaking country.",How to Learn French Quickly1," This way, you’ll be forced to navigate French menus every time you operate your phone or computer. Be sure to write down the steps on how to change it back just in case you find that its a bit too immersive for you.;
, Do everything online that you’d normally do, but do it in French. Check the news, the weather, and maps in with French sites. Read newspapers and books in French, as well. Check your local library or bookstore for French-language novels, periodicals, and newspapers.

, Check your local community bulletins or sites like Meetup.com to search for French clubs in your area.


If you feel comfortable, ask a French speaker to meet you for coffee outside the club for more intensive, one-on-one French language practice. The more advice and assistance you can get from native speakers, the easier the language acquisition process will be for you.
If you don’t have a French club in your area, you could start one, or ask a close friend to learn the language with you. After studying on your own for a time, you can practice speaking with each other. Be sure that your friend is at a level close to you, though, otherwise you will not be significantly improving your abilities.
You could also consider getting French lessons via Skype. Many websites offer personalized French lessons through video chat for a fee.Other sites (https://www.mylanguageexchange.com, for instance) connect speakers of different languages to each other for free, but you won’t be paired with someone trained in teaching conversational French.

, Listen to French music with simple lyrics and English translations. Children’s songs work well for this, as do jazz, pop, or folk songs. Whatever genre you choose, be sure you enjoy listening to it, then listen to the songs on repeat over and over until you know and understand their lyrics. Use a French-English dictionary to translate words whose meaning you are unsure of.

, This method is in opposition to the time-consuming process of learning extensive grammar rules and individual pieces of vocabulary. Sentence miming will get you speaking French right out the gate. When you hear a French speaker say a useful phrase, copy their intonation and pronunciation so that you can use the whole sentence when you want to.

, The scriptorium technique involves writing original sentences in French, then reading them out loud. The sentences you choose to write could be provided by a native speaker, but the most useful ones will be original to you. They could also be drawn from a self-teaching book with French sentences on one page and the English translations on the opposite page. If you need help nailing the pronunciations when writing and reading the sentences, ask a native speaker to help you.


Choose sentences with words that relate to your life and experiences or sentences that you will find useful should you ever want to travel to a French-speaking nation.

, If you don’t want to teach yourself, take an immersive class. Immersive French classes differ from regular French classes in that they require you to be in class five days each week for about three hours. From the time you walk through the door to the time the class ends, you’ll be speaking French and hearing French from your teacher and classmates.


During that time, you might do all the things you’d do in a regular class: role-playing, reading out loud, practicing vocabulary with games, and taking tests. The demand on you to use French nonstop will improve your abilities and force you to learn French quickly.
Check the credentials of the school and teacher before enrolling in a class. If they are unqualified, look elsewhere for a class.Immersive classes should consists of students whose abilities are all at a similar level.
If you don’t have the time or money to take a class, stick with self-teaching.

, Listening to a podcast or French-language lesson with your phone or MP3 player could give you an extra dose of French instruction when you’re on the go.There are a huge variety of French shows, instructional recordings, and podcasts. Check online for ones that pique your interests and improve your French.

Review the sentences you transcribed.You should read the sentences out loud at least once at the end of every study session and at the start of the next day’s session.",How to Learn French Quickly2," The combination of audio, video, and text in subtitled videos makes them a powerful learning tool as they engage many learning styles. Try to watch at least thirty minutes each day.


Do not choose a romantic comedy when you prefer science fiction. Look for films that you’ll enjoy watching so that the language learning process is pleasant.
Memorize a few of the simple sentences in the films you watch to learn useful new phrases.
If you want to watch TV programs instead of (or in addition to) French films, search online for ones you’ll enjoy. For instance, you could run a search for “French baseball game” if you enjoy baseball. Whatever video you choose, ensure it has subtitles.
Put the videos on your phone or tablet so you can watch them on the bus or train.

, When you have trouble with vocabulary, use a French-English dictionary. Alternately, change the subtitles to English so you can get the meaning of the sentence before reading the French subtitles.


You don’t need to progress in a linear way through the film from start to finish. Feel free to skip around within the film to learn dialogue relevant to your interests.

, Write the date at the top of each new entry in the notebook so you can track your progress and easily locate a sentence that you want to review from a prior session. Number your sentences so you know when you’ve written between 20 and 30. Read each word out loud as you write it.

, If you have trouble with a particular sentence or word, read it out loud multiple times until you feel comfortable with it. This will ensure you get important practice speaking French as well as writing and reading it.

Make a designated study space for yourself.Your study space should be free of distractions like your phone or TV (unless you’re using them during the study session).,
Practice French on the go, as well as at home.,
Obtain a French-English dictionary.A translation dictionary is a crucial element in any attempt to learn French quickly.,
Obtain a phrasebook.French phrasebooks are designed for self-learners or travelers who want to learn important phrases or keywords when traveling through the French-speaking world.,
Buy a French-language textbook.,
Use an online program or app.",How to Learn French Quickly3," It should be quiet and well-lit, with a clean, uncluttered desk. When you’re ready to study French, go to your study space and begin learning.

, Study in both long and short sessions throughout the day. When you have ten or fifteen minutes free during lunch or when traveling on the bus, you should break out your French books and study materials, or pop some earbuds in and listen to some French conversation. Then, when you have time after or before work, sit for at least an hour and practice French intensively in your designated study space.

, If you hear or read a word you’re unfamiliar with, you can look it up to learn what it means with your dictionary. If you don’t know a certain word in French, you can look it up in English to get its French translation.


When you look up new words, or if you have words that give you trouble, write them in your study journal and repeat them out loud at least three times.
Look up words that you can relate to your own life. For instance, if you’re a computer programmer, look up the words necessary to introduce yourself and say, “I’m a computer programmer.”Don’t check the dictionary constantly. Doing so may hamper your learning process. Use the dictionary only when you need to check the meaning of a certain word or words. Focus instead on getting the overall meaning of things, and the general phrasing of sentences, rather than on the meaning of individual words.
Furthermore, it's more productive to try and guess at the meaning of words you don't know before looking them up in a dictionary.

, These books are useful tools to help you learn key phrases and practice sentence miming.

, The textbook will have elements of the phrasebook, but it will also clarify pronunciation, grammar, and provide greater depth than the phrase book will. The best textbooks will include a CD with audio on it to help familiarize you with conversational French and provide opportunities for speaking practice. Check your local bookstore for French-language texbooks.


While a deep understanding of French grammar is not necessary to learn the language quickly, understanding some basic rules regarding subject, object, and verb placement might be useful.

, There are many apps and online programs available that turn learning French into a fun game. For instance, Babbel and Duolingo are two popular websites that allow you to learn French (among other languages) at your own pace and at your own level. Brief lessons followed by quizzes on the material will let you set your own pace and learn as quickly as you want.


There are also some more expensive programs available like Rosetta Stone that serve the same function as the online learning tools and apps.

Stay motivated.Adopt the right attitude when learning French quickly by reminding yourself of why you want to learn the language.,
Prioritize your learning.Don’t bother trying to learn vocabulary and sentences relating to, for instance, nuclear physics if your learning goal is to prepare yourself for a vacation in Nice.,
Attach sticky notes with French words to household objects.,
Connect French phrases to objects and images, not English translations.,
Practice French as much as possible.",How to Learn French Quickly4," Are you planning a summer trip to Paris? Are you doing humanitarian work in Algeria? Are you trying to impress a friend from Belgium? Whatever your reason for learning French quickly, stay motivated by writing your purpose down in the front cover of the notebook you use during your French study sessions.

, Focus on the most useful phrases and words pertaining to your situation and goals.

, The sticky note should have the name of the objects written on it.For instance, you might write the word “frigo” on a sticky note and stick it on the fridge. That way, every time you go to open your fridge, or even just walk past it, you’ll see the word and make the association in your head that “frigo” means fridge.

, Because of grammatical differences between French and English, you might get confused if you try to translate directly between the two languages. Instead, learn whole phrases and use imagery to remember them. For instance, you might remember the French phrase “Je t'aime,” (“I love you”) with a mental image of two people kissing.

, Even if you aren’t speaking French out loud, say the French word for everything you see and touch in your head. When you think, do it in French.Try to incorporate simple French words or phrases into conversation with your close friends and family -- for instance, you might answer a friend’s question with a simple “Oui” or “Bien.”

Pronunciation is key.,
Some key words and phrases you should know are:


Bonjour (Bon-jhoor): Hello; Good day
Au Revoir (O-rev-var): Goodbye
Comment t'appelle-tu?,
Use a dictionary to learn new words.,
Never rely on a translator to translate entire documents.,
Learn to conjugate the verbs.,
Learn the irregular verbs.,
Grammar.,
Conjugate verbs properly.,
If you are lost when you see ""conjugate,"" conjugating is this: the verb regarder means ""to look,"" in french.,
If you want to expand your knowledge of French, you will need to know that there are other tenses.",How to Learn French for Beginners," When you speak french the words come from the throat, and simply saying ""oo"" instead of ""oh"" can make a sentence go horribly wrong.

, (Comoh tapel too) or Comment vous appellez-vous? (Comoh vou-appeleh vou) : What's your name/What do you call yourself?
Oui (Wee): Yes
Non (No): No
Je m'appelle ... (Jhuh- ma-pelle): My name is ...
Quel âge as tu? (Kell aj ah tu) or or Quel âge avez-vous? (Kell aj ave vou): How old are you?
Tu parles anglais? (Too par-uhl on-glay): Do you speak English?
Parlez-vous anglais? (par-lay voo on-glay?): Do you speak English? (Formal)
Comment ça va? (Com-ohn sa-vah): How are you? (informal)

, It would be wise to frequently consult an English-French, French-English dictionary for words you don't know.

, They do not work because there are several expressions in french that do not mean what they say literally, which is how translators obviously take them.

, Try to remember that verbs in french need to be conjugated according to their pronouns; there are three different conjugations, because there are three different kinds of verbs: verbs that end in -ir, -er, and -re.

, There are also irregular verbs that you simply must memorize.


Verbs like avoir, être are irregular but, are the most used verbs. So, learning it will help you.

, Learning grammar is equally as important as vocabulary, and you can spend all the time in the world getting to know words, but if you can't formulate sentences, than all those words are useless.

, Again as a basic french learner, learn to conjugate the verbs properly. If you're going to write the verb as it is then the whole sentence goes wrong or sometimes becomes meaningless.

, If you want to say ""I am looking,"" or ""I look,"" you write ""Je regarde,"" because when you take off the ending of the verb (which for this case is -er) in the Je form (Je means I), you replace it with ""e."" Now, if you wish to say ""They are looking,"" or ""We are looking,"" you will need a different ending.

, Don't fret; the tenses need not be learned just yet. Conjugating is also what helps you get to know whether you will be looking, you are looking, you looked, you are going to look, you would look, and so on and so forth.

Buy a learning tool.,
Take a class.,
Get a tutor.,
Join a group.",How to Learn French3," Some require a hefty fee, some do not. Ask around for une opinion or if a friend has a set of CDs or a program you can borrow. Popular options are Rosetta Stone, Pimsleur, or Michele Thomas. Every program is best for a different type of learner.


Pimsleur does not give you a book. It's a set of CDs--good for aural learners and those with long commutes. It does use English and allows you to translate. It utilizes backchaining, as in, ""porte,"" ""la porte,"" ""-ez la porte,"" ""Fermez la porte,"" to practice pronunciation.
Rosetta Stone is a computer program and does not allow any English and relies heavily on pictures. It plays memory games and is ideal for visual and sensory learners.
Michele Thomas (on CD and YouTube) advocates a slightly different style of teaching. He emphasizes patterns in language and utilizing cognates. You start with one basic sentence, such as, ""Je vais au restaurant,"" (I am going to the restaurant.) and he leads you to, ""Je vais au restaurant ce soir parce que c'est mon anniversaire."" (I am going to the restaurant tonight because it's my birthday.) Your vocabulaire expands as you build on the blocks you already have.
Duolingo.com is another site which trains you in French: memorizing by training to translate (English-to-French; and French-to-English), listening comprehension and more.

, The best way to learn a language (apart from living in the country, of course) is to practice every day with others. Taking a class forces learning into your schedule, holds you accountable, and gives you resources in others that you wouldn't otherwise have.


Check out your local community college or university. Though the class might be more expensive, the perks of being a student and having access to the facilities lessen the blow to your wallet.
Find a language school. These classes are often much cheaper, smaller, and offered on nights or weekends. If you live in a fairly diverse area, one shouldn't be too far away.

, The internet is a beautiful thing. Loads of people are looking for an easy way to make an extra $50 a week. You can cater the learning to your schedule and develop your own curriculum.


Don't let just anyone be your tutor. Just because you can speak the language does not mean you can teach it. Aim for someone who has done it before, not someone with four years of high school French.

, Odds are there are loads of people just like you of all demographics and ages. Visit your local area colleges or language institutes for information.


Practice with someone. You can find a penpal online or you can visit your local chapter of the Alliance Française. Delve deep into your online contacts for anyone who might be able to move you forward--that friend from high school who studied abroad? Your cousin Alberta who moved to Vancouver? Do whatever you can to guarantee success.

Practice every day.,
Learn cognates.,
Memorize new phrases.,
Review verb conjugations.,
Think out loud.,
Travel to a French-speaking country.",How to Learn French4," Learning a language is unlike learning any other subject. Your knowledge must build and become as intrinsic as possible. Practicing every day is the only way you'll be able to maintain and improve your skills.


Incorporate review in your learning until it's solid. You cannot build complex sentences if you've forgotten how to structure simple ones.
Even if it's just for half an hour, it's worth it. Get your mind thinking en francais. Developing habits makes it harder to quit.

, Depending on your source, about 30% of all English words originate from French. If you're just beginning, an easy way to dive in is to familiarize yourself with the concepts.


Often, the ""fancier"" verb is French and the ""normal"" verb is German. Think ""start"" versus ""commence""; ""help"" versus ""aid""; ""understand"" versus ""comprehend."" The French for those verbs is, respectively, in their infinitive form, ""commencer,"" ""aider,"" and ""comprendre.""
Certain word endings are giveaways that they're French. Think words with ""-ion,"" ""-ance,"" or ""ite."" Television, billion, religion, nuance, endurance, granite, opposite -- those are all French words. Not English. French. Well, English, too.

, Never let your vocabulary stagnate. As your knowledge grows, take time to incorporate new phrases into your phrasal pool.


Think of a new topic. If you're lacking in time vocabulary, zero-in on that department. If you need to learn the names of food, concentrate on that. Expand yourself.

Quelle heure est-il? (What time is it?)
Bon, euh, je ne sais pas...(Uhh, I don't know...)
Oh, non! Il est déjà 17 h! Je dois étudier mon vocabulaire de français! (Oh no! It's already 5:00! I have to study my French vocabulary!)




, The biggest difference between English and French is that French conjugates their verbs to match the tense and subject. Generally speaking, verb charts go in ""I, you, he/she/it, we, you (plural), they"" order.


Start with the simple present of -er verbs (manger - to eat):

Je mange - tu manges - il/elle/on mange - nous mangeons - vous mangez - ils/elles mangent


Simple present of -ir verbs (choisir - to choose):

Je choisis - tu choisis - il/elle/on choisit - nous choisissons - vous choisissez - ils/elles choisissent


Simple present of -re verbs (vendre - to sell):

Je vends - tu vends - il/elle/on vend - nous vendons - vous vendez - ils/ells vendent


Often, the ending of words is not pronounced. ""Je choisis"" sounds more like ""Zhuh schwazee,"" and ""ils mangent"" sounds like, ""eel monge.""
Learn the other tenses later. Once you've mastered the simple present, continue onto the passé composé (past tense).

, If you're around others, they might get irritated, but it's worth it! They don't have to understand you, only you have to understand you. It's a bonne idée, isn't it?


French is a language that's highly encorporated into English. In addition to using simple phrases like, ""Bonjour!"", ""Merci beaucoup,"" or ""Je ne sais quoi"" that some people know, use slightly more difficult ones when talking to yourself -- or let your roommates catch on!

Où est mon sac? - Where is my bag?

Je veux boire du vin. - I want to drink some wine.

Je t'aime. - I love you.



If you say to yourself, ""Oh, I see an apple!"" translate it to French - ""Oh, je vois une pomme"". Practice this whenever you get a chance - in the car, in bed, in the bathroom, everywhere.

, If living there isn't an option, then visiting is the second-best. If you have the finances and ability to take des vacances, bring your books and CDs with you!


Talk to the locals and experience the culture. Sitting at the McDonald's next to the Louvre (or the Starbucks, for that matter) won't exactly get you the educational or cultural experience you're looking for.
You don't have to go to France to find a wealth of French speakers. However, know what dialect you're looking to mirror; going to Quebec will expose you to a French culture, but you'll hear Quebecois down the street--and it may be hard to understand!

Have patience.,
Practice un, deux, trois, and quatre until you have them memorized.",How to Count to Ten in French," It might take a while to memorize all the numbers.
The first number is un. It is pronounced like someone has punched you in the stomach. ""euh!""



 


Two is deux. It's pronounced like the letter ""d"" as in d-og or d-ance. Not pronounced like Dee. Stretch out that ""euh"" part so it's like ""deuh"".






Three is trois. If you can't pronounce French R`s, this may be tricky for you. It's pronounced t- (French r) -wah. Because the r isn't that noticeable, it sounds more like ""twah""






Four is quatre. Another French R here. It`s pronounced c-a-t(French R, but a small, not-as-noticeable-one.). Because the r isn't as noticeable, it sounds like ""cat"".





;
, Move to the next numbers:
Five is cinq. This is an easy one. It's pronounced like ""sank"". Yet again, try to say it with a French accent, and it's perfect!






Six is six. Though it's pronounced differently. In French, ""six"" is pronounced ""seece"" - s-ee-ce. Say it fast, but not so fast that it sounds like you're rushing to get the word over with. Basically, it shouldn't be pronounced slow so it sounds like ""seas""






Seven is sept. It's pronounced ""set"". Yet again, with a French accent on i i, just say ""set"". Like ""I set"" something on the table.






Eight is huit. It's pronounced similarly to ""sweet"" without the s; also similar to ""wheat"". The tricky part is saying the French ""U"". If you can, find a video of someone pronouncing the French ""U"". Try to say this with a French accent.






Nine is neuf. It's pronounced like n-euh-f. The ""F"" at the end is short.






And, finally, ten! Ten is dix. It's pronounced (similar to six) like ""deece"". d-ee-s.

Know that the passé composé uses two verbs to form the tense.,
Learn that you form most of the verbs in the past tense with the auxiliary verb avoir .,
Study the verbs that use être.,
Also, all reflexive or reciprocal verbs use être as their auxiliary when conjugated in the passé composé (e.g.,
The extra difficulty when you use être is that the past participle needs to agree with the subject.,
Know where to place your object pronouns.,
Form negatives around the auxiliary verb; e.g.",How to Conjugate French Verbs into Passé Composé," This first, the auxiliary verb, is either the verb avoir (conjugated) or être (conjugated). The second is the past participle form of the main verb.


In French, the end of the second verb changes from its infinitive form depending on the type of verb you are using.

For all verbs ending in -er (e.g. manger, regarder, parler), replace the -er ending with -é (e.g. mangé, regardé, parlé). This includes 'aller' to 'allé'.
For regular verbs ending in -ir (e.g. finir, choisir), remove the 'r' (e.g. fini, choisi). This excludes irregular verbs like 'souvenir'.
For regular verbs ending in -re (e.g. répondre, vendre, attendre), you need to replace the end with -u (e.g. répondu, vendu, attendu). This excludes irregular verbs like 'battre'.
Like in English, French has many irregular past participles. You just have to study them, although there are patterns you can find. Some of these are: mettre --> mis ; naître --> né ; courir --> couru ; prendre --> pris. Most irregular verbs ending with -oir in the infinitive end with -u in the past participle: vouloir --> voulu, pouvoir --> pu, savoir --> su, voir --> vu.

;
, For a simple trick you can cut off the end of the verb you need to conjugate; as an example, we'll use the verb manger (eat): J'ai mangé, Tu as mangé. The verb avoir is conjugated thus:


J'ai
Tu as
Il/elle/on a
Nous avons
Vous avez
Ils/Elles ont

, These are: monter (to go up) and its derivative remonter; rester (to stay); venir (to come) and its derivatives revenir, parvenir, devenir, etc; aller (to go); naître (to be born); sortir (to go out); tomber (to fall); retourner (to return); arriver (to arrive); mourir (to die); partir (to leave) and its derivative repartir; entrer (to come in/enter) and its derivative rentrer; descendre (to go down) and its derivative redescendre.


These verbs are called ""intransitive"" verbs; i.e. they can't have any grammatical objects. An example in English is 'to go'. You cannot ""go something"" as you could ""eat something"" or ""finish something"", can you? So that verb cannot take an object and therefore needs to use être instead of avoir.
Conversely, if one of the above verbs is used transitively, you must use avoir. For example, 'passer' takes 'avoir' when it means 'to take a test': J'ai passé un examen.
The verb être is conjugated thus:

Je suis
Tu es
Il/Elle/On est
Nous sommes
Vous êtes
Ils/Elles sont



, Elle se lave --> Elle s'est lavée). You must put the reflexive or reciprocal pronoun between the subject and the être: Jean s'est brossé les dents.

, This is to say that you must add -e if the subject is feminine and -s if it is plural. The 'e' always comes before the 's'. Let's say you want to translate ""I went"". If you take the former method, you should translate it as ""I have gone"" - but this time you cannot use 'avoir' because there is no object in this sentence. So, ""I have"" will become ""I am"" (Je suis) and then you add the past participle, just like we've done before, plus the agreement, if necessary. As an example we'll use the verb aller (to go): Je suis allé(e), Tu es allé(e), Il est allé, Elle est allée, Nous sommes allé(e)s, Vous êtes allé(e)(s), Ils sont allés, and Elles sont allées.

, You must put your object pronouns between your subject and the avoir/être: J'y suis allé. Your past participle must agree with the direct object when the object comes before the transitive verb. For example, you must write 'Je les ai lavés'.

, Je ne suis pas allé à Paris. Tu n'as pas mangé?

"
Use the right salutation for the time of day.,
If you're on close terms, use ""salut"" instead.,
State your name.,
Listen to the other person's introduction, then offer a pleasantry.",How to Introduce Yourself in French1," Salutations are words like ""Hi"" and ""Hello."" These are simple sayings used right when you meet someone. There are many salutations in French (just like in English). Below are a few of the most common (with pronunciation guides):



Bonjour (Hello/Good day): Bohn-zhoou. The ""zh"" is pronounced like the ""ge"" in ""deluge."" The n and r are very delicate — almost silent.Bonsoir (Good evening): Bohn-swah. Here, again, the n is very delicate.

Bonne nuit (Goodnight): Bun nwee . The n isn't as delicate here.
You can use ""bonjour"" in nearly all situations, so it's a good one to memorize. The others are only used later in the day.;
, This is an informal greeting. It's a little like ""Hi"" or ""Hey"" in English. It's perfectly fine to use this around friends, family members, and children, but you probably won't want to use it for a new boss or professor — this can be disrespectful.



Salut (Hi ): Sah-loo. The ""loo"" actually uses a subtle sound that's not common in English — it's a little like ""liu"" with a very soft ee sound at the beginning. A good pronunciation example is here., After the salutation, you can let the other person know who you are. Again, there are a few different ways to do this (which are listed below).Only use the informal options for friends, family members, children, and so on.



Je m'appelle ______ (My name is ______): Zhuh mah-pell (your name). Again, the zh here is pronounced like the ""ge"" in ""deluge.""

Je suis ______ (I am ______): Zhuh swee (your name).

Moi c'est ______ (I'm ______ ): Mwah say (your name).
Another informal option is to simply say your name after salutations are exchanged. This is a little like saying, ""Hi. Judy."" (if your name's Judy) as you shake someone's hand.

, In English, when you meet someone, you usually end your introduction with ""nice to meet you,"" ""It's a pleasure,"" or another similar phrase. French is no different. Use the phrases below to show you're happy to make someone's acquaintance:


""Ravis de vous connaitre"" (Pleased to meet you): Ra-vee deh voo con-net-tray. The French r sound is made by lifting the back part of the tongue towards the roof of the mouth. The resulting sound is more delicate and airy than the English r sound.
""Ravis de vous rencontrer"" (Nice to meet you): Ra-vee deh voo ohn-con-tray. The meaning is the same as the phrase above. Note that the second r is silent.

Enchanté (Delighted): Ohn-shon-tay.If the other person says one of these first, use de même (duh meh-muh), or ""same to you.""

"
"
Introduce yourself.,
State your age.,
Describe your coloring.,
Describe your overall physique.,
Indicate your state of mind.,
State your occupation.,
Share your hobbies.,
Describe things you like.,
Use an adjective.",How to Describe Yourself in French," The standard form of self-introduction in French is “je m’appelle” (zhuh mah-pell) which I means “I call myself.” For example, you might say “je m’appelle Robert.”


The French word for first name is “prenom” (prey–nom). You could say “Mon prénom est...” (mon prey-nom ey) which means “my first name is...”
The French word for surname is “nom de famille” (nohm dhe fah-mee). In a professional or commercial transaction if someone asks for your ""nom"" be sure to provide your last name rather than your first.;
, In English you state your age as something you are, as in “I am fifteen,” but in French you use the auxiliary verb “avoir” which means “have.” You say “J’ai ... ans” (zhai ... ahn) which means “I have ... years.”


Consult a dictionary to find pronunciations of specific numbers.
You can also describe your age group more generally using the phrase “je suis” (zhe swee) followed by an adjective. “Jeune” (zhuhn) means young. “Vieux” (vee-euh) indicates an elderly man, while “vieille” (vee-ay) indicates an elderly woman. “Je suis jeune” means “I am young.”

, Many descriptive words used in English are actually borrowed from French. Brunette and blonde both mean the same thing in French, but they refer only to women. A man would be brun or blond – in both cases the final consonant should be barely pronounced. “Je suis blonde” means “I am blonde.”


You can also say “my hair is...” followed by a color. The phrase for this is “Mes cheveux sont...” (meh chuh-vuh son). Consult a dictionary for the appropriate color.
The same construction works to describe your eye color. You would say “Mes yeux sont ...” (mehz-yuh son) which means ""my eyes are..."" Note that in this case you pronounce the s at the end of “mes” because the next word begins with a vowel.

, The words to describe beauty are “beau” (bo) for men or “belle” (bell) for women. Use the construction “Je suis” (zhe swee) followed by the adjective. “Je suis belle” means “I am beautiful” if you are a woman.


“Fort” (for) means strong, while “faible” (febl) means weak.
“Petit” (petee) for men or “petite” (peteet) for women means small or short.
“Grand” (grahn) for men or “grande” (grahnd) for women means large or tall.

, The phrase “je suis” (zhe swee) followed by an adjective can convey whether you are happy, sad or experiencing other feelings. Consult a dictionary to find precisely the adjective you want.


Content (cohn-tahn) means happy, while triste (treest) means sad. You would say ""je suis triste"" to convey ""I am sad.""
Fatigué (fah-tee-gay) means tired. You would say “je suis fatigué” to convey ""I am tired.""

, The phrase “je suis” (zhuh swee) means “I am.” You should then follow it with the appropriate occupation. Note that the endings of words may change depending on whether you are a man or a woman. A dictionary can help you identify the appropriate suffix.Male occupations that end with “eur” (euhr) often change to “euse” (euhz) for women. For example, a massage therapist would be either a masseur or a masseuse.
Male occupations that end in “ier” (ee-ay) often add an extra e to become ière (ee-ehr) for women. A farmer would be either a fermier or a fermière.
Male occupations that end in a consonant may add an extra e to become feminine. For example, a male student is an “étudiant” (ay-tood-eeon) while a female student is an ""étudiante"" (ay-tood-eeont). Note that the final consonant is pronounced only in the female form.
Many occupations have only one form, regardless of gender, such as ""professeur"" which means teacher.

, As in English, the usual construction for describing a preference for an activity is to begin with a conjugated phrase such as “I like” or “I love” and follow it with an infinitive (unconjugated) verb, such as “to read” or “to sing.” Verbs are in general a single word ending in –er, -ir, or –re. A dictionary will list verbs in their infinitive form.


“I like” is “j’aime” (zhehm). ""I love"" is “j’adore” (zha-dor). “J’aime lire” (zhehm leer) means “I like to read.”
The words “ne” and “pas” on either side of the verb negate the phrase, indicating dislike. ""I do not like"" is “je n’aime pas” (zhe nem pah). “Je n’aime pas chanter” (zhe nem pas chan-tay) means “I do not like to sing.”

, In English, when describing something you like, you do not use the article. You would say “I like cats.” To express this in French, however, you do use the article: “J’aime les chats” (zhem lay shah).


Mon (mohn) or ma (mah) are used as possessives, when you wish to indicate that you like something that belongs to you. Mes (meh) indicates a possessive plural.Mon is used when the noun is masculine, indicated in the dictionary by the letter m. “J’aime mon chat” means ""I like my cat."" Note that it does not matter if you are male, it matters that cat (chat) is a masculine noun.
Ma is used when the noun is feminine, indicated in the dictionary by the letter f. “J’aime ma tante” means ""I like my aunt."" Again, it matters that aunt is a feminine noun, not that you are a man or a woman.
Mes indicates a possessive plural noun, such as “my aunts” or “my cats.” You would say “j’aime mes tantes” or “j’aime mes chats.”

, The phrase “je suis” (zhe swee) followed by an adjective can indicate your general interests. Note the suffix should change depending on whether you are a man or a woman. The dictionary typically lists the male version first and the female second. “Je suis sportif” (sporteef) for men or “je suis sportive” (sporteev) for women means “I am athletic.”If this is too challenging it may be easier to use the above recommendations for sharing hobbies, simply saying “I like sports” or “j’aime les sports.”
This construction also works to describe personality traits. For example gentil/gentille (zhantee/zhanteel) means nice. You would say “je suis gentil” if you are a man or ""je suis gentille"" for a woman.

Mention where you're from.,
If appropriate, mention how old you are.,
Introduce other people with you.,
Ask a few basic questions.",How to Introduce Yourself in French2," This is one of the most common questions asked among people meeting for the first time. Since you're not a French speaker, the person you're talking to will probably be even more interested to learn your origins. Use one of the phrases below:



J'habite à ______ (I live in ______): Zhah-beet ah (location)


Je vis à ______ (I live in ______): Zhuh veez ah (location)


Je suis de ______ (I'm from ______): Zhuh swee duh (location)

Put the name of your city, state, or country in the blank. For example, if you're from the U.S. you might say, ""Je suis des États-Unis.""

, This isn't always a topic of conversation that will come up, but if you're a young person meeting people who are older than you, it's nice to know how to say. Use the easy phrase below:



J'ai ___ ans (I'm ___ years old): Zheh (number) ahn. The final n is very delicate — more or less silent.
Put the number of years old you are in the blank. See our guide to counting in French for help.

, Being able to introduce other people is almost as important as being able to introduce yourself — especially if they're not great French speakers. Use the phrases below to make introductions between people you know and people you don't:Je vous présente ______ (I present you ______): Zhuh voo preh-zont (name and/or title)


Voici ______ (Here is ______): Vwuh-see (name and/or title)

After you say someone's name, you may want to describe your relationship with this person in a few words. For instance, you might say ""Voici Emma, ma femme"" (""Here is Emma, my wife"").

, Once introductions are out of the way, the conversation itself can commence. Below are just a few basic questions you may want to have ready — you don't need to be perfectly fluent to show you're interested in learning more about the person you're meeting.



Comment vous appelez-vous? (What is your name?): Co-mahnt vooz ah-play-voo?


D'où êtes-vous ? (Where are you from?): Doo eht-voo?Quel est votre profession? (What do you do for a living?): Kell ay vote-ruh pro-fess-yone?


Comment allez-vous? (How are you?): Co-mahnt ah-lay-voo?

Add the endings to the infinitive form of the er or ir verbs.",How to Conjugate French Verbs Into Future Tense,", Remove the 'e' before appending the suffix to an '-re' verb.


Example: PARLER: Je parlerai, tu parleras, il/elle/on parlera, nous parlerons, vous parlerez, ils/elles parleront
With IR: FINIR: je finirai, tu finiras, il/elle/on finira, nous finirons, vous finirez, ils/elles finiront

Add -iens to say ""I hold"" or ""you hold."",
Use the -ient ending to say ""he/she holds."",
Add -enons to say ""we hold."",
Say ""you all hold"" by adding -enez.,
Use the -iennent ending for ""they hold.""",How to Conjugate Tenir1," For present tense, the verb form for first person and second person is the same. Only the pronoun you use will be different. ""I hold"" is ""je tiens"" and ""you hold"" is ""tu tiens.""Keep in mind that the tu form is considered informal, and should only be used when talking to children or people you know well. If you're talking to an older person or an authority figure, it's better to use ""vous."";
, Conjugate tenir as ""il tient"" if you want to say ""he holds,"" or ""elle tient"" for ""she holds."" Remember that in French objects also have a gender, so use the appropriate pronoun.For example, if you wanted to say ""that box holds my papers,"" you might say ""cette boîte tient mes papiers"" or ""elle tient mes papiers,"" since the word boîte is feminine.
You also could say ""cette boîte contient mes papiers."" Contient is the conjugation for the compound verb contenir, which means the same as the English verb contain. It is conjugated the same as the verb tenir.

, For the first person plural conjugation, you would use ""nous tenons"" to mean ""we hold."" Note that you don't include an i here, as you did with first, second, and third person singular., If you are addressing several people, or you're talking to an authority figure and want to use the more formal version of you, conjugate tenir as ""vous tenez."", The i returns for the third person plural form of tenir in present tense. To say ""they hold"" you would either say ""ils tiennent"" or ""elles tiennent"" depending on the gender of the group.Use ils if you are talking about a mixed-gender group. This also applies if you are referring to several objects that have both masculine and feminine nouns."
"
Use the -ins ending to say ""I held"" or ""you held."",
Say ""he/she held"" by adding -int.,
Add -înmes to say ""we held."",
Use the -întes ending to say ""you all held."",
Say ""they held"" by adding -inrent.",How to Conjugate Tenir2," The basic past tense in French is called passé simple and is probably the first past tense conjugation you'll learn. Just as in present tense, the verb form is the same for first and second person.""I held"" would be ""je tins"" and ""you held"" would be ""tu tins."" Remember that French has two pronouns for you – tu is considered both singular and informal.

, If you want to talk or write about another person or thing holding something in the past, you would use ""il tint"" to mean ""he held"" and ""elle tint"" to mean ""she held."" Don't forget about the gender of nouns!, For first person plural, you conjugate tenir as ""tînmes."" So for example, if you wanted to say ""we held hands"" you would say ""nous tînmes les mains."", The pronoun vous is used in French if you are talking to a group of people, or as a more polite or formal version of the pronoun tu. The conjugation for tenir in past tense is ""vous tîntes"" for ""you all held."", When you are talking about some group of people or things, say ""ils tinrent"" or ""elles tinrent"" to mean ""they held,"" depending on the gender of the people or things in the group. Use ils if you are referring to a mixed-gender group."
"
Add -iendrai to say ""I will hold."",
Use the -iendras ending to say ""you will hold."",
Say ""he/she will hold"" by adding -iendra.,
Add -iendrons to say ""we will hold."",
Use the -iendrez ending to say ""you all will hold."",
Say ""they will hold"" by adding -iendront.",How to Conjugate Tenir3," Unlike English, the basic future tense in French doesn't have a helper verb – you just conjugate the verb with a different ending. If you want to say ""I will hold"" in French, you would say ""je tiendrai."", When speaking to a younger person or a friend, if you want to say ""you will hold"" in French, you would say ""tu tiendras."" Remember to use the vous form in circumstances where you need to be more polite or formal in addressing someone.In future tense you use a different ending for the second person ""tu"" than for the first person ""je"" verb form. This is unlike in past and present tenses, where these two endings were the same.

, If you are talking about a third person or an object and want to say ""he or she will hold"" in French, you would say either ""il tiendra"" or ""elle tiendra"" depending on the gender of the person or thing., The first person plural conjugation of tenir is tiendrons. Say ""nous tiendrons"" if you want to say ""we will hold."" Note that unlike in present tense, in future tense this form still includes the i., The French pronoun vous is used when you're talking to several people at once, or to a single person who you want to address more politely or respectfully. To conjugate tenir in future tense, say ""vous tiendrez."", When you're talking about a group of people or objects, say ""ils tiendront"" for a masculine or mixed-gender group, and ""elles tiendront"" for a feminine group."
"
Know that conjugation is when you change a verb based on who it involves.,
Remember the French pronouns.,
Note the infinitive of verbs.,
Recognize the three types of ""regular"" verbs.,
Know what verbs are irregular.",How to Conjugate French Verbs1," We do this in English as well. For example, you would say ""I run,"" but you would add and ""s"" for ""he runs."" Conjugation in French works similarly; for every pronoun (I, he, she, it, we, you) there is a different conjugation.;
, There are more French pronouns then English, but they are still easy to remember:



Je: I

Tu: You

Il, elle, on: He, she, it

Nous: We

Vous: You (plural or formal)

Ils, elles: They (male), they (female).

, An unconjugated verb is called the ""infinitive."" In English you simply at the word ""to,"" so the infinitive is ""to be,"" ""to see,"" or ""to write."" In French the infinitive is one word -- like ""aller"" (to go), ""ouvrir"" (to open) or ""répondre"" (to respond). The infinitive is the base verb, or what changes as you conjugate.For example, in English you would not say, ""He to be,"" you would say ""he is."" This is how we conjugate the verb ""to be"" in English.

, In French the large majority of verbs fall under three categories based on the ending of the infinitive. For each of these three categories there is a set of rules for conjugation.



-er Verbs: This includes verbs like ""parler"" (to talk) and ""manger"" (to eat).

-ir Verbs: This includes verbs like ""applaudir"" (to clap) and ""finir"" (to finish).

-re Vebrs: This includes verbs like ""entendre"" (to hear).

, There are, unfortunately, some verbs in French that no longer use the same rules to conjugate. Almost every tense of these verbs is different, so you often have to look irregular verbs up separately. While by no means exhaustive, this list shows some of the most common irregular verbs:



être: To be

Avoir: To have

Aller: To go

Vouloir: To want

Faire: To make, to do

Mettre: To put, to place."

Learn French idioms that use the verb ""avoir."",
Use avoir to say you need or want something.",How to Conjugate Avoir1," In the first person present tense, the verb avoir takes the form ""ai"" (pronounced ay). Since it starts with a vowel, glide between the pronoun je and the verb – don't say them separately, but treat them as one word.In French, the verb avoir is used when telling people your age. The literal translation would be that you ""have"" a certain number of years. For example, if you say ""J'ai 22 ans,"" it means ""I am 22 years old"" – even though you literally said ""I have 22 years."";
, In any situation where you would use the informal second-person pronoun ""tu,"" conjugate ""avoir"" as ""as."" Pronounce as ""ah,"" keeping the ""s"" silent unless it comes before a word that starts with a vowel., If you want to say someone or something has something, you would say either ""il a"" (he has) or ""elle a"" (she has). Remember that objects have a gender in French.This conjugation is used in a common French idiom, ""il y a,"" which means ""there is"" or ""there are"" (the idiom doesn't change for plural objects). For example, you might say ""il y a plein de poisson"" or ""there are plenty of fish.""

, If you're speaking about you and someone else using first-person plural, conjugate avoir as ""avons"" (AH-vohns). Slur the pronoun and verb together as you say them, with a strong Z sound in between, like ""Noo ZAH-vohns."", The French pronoun ""vous"" can be thought of as second-person plural, when you are addressing a group of people, and also as a more formal way to address a single person.Translate ""vous avez"" either as ""you all have"" or ""you have,"" depending on the context.
When speaking, slur the pronoun and verb together with a pronounced Z sound: ""Voo ZAH-vay.""

, When you are talking about a group of people or objects, you want the third-person plural conjugation of avoir. When referring to a mixed-gender group, always use the masculine pronoun ils.Pronounce these with the same Z sound you used when saying ""vous avez."" Be careful that your Z sound doesn't sound too much like an S sound here. Otherwise ""ils ont"" (they have) can sound more like ""ils sont"" (they are), which will lead to confusion.

, There are a number of idioms and verb phrases that you'll find you use fairly frequently in conversational French. For example, if you wanted to tell someone you were hungry, you might say ""j'ai faim."" This phrase is translated in English to ""I am hungry,"" although a literal translation would be ""I have hunger.""You also could say ""j'ai soif"" (I'm thirsty/I have thirst) or ""j'ai chaud"" (I'm hot/I have heat).

, The words ""want"" and ""need"" are not separate verbs in French as they are in English. Rather, you use a verb phrase including the correctly conjugated form of the verb ""avoir.""For example, if you either need or want chocolate, you would either say ""j'ai besoin de chocolat"" (I need chocolate, or literally ""I have a need of chocolate"") or ""j'ai envie de chocolat"" (I want chocolate, literally ""I have a want of chocolate"").

Use the present tense for current or habitual action.,
Conjugate ""-er verbs"" by replacing the ""er."",
Conjugate ""-ir verbs by replacing the ""ir"".,
Conjugate ""-re"" verbs by replacing the ""re."",
Learn the conjugations for common irregular verbs.",How to Conjugate French Verbs2," The present tense is used similarly in French as in English. Use the present tense to translate phrases like ""I swim in the pool"" or ""He eats fish."" There are three basic types of verbs to conjugate, as well as a handful or ""irregular verbs,"" or verbs that don't follow set rules. The basic types of verbs are:



-er Verbs:""Parler"" (to talk) and ""manger"" (to eat).

-ir Verbs: ""Applaudir"" (to clap) and ""finir"" (to finish).

-re Vebrs: ""Entendre"" (to hear).

, Each pronoun (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) has a different ending that goes in the place of ""-er."" The endings are -e, -e, -es, -ons, -ez, -ent. For example, ""parler"" (to talk), would conjugate as:



First person: ""-e."" Je parle → I talk


Second person: ""-es."" Tu parles → You talk


Third person: ""-e."" Il parle, → He talks.


Plural first person: ""-ons."" Nous parlons → We talk.


Plural second person: ""-ez."" Vous parlez → You all talk.


Plural third person: ""-ent."" Elles parlent → They talk., To do so,add in the following endings, depending on the pronoun: -is, -is, -it, -issons, -issez, -issent. For this example we will use ""applaudir"" (to clap):



First person: ""-is."" J'applaudis → I clap.


Second person: ""-is."" Tu applaudis → You clap.


Third person: ""-it."" Il applaudit → He claps.


Plural first person: ""-issons."" Nous applaudissons → We clap.


Plural second person: ""-issez."" Vous applaudissez → You all clap.


Plural third person: ""-issent."" Ils applaudissent → They clap.


, These are the least common regular verbs, but you still need to know how to conjugate them. The endings are -s, -s, nothing, -ons, -ez, ent. Note how one conjugation, the third person (he/she) does not have an ending. To conjugate an example, ""répondre"" (to respond):



First person: ""-s."" Je réponds → I respond.


Second person: ""-s."" Tu réponds → You respond.


Third person: ""nothing."" Il répond → He responds.


Plural first person: ""-ons."" Nous répondons → We respond.


Plural second person: ""-ez."" Vous répondez → You all respond.

Plural third person: ""-ent."" Elles répondent → They respond.

, There are a lot of irregular verbs, but there are a few that are essential to know moving forward. The rest can be quickly looked up online by trying ""Verb + French Conjugation.""



être (to be): Je suis, tu es, il est, nous sommes, vous êtes, elles sont.

Avoir (to have): J'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons, vous avez, elles ont.

Aller (to go): Je vais, tu vas, il va, nous allons, vous allez, elles vont.

Faire (to make, to do): Je fais, tu fais, il fait, nous faison, vous faites, ils font.

Advanced note: The conjugations of ""être, ""avoir,"" and ""aller"" are necessary for the past and future tenses. To make the future tense, for example, you conjugate

"
"
Use the past tense for simple, complete actions in the past.,
Conjugate the present tense of ""avoir"" to start the passé composé.,
Find the ""past participle"" of your verb.,
Put the two parts together to form the past tense.,
Know the verbs that conjugate with ""être"" instead of ""avoir."",
Replace ""avoir"" with ""être"" for Dr. & Mrs. Vandertramp verbs.",How to Conjugate French Verbs3," The ""passé composé"" is for actions that had a definite beginning and end, such as ""I threw a ball,"" or ""They have baked a cake."" Actions in the past that happen often or habitually (like the weather or your mood) use a different tense. The passé composé is the most common past tense in French.

, The passé compose is a compound tense, which is a fancy way of saying it has two parts. The first part is a conjugated version of ""avoir"" (to have)."" This is similar to English, where you can say ""I have eaten,"" or ""She has run."" This is the first part of your conjugation. As a refresher, the conjugation of ""avoir"" is:



Avoir (to have): J'ai, tu as, il a, nous avons, vous avez, elles ont.

, Think of the English expression, ""I have eaten."" Notice how ""eaten"" is not like any other conjugation for the verb ""to eat."" French does the same thing -- there is a different ending for the past tense of verbs. Luckily, they are easy to remember:



-Er verbs, ""-é."" Examples: parlé, montré, decidé.

-Ir verbs, ""-i."" Examples: fini, réussi.

-Re verbs, ""-u"" Examples: entendu, répondu.

, Simply add your conjugation of ""avoir"" to your past participle to form the past tense. While the literal translation will always be ""I have talked,"" or ""they have listened,"" this tense can also translate to ""I talked,"" or ""they listened."" Several examples from different verbs:



First person: ""ai + verb."" J'ai parlé → I talked.


Second person: ""as + verb."" Tu as fini → You finished.


Third person: ""a + verb."" Il a entendu → He heard.


Plural first person: ""avons + verb."" Nous avons réussi → We succeeded.


Plural second person: ""avez + verb."" Vous avez essayé → You all tried.


Plural third person: ""-ont + verb."" Elles ont répondu → They responded.


, The formula ""avoir + past participle works for 95% of French verbs. However, there are a selection of verbs that must use ""être + past participle"" (to be) to be put in the simple past tense. The translation is still in the past (""I fell""). These verbs are:


Devenir, Revenir, Monter, Rester, Sortir, Venir, Aller, Naître, Descendre, Entrer, Rentrer, Tomber, Retourner, Arriver, Mourir, Partir
A helpful way to remember these verbs is by the acronym, Dr. & Mrs. Vandertramp. You'll notice the list above is already in this order.
Grammatically, these verbs are known as ""intransitive verbs."", Once you remember which verbs need ""être"" (to be), add the past participle to make the past tense. Note, however, that the verb has to match the subject. Plural phrases get an ""-s"" and expressions about females get an extra ""-e""



First person: ""suis + verb."" Je suis tombée → I fell. (""I"" refers to a woman.)

Second person: ""es + verb."" Tu es tombé → You fell.


Third person: ""est + verb."" Il est tombé → He fell.


Plural first person: ""sommes + verb."" Nous sommes tombés → We fell.


Plural second person: ""etes + verb."" Vous êtes tombés → You all fell.


Plural third person: ""sont + verb."" Elles sont tombées → They fell.

"
Say ""j'avais"" (pronounced ""zh'AH-vay"") to mean ""I had."",
Use ""il avait"" or ""elle avait"" to say ""he had"" or ""she had."",
Conjugate the verb avoir as avions to speak in first-person plural.,
Use ""vous aviez"" for ""you all had."",
Choose ""ills avaient"" or ""elles avaient"" to say ""they had.""",How to Conjugate Avoir2," In French, the imperfect tense is closest to what you would think of as basic past tense in English. Use ""j'avais"" to talk about something you had at some point in the past.The verb avoir is conjugated the same for the second-person singular pronoun tu. Don't slur the pronoun and the verb together in speech as you would for the first-person singular.

, When talking about a third person or an object, use this conjugation of the verb avoir. Pronounce this word ""AH-vay,"" leaving the ""t"" at the end silent., If you want to talk about how you and someone else together had something in the past, you would say ""nous avions,"" or ""we had."", If you're addressing a group of people, you would use the second-person plural pronoun ""vous."" This pronoun also is appropriate in more formal situations, or if you're addressing an authority figure.Pronounce ""vous aviez"" as ""voo ZAH-vee-yay,"" blending the pronoun and verb together with a strong Z sound between them.

, Conjugate avoir as avaient (pronounced ""AH-vay"") to talk about how the group had something in the past.Blend the pronoun and the verb together with a Z sound when you speak. Make sure it's a hard Z sound that wouldn't be confused with an S.
Because so many conjugations of avoir are pronounced the same way (AH-vay), pay close attention to spelling when you are writing.

"
"
Use ""j'aurai"" to say ""I will have."",
Say ""tu auras"" for ""you will have."",
Choose ""il aura"" or ""elle aura"" for third-person future tense.,
Say ""nous aurons"" to mean ""we will have."",
Use ""vous aurez"" when addressing a group.,
Choose ""ils auront or ""elles auront"" to mean ""they will have.""",How to Conjugate Avoir3," In French, unlike in English, the basic future tense does not use a helping verb. If you want to talk about something you will have at some point in the future, use this conjugation.Pronounce ""j'aurai"" as ""ZHOR-ay.""

, When you're addressing one person and want to talk about how they will have something in the future, conjugate avoir as ""aura"" (pronounced OHR-ah). Remember that the s at the end is silent., Since all objects have a gender, if you want to talk about how someone or something will have something in the future, use whichever gender is appropriate.For example, suppose you're talking to a friend about a boat you're going to buy. The French word for boat is masculine, ""le bateau,"" so when you talk about the features the boat will have, you would say ""il aura,"" or ""it will have."" Even though you used the masculine pronoun, you wouldn't translate the word directly as ""he"" in this context.

, When you are speaking about what you and another person will have in the future, conjugate avoir as aurons. Pronounce this conjugation ""OHR-ohn,"" keeping the s silent.For example, you might say ""nous aurons le poisson,"" or ""we will have the fish.""

, If you are talking to a group of people, and want to tell them about what they will have someday, use the second-person plural vous. This pronoun also is appropriate when you are speaking to someone formally, such as an authority figure., When speaking about a group of others, choose the pronoun that represents the gender of the entire group. Use ils for mixed-gender groups.The conjugation ""auront"" is pronounced ""OHR-ohn,"" with the t remaining silent.

"
"
Know that the imperfect past refers to things that happened over a span of time.,
Find the ""stem"" of verbs by dropping the ""-ons"" from the present ""nous"" form.,
Add the imperfect endings to your stem to get the imperfect tense.",How to Conjugate French Verbs4," Though this seems tricky, it is actually simple in practice. The imperfect tense is used for things that happened in the past, but not at a specific time. For example, phrases like, ""when I was 10, I played hide and seek,"" or ""Every week, they ate Chinese food."" These expression could refer to one of the many times you played hide and seek, or the broader habit of ordering Chinese food.



Use Imperfect for: States of being, weather, habitual actions, emotions, age, background information.The simple past is for the events of a story (I bought candy, I ate it), and the imperfect is for background information (I was ten, I went to the store after school each day, it was sunny).

, This works for irregular verbs as well. Start the imperfect by dropping the ""-ons"" from the nous form. The same same thing happens in English: the stem of ""to walk,"" for example, is walk (walk, walks, walked, walking, etc.). Examples include:


Parler: Parlons → ""parl""

Finir: Finissons → ""finniss""

Entendre: Entendons → ""entend""

Avoir: Avons → ""av""

Faire: Faisons → ""fais""

The only exception to this rule is ""être, since the nous form (""nous sommes"") does not have an ""ons."" The stem of être is ""ét.""


, Unlike the passé composé, the imperfect tense is only one word. Simply add the endings to your stem and you've finished. The imperfect endings are ""-ais, -ais, -ait, -ions, -iez, -aient."" Using the verb ""regarder"" (to watch) as an example:



First person: ""-ais."" Je regardais → I was watching.


Second person: ""-ais."" Tu regardais &rarr: You were watching.


Third person: ""-ait."" Il regardait → He was watching.


Plural first person: ""-ions."" Nous regardions → We were watching.


Plural second person: ""-iez."" Vous regardiez → You all were watching.


Plural third person: ""-aient."" Elles regardaient → They were watching.


"
"
Express the near future with ""aller + infinitive of verb."",
Add future endings to the infinitive form to make future tense.,
Recognize the words with irregular future stems.,
Know that both clauses of a sentence need to be in the future tense, or neither.",How to Conjugate French Verbs5," This simple construction literally translates as ""is going to do,"" and is used similarly in English. For example, use the near future for sentences like ""I am going to run,"" ""She will eat,"" or ""they are going to study,"" basically any sentence where the action is going to take place soon. To use the near future tense, simply conjugate ""aller"" in the present tense and add your unconjugated verb. The example uses the verb ""nager"" (to swim).



First person: ""vais + verb."" Je vais nager → I am going to swim.


Second person: ""vas + verb."" Tu vas nager → You are going to swim.


Third person: ""va + verb."" Il va nager → He is going to swim.


Plural first person: ""allons + verb."" Nous allons nager &rarr: We are going to swim.


Plural second person: ""allez + verb."" Vous allez nager → You all are going to swim.


Plural third person: ""vont + verb."" Elles vont nager → They are going to swim.


, Remember that the infinitive is the normal version of the verb, like ""parler,"" ""finir,"" or ""enterndre."" The future stem always ends in an ""r,"" so you must eliminate the ""e"" in verbs like ""entrendre to continue. However, there is only one set of endings for every future tense verbs: ""-ai, -as, -a, -ons, -ez, -ont."" The following example uses ""nager"" (to swim):



First person: ""-ai."" Je nagerai → I will swim.


Second person: ""-as."" Tu nageras &rarr: You will swim.


Third person: ""-a."" Il nagera → He will swim.


Plural first person: ""-ons."" Nous nagerons → We will swim.


Plural second person: ""-ez."" Vous nagerez → You all will swim.


Plural third person: ""-ont."" Elles nageront → They will swim.


, There are, of course, exceptions to the rules. There are only a few, however, and a Some examples and their future stems include:


être → serr-

Voir → verr-

Pouvoir → pourr-

Voulor → voudr-

Aller → ir-, This is one instance where French and English differ. For example, English speakers would say, ""When she finishes, they will eat dinner,"" with the first half in the present tense (she finishes) and the second in the future (they will eat). In French you would say, ""Quand elle finira, elles mangeront.""

"
"
Use the subjunctive tense for uncertain or subjective actions and ideas.,
Know that all subjunctive phrases start with the ""que."",
Find the ""stem"" of verbs by dropping the ""-ent"" from the present ""ils/elles"" form.,
Add the subjunctive endings to complete the subjunctive tense.,
Know what verbs are irregular in the subjunctive.,
Memorize the the conjugations for ""etre"" and ""avoir.""",How to Conjugate French Verbs6," The subjunctive is used to express sentences like ""I want you to do something,"" ""It is necessary that we talk,"" or ""she hopes that he ______."" Unfortunately, there is no real subjunctive tense in English to compare with the French. The easiest way to comprehend the subjunctive is to read French and speak to French speakers, noting where they use it.The most common phrases that use subjunctive are ""il faut que + pronoun + subjunctive verb"" (""It's necessary that someone does (verb)"") and ""je veux que + pronoun + subjunctive verb"" (""I want someone to do (verb)"")

, Before conjugating any subjunctive phrase, remember that the subjunctive tense always begins with ""que,"" which translates as ""that"" or ""who/whom.""


Examples: Il faut que, (it is necessary that), aimer mieux que (prefer that)

, This works for irregular verbs as well. Start conjugating subjunctive by dropping the ""-ent"" from the plural 3rd person verb form. The same same thing happens in English: the stem of ""to walk,"" for example, is walk (walk, walks, walked, walking, etc.). Examples include:


Parler: Parlent → ""parl""

Finir: Finissent → finniss""

Entendre: Entendent → ""entend""'


, There is only one set of endings for the subjunctive tense in French. They are ""-e, -es, -e, -ions, -iez, -ent."" Remember to add the ""que"" as well. The following examples translate the phrase ""it is necessary that (I, you, she, they, etc.) talks.""



First person: ""-e."" Il faut que je parle → It is necessary that I talk.


Second person: ""-es."" Il faut que tu parles → It is necessary that you talk.


Third person: ""-e"" Il faut que il parle → it is necessary that he talks.


Plural first person: ""-ions."" Il faut que nous parlions → It is necessary that we talk.


Plural second person: ""-iez.""Il faut que vous parliez → It is necessary that you all talk.

Plural third person: ""-ent.""Il faut que elles parlent → It is necessary that they talk.

, Any verb that does not end in ""-ent"" in the present tense 3rd person plural (""They,"" or ""Ils/Elles"") has an irregular stem. Luckily, the endings are still the same. Some common verbs include:


Faire → fass-""

Savoir &rarr: sach-

Pouvoir → puiss-


Advanced Tip:' There are also several words that have two stems -- one singular and one plural. In this case, use the nous form, minus ""-ons"" and the same ending (Ex. buvoir &rarr: boiv & buv), These are the only two verbs that are completely different in the subjunctive. Unfortunately, they are also some of the most common words in French. To conjugate them:



Etre: je sois, tu sois, il soit, nous soyons, vous soyez, elles soient.

Avoir: j'aie, tu aies, il ait, nous ayons, vous ayez, elles aient.

Use Cockney dialect.,
Voice vowels differently.,
Use glottal stops.,
Drop your Hs from the beginnings of words.,
Don't pronounce Rs at the ends of words.,
Drop the G from -ing endings.,
Pronounce some short As as ""ah"".",How to Speak with a Cockney Accent," Part of pulling off a convincing accent is using the correct dialect along with it. Parts of Cockney dialect include:


Use of ""ain't"" instead of ""isn't""/""is not.""
Use of double negatives (such as ""I didn't see nothing!"").
Using ""me"" instead of ""my"" (""I'm going on a walk with me dog"" or ""I'm wearing me best suit"").
Cockney rhyming slang is another aspect of Cockney dialect. To people from other countries, rhyming slang may seem nonsensical, but the concept is fairly simple. One common example of rhyming slang is ""apples and pears."" The last word in this phrase, ""pears,"" rhymes with the figurative meaning - ""stairs."" Other common examples of Cockney rhyming slang include:

""Ruby"" (short for ""Ruby Murray"") = curry
""Adam and Eve"" = believe
""Kettle and Hob"" = watch (""hob"" rhymes with ""fob,"" an old term for a pocket watch)
""Butcher's"" or ""Butcher's Hook"" = look
""Trouble and Strife"" = wife

;

""Glottal stop"", for instance, would be pronounced ""glo'le stop.""
A common example you may be familiar with: ""Scottish"" would be pronounced ""Sco'ish.""

, Some dialects pronounce herb as ""'erb"" (in some forms of American English, for instance. Do this for other words that begin with H. ""Horse"" becomes ""'orse,"" ""hopefully"" becomes ""'opefully.""

, This is common to most British accents. ""Mother"" becomes ""MO-thah."" ""Anger"" becomes ""AN-ga.""

, Thus ""starting"" becomes ""startin',"" ""laughing"" becomes ""laughin',"" and so on.

, This may sound a bit cryptic, but it isn't too complicated. Think about the word ""cat."" This is the typical short-A sound. Now think of the word ""father."" The ""ah"" in ""father"" is how you should voice the short As in ""bath,"" ""can't,"" and ""apples.""

Learn the importance of “I-tal”.,
Understand the role of cannabis in Rastafarian culture.,
Become familiar with the idea of “everliving life”.",How to Speak Rastafarian English," Rastafarian survives as a spoken language, so pronunciation is very important when trying to speak Rastafarian.


In Rastafarian, you do not pronounce “h” in English words. So “thanks” becomes “tanks”, “three” becomes “tree”, etc.
Similarly, Rastafarians do not pronounce “th” in English words. So, “the” become “di”, “them” becomes “dem”, and “that” becomes “dat”.;
, In Rastafarian, “I and I”, pronounced “eye an’ eye”, is an important term. It refers to the oneness of Jah (Rastafari for their “God”, the Ethiopian Emperor Ras Tafari Haile Selassie I)in every person. “I and I” is a term that reinforces the Rastafarian belief that Jah exists in all people, and everyone exists as one people, unified by Jah.


“I and I” can be used to replace “you and I” in a sentence. Such as,: “And I going to de concert.” This means you and someone else are going to a concert.
But it can also be used when talking about something you are doing alone, or a shorthand for “me, myself, and I”. Such as: “I and I going to de concert”. This means you are going to a concert, on your own.“I” is also used as a play on certain English words, such as “I man” for “inner man”, or a Rastafari believer. Rastas will say “Inity”, instead of “unity”.

, Most Rastafarians do not use certain words in the English language as they have devil-like connotations. For example, the word “hello” is not used because it contains the word “hell” and “lo”, referring to “low”.


To say “hello”, use: “Wa gwaan” or “Yes I”.
To say “goodbye”, use: “Me a go”, or “Lickle bit”.
To say “thank you”, use: “Give thanks” or “Praise Jah”., For example: “Jah Jah protect mi fram mi enemy dem.” In English, this means: “Jehovah protect me from my enemies.”
“Dread” refers to the dreadlocks worn as a spiritual practice by Rastafarians. It is also used to describe something or someone who is a Rastafarian, or seen as a positive influence.
For example: “Dread, mon.” In English, this means: “Cool, man.” Or, “Natty dread.” In English, this means: “You’re cool” or “You’re a Rasta.”
A person who does not have dreadlocks is called a “ball head”, a play on the term “bald head”. For example, Bob Marley sings in his song “Crazy Baldheads”: “Wi guh chase dem crazy Ball head outta town.” This translates to: “We gonna chase those crazy people without dreads out of town”., These are keywords in the Rastafarian, as they refer to important concepts in Rastafarian culture.


“Babylon” is the Rastafarian word for the police, who are viewed by Rastafarians as part of a corrupt government system. “Babylon”, which refers to the Biblical rebellion against God through the Tower of Babel, can also be used to describe any person or organization that oppresses the innocent.
For example: “Babylon deh cum, yuh hav nutten pan yuh?” In English, this translates to: “The police are coming, do you have anything on you?”
“Politricks” is the Rasta term for “politics”. There is a general skepticism of authority figures in Rastafarian, including politicians. So they are seen as tricksters, or full of “tricks”.
“Irie” is one of the most important terms in Rastafarian. It embodies the positive outlook of Rastafarian culture and their belief that “everyting irie” or “everything is alright”.
For example, “Mi nuh have nutten fi complain bout, mi life irie.” In English, this translates to: “I don’t have anything to complain about, my life is good.”

, Rastafarian centers on the idea of oneness with everyone. So Rastas refer to people as their “Idren”, a version of the English word “children.”A boy is called a “bwoy” by a Rasta. A girl is called a “gal” by a Rasta. If a Rasta is asking another Rasta about their children, they will refer to the children as “pickney”, or “gal pickney”.
Rastas refer to adult males as “bredren”. Female adults are called “sistren”.
A Rasta man will refer to their wife or girlfriend as their “empress” or “queen”. For example: “My cyaah cum tomorrow, mi a guh spen sum time wid mi empress.” This translates to: “I can’t come tomorrow, I’m going to spend time with my girlfriend.”, Rastas replace words that have negative terms like “down” or “under” with “up” or “out”. For example:


Rastas will say “downpression” instead of “oppression”. This is because “op” is Rastafarian for “up”, so “downpression” indicates something is holding someone down.
Rastas will say “overstanding” or “innerstanding” instead of “understanding”.
Rastas will say “outernational” instead of “international”. This indicates the Rasta’s feeling that the rest of the world lies outside their realm or world., There some unique sounding swear words in Rastafarian. They usually refer to bodily harm or bodily functions.


“Fiyah bun” is an expression used to strongly denounce someone or something.
For example: “Fiyah bun babylon kaaz dem eva deh taament people.” This translates to: “I denounce the police because they are always tormenting poor people.”“Bag o wire” is expression that refers to a “betrayer” or “traitor”. This is a reference to a close friend of the black political leader Marcus Garvey, who betrayed him by giving away details of his escape plan.For example: “Mi nuh truss deh bredren deh kaaz him a bag o wire.” This translates to: “I don’t trust that man because he is a traitor.”
“Bumba clot” or “Rass clot” are very strong curse words in Rastafarian. “Clot” is considered a nasty sounding word and can be tied to the verb “to clout”, or “to hit or strike”. It can also refer to a used tampon, which is where the nasty aspect of the word comes from., In Rastafarian, you would greet a friend on the street by saying “Bredren, wa gwaan?”


The other Rasta may respond with: “Bwai, ya done know seh mi deya gwaan easy."" This means: “""I’m here just taking it easy.""

, In Rastafarian, you would ask someone where they are from or where they were born by saying: “A weh ya baan?”


The other Rasta may respond with: “Mi baan inna Kingston”, which translates to: “I was born in Kingston.”

, A Rastafarian will end a casual conversation with:


""Yeh man, lickle more, seen?"" This translates to: “Ok see you later.”
The other Rasta may then respond: ""Lickle more."" This translates to: “For sure, see you later.”
A conversation in Rastafarian may go something like this:""Bredrin, wa gwaan?""
""Bwai, ya done know seh mi deya gwaan easy.""
""Yes I, a so it go still. Not 'n na gwaan, but we a keep di faith, nuh true?""
""True. How de pickney dem stay?""
""Bwai, dem aright.""
""Yeh man, lickle more, seen?""
""Lickle more.""
The translation of this in English would be:
""What 's up, man?""
""Not much, just taking it easy.""
""Yeah, that 's how it is. Times are hard but we have to keep the faith, isn't that right?""
""Yeah. How are your kids?""
""They're alright.""
""Great, see you later.""
""See you later.""

, The Rastafarian language grew out of the Rastafarian movement, a religious and social movement based in Jamaica. Though largely unorganized, the Rastafarians are united on several strong beliefs:The belief in the beauty of black people’s African heritage.
The belief that Ras Tafari Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, is the Biblical Messiah. He is also referred to as the Conquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah. This is why the lion is seen as a powerful symbol by Rastafarians.
The belief in repatriation to Ethiopia, also referred to by Rastas as “Zion”, the true home and redemption of black people.
The belief in the eventual fall of “Babylon”, the corrupt world of the white man, and a reversal of the power structure of slave and master.

, The Bible is the main holy text for Rastafarians. This is why Bob Marley’s lyrics, for example, are full of Biblical references to Exodus and the Holy Land.Rastas take Biblical study very seriously and will cite and discuss scriptural passages. They believe the scriptures tell the true story of the black man’s history. They also feel Christian ministers have misled people by providing incorrect interpretations of the Bible, especially the use of the Bible to justify slavery.
Rastas also refer to other official documents like The Promised Key and The Living Testament of Rasta-for-I. But most scholars agree no central doctrine of Rastafarian exists, as Rastas are against following organized systems or schools of thought. Instead, Rastas believe a person should engage in reflection and interpretation of their experience and form their own personal convictions about the Rasta beliefs.

, Rastas use the word “I-tal” to refer to food that is in its natural state. ""I-tal"" food has not touched modern chemicals and contains no preservatives, condiments, or salt.Most Rastas follow the “I-tal” practice and some are vegetarians. Meat-eating Rastas usually abstain from eating pork, as pigs are seen as scavengers of the dead.
Alcohol, coffee, milk, and flavored beverages like soda are also considered not “I-tal”.
Often, Rastas will say: “Man a rasta man, mi only nyam ital food.” This translates to: “I am a Rastafarian, I only eat natural foods.”, We all know the familiar image of a Rasta with dreads smoking weed or “herb” as Rastas call it. Besides making you feel “irie”, the smoking of marijuana or “ganja” plays an important role in Rastafarian life. It is considered a sacred ritual in Rasta culture.


For Rastas, the “holy herb” is highly valued for its physical, psychological, and therapeutic powers., Rastas embrace the idea of an “everliving life” instead of an “everlasting life”. They do not believe in the end of life, or “last” part of life. Instead, Rastas believe in a continually living life, or having an immortal life.This does not necessary mean Rastas believe they will live forever. But they consider “everlasting life” a negative outlook on the fullness or “living”-ness of life."

Find a partner to practice with.",How to Speak Old English," Old English vowels are quite different from Modern English, and it's important to pronounce them as distinctly as you can. Many words change meaning if you mispronounce the vowel, even if it sounds like the same letter in Modern English. Here's the list, with examples from the Mid-Atlantic American accent:



a as in father; in the international phonetic alphabet

æ as in cat e as in fate i as in feet o as in boat u as in tool y as in the German über or French tu . Move your lips as though you were saying ""oo,"" but make an ""ee"" sound instead.;
, Most Old English consonants are pronounced the same as they are in Modern English. Here are the exceptions:The letters Ð ð (""eth"") and Þ þ (""thorn"") are used for ""th."" These are interchangable; replacing an ð with þ does not change the meaning, and either can be pronounced as in ""that"" or ""thin,"" depending on the word.

h is pronounced with a throaty rasp, as in Scottish ""loch.""

c is pronounced sometime as a k, and sometimes as a ch as in chin. Some texts write the ""ch"" pronunciation as ċ, a c with a dot over it.

g is pronounced sometimes as the g in goal, and sometimes as the y in yes. The y pronunciation is sometimes written with a dot over it, ġ.

, Texts meant for students will mark ""long"" vowels with a dash (ā), and leave short vowels unmarked. This literally refers to the length of time you pronounce the vowel. The pronunciation guide above applies to both long and short vowels; just hold the longer one for a moment. Using the wrong type of vowel can change the meaning of the word.


If this is too difficult for you, you can use a less accurate pronunciation that follows a more Modern English style of short and long vowels. For example, pronounce a short e as in ""bet"" and a long ē as in ""fate.""
If your text does not mark vowel length, you can look up the word in an Old English dictionary to find a pronunciation guide.

, When you see the same consonant written twice, pronounce it twice, ""sticking"" on the sound to use it as the end of one syllable as well as the beginning of the next syllable. Try saying ""big gun"" or ""hat trick"" in English to get a feel for this sound.

, You've already learned all you need to know to pronounce the letters in this word. Here are some words to read, pronunciations in Mid-Atlantic American dialect, and definitions:hām (khaawm): home
læn (lan): loan (short ae)

nædre (naad-rey): snake (long ae)
pipor (pee-poar): pepper
slīm (sleeem): slime
snoru (snoa-roo): daughter-in-law
rūh (roookh): shaggy
mys (mös): mouse (long y)


, At the beginning or end of words, these are pronounced ""unvoiced"" as in father, sight, and thick. When they show up between vowels or other voiced sounds, these are ""voiced,"" pronounced as in vulture, zoo, and that. If you haven't guessed it already, any sound made with your vocal chords is ""voiced,"" and any sound made with just an airy breath is ""voiceless."" Try these examples:


fēdan (feey–dan): to feed
lufu (loo–voo): love
slīdan (sleee–dan): to slide
mēsan (meey–zan): a dining table
pæð (paath): path (pronounce th as in path)

leðer (ley–theyr): leather (pronounce th as in leather)


, As mentioned earlier, g and c can be pronounced in different ways. It's not always possible to tell which pronunciation to use without looking it up, but here's a guide that works for many words:C is usually a ""k"" sound before a consonant, or when next to a back vowel (a, æ, o, u, y): clif (kleef) = cliff; staca (sta-ka) = stake; cū (kooo) = cow
C is usually a ""ch"" sound when next to a front vowel (i or e): brēc (breeych) = breeches; ceris (chey–rees) = cherry.
G is usually a hard ""g"" sound before a consonant, before a back vowel (a, æ, o, u, y), and after n: grund (groond) = ground; gāt (gaat) = goat; þing (theeng) = thing.
G is usually a ""y"" next to a front vowel (i or e): bodig (boa–dee-y) = body; segel (sey-yeyl) = sail; gingra (yeen–gra) = younger.
G following a back vowel or consonant (besides n) is pronounced as , a sound that no longer exists in English. Just use the sound ""wa"" for now, or practice raising your tongue in a ""k"" position while saying ""ch"" as in ""loch.""

, These are practically the only combinations of letters that change sound when put together. Any other combination of consonants (no matter how difficult it seems!) is pronounced as it looks. Here are the two exceptions:CG is pronounced as the dg in edge: hrycg (khrödg) = ridge
SC is pronounced as the sh in show: scinu (shee-noo) = shin

, Few people can hold a conversation in Old English. Reading aloud is the first stage to learning spoken Old English, and as close as most students get. You can find useful phrases in Old English here and texts at sacred-texts.com or the University of Calgary website, but a physical student text with long vowel marks and an English translation will be easiest to follow. Here's your first snippet, the opening lines of Beowulf:Hwæt! We Gar-Dena in gear-dagum / þeod-cyninga, þrym gefrunon / hu ða æþelingas ellen fremedon!
""Yo! We have heard tell of the majesty of the Speardanes, of the Folk-kings, how the princes did valorous deeds.""Search for Beowulf recitations online to see whether you have the right pronunciation.

, Order a Old English to Modern English dictionary from an online bookstore, and use it to work your way through an Old English text. Study the vocabulary as you would a foreign language.


You can also use online dictionaries, such as the Bosworth-Toller Anglo-Saxon Dictionary, or the John R. Clark Hall dictionary. Due to copyright reasons, almost all of these are from the 19th and early 20th century. These will work fine, but they may not always agree with a more modern dictionary that benefits from another hundred years of scholarship.

, Search for online videos of scholars reciting Old English texts, such as Beowulf or the Exeter Book. Repeat what they say to practice Old English sounds, and make the poetry feel more alive.


Many videos will not perfectly match what you learned here. Different scholars and linguists have different ideas about how Old English would have been spoken. There is also variation between different regions or time periods of Old English, and usually some hints of the reader's original accent.

, This guide has not even begun to touch on how to put an original sentence together, or how to translate a passage. This is a massive topic that's best left to a longer book. Look for a beginner's guide to Old English if you want to become a true student of the language.


Here's one basic difference between Old and Modern English: Old English uses ""declensions"" instead of word order.This means the ending of every noun changes to show where it belongs in the meaning of the sentence. If you can't find a word in the dictionary, look for a word that looks similar, but has a different ending.

, Learning to speak a language is very hard when you have no one to speak it to. For a dead language like Old English, it can be tricky to find a partner. Your best chance might be searching for other students online. University students in England working toward English degrees often learn Old English.


There are also Old English communities on social media and video-sharing sites. Join them and ask for help finding resources.

Use standard English.,
Keep proper pronunciation in mind.,
Keep proper spelling in mind.,
Watch major network TV news, and other programming that uses Standard English.,
Expose yourself to writing to pick up structures, tones, and ideas.,
Listen to talk radio, podcasts, and audio books.

,
Read aloud, with intonation.,
Build your vocabulary.,

Do not be afraid to make mistakes.,
Try learning another language.",How to Learn Perfect English As a Native English Speaker," Avoid nonstandard (i.e., ungrammatical) forms such as “ain’t”, “can’t hardly”, “can’t seem to”, “irregardless”, and “anyways”. See the list below (“Nonstandard and Questionable Usage”) and How to Use Commonly Misused Words. Consult a dictionary for proper usage and a style manual, such as Strunk and White’s Elements of Style.;
, For most words that can be pronounced more than one way (such as ""either""), all the different pronunciations are correct. For a few, such as ""mischievous"", one pronunciation is preferred.

, For words like ""Color"", all the different spellings are fine, but for ""jail"", one spelling is preferred., Newscasters in particular are very careful to present language that is grammatically clear and well articulated. Therefore, it is usually recommended to people trying to learn Standard English to watch such news programs. Certain other television shows will present very good Standard English, however television ranges wildly in terms of proper English usage., Not everything in print is perfect, but the vast majority of printed works, such as books and magazines, have been thoroughly edited. Look at what makes good writing good. As you read more, mistakes and problems will start to ""look"" or ""sound"" wrong to you. Correctness will start to feel natural.


If you want to write with a particular style or in a particular genre, read things that are related to that. You will tend to adopt styles and ideas from what you read.

,, You can read to your children or even your pets. Reading passages aloud is one way to interpret their structures, and it will make you more conscious of their details. It will improve your speech, especially if you are hesitant when you speak or say ""uh"" and ""um"". If you practice reading aloud, you will be less likely to stammer or pause when you speak. You will find yourself saying words carefully instead of slurring them together.

, Reading will expose you to a far wider range of words than conversation or spoken media, such as radio or television. Collect words that you do not know. Also browse the dictionary, play word games (such as Hangman, Fictionary, and Freerice), and subscribe to a word of the day.

, Start a pun war. Dust off your Scrabble game. Invent your own word. Try your hand at a garden path sentence, write your own aprosdoketon, or enter the Bulwer-Lytton contest for bad prose or one of its imitators.

, Write for a journal, blog, or wiki. Wikis, especially, need writers and frequently come with a whole community of editors who will help you. Whatever and wherever you write, practice daily, if possible. In email and text messages, use complete sentences. That counts as writing, too.

, Just as you wear different clothing for different weather, you should write or speak differently depending upon your audience. Is this communication factual or fanciful? Are you telling a story, arguing a point, or explaining a procedure?

, As you proofread, you can see what kinds of mistakes you make often. Read your composition aloud. You may find a grammatical error when something that you read does not sound right.

, That fear may keep you from writing well. Language takes extraordinary amounts of practice to master, and mistakes are part of the learning process.

, It will make you more conscious of the structures and grammar in your own. Many of the Latin-based and Germanic languages have words and structures similar to those in English, and exploring these similarities and differences will strengthen both languages.

Bien is usually used to mean ""well"" or ""good,"" but it can also mean ""very.""

As such, it is only useful for talking to one person who you are familiar with.Warning: this is very rarely used and you will sound clumsy, awkward. To avoid this, add ""de toi"" at the end of the sentence (pronounced ""deh touah"")

Pronounced ""pron swan."" It sounds bit like a stereotypical French accent saying the English name ""Bronson."" Try to barely pronounce the final ""n"" sound in soin.;
, ""Prenez"" is the vous form of ""prendre,"" which means ""to take."" The vous form is for second-person plural (""you all"") and for the formal tense (anyone you would call ""sir, ""ma'am,"" ""Mr,"" or ""Mrs""). You can use ""prenez soin"" just like you would use the English expression ""take care:""It is more common to add ""de vous"" at the end of the sentence: ""prenez soin"" sound really weird.

Pronounced ""pren-eh swan (deh vou)"" To be extra native sounding, you want a gravelly, guttural sound with the ""n' in prenez, like a stereotypical French accent.

, This is a simple and easy way to spice up your dialogue. Simply go from ""prenez soin de vous"" meaning ""take care,"" to ""prenez bien soin de vous"" meaning ""take good care."" The change is subtle, but you can use it to mix up your phrases.""Bien"" is pronounced bee-en

, The de allows you to add a person, place, or thing, changing the expression to ""take care of ________."" For example, ""prends soin de ma mère"" means ""take care of my mom."" You'll need to conjugate prendre to make the phrase work, changing the verb depending on who you're talking to. Though it is irregular, it is an easy conjugation:



Je Prends

Tu Prends

Il/elle/on Prend

Nous Prenons

Vous Prenez

Ils/Elles Prennent, Just like in English, this is the longer version of the full goodbye. You'll need to conjugate the verb ""prendre,"" of course, to fit the subject of the person you're talking, as well as the subject.



Informal: ""Prends bien soin de toi."" Translates literally as ""take good care of yourself.""

Formal or Plural: ""Prenez bien soin de vous.""

Use ""bonne fête"" in French-speaking Canada.This is the most casual and commonly used way of saying “happy birthday” in French-speaking portions of Canada, like Quebec.",How to Say Happy Birthday in French1,"""This is the first of two standard “happy birthday” greetings used in France.


Note that you can use this saying in Quebec and other French-speaking parts of Canada, but it is not the most common way to offer birthday wishes there.
This phrase translates directly into ""happy birthday.""

Joyeux means ""happy,"" ""joyful,"" or ""gleeful.""

Anniversaire can mean ""birthday"" or ""anniversary,"" but when said alone, it most commonly refers to one's birthday. To refer to a wedding anniversary, you would say ""anniversaire de mariage."";
, This is the second of two standard “happy birthday” greetings used in France.


As with joyeux anniversaire, bon anniversaire can be used and understood in French-speaking parts of Canada, but it is not the most common birthday greeting there.

Bon usually means ""good"" or ""well."" As such, this phrase translates more directly to ""have a good birthday"" rather than ""happy birthday.""

,


Unlike ""joyeux anniversaire"" and ""bon anniversaire,"" ""bonne fête"" cannot be used in both France and Canada. In France, ""bonne fête"" would usually be used when wishing someone a good ""name day."" One's ""name day"" refers to the feast day of the saint one is named after.

Bonne is the feminine form of the word ""bon"", meaning ""good"" or ""well.""

Fête means ""celebration.""
Translated more directly, ""bonne fête"" means ""have a good celebration.""

"
Use ""fais/faites attention à toi/vous"" for a slightly more neutral ""take care."",
Consider other expressions of well-wishing.,
Use other expressions to say ""see you later."",
Don't use ""prends/prenez soin de toi/vous"" in formal letters.",How to Say Take Care in French2," Translating literally as ""watch/look out"" or ""take heed,"" this phrase is a bit less friendly than ""prends soin de toi"" As such, it is a great way to say goodbye to acquaintances or to interchange with ""prends soin de toi"" when you're looking for new vocabulary. Fais is pronouced ""fays,"" and faites is pronounced ""fehts.""


Singular/Informal: Fais attention à toi → Look out (for yourself).
Plural/Formal: Faites attention à vous → Look out (for yourself).""Fais attention!"" is also used to warn people of danger, both in speech and on road signs.
You do pronounce the ""s"" at the end of the first word, since ""attention"" starts with a vowel.

, If you're saying ""take care"" to help someone get better or work through an issue or tough time, you have several other phrases at your disposal. Try out:



Tout le meilleur (Too leh meh-uhr) → All the best

Bonne chance (Bon shan-ce) → Good luck

Avoir la bonne santé (Av-war leh bun san-teh) → Have good health (clumsy, never used by french people, should be avoided)

Meilleurs vœux (Meh-uhr vo-eh) → I send my best wishes., If ""take care"" is how you sign off on a conversation, there are other options. Some similar phrases include:



À bientôt (ah bee-en-toe) → See you soon

À plus tard (ah ploo tar) → Until later (you can drop the ""tard"" for a less formal goodbye)

Je m’en vais (je men vase) → I’m outta here, Because the expression is relatively new in French, it is still a little weird when it is used for letters, coming across as unprofessional and unlearned. Instead, use phrases like:



Bien à toi/Meilleurs voeux (Bee-en ah twah/Meh-uhr vo-eh) → Best wishes

Amitiés (Ahm-ee-teh) → Sincerely, Kindest regards

Avec beaucoup d'amour (Ah-vek bow-coo dam-or) → With lots of love

Grosses bises(Gross beez) → With love and kisses"

Passez is a conjugated form of the French verb ""passer,"" meaning ""pass"" or ""spend.""

Merveilleuse translates into ""wonderful.""

Une journée means ""a day.""

,


Note that this is not an especially common birthday greeting, but it is acceptable to use.

Meilleurs translates into ""best,"" and ""vœux"" translates into ""wishes"" or ""greetings.""

, Use this greeting to congratulate someone on his or her birthday.


This is not an especially common way to wish someone ""happy birthday,"" but it is slightly more common to congratulate someone on his or her birthday in France than in the United States.

Félicitations translates directly to ""congratulations"" in English.

,""This question is used to ask someone how old he or she is.


Only ask this if you know the person well and have already wished him or her a happy birthday. This can easily be misconstrued as rude. You wouldn't ask a stranger how old they are in English, after all!

Quel means ""what"" or ""which.""

One other letter, the Medial(Long-)Es was added by the time of the Early-Modern English, otherwise known as its derogatory name: ""King-James-English;"" it has been added to the following list so that you may recognize it, when reading old English texts:


Ææ = this is an Æsh and it sounds like the “a” in “hat(American Pronunciation)”
Ðð =this is an Ed and it sounds like the “th” in “weather,” or ""the;"" Eth fell out of favor, in place of thorn -- eth was created by drawing a line through a ""d,"" and in writing, you can either write a ""d,"" and draw a line through it, that it looks like a ""đ(d-stroke,)"" or the classic way, as a backwards six with a stroke through it
Þþ = this is a Þorne and it sounds like the ""th"" in ""thorn,"" however the previous letter, eth, fell out of favor, and was replaced with either ""th"" or thorn, by the time of Middle English, soon thorn suffered the same fate...
ſ ʃ = this is a ""Medial-'S,'"" or ""Long-'S.'"" The Long-Es was created as an equal to the primary form of the Greek letter Sigma; the Medial-Es functions exactly the same as the Final-Es, which replaced the Medial-Es -- ""stress,"" by in the time of Early-Modern/Late-Middle English was written: ""ſtreſs,"" the word ""blessings"" was written: ""bleſſings;"" as you have probably figured out, the Capital-'S' was the same, and the Lowercaſe-'s' were the same as they are today -- ""s"" only came at the end of a word, it is a ""Final-Es."" The ""ʃ,"" not to be confused with the African Esh(Sʃ,) was the design of the Medial-Es not common in English, this design was mostly used in Germany.;

Recognize the difficulty of Old English.,
Treat Old English as a foreign language.,
Be prepared for a challenge.,
Look for ways to make Old English fun.",How to Learn Old English3," You may recognize certain basic words in Old English, but a written passage may be impossible to comprehend for a Modern English speaker. Just because Old English is an early version of our modern language doesn’t mean you’ll necessary grasp it quickly, and understanding this can help the ways in which you approach learning it.Learn that the some of the biggest differences come in phonology—Old English is very guttural, much more complex grammar based on proto-Germanic languages, and the largely Germanic vocabulary. Modern English is a much more Latin-based language as a result of the Norman invasion in 1066., Old English will be a foreign language to Modern English speakers. You can adopt many of the strategies commonly used for learning foreign languages to studying Old English.Be prepared to learn everything from the start, including the writing system, grammar, and vocabulary.

Learn the Russian alphabet.,
Learn to count.,
Memorize simple vocabulary.,
Learn some basic conversational phrases.,
Study basic grammar.,
Don't be discouraged!",How to Speak Russian1," The alphabet is a good place to start when you're learning to speak Russian. Russian is a phonetic language, which means that more or less every Russian letter corresponds to a single sound. Once you have learned to pronounce every letter of the alphabet correctly, learn what other sounds the letters can make for example o can be a sometimes in Russian.


The Russian alphabet is derived from the Cyrillic alphabet and consists of 33 letters, including 11 vowels, 20 consonants and 2 letters which make no sound, but make a word sound harder or softer. When learning, it might help to group the letters by look and sound, compared with their English counterparts:

First Group: Written and pronounced the same. Six Russian letters are the same as English in both pronunciation and form - namely A, E, K, M, O and T.Second Group: Look different but sound the same. Sixteen Russian letters have the same pronunciation as English ones, but are symbolized by a completely different letter. These include Б, Г, Д, ё, Ж, П, Ф, И, й, Л, Ц, Ш, Щ, Э, Ю and Я.Third Group: Look familiar but are pronounced differently. Eight Russian letters look very similar to some English letters and numbers but they are pronounced very differently - these are В, З, Н, Р, С, У, Ч, Х.Fourth Group: New letter and unfamiliar sound. There are some Russian letters which do not exist in English at all and either represent unfamiliar sounds or have no sound value - for example: Ы, Ъ, Ь.Mnemonics for the trickiest letters in the third group:В looks like the reels of a video tape, and sounds like one rewinding: V-v-v-v-v.Н sounds like N as in nail, and looks like two planks nailed together.Р is an R that has lost a leg and started Rolling downhill. (This sound is rolled in Russian.)У is a pair of fireworks about to launch; the crowd says oooo when it sees them.
;
, Knowing how to count is an essential skill in any language. Learning Russian numbers can be tricky, as each number has six different forms, depending on how it's used. However, the nominative case is the most widely used and therefore the best place to start.Here's how to count to ten:



One = один, pronounced ""ah-DEEN""

Two = два, pronounced ""dvah""

Three = три, pronounced ""tree""

Four = четыре, pronounced ""chee-TIH-r'eh""

Five = пять, pronounced ""p'aht""

Six = шесть, pronounced ""shehst""

Seven = семь, pronounced ""s'ehm""

Eight = восемь, pronounced ""VOH-s'ehm""

Nine = девять, pronounced ""D'EH-v'uht""

Ten = десять, pronounced ""D'EH-s'uht""

, The wider the vocabulary you have at your disposal, the easier it is to speak a language fluently. Familiarize yourself with as many simple, everyday Russian words as possible - you'll be surprised at how quickly they build up!


Attach little Russian labels to items around your house, such as the mirror, the coffee table and the sugar bowl. You'll see the words so often that you'll learn them without realizing it!
It is important to learn a word or phrase from ‘Russian to English’ as well as ‘English to Russian.’ That way you will remember how to say it, not just recognize it when you hear it., By learning the basics of polite conversation, you'll very quickly be able to interact with Russian-speakers on a simple level. Try learning the words/phrases for:



Hello = Здравствуйте, pronounced,""zdra-stvooy-tye""

Yes = Да, pronounced ""da""

No = Нет, pronounced ""nyet""

Thank you = Спасибо, pronounced ""spuh-SEE-buh""

Please = Пожалуйста, pronounced ""pah-ZHAH-luh-stuh""

My name is... = Меня зовут...pronounced ""men-ya za-voot""

What is your name? = Как вас зовут? pronounced ""kak vas za-voot""

Pleased to meet you = Очень приятно, pronounced ""och-en pree-yat-na""

Okay = Хорошо, pronounced ""ho-ro-sho""

Goodbye = До свидания, pronounced ""da-svee-da-nee-ye"", In order to speak any language correctly, it is necessary to study the grammar particular to that language. Russian grammar can appear quite daunting to an English speaker at first, due to unfamiliar grammatical concepts such as gender and the case system. Don't let it put you off though, once you get the hang of the grammar you'll find that Russian is a very direct and expressive language!



The case system. There are 6 cases in the Russian Case System, the Nominative, the Accusative, the Dative, the Genitive, the Instrumental and the Prepositional. To put it simply, a case is a set of endings that words take to indicate their function and relationship to other words in a sentence.Gender. Like many other languages, every noun in the Russian language is assigned a gender. Russian nouns are divided into three separate genders: masculine, feminine, and neuter (neutral). Sometimes it's easy to guess the gender of a noun, as it relates to physical gender - for example, in Russian the word for father is masculine and the word for mother is feminine. However, with many other nouns gender is assigned arbitrarily - for example, the Russian word for ""home"" is masculine, while the Russian word for ""door"" is feminine. Fortunately for Russian language learners, it is usually possible to tell the gender of a given noun by its spelling.Verbs. One nice thing about Russian is that verbs have only 3 tenses — past, present and future. Russian verbs change their endings depending on the subject. Sometimes this happens in English, but not as much. (Example: I work, he works). There are two patterns of conjugation (or word endings) which are known as the first conjugation, and the second conjugation. There are also a number of irregular verbs that simply need to be learned., If you're serious about learning to speak Russian, keep at it - the satisfaction you'll get from mastering a second language will far outweigh the difficulties you encounter along the way. Learning a new language takes time and practice, it won't happen overnight. If you still need some extra motivation, here are some things that make Russian easier to learn than other languages:


Russian has only three tenses, much fewer than English. For example, in the past tense they do not bother making a distinction between “I was running”, “I had been running”, etc.
Russian does not use articles. (Like “a” and “the”)
Russian uses a much simpler sentence structure than English. In fact, it's usually possible to say exactly what you want in just a few succinct words. For example, in polite English you would need to use a long sentence like “can you please pass me the salt?” However in Russian it's just as polite to say something simple like “give salt please.”"

While common, this phrase is actually considered the least formal way of saying “thank you” in Russian. You can probably get through most conversations using this phrase alone, but if you want to express a deeper sense of formality toward elders or business colleagues, you may need to use something more formal.;
, This is the most basic way to reply ""you're welcome"" in Russian when someone expresses thanks to you.


Pronounce ""пожалуйста"" as: pa-zhal-sta

Note that ""пожалуйста"" also means ""please"" in Russian. The context determines the meaning, so if you say ""пожалуйста"" when no thanks have been exchanged, it could be interpreted as ""please"" instead of ""you're welcome.""

, If you want to express a greater degree of gratitude than usual, you could use this phrase to say ""thank you very much"" or ""many thanks"" in Russian.Pronounce ""Большое спасибо"" as: bal-shoye spa-see-ba

Notice that ""спасибо,"" the basic word for ""thank you,"" lies at the root of this phrase. The term ""Большое"" means ""great"" or ""large,"" so combining the two terms results in a phrase literally meaning ""great thank you.""

, When someone treats you to a remarkable favor, you could use this phrase to say “""thanks a ton"" or ""a giant thank you.” This will express a form of gratitude even greater than that expressed with “Большое спасибо.”Pronounce “ огромное спасибо” as: ah-gro-mnaye spa-see-ba

The term ""огромное"" can be translated as ""huge"" or ""immense."" By attaching it to the root term for ""thank you"" (спасибо), you're directly saying ""a huge thank you.""

, While this is still an informal phrase, you can use it to say ""a thousand thanks"" in Russian.


Pronounce ""Тысяча благодарностей"" as: ty-sya-cha bla-go-dar-no-stee

The term ""Тысяча"" means ""thousand"" and ""благодарностей"" is the noun form of ""gratitude"" or ""thanks,"" so this phrase translates fairly literally into ""a thousand thanks.""

, If you need to decline someone's offer, you could use this phrase to say ""no, thanks.""


Pronounce ""нет, спасибо"" as: nyet spa-see-ba

The term ""нет"" means ""no"" in Russian, so this phrase translates rather literally into ""no, thank you.""

, If you need to express gratitude while showing a greater degree of respect than usual, this is one of the simplest phrases you can use to do so.Pronounce ""Благодарю вас"" as: bla-go-dar-ju vas

The English equivalent of this phrase would be something along the lines of, ""I am much obliged to you.""This phrase would be appropriate to use with business colleagues, elders, or strangers.
Translated more literally, though, this phrase simply means ""thank you"" using polite terms. The word ""Благодарю"" is the formal word for ""thank you,"" and ""вас"" is a term used to emphasize the formal term for ""you.""

, You can use this phrase if you want to say something along the lines of, ""thank you wholeheartedly.""


Pronounce ""Благодарю сердечно"" as: bla-go-dar-ju ser-deesh-nye

This phrase builds off ""Благодарю,"" the polite root phrase for ""thank you."" The term ""сердечно"" comes from the root term for “cardio” or “heart” (сердце) and is often translated as ""cordially"" or ""heartily,"" so a more direct translation of the entire phrase might be ""thank you cordially.""

, Try using this phrase to express extreme, heartfelt thanks in a polite or formal manner. Essentially, you're telling the other person, ""thank you from the bottom of my heart"" or ""thank you with all my heart.""


Pronounce ""Благодарю от всей души"" as: bla-go-dar-ju ot vsey du-shi

This is another phrase that uses the polite ""Благодарю"" as its starting point. The word ""от"" means ""from,"" and ""всей"" means ""all."" A more direct translation of ""души"" would be ""soul,"" but it essentially describes the core of a human being, so you could translate it as ""heart"" in some instances. As such, this phrase literally means ""thank you from all my soul"" or ""thank you from all my heart.""

, If you're looking for a casual way to reply when someone offers a casual expression of gratitude, you could this phrase as a way of saying ""that's all right"" or ""it's my pleasure.""


Pronounce ""Не за что"" as: nye za shta

This phrase does not directly translate into English well. The term ""Не"" means ""not"" or ""no."" The word ""за"" means ""for,"" and ""что"" means ""what"" or ""that."" Essentially, you're saying ""not for that,"" or expressing that thanks aren't needed for these circumstances.

, If you're speaking informally with someone, you can use this phrase as a way of saying ""don't mention it"" after that individual thanks you for something.Pronounce ""да что вы, не стоит меня благодарить"" as: da chto vy, ne stoit men-ya bla-go-dar-it

You could also shorten this phrase to ""да что вы"" in most circumstances.
The direct translation of this phrase gets messy. The first part of the phrase, ""да"" (yes) ""что"" (that/what) ""вы"" (you) mainly exists to acknowledge the thanks. The second part, ""не"" (not) ""стоит"" (should) ""меня"" (me) ""благодарить"" (thank) expresses that the other person should not feel inclined to offer thanks.

, If you want to thank someone in response to the thanks they offered you first, use this phrase as a way of saying, ""I should thank you.""


Pronounce ""это я должен вас поблагодарить"" as: et-oh () ya dol-zhen vas po-bla-go-dar-it

When broken into its separate parts, the English translation becomes somewhat choppy, but the sentiment is still clear. The term ""это"" means ""it,"" ""я"" means ""I,"" ""должен"" means ""should"" or ""must,"" ""вас"" means ""you,"" and ""поблагодарить"" means ""thank."" As such, the most direct translation would be, ""it is I that must thank you.""

,, For example the word computer would be written in Russian as компьютер, but if you were to rewrite it in English letters it would look like kompyuter.

, If you have a little extra money to throw at the pursuit of learning the Russian language, go to Amazon or Google Product Search and find yourself a copy of Pimsleur Russian I - or find it some other way. Bang your way through it and work to get your pronunciation correct. Try to mimic their speech, be patient with your capabilities, and watch them grow. I personally don't go for Rosetta Stone (language learning software,) but if it works for you, great.

, You could use a Russian-English dictionary, 501 Russian Verbs, a traveller's Russian phrasebook, and a book on swearing in Russian (for that authentic touch.)You also need Teach Yourself Russian Script, because handwritten Russian looks different from the printed version and Russians rarely print by hand - not to mention some signage uses script, as well.

, Try watching movies that were made in Russia with English subtitles and Russian audio, or vice versa. Two movies I like are Nightwatch and Daywatch. Also, go to Rambler.ru and try reading some of the articles. Use Google Translateto figure out words you don't know and try to learn them. Find a Russian Word of the Day widget / gadget.

Work on your pronunciation.,
Revise your grammar constantly.,
Increase your vocabulary.,
Surround yourself with the language.,
Find a conversation partner.,
Go French for the weekend.,
Travel.,
Understand that language learning is also cultural learning.",How to Improve Your French," Smooth flowing French is gained through continual practice at acquiring a good accent. Good pronunciation helps to ensure that you are easily understood and will enable you to enjoy speaking the language more fluently. Ways to improve your pronunciation include:


Listen to native French speakers and repeat what they say. Watch a good French movie and imitate your favorite actor's accents. Listen to native French speakers on your iPod or MP3 player as you're traveling to work, and repeat what they say (when appropriate).

Sing French music. Download your favorite songs and sing along. Music is an excellent method by which to perfect accent, and most times, you won't even notice the effort involved.
Ensure that you have a good French teacher. If you're not studying as part of your college curriculum, take up French classes after work, or on the weekends. Your teacher should be able to help correct your pronunciation by picking out your weaker points and giving you specific exercises to improve your intonation, inflexion, and sound linking.;
, Even though you have already learned certain grammar points, it continues to be important to revisit your grammar learning until the individual points become second nature. If it helps, think of grammar like a math problem--by adding a certain word, the equation will be complete! This can be made a lot more fun and engaging if you use multimedia to assist:


Use your iPod or MP3 player to listen to grammar drills. Do this while exercising, traveling, relaxing on your bed, etc.
Use computer games and exercises to improve your grammar. There are many games and exercises available for free online, or you can purchase CD-Roms for your computer. Do a search of ""French grammar games"", ""French spelling games"", ""French verb games"", etc., and see what suits your interests most. Look for games that French speakers play - these will be an excellent way to improve your French., As with your native language, aim to make learning vocabulary a lifelong learning process. While learning vocabulary gets easier the more you do it, and the faster you are able to work out meanings by context and association, it can be helpful to continue learning vocabulary as a discrete exercise in its own right. The best ways to do this include:



Keep a notebook for writing down words you discover when reading, or listening to some other kind of media. You can choose to look them up later rather than constantly interrupting a good read with dictionary hunting. It is helpful to use categories for the words, such as travel, clothes, body, fashion, car, movies, etc. to make finding the words easier, and to provide contextual association in your mind.
Make use of Post-It notes to write down the names of household items.

Create a scrapbook. Cut out pictures of items by theme and add the French words to them. A craft exercise on the one hand, a French lesson on the other!
Use events that interest you to provide intrinsic motivation for learning new words. For example, if you're a soccer (football) fan, why not watch the games in French, and learn new words?When you learn a new word in your native language, look it up in French at the same time.
Read the instructions accompanying your appliances and software in French. Most manuals now come in a range of languages, making it easy for you to learn new technological or technical terms quickly, with the ability to cross-check with the English version.
Aim to learn 5 new words every day - that amounts to 35 new words a week, 1820 words a year!
Buy a visual dictionary in French. It does not need to have any English in it, although bilingual visual dictionaries do exist. This is an inspiring and very useful way to learn a wide range of vocabulary and is particularly helpful for technical terms that you might need for work, or for a hobby.

, Whether it's books, radio, the Internet, or TV, every form of media will open up your learning possibilities and enhance the experience for you. If there isn't much French in your area, download podcasts. You'll find yourself understanding things much better and remembering words that you haven't seen in a while if you mix up the media approaches to learning.


Read French as often as possible. Reading will expand your vocabulary and broaden your immersion in the language. You will learn easily while reading because you're enjoying yourself. Just be sure to pick books that interest you, fiction or non-fiction. Or, if books are not your thing, try reading wikiHow in French. (You can find these pages in the wikiHow worldwide section of wikiHow's homepage).
Many DVDs now come with the option of French. Switch to French when watching - whether it is dubbed or subtitled, you're still learning using an engaging medium.
Listen to French radio stations. There are hundreds of stations broadcasting in French and many of them can be easily accessed online.You can also check out what French options are available on foreign language stations in your location.

, Plenty of French speakers would like to improve their English in return for helping you with your French. It's great practice, and a native speaker can easily set you straight on all sorts of details that never appear in textbooks. You can practice with a conversation partner in a number of ways:


As pen-pals over the Internet using email, chat clients or IRC;
Using social networking clients (use Twitter, etc., only in French);
Get onto a French wiki and edit only in French and communicate with the other people on the site in French;Talk with French pals using software like Google Talk or Skype; or,
If you find somebody in your area, have conversations regularly, in person.
Most importantly, don't just talk. Remember to also perfect your French listening skills. Being a language that is spoken quickly, with much liaison, listening for understanding French well is a vital skill.

, Grab a buddy who has a more advanced level of French, or someone who is a native French speaker, and aim to speak nothing but French with them for a day or two over the weekend. Go shopping, dining, and having fun--all in French.

, Visit a French speaking country and soak up the language and culture all at once. Don't just limit yourself to France or Belgium - if you live in North America, Quebec is on your doorstep, and with there are many other French speaking countries, regions, and cultures around the world in Africa, the Pacific, the Caribbean, etc. It's a good excuse for a vacation and a learning experience!


Book into a language school in a French country or city. Try to live with a local family so that you speak French all the time.

Look for volunteer work, or casual work. Working is an excellent way to improve your ability in another language quickly. If you get to work in a busy industry, such as waiting or cooking, you will be compelled out of necessity to improve your French very quickly.
Teach English as a Second Language in a French-speaking country. You will need to have a good grasp of both languages for this one, and as you teach, you will definitely learn!

, While learning and improving your second language skills, it is equally important to improve your cultural understanding.


Read French history. Read widely, because French history extends well beyond France.
Learn as much as you can about French cultural works, such as art, fashion, and movies.
Dine on French food occasionally, or learn to make your own. Read up on French cuisine and history.
Learn about French politics. Again, don't focus simply on France but remember to look at other French-speaking countries.

Say ""arrivederci"" in most situations.This is the most direct way to say ""goodbye"" in Italian.,
Offer ""arrivederla"" during formal situations.,
Use ""ciao"" informally.,
Remark ""addio."",
Offer a meaningful ""stai attento."",
Change the goodbye based on the time of day.,
Bid farewell before a trip.,
Temporarily part ways.,
Part ways until tomorrow.,
Rudely remark ""sparisci!""",How to Say Goodbye in Italian," While it's technically an informal saying, it's acceptably proper for the vast majority of social occasions.


Pronounce “arrivederci” as: ahr-ree-veh-DEHR-chee

Technically, the ""ci"" syllable at the end of ""arrivederci"" makes it an informal word, but it's such a common phrase that you should be able to use it in any friendly setting, even when talking with strangers or elders.;
, This is another direct way to say ""goodbye"" in Italian, but it's more formal than ""arrivederci."" You probably won't need to use it often, but it's good to know.


Pronounce “arrivederla” as: ahr-ree-veh-DEHR-lah

The ""la"" syllable at the end of ""arrivederla"" gives the term greater formality. You should generally use this phrase when you need to show a higher level of respect for someone, such as someone you meet during formal or professional occasions.
If in doubt, it's safest to use ""arrivederla."" The other person may tell you that it's too formal, and at that point, you should switch to ""arrivederci."" Since the initial mistake would show extra respect, though, the other person probably won't be offended by it.

, While ""ciao"" is a popular way to say both ""bye"" and ""hello"" in Italian, you should save it for people you already know instead of using it with strangers.


Pronounce “ciao” as: CHOW

The word ""ciao"" actually comes from the phrase ""s-ciào vostro,"" which means ""I am your slave."" It was originally use as a polite, semi-formal way of saying ""I am at your service."" The original phrase is now outdated, but the shortened form ""ciao"" remained as a popular way to greet friends and family. It should not be used with strangers or elders, though., The English equivalent of ""addio"" would be ""farewell.""It's not an especially common phrase, but it's common enough and fitting enough for most circumstances.


Pronounce “addio” as: ah-DEE-oh

This term originally came from the phrase ""a Dio,"" meaning, ""to God."" It's still relatively polite thanks to these origins, but the phrase is more commonly and generically interpreted as ""farewell.""

, The English equivalent of this phrase would be ""take care!"" Saying this to someone as you part ways conveys interest in the other person's well-being.


Pronounce “stai attento” as: sti ah-TEN-toh

More directly, the phrase should be translated as ""watch out"" or ""stay alert."" The verb ""stai"" can be translated as ""stay"" or ""remain.” The adjective ""attento"" means ""attentive,"" ""careful,"" or ""alert.""

, During the morning and afternoon, you could say ""buongiorno."" In the evening, however, you'll need to switch to ""buona sera."" Immediately before bedtime, you should use ""dormi bene.""


""Buongiorno"" (bwon-JOR-noh) can be used as both a greeting or parting term. When used in parting, it essentially means ""good day"" or ""have a good day."" The term ""buon"" means ""good,"" and ""giorno"" means ""day."" Similarly, you could also use the longer form,“buona giornata” (bwon-ah JOR-nah-tah) to convey the same sentiment.
""Buono sera"" (bwon-ah SEHR-ah) can also be used for both greetings and partings. The term ""buono"" means ""good,"" and ""sera"" means ""evening,"" so the entire phrase means ""good evening.""
""Dormi bene"" (dohr-mee BEHN-ay) is strictly used for nighttime farewells. ""Dormi"" means ""sleep,"" and ""bene"" means ""well."" The entire phrase means ""sleep well.""

, There are two phrases you can use to convey positive sentiments toward someone before he or she goes on vacation: ""buon viaggio"" and ""buone vacanze.""""Buon viaggio"" (bwon vee-AH-jo) means ""good trip"" or ""have a good trip."" The term ""buon"" is translated as ""good,"" and ""viaggo"" is translated as ""trip"" or ""journey.""
""Buone vacanze"" (bwon-ay vah-CAHN-say) can be translated as ""have a good vacation"" or ""have a good holiday."" The term ""buone"" means ""good,"" and ""vacanze"" means ""vacation"" or ""holiday.""

, If you intend to see someone again after a brief parting, two proper ways of saying ""goodbye"" would be ""a presto"" and ""a dopo.""


""A presto"" (AH pres-toh) means ""see you soon."" The term ""a"" is a preposition typically translated as ""to,"" and ""presto"" is an adverb meaning ""soon"" or ""before long.""
""A dopo"" (AH doh-poh) means ""see you later."" The preposition ""a"" still means ""to,"" and the adverb ""dopo"" means ""later"" or ""after.""

, If you know you'll see the other person the following day, you can say ""see you tomorrow"" by saying ""a domani"" or ""ci vediamo domani.""


""A domani"" (AH doh-mahn-ee) means ""see you tomorrow."" The term ""a"" can be translated as ""to,"" and ""domani"" is translated as ""tomorrow.""
""Ci vediamo domani"" (see veh-DEAH-moh doh-mah-nee) also means ""see you tomorrow."" The verb ""vediamo"" is the conjugated form of ""to see,"" and ""ci"" is a pronoun indicating that you're speaking to the second person ""you."" The term ""domani"" still means ""tomorrow.""

, This is a rude way of saying ""get lost"" or “beat it” to someone who's bothering you. Since this is so impolite, though, you should be careful about when you use it.


Pronounce “sparisci” as: spah-REE-shee

This phrase is a conjugated form of the verb ""sparire,"" which means ""to disappear."" Shouting ""sparisci!"" at someone would be the same as shouting ""disappear!""
While there may be an occasion to use this, you should avoid using the phrase with anyone dear to you or anyone you need to respect. Even if you intend to use this parting term as a joke, there's a risk that the other person may still take offense to it.

, Read through the list of numbers out loud and get used to saying them.

, ""Raz"" literally means ""(one) time."" It sounds more natural to use ""raz"" in these circumstances. On the other hand, never use ""raz"", when you describe the quantity of something. For example to say ""one pickle, please,"" say ""ah-DEEN.""

, As you practice saying the numbers from one to ten, pay close attention to the pronunciation of each sound that makes up the word for each number.

, In Russian the stressed syllable of each word plays a key role in pronunciation. Stress refers to which syllable is emphasized. Make sure you are pronouncing the word with the stress on the correct syllable, which is capitalized in the phonetic pronunciation.


Stress is very important in speaking Russian, not only for an authentic accent but also because some words have different meaning when the stress is on a different syllable.

, Commit the numbers from one to ten and their pronunciation to memory.

, Hearing a Russian speaker pronounce the numbers will help a lot. If you know a native speaker, ask her to count to ten in Russian. Listen and repeat each number.

, Youtube and other sites have videos intended for Russian children to learn counting. These can be helpful resources as you learn to count to ten in Russian.

, Once you know how to count to ten, learn about using Russian numbers in sentences.


Russian numbers have different forms depending on how they are used in sentences., When numbers are used as adjectives to describe how many of a noun, the gender of the number may change to match the noun it modifies.


The number ""1"" has a masculine, feminine, and neuter form. Unless specified, use the masculine form. Masculine: ""One brother"" is ""Один брат,"" ""1"" is pronounced ""ah-DEEN."" Feminine: ""One sister"" is ""одна сестра,"" ""1"" is pronounced ""ahd-NAH."" Neuter: ""One window"" is ""Одно окно,"" ""1"" is pronounced ""ahd-NOH.""
The number ""2"" has two forms, masculine and feminine. The masculine is ""два,"" pronounced ""dvah"" and the feminine is ""две,"" pronounced ""dv'eh.""Numbers ""3"" through ""10"" stay in masculine form regardless of the noun's gender.

, Russian language uses six cases that modify words according to their part of speech and use in a sentence. Each of the numbers will change its spelling and pronunciation when used in particular ways.


Most of the time numbers are used in the nominative case such as when the number is the subject of a sentence or modifies the subject of the sentence.This means you can usually use them in their regular form.

Know the basic term.,
Pronounce it correctly: The emphasis in the word should be put on the first syllable.,
Know how to conjugate adjectives in Russian: As a Russian-language adjective, the word ""Русский"" is actually the root ""русск-"" (""roossk"") with an attached suffix depending on its exact conjugation.,
Consider gender: Russian changes the conjugation of words partly based on their gender: masculine, feminine, neuter or plural.,
Adjust the wording if you're talking about the Russian language.,
Use the phrase for ""In a Russian manner"".",How to Say Russian in Russian," The all-purpose way to say ""Russian"" without worrying about exact conjugation is ""ROOS-skee"" (Russian spelling: Ру́сский).


This will always be understood by Russian speakers, even when it is technically the incorrect conjugation. It is the most common conjugation, and also the one that is used in the phrase ""Russian language"" (""ROOS-skee ye-ZYK/Ру́сский язы́к"");
,


The first syllable sounds like the ""ew"" in ""threw"".
The second syllable sounds like the word ""ski"".
To get the accent right, you want to roll the ""r"" at the beginning of the word.
For best results. listen to native speakers pronouncing ""Русский"",


Every single form of the word ""русский"" will always start with ""русск/roossk"", and it will always have an accent on the first syllable.

,


""ROOS-skee"" (Русский) is the masculine form of the word. We add the -ee (ий) ending to the root ""roossk"". This is the correct form to use when referring to men, place names that end in a consonant (e.g. Novgorod, Volgograd, Omsk), or masculine nouns.

If you aren't sure what gender something is in Russian, it is safest to use the masculine form.


The feminine form of the word is ""ROOS-skah-yah"" (Русская). We add the -ahyah (ая) ending to the root. This is the correct form to use when referring to women, place names that end in either an ""ah"" or ""yah"" (e.g. Volga, Kamchatka, Estonia), sound or feminine nouns.The neuter form of the word is ""ROOS-skoh-ye"" (Русское). We add the -ohye (ое) ending to the root. This is the correct form to use when referring to neuter nouns or place names that end in ""o"" or ""e"" (e.g. Beloozero).The plural form of the word is ""ROOS-skee-ye"" (Русские). We add the -eeye (ие) ending to the root. Plural form is always used for groups of things, regardless of their gender., It is grammatically incorrect to say ""I speak roosskee"". In English, you can say ""I speak/understand Russian"" and ""I speak/understand the Russian language"" interchangeably. In Russian, however, the way you refer to a language is slightly more complex than just saying the adjectival form.

, The most common way to say ""I speak Russian"" in Russian is to say ""yah go-var-YOO pa-ROOS-skee"" (я говорю по-русски). Literally this means ""I speak in a Russian manner"".


You can also use this to say ""I understand"" (yah pa-nee-MAH-you pa-ROOS-skee/я понимаю по-русски) or ""I don't speak/understand"" (yah nye pah-nee-MAH-you/go-var-YOO pa-ROOS-skee/я не говорю/понимаю по-русски).
Alternatively, you can say that you understand Russian by explicitly saying that you understand Russian language: yah pa-nee-MAH-yoo ROOS-skee ye-ZYK (я понимаю русский язык).

It is also valid to say that you ""speak in the Russian language"" yah go-var-YOO na ROOS-skom ye-ZYK-ye (я говорю на русском языке). Note that you cannot say that you ""speak Russian language"" or that you ""understand in the Russian language"".

This phrase will come across as rude to some because it’s an order.
It’s also an informal way of speech, so it shouldn’t be said to, say, a teacher. It’s a direct command.;
, This version is Stai zitta! It’s pronounced STY-dzee-tah.


Put the emphasis on the first syllable.Use this term if you are telling a single person to shut up, not several people.

, A more colloquial way of saying be quiet is “Taci!” Pronounce the word “Tah-chee.” It’s from the verb tacere, which means to go quiet.

In Russian, “Hello,” is “Zdrastvooyte” or Здравствуйте“Thank you” is “Spaseeba” or Спасибо
“Goodbye” is “Da sveedaneeya” or До свидания!
""My name is..."" is ""Meenya zavoot..."" or Меня зовут...
""Please"" is ""Požalujsta"" or Пожалуйста ""Where...?"" is ""Gde"" or Где ;
, The 33 letters in the Russian alphabet are phonetic, which means they sound the way they look. The pronunciation of these letters is the same no matter what words they are in. This is different from English, which can have several sounds for one letter.Knowing that every letter you see has the same sound helps you speak new words quickly.
For example, in English, the letter “c” can sound like the letters “k” and “s” depending on what word it is.
In Russian, you always know how to pronounce a word because there is no question about how each letter might sound.
Keep in mind that the Russian alphabet is Cyrillic, which means its letters look very different from English. You might want to study a chart of the Russian alphabet in order to start understanding the letters you see.
Focus on vowel sounds when learning pronunciation because these are the letters that lend meaning to most Russian words. You want to stretch out the sound of each vowel, such as when you are calling to someone from the other room and you say ""Mo-o-o-m!"", It is helpful to begin learning a language by building your vocabulary. This way, you can quickly pick out words when you hear or read them. An easy way to learn Russian vocabulary is to take the Russian word for something and insert it into a sentence every time you speak it.The Russian word for “rug” is “covyours.”
Use “covyours” every time you would say “rug”: “Did you wipe your feet on the covyours?” or “Your covyours looks lovely in this room.”
You might put up sticky notes on household items with the names in Russian. Every time you pass that item, you will remember to call it by its Russian word.
Use this technique in every place you go regularly—in your car, your locker, your office, etc.

, Like many languages, Russian borrows words from other languages. When a language borrows a term, it is called a “cognate.” If you are an English speaker, you may be able to find words that you recognize. For example, there is a section of Russian verbs that is borrowed from English, such as “parkovat” (to park) or “adoptirovat” (to adopt).
Parkovat looks like this: парковать
Adoptirovat looks like this: адоптировать

, Russian has some simple elements that, once you know about them, make it easier to learn. For one thing, Russian frequently allows speakers to change the order of words in sentences without losing meaning. Although the order of many phrases is usually generally accepted to be one way, a different order can still be correct.In Russian, the phrase ""A cat caught a mouse"" can be spoken in six different ways and still be correct.
The most common word order of a Russian sentence is subject-verb-object, although grammar rules allow this to be rearranged in nearly any order imaginable.

, The great thing about Russian grammar is that there are few exceptions. Once you learn a rule, you don’t have to worry about when it might change. There are a lot of rules, but if you learn them one at a time, you will master them.For example, the last letter of a noun in Russian determines what the gender is. The main exception for this rule occurs when a noun has a physical gender, like a human or animal.
The word “Папа” looks like it should be feminine. But the word is “daddy,” so this noun is considered masculine.

, In order to understand a language when it is written or spoken, you need to understand the verb forms. Since the conjugation for different subjects (I, you, he, they, we, etc.) will sound and look different, you need to quickly identify them. Knowing the ending of verbs for each type of subject will help you understand faster.


For example, in Russian, only one present tense conjugation is used in any present tense scenario in English. In English, you could say I go, I do go, I am going, I have been going. In Russian, there is only one conjugation for all of these.
However, don't get bogged down in grammar rules. You will understand them naturally as you begin to speak Russian.

Roll your /r/.,
Replace the sound /th/ with the sound /d/.,
Pronounce ending consonant sounds /d/, /v/, and /z/, as /t/, /f/, and /s/.,
Pronounce the vowel sound used in words like ""In"" more like the vowel in ""Seen"".,
Pronounce the short ""o"" sound in a clipped way.,
Pronounce initial /w/ as /v/ or vice versa.",How to Fake a Thick Russian Accent1," As with many European languages, the /r/ is rolled or trilled in Russian. So, when you are speaking English with a Russian accent, make sure you roll your Rs. Doing this consistently will make the accent sound more authentic. Don’t trill your /r/ for too long, as this will make the accent sound fake.For instance, when you say the word ""very,"" you will roll the /r/. It may come out sounding like a ""d"" at first, but with practice you can get the rolling sound down.;
, So instead of saying ""this,"" say ""dis."" If you do this, it will help enhance your thick Russian accent. Don't do this if you want to portray a lighter Russian accent. This is not true at the ends of words, as in Russian, consonants are not voiced at the ends of words. Instead pronounce /th/ as /t/. For instance, you would say, ""cot"" for the word ""cod"" (the fish) instead of ""coth."", In Russian, the consonants at the ends of words are not voiced. You would pronounce 'breeze' as 'breese.' Doing this will make your accent sound thicker.For instance, ""love"" becomes ""lof"" and ""clod"" becomes ""clot.""

, ""I will make this thing bigger"" would become ""I weel make thees theeng beegger."" This is because the long ""i"" vowel sound occurs infrequently in Russian, so a native Russian speaker who is new to English will be more likely to say ""ee"" instead of the long ""i"" sound., In English, the sound is a diphthong, and you actually pronounce the sounds of ""o"" and ""u,"" though the latter is very soft. For instance the word ""boat"" becomes much shorter, more like ""bote."" As we don't use the sound in English often, it is important to listen to native speakers of Russian., Because the /w/ sound is not frequent in Russian, it can be difficult for Russian ELLs(English Language Learners) to pick up. While a lot of people usually only change the /w/ to /v/, the error can go both ways. Therefore, a more passable accent should contain both types of errors. For instance, you could say, ""Vere is my west?"" for ""Where is my vest?"""

Tell someone to be quiet in a more formal way.",How to Say Shut Up in Italian2," If you want to be more formal, you can say faccia silenzio (be silent).


Silenzioso! Be quiet (SEE- lehn-tzee-oh-soh). You can also say Silenzio! Speak fast if you want to sound Italian.Silenzioso is a more polite version of the word that would likely be said in a quieter fashion."
"
Use a pronunciation guide.,
Speak expressively.",How to Say Shut Up in Italian3," Before you try to say Italian words, take some time to understand how vowels and consonants sound in Italian. You can find many of these pronunciation guides online.There are only 7 vowel sounds in Italian. When two or more vowels occur in a row, pronounce them separately. Some vowel sounds depend on the part of Italy you’re in.
Most words in Italian are phonetic, meaning they are pronounced the way they are written.
Most consonants sound similar to the way they are pronounced in English.The exceptions are the consonants c and g. These vary depending on the letters that follow them. Pronounce double consonants more forcefully than single consonants.

, Italian is a very emotional language. Use your hands. Let your emotions out. Let them be wild, bold and expressive.


The key is to say Italian vowels short and clear. Don’t draw them out. In English, you may end with a gliding sound. Italian is more abrupt.
Open your mouth wide to form a big and round vowel sound. For example, the letter ""a"" should be spoken with a wide open mouth. Say “aahh!”"

Live with a Russian family.,
Move to Russia.,
Take an intensive course on Russian in person.,
Find a tandem partner.,
Surround yourself with Russian media.,
Read only in Russian.,
Practice writing in Russian.",How to Learn Russian Fast2," If you are able to visit a Russian-speaking country, you should stay in a household where they don't speak your language. This way you are forced to communicate only in Russian. It may take a few months, or longer if you don’t have basic understanding of the language. However, being in a situation where you can only communicate in Russian will help you pick it up quickly.Having a basic knowledge of grammar structure and vocabulary is preferable when living in total immersion. This way, you are able to understand most of what you hear, and grow in understanding much more quickly.

, If you visit Russia, you may like it. Moving to Russia can also be an option. If you place yourself in total immersion on a more permanent basis, you will be highly motivated to both understand and speak Russian. You will learn quickly so that you can function better in society.


It is better to know people before you move to a new country. They will help you find a place to live, make friends, stay safe, and so on.
You might want to visit before making the decision to move there.

, Some colleges and community centers offer Russian language courses in their facilities rather than online. Try taking a course where the instructor only speaks Russian. During the class time, you will only hear, read, and speak in Russian. This is a good way to immerse yourself if you don't live in a Russian-speaking area.


Look at the course offerings of your local university or community center by visiting their catalog online or giving them a call.

, If you are unable to go to a Russian-speaking country, a good place to start is to find a Russian tandem partner. Tandem partnering means that you meet with a native speaker on a regular basis. They teach you Russian, and you teach them your language.Keep in mind that while this arrangement is free, it doesn’t mean it will be easy. Your partner may not be good at teaching, and vice versa.
You should study when not with your partner so that you don’t forget what you learn each time.
Use any study method you know of, whether a Russian language textbook, workbook, website, app, and so on.
Have your partner teach you verb structure, vocabulary, and quiz you on everything you learn.
Try to have as many conversations in Russian as you can.

, Another way to practice immersion if you can’t go to a Russian-speaking country is to immerse yourself at home. Make all your media be in Russian. Find Russian radio stations online, watch Russian-speaking movies and TV shows, listen to Russian music, and so on.


You can look into changing your computer, tablet, and smartphone language settings to Russian.
Whenever you see an option to translate a website, choose to translate it into Russian.

, To help with visually understanding the Russian language, try to read only in Russian. Purchase newspapers, books, and magazines only in Russian. Go onto Russian websites and read web articles and webzines in Russian.


Try changing the language settings on your social media to Russian.
For example, you can change your Facebook language to Russian by clicking “Settings,” then “Language” in the upper right hand corner after signing in.Learning the sounds of the Russian alphabet is helpful for reading the language.

, Being able to write in Russian is proof that you are learning it. Whenever you have the chance, write down your thoughts in Russian. A class will provide this opportunity and give you feedback. If you’re not in a class, try finding a Russian speaker to write letters or emails with.


You could also try texting or having instant message chats with a Russian speaker to test your Russian writing skills.

Sign up for an online class.,
Download a language-learning app.,
Meet a native speaker online.,
Join social media groups.",How to Learn Russian Fast3," You can use language learning websites and smartphone apps to help you master Russian quickly. Consider a Russian language learning website. Most of these websites are free. You can go onto most of them and click the links to find vocabulary, verb conjugations, the alphabet, helpful phrases, and so on.The trouble with using a website instead of a class is that you have no clear instruction about where to start and where to go next so that you’re not learning in a logical, organized manner.
Language-learning websites are free, but they can be confusing.

, There are both free and paid Russian classes available online. Some of them are low cost, and some are available through online universities. Some universities that offer Russian courses include Cornell and University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).UCLA offers business and literature podcasts in Russian. These are good options for increasing your exposure to spoken Russian.

, There are several apps for smartphones and tablets that claim to teach Russian, and many of them are free. For example, the app AccelaStudy claims to teach Russian in a very short time frame.Other apps include Duolingo, Memrise, and Learn Russian.Apps make language learning mobile.

, Use technology to its advantage. Find someone to teach you Russian over teleconference. If you already know someone who speaks Russian, just ask them to start video chatting so you learn from them. You might also look for a language partner in online forums or social media.


For example, you could ask your friends on Facebook if they know anyone who speaks Russian who would be willing to teach you on video chat.

, You could join a group on on Facebook or in Google plus, or any social media platform that has groups. You might be able to find a group of people who are also interested in learning Russian. Go to the search bar in any social media and type in “Russian language groups.”


Join the group, and as soon as you have permission, post a public message about your desire to learn Russian from someone in the group.

Pronounce stressed syllables with a higher pitch and for longer periods of time than in English.,
Make your tone rise from the beginning and then fall at the end of declarative sentences.,
Slow down.",How to Fake a Thick Russian Accent2," With stressed syllables (""stressed"" in the word ""distressed""), you should raise your pitch and lengthen the syllable just a bit. It shouldn't last forever, but should be noticeable to achieve the Russian accent., This is practically the opposite of intonation we have for questions (interrogative, not declarative sentences) in English where our tones are lower toward the beginning and higher toward the end. Practice this to help your overall speech sound Russian., As with most non-native speakers who are fairly new to speaking regularly, a Russian accent in English should be pronounced slower than a typical native English speaker. However, this shouldn’t be drawn out so that it becomes ridiculous, just slow enough that it emphasizes the accent."
"
Listen closely to the way they pronounce each sound.,
Mimic Russian cadence.,
Listen for tone.,
Listen to a variety of Russian accents.,
Watch a video.",How to Fake a Thick Russian Accent3," It can help to have a transcript to mark up, especially if you are learning the accent for a script. You may want to listen to the recording several times to pick up the specific sounds. You may only concentrate on the ‘s’ in one listening or you may focus on the vowels in another listening., Cadence, or the pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables, affects the way an accent sounds as much as the individual letters. Without the right cadence, you may sound like someone from a completely different area. Take Tom Kaine’s impression of Donald Trump—he sounds nothing like Trump's New York accent., Tone can affect the way a sentence sounds as well. You can read about a tone should shift, but because of subtle differences between accents, it is important to hear it for yourself. Choose a recording or video with a lot of sentence variety so you can hear the way declarative, interrogative, and exclamatory sentences sound in a particular accent.In Russian, declarative sentences should be much more monotone than in English. Instead of emphasizing a word to give it meaning, such as ""I do NOT want to go"" (with all-caps represented heightened stress on a word,"" you would say ""I do not want to go.""For questions, the emphasis should fall on the word that is in question. For instance, instead of ""Have you seen the new moVIE?,"" you would say, ""Have you seen the NEW movie?"" This can make the sentence seem rude to native English speakers., Choose an accent that works for your character. Accents reflect not only region but class and historical period. For instance, in 19th-century Russia, the upper class was very familiar with French, and they often threw French terms into their dialogue. This kind detail will allow you to perfect an accent., This will help you see the way a Russian moves their mouth when speaking English. Oftentimes it can be easy to ignore this facet, but it can make the difference between a convincing and an unconvincing accent."

Take Italian courses.,
Buy Italian language software.,
Get an Italian tutor.",How to Learn to Speak Italian2," Sign up for classes at a local university or community college. You may also want to look into taking courses at a school specifically geared toward languages; these often offer intensive programs that are designed to help you learn a foreign language quickly. Check online for course opportunities as well, since they're often less expensive than in-person options.


Do your Italian homework. There's no sense in taking a language class unless you're going to do all of the homework and exercises. They may seem tedious, but they're absolutely necessary, since learning a brand new language takes hours and hours of practice.
Participate in class discussions. Raise your hand a lot to answer the instructor's questions. Speaking out loud as often as possible and getting feedback on your pronunciation will help you improve much faster than if you listen quietly in the back of the classroom.

, Companies like Rosetta Stone offer software to help you learn languages quickly and on your own time. These language packages have an audio component so you can hear Italian pronunciation and practice it yourself, too. Language software can be expensive, so look into buying a used CD collection or going in on it with a friend who wants to learn Italian, too.

, Having one-on-one instruction is invaluable when it comes to learning a new language. Hire a tutor to help you excel in the classes you are taking. Even if you aren't taking classes, consider meeting with a language tutor a few times a week so that he or she may provide the instruction you need to effectively learn Italian.


Check your university's message boards for graduate students or others proficient in Italian who may advertise tutoring services. Your university's language department may also have a list of tutors available for students.

Spend time with people who speak Italian.,
Consume Italian media.,
Study Italian in Italy.",How to Learn to Speak Italian3," Speak with students in more advanced Italian classes, or make friends with people who are fluent speakers. Conversing with people who are fluent in Italian is the best way to improve your language skills; it's impossible to get this kind of practice by reading a textbook or using other educational resources.


Start an Italian discussion group that meets a few times a week. The goal should be to speak only Italian for a full hour or so. You can have everyone discuss a certain conversation topic, or simply go with how the conversation flows.
Plan outings with Italian speakers so you can practice using the language in a variety of contexts. For example, you could go to a museum and discuss art in Italian.
Find a way to speak Italian for at least half an hour a day. Even on the days when you don't meet with your group, give a fellow Italian speaker a call and chat in Italian for half an hour. Meet with an Italian instructor during his or her office hours and discuss the class in Italian. Get as much practice in as you can.

, Media immersion is a good way to continue improving your skills, and it helps you gain a deeper understanding of the Italian language through pop culture and other contexts. Rent Italian films and watch them with Italian subtitles, or no subtitles at all. Focus on understanding the language; soon you should be able to pick up on what the actors are saying.

, If you want to become fluent in Italian, there is no substitute for going to Italy and studying the language there for as long as you can. Attaining full fluency could take many years, but even a stay of 6 months to a year will vastly improve your language skills.


Look for study abroad opportunities offered by your college or university. You may be able to spend a semester or a year studying in Italy.
If you aren't affiliated with a school, look for work opportunities in Italy. Foreigners can work abroad through arts programs, organic farming programs, and other interesting opportunities.
When you're in Italy, speak only Italian and try to avoid English. Don't gravitate toward the English-speaking foreigners you'll inevitably encounter. Many well-meaning Italians may assume you'd rather speak English, but you should politely continue to speak Italian, even if it's difficult at first. With enough time and practice, the language will begin to click and you'll be able to speak with fluency.

While not quite as common as “ciao,” the term “salve” is more appropriate to use amongst people you are not on familiar terms with. The most formal way to greet someone is with a time-specific greeting, but salve is still appropriate to use with most people.
To put it in the perspective of a native English speaker, “ciao” is like “hi” while “salve” is closer to “hello.”

Salve is borrowed from Latin and was used frequently by the Romans during Caesar's time.Like ciao, salve can also be used to say ""good-bye"" depending on the context.
Pronounce salve as sahl-veh.

Learn the numbers up to five.,
Follow up with six through ten.,
Try eleven through twenty.,
Practice the numbers.,
Learn the sounds of Italian vowels.,
Practice pronouncing Italian consonants.,
Learn the numbers up to twenty-nine.,
Learn some higher numbers.,
Pick up some conversational phrases.,
Use audio and visual aids to increase your vocabulary.",How to Count to 20 in Italian," Start with just a few numbers to get a feel for Italian. Pay attention to how the numbers are spelled, but focus on their pronunciation. Stressed (accented) syllables are in all caps:0 zero (TSEH-ro)
1 uno (OO-no)
2 due (DOO-eh)
3 tre (TREH)
4 quattro (KWAHT-tro)
5 cinque (CHEEN-kweh);
, Once you have the first few numbers down, you’re ready to learn up to ten. Make sure to pay attention to the number ten, which is the first to have three syllables (and the stress on the second).6 sei (SEH-ee)
7 sette (SET-teh)
8 otto (OHT-toh)
9 nove (NOH-veh)
10 dieci (dee-EH-chee)

, After you’ve mastered the first few numbers in Italian, you’ll have a good sense for how the language sounds. The numbers eleven through twenty are a bit longer, but you can see that parts of them will sound very similar to the numbers 1-10 (undici, or ""eleven,"" for example, sounds a lot like uno plus dieci, or one plus ten).11 undici (OON-dee-chee)
12 dodici (DOH-dee-chee)
13 tredici (TREH-dee-chee)
14 quattordici (kwaht-TOR-dee-chee)
15 quindici (KWEEN-dee-chee)
16 sedici (SEH-dee-chee)
17 diciassette (dee-chahs-SET-teh)
18 diciotto (dee-CHOHT-toh)
19 diciannove (dee-chahn-NOH-veh)
20 venti (VEN-tee)

, Using the numbers as often as possible will help them stick in your memory. Regular practice will also help you feel more comfortable speaking Italian. Try a combination of techniques to use the numbers, such as:Making flashcards and quizzing yourself
Counting everyday objects, like coins or grapes
Using Italian numbers whenever you have to do mental math
Playing games, like Uno, that let you easily say the numbers in Italian.

, Knowing how to say words correctly in Italian will make you sound more natural when speaking the language. Italian vowels are a distinctive part of the language’s sound, so make sure to pay attention to their correct pronunciation:a is pronounced like the first “a’ in “papa”

i usually sounds like the “ee” in “beet.” Occasionally, after some consonants, it will sound like a “y” as in “yet”

u is usually pronounced like the “oo” in “boot.” Sometimes (like after the letter g), u can sound like a “w”.

e is pronounced either like the “e” in “bet” (open form) or the “a” in “chaotic” (closed form)

o sounds close to either the vowel in “awe” (open form) or the “o” in “go”

, Most consonants in Italian are relatively close to their English equivalents. Beyond that, it’s mostly a matter of paying attention to a few guidelines and a couple of special cases:c and g can be either hard (before a, o, or u) or soft (before e or i). A hard c sounds like the “c” in “car."" A soft c sounds like the “ch” in “chase.” Say a hard g like the “g” in “go,” but a soft one like the beginning of “general.”
When there is an h after a c or g, the sound will be hard.

sc is pronounced like the “sh” in “ship.”

r in Italian is slightly trilled.

S is sometimes pronounced “ess” and sometimes like a “z.” Similarly, z can sound like an English “z” or like a “ts” sound, as in pizza.
The cluster gn sounds close to the “ny” in “canyon,” and gl is close to the middle sound in “million.”
Hold double consonants, such as in the middle of tutto, longer than you would in English.

, If you're comfortable saying the numbers up to twenty in Italian, then a logical next step is to go even higher. To say “twenty-one,” “twenty-two,” and so on, you’ll follow a pattern that combines numbers very similar to the way that English does:21 ventuno (ven-TOO-noh)
22 ventidue (ven-tee-DOO-eh)
23 ventitré (ven-tee-TREH)
24 ventiquattro (ven-tee-KWAHT-troh)
25 venticinque (ven-tee-CHEEN-kweh)
26 ventisei (ven-tee-SEH-ee)
27 ventisette (ven-tee-SET-teh)
28 ventotto (ven-TOHT-toh)
29 ventinove (ven-tee-NOH-veh)

, Once you’ve have a sense of the basic pattern for how higher numbers are formed in Italian, you can start expanding your vocabulary. Try saying the tens up to one hundred:30 trenta (TREN-tah)
40 quaranta (kwah-RAHN-tah)
50 cinquanta (cheen-KWAHN-tah)
60 sessanta (ses-SAHN-tah)
70 settanta (set-TAHN-ta)
80 ottanta (oht-TAHN-ta)
90 novanta (noh-VAHN-tah)
100 cento (CHEN-toh)

, If you know someone who speaks Italian, ask them to let you practice with them! Start with a few greetings and introductions. For example, you might say:Hello - Ciao (CHOW)
My name is Melissa - Mi chiamo Melissa (ME kee-AH-mo Melissa)
What is your name? - Come ti chiami? (CO-may TEE kee-AH-mee)
Nice to meet you - Piacere di conoscerti (PYA-cheh-ray DEE ko-no-SHER-tee)
How are you? - Come stai? (CO-may STAH-ee)
I am fine - Sto bene (STO BEH-nay)
Goodbye - Ciao or Arrivederci (ah-REE-veh-dehr-chee)

, Once you’ve got some of the basics down, try picking up some everyday words and phrases. Audio and visual aids are fun ways to make progress. Try using apps like Duolingo, for instance. There are also podcasts, Youtube videos, and other media materials that can help you get used to the sound of the language.

Tell someone ""buonasera"" in the evening.",How to Say Hello in Italian2," This phrase translates into “good morning” or “good day.”



Buon is derived from the Italian adjective ""buono,"" meaning ""good.""

Giorno is an Italian noun meaning ""day.""

Say ""jameel"" to refer to a male, or ""jameela"" to refer to a woman.,
Do not say ""jameel"" or ""jameela"" about things that are only beautiful on the surface.,
Say ""Antee jameela"" (female) or ""Enta jameel"" (male) to mean ""you are beautiful"".,
Note that ""jameel"" is also sometimes used to mean ""good"".",How to Say Beautiful in Arabic," In Arabic, this translates directly to ""beautiful"".Pronounce it ""jah-meel"" or ""jah-meel-ah"". The Arabic character is: جميل.


Some Arabic speakers (e.g. Egyptians) tend to pronounce the word with a hard ""J"", as in ""gah-meel"" or ""gah-meelah"". Be aware that people may make assumptions about you if you pronounce the word in a certain way. Listen carefully before you speak, and try to take your cues from those around you.Bear in mind that ""jameel"" and ""jameela"" are only phonetic approximations of the Arabic word (جميل). There is one official way to spell these words in Arabic, but you may come across various acceptable English spellings: jamila, jameelah, gamila, gameela, etc. The important thing is that you know how to say it.;
, When Arabs say ""jameel"", they mean more than just ""good-looking"". The term refers to a deep, inner beauty, as in, ""there's something beautiful inside you"". Respect the word and the culture by only calling something ""jameel"" if you are truly impressed by its inner beauty., Pronounce it ""an-tay jah-meelah"" (female) or ""enta jah-meel"" (male).


Be careful with your words. Only call women ""jameela"" if you know them or you are meeting them formally. Don't go around saying this to women that you don't know, or they may think that you have bad intentions toward them.

Recognize easily genders from the face of the words as,


Feminine singular: Any noun ends to letter 'a' is femminile.,
When a noun does not end to 'a' or 'o' it ends to 'e' and could not be recognized as being feminine or masculine.

,
To build plural of these nouns, drop the ending 'e' and replace it with 'i' (similar to masculine plurals).

,
When you do not recognise gender of a noun immediately from its face, there are two ways to know them as,


First, the owner of the noun shows it:

Padre (father) is masculine.,
The concerned noun clause will follow the gender of the noun; modifiers (adjectives) and articles.",How to Learn Articles in Italian2,"

To build feminine plural: drop 'a' and replace it by 'e'


Masculine singular: Any noun ends to letter 'o' is maschile.

To build masculine plural: drop 'o' and replace it by 'i'



,,,
Madre (mother) is feminine.


Second, you have to memorize it when first you learn it, such as la notte (the night), which is femminile.

Always learn Italian words with their articles (and hence their gender) as part of the vocabulary. In English you do not have to do this since there is no difference in gender of the articles; the man or the woman.
Not that trying to make the road so difficult for you, but if you are really adamant to learn a foreign language it is better to learn the vocabulary with division of each word into its syllables.
And knowing which syllable is stressed.
This will be achieved by constant referring to a good quality dictionary of that language.



,



il mio fidanzato (my boyfriend).

la mia fidanzata (my girlfriend).

Note this. Gentile (/dʒεn-ti-le/) means delicate. Then il gentil sesso figuratively means le donne; that is, the plural of women, while the phrase is a masculine clause.
Owner of speech is not important. A girl says, ""il mio fidanzato.""
Object of the speech is not important too. A man says, ""il mio amore"" since l'amore (love by itself) is maschile (masculine).


Adjective agrees with the gender of the modified noun (and comes after the noun, in contrast to English). Hence,

il fiore rosso (red flower - flower masculine).

Remember two cardinals ""uno"" and ""otto"" as they begin with a vowel.
Any other number is built by attaching the larger number and then the smaller number; hence,

Forty-three is quarantatre.
Seventy-five is settantacinque.
Hundred and ninety-six is centonovantasei.
Four-hundred and twenty-five is quattrocentoventicinque.
Note that in Italian they attach them; in contrast to English that they put a hyphen.


If smaller number is uno or otto, drop the last letter of the larger number (I put a vertical bar | to show the drop); hence,

Thirty-one is trentuno (trent|uno).
Fifty-eight is cinquantotto (cinquant|otto).
Hundred and one is centuno (cent|uno).
Two-thousand and eight-hundred and sixty-four is duomilottocentosessantaquattro (duomil|ottocentosessantaquattro).

Note that all the cardinals from eleven upwards end to a vowel (that is, a, e, i, o).,


Know that when a cardinal ends to three (3) such as twenty-three, thirty-three, forty-three, and so on, to build ordinals, do not drop the ending vowel of ""tre;"" hence,

Twenty-third : (twenty-three)ventitre+esimo: ventitreesimo (ventitreesimo).,


Note that ordinals greater than tenth could have a second construct as an aesthetical variation of style.",How to Count in Italian3,"


First : Primo,

segment it as prim-o; pronounce it as preemo. (/pri-mo/)


Second : Secondo,

segment it as second-o; pronounce it as seh-condo. (/se-kon-do/)


Third : Terzo,

segment it as terz-o (compare it with tre); pronounce it as teh-rza. (/tεr-tso/)


Fourth : Quarto,

Fifth : Quinto,

segment it as quint-o; pronounce it as koo-int-oh. (/kwin-to/)


Sixth : Sesto,

segment it as se-st-o; pronounce it as sehs-toe. (/se-sto/)


Seventh : Settimo,

segment it as sett-im-o; pronounce it as set-teem-oh. (/sεt-ti-mo/)


Eighth : Ottavo,

segment it as ott-av-o; pronounce it as ottah-voe. (/ot-ta-vo/)


Ninth : Nono,

segment it as non-o; pronounce it as nono. (/nɔ-no/)


Tenth : Decimo,

segment it as d-ecim-o; pronounce it as deh-cheem-o. (/dε-t∫i-mo/)



,
Drop the ending vowel from the cardinal (a vertical bar | is put in place of the dropped vowel, showing the trick).
Add the new ending ""esimo"" (/ε-zi-mo/) to cardinal to build the ordinal. Hence,

Eleventh : (eleven)undici+esimo: undicesimo (undic|esimo).
Thirteenth : (thirteen)tredici+esimo: tredicesimo (tredic|esimo).
Seventeenth : (seventeen)diciasette+esimo: diciasettesimo (diciasett|esimo).
Twentieth : (twenty)venti+esimo: ventesimo (vent|esimo).
Twenty-first : (twenty-one)ventuno+esimo: ventunesimo (ventun|esimo).
Thirtieth : (thirty)trenta+esimo: trentesimo (trent|esimo).



,
Thirty-third : (thirty-three)trentatre+esimo: trentatreesimo (trentatreesimo).
Forty-third : (forty-three)quarantatre+esimo: quarantatreesimo (quarantatreesimo).



,
In such constructs they are written as separate words. Hence,

Eleventh : undicesimo is the same as decimo primo.
Fourteenth : quattordicesimo is the same as decimo quarto.
Twenty-third : ventitreesimo is the same as ventesimo terzo.
Fifty-seventh : cinquantasetttesimo is the same as cinquantesimo settimo.



"
"


Use Cardinals for calendar dates.",How to Count in Italian4," In contrast to English language, for calendar dates Italians do not use ordinals; hence,

Third of April is said, ""tre aprile.""


There is only one exception to this rule as the first day of each month; hence,

First of November is said, ""primo novembre.""

"
Learn what the direct object pronoun of the sentence is.,
Remember that reflexive pronouns also have the role of object pronouns.

,
Learn where the indirect object or reflexive pronouns should be modified to new forms when they appear before the direct pronouns:


mi + (lo, la, li, le) : mi becomes me.,
The reflexive pronouns, mi, ti, ci, vi follow the same rules, and:


si + (lo, la, li, le) : si becomes se.

",How to Learn Pronouns in Italian7," For example: ""He gave a book to me""––now, substitute ""a book"" by the pronoun ""it""––He gave ""it"" to me. Now this needs to be dealt with as double object pronouns. In the basic Italian discussed here, ""to me"" (indirect pronoun) should come first, then ""it"" (direct pronoun) and, at last, the ""gave"" verb that in Italian includes ""he"" as its ending. Hence, this become in Italian: to me-it-gave, that is, me lo dà



Me is the new form of mi when used in a double object pronouns sentence.

,,
ti + (lo, la, li, le) : ti becomes te.
Le + (lo, la, li, le) : Le becomes glie.

glie attaches to the direct pronouns it precedes. For example,

glie + lo becomes glielo.
glie + la becomes gliela, and so on.




gli + (lo, la, li, le) : gli becomes glie.

glie attaches to the direct pronouns it precedes. For example,

glie + lo becomes glielo.
glie + la becomes gliela, and so on.




le + (lo, la, li, le) : le becomes glie.

glie attaches to the direct pronouns it precedes. For example,

glie + lo becomes glielo.
glie + la becomes gliela, and so on.




ci + (lo, la, li, le) : ci becomes ce.
vi + (lo, la, li, le) : vi becomes ve.
Loro does not change and comes after the verb.
loro does not change and comes after the verb.

,"
"
Note that possessive pronouns answer the questions such as, ""Whose is this?""",How to Learn Pronouns in Italian8," In Italian, in contrast to English, there are no possessive pronouns. Instead, possessive adjectives are used with the modified noun dropped and ""definite articles"" are placed in front of them to convey the same meaning as English possessive pronouns. For example:



Di chi è questo libro? È il mio. (Whose is this book? It is mine.)

"
"
Note that relative pronouns are those that begin a ""relative clause"" and refer to a noun in the ""subject clause."",
Note that there are other pronouns in the same category, such as:


Demonstrative pronouns, such as, ""That is what I am talking about in an hour."",
Note also that relative, interrogative, and demonstrative pronouns have three cases depending on the noun that they refer to as:


Subjective
Objective
Possessive.

",How to Learn Pronouns in Italian9," For example, ""The boy who sits in the front row."" Here the relative clause is ""who sits in the front row"", which modifies the subject clause ""the boy."" In this sentence, who has the role of a pronoun.

, By that he refers to a topic known by the audience.
Interrogative pronoun, such as, ""Who is the boy sitting in the front row (showing John in front row)?"" Hence, who is a reference to John.
Indefinite pronouns, such as, ""Anybody could sit in the front row (among them John)."" Here, anybody refers to John.
Reciprocal pronouns, such as ""Teacher and students started arguing with each other."" Again, each other refers to teachers and students.

che : who, that, which, whom
chi : who (one who)
cui : which, whom; in the sense,

a cui : to whom
con cui : with which (the company with which I have contract.),
Variable relative pronouns change depending on gender and number:


Article il : quale (singular).",How to Learn Pronouns in Italian11,"
di cui : to which
in cui : in which (where)


ci&ograve che: what.

,
Article la : quale (singular).

Consider moving to Italy for a holiday (or a period of time) and attend Italian courses in a real Italian school.",How to Choose an Italian Language Course or Program," Before enrolling, make sure the school you're considering is a qualified school with mother tongue, professional and qualified teachers.


Verify the teachers qualifications. Teachers must be mother tongue, qualified and experienced. It is not enough to be Italian to be a professor and teach the language to students. If the school professors are qualified and experienced, you can learn the Italian language very well and very fast. Otherwise, you risk of losing your time and money as well.
Understand the kind of qualification they have, because certifications are not all the same. Before choosing an institute and attending an Italian language course, the most important thing is verifying if the school is officially recognized by the Italian Education Ministry (MIUR in Italian). One of the most valid certifications is DITALS (Examination of the University for Foreigners of Siena that you can find in many other cities as well).;
, Go on the school website and read the study programs.


Enter the name of the school and search on Google for sites, blogs and forums about studies abroad and international schools: verify what users and bloggers write about the institute you want to choose. On these websites you can discover positive and negative messages and check the reputation of the school. Obviously, if posts and comments have a large number of negative reviews, it is not the right school for you!
Find out if the organizers plan special courses about the Italian culture (art, history, music, etc), guided art history itineraries, Italian architecture visits, cultural events, excursions and guided visits to the city’s parks, evenings out at restaurants and “pizzerie”, cooking classes, photography sessions and inter-linguistic exchange with the Italians.

, So, the best thing you can do is buying a book at the book store or taking one at the library.
, Selecting an institute is not easy, because there is a large offer of different classes, according to the different students’ needs. You can choose a full immersion and intensive class or a super-intensive course, but it depends on what you have to do and in particular why you want to learn the Italian language.


If you want to study Italian because you want to visit Italy and know the basis of the language to understand what the Italians say, you can choose an intensive course.
If you wish to move and work there, you should choose a full immersion and super-intensive class. In this way, you will learn the most important rules very fast.

Remember that English language is influenced by the Italian (actually Latin) modifiers in certain places such as World War II that we read as World War the Second.,
Note please.",How to Count in Italian5," Hence, we have in Italian,


Benedicto XVI as Benedicto, decimo sesto.
Carlo II as Carlo secondo (Charles, the second).
Tomo IV as Tomo quarto (volume four).

, Ordinal modifiers follow the grammar rules of other Italian modifiers, when being adverb, plural, and so on. Hence,


primi anni (first years, contrasted with English).
prima donna (first woman, contrasted with English).
primo uomo (first man, contrasted with English).

Visit an Arab cultural center.",How to Speak Arabic," Arabic is very different than English, so it is important to have some kind of grammar book to assist you in your language education, especially if you are a beginner learner of the language. Here are a few books to consider to help you learn the foundational elements of Arabic grammar:



Teaching and Learning Arabic as a Foreign Language: A Guide for Teachers by Karin C. Ryding. This book was published by Georgetown University Press in 2013.The Arabic Alphabet: How to Read and Write It by Nicholas Awde and Putros Samano.Easy Arabic Grammar by Jane Wightwick and Mahmoud Gaafar. It was published by McGraw Hill in 2004.Arabic Verbs and Essentials of Grammar by Jane Wightwick and Mahmoud Gaafar. This text was published by McGraw Hill in 2007.;
, There are many online tools available to help language learners get the information they need. While there are many heralded programs that can cost and arm and a leg (like Rosetta Stone), there are also quite a few online tutorials that offer guidance at no cost. Here are a few of the most reputable free online Arabic language learning sources:


Salaam Arabic, hosted by Pangaea Learning, offers free online tutorials in learning Arabic. The lessons are broken down by category: Numbers, Days, Greetings, Religion, Subject Pronouns, etc. There are even some grammar sections for beginner and intermediate learners.Arabic Speak 7 provides online grammar training in Arabic at no cost. Their program includes extensive lists of verbs, pronouns, and other useful words/phrases with clear English instructions.Madinah Arabic offers free online Arabic instruction with a focus on numbers, vocabulary, and situational Arabic. They also feature a discussion forum where you can ask questions of the more advanced members of the community when you need additional help understanding something., Arabic letters and text and read horizontally from right to left (the opposite of English and other European languages). Some sounds/letters that exist in the English alphabet can't be found in the Arabic alphabet, and vice versa.


Use an online source, such as Salaam Arabic, to memorize the Arabic alphabet. Websites like this usually have audio pronunciation guides to help you learn how to say each letter correctly. (ت is taa or ""t"", ب is baa or ""b"", and so on).
Additionally, short vowels aren't written in Arabic as letters, but as symbols (called fathas) that are written above the consonants to indicate a vowel sound., When learning a new language, it is important to familiarize yourself with some of the basic words so that you can get comfortable with pronunciation and start building your knowledge of the language. Here are a few of the most basic Arabic words that you should memorize.


مرحباً, or Marhaban, is the formal word for ""Hello.""
مع السّلامة, or Maᶜa ssalamah, is the word for ""Goodbye.""
أهلاً وسهلاً بكَ, or Aahlan wa sahlan bika, is the word for ""Welcome"" addressed to a male.
أهلاً وسهلاً بكِ, or Aahlan wa sahlan biki, is the word for ""Welcome"" addressed to a female.
كبير, or Kabeer, is the word for ""big.""
صغير, or Sagheer, is the word for ""small.""
اليوم, or Alyawm, is the word for ""today.""
واحد, إثنان, ثلاثة, or wahed, ithnaan, thalatha, are the words for ""one, two, three.""
أكل, or akala, is the word for ""to eat.""
ذهب, or dahaba, is the word for ""to go.""

, The only way to learn a new language is to start memorizing the words. Make flashcards with the word in Arabic on one side and the same word in English on the other side. You can use them to test your memory. Plus, flashcards are less bulky than textbooks, so you can take the flashcards with you and practice whenever you have a free moment.


It might be helpful to group words together by meaning as you learn. Unlike English, Arabic uses roots that will indicate and allow Arabic speakers to anticipate the meaning or context of a word. For instance, in English, words like computer, keyboard, and internet may be related ideas or objects but they do not sound similar. In Arabic, related words are also related sonically.

, Arabic sentences are usually constructed in this order: verb-subject-direct object.This is one of the main reasons why it differs so much from English, which typically structures its sentences subject-verb-direct object.


Some Arabic sentences, however, exclude verbs altogether because they have an implied ""to be"". These sentences start with a noun and are called nominal sentences.For example, الولد مصري, or al-walad miSri, means ""The boy is Egyptian,"" but there is no verb. So, literally translated, it means ""The boy Egyptian.""



, To ask questions in Arabic, you can simply add هل, or hal, to the beginning of the sentence (remember, the sentence begins on the right side!).


For example, هل لديه بيت؟, or hal ladaihi bait? (""Does he have a house?"") is the question form of the phrase لديه بيت, or ladaihi bai, meaning ""He has a house.""

, Especially if you are traveling to a place where Arabic is the native spoken language, you'll need to learn how to combine words into phrases in order to communicate. Here are a few of the most common phrases you'll need to know in Arabic:


كيف حالك؟, or Kaifa haloka, is the phrase for ""How are you?""
أنا بخير شكرا, or Ana bekhair, shokran, is the phrase for ""I'm fine, thanks.""
شكرا, or Shokran, is the word for ""Thank you.""
ما إسمك؟, or Ma esmouk? to a male and Ma esmouki?"" to a female, is the phrase for ""What is your name?""

إسمي...., or Esmee…, is the word for ""My name is...""
متشرف, or Motasharefon, is the word for ""Nice to meet you.""
هل تتكلم اللغة الإنجليزية, or Hal tatakallamu alloghah alenjleziah, is the phrase for ""Do you speak English?""
لا أفهم, or La afham, is the phrase for ""I don't understand.""
هل بإمكانك مساعدتي؟, or Hal beemkanek mosa’adati?, is the phrase for ""Can you help me?""
أدرس اللغة العربية منذ شهر, or adrusu allughah al arabia mundu shahr, means ""I have been learning Arabic for one month.""
أحبك, or Uhibbok, is the word for ""I love you.""
كم الساعة؟, or Kam As-sa'ah, is the phrase for ""What time is it?""

, If you're able, enroll in an Arabic course at a local university. You will usually have to take a placement test to determine your proficiency level, but then you will be placed with other learners at your same skill level. This will provide you with an automatic support system of other learners with whom you can study and practice speaking.

, One of the best ways to expand language proficiency is to read books that are written in that language. The more you read, the better acquainted you'll become with the words and how they work together. Try reading the Qur'an, which is the primary religious text of Islam. You can find English versions, but it will also be easy to find editions in Arabic.

, It is important to immerse yourself in the language to fully learn its use. Try listening to conversations around you, or, if you don't live in a place where the language is commonly spoken, try watching movies that are filmed in Arabic with English subtitles. The form of the movie will allow you to understand more from the context than you might otherwise be able to follow. There are many famous Arabic language filmsto choose from.

, Improving your grasp of the vocabulary is important in learning a new language. Read through an Arabic-English dictionary to try to memorize new words. The more words you know, the more you'll be able to use the language.

, Immersing yourself in the culture and experience of a place where the natives speak the language you are attempting to learn is one of the best ways to practice your speaking skills. While it may often be difficult to use your Arabic conversational skills regularly at home, when you travel to an Arabic speaking country, almost every interaction you have will involve practicing your speaking skills - from checking in at your hotel to engaging with street vendors at the market.

, One good way to practice your language skills is to join an Arabic conversation group. Try searching on the internet for one in your area, or inquire at a local college. College campuses often provide support groups (like conversation clubs) for language learners.

, Try to find someone who lives near you that is a native Arabic speaker. Regularly engaging in conversations with native speakers is a great way to keep your language skills active. Even if you don't know any native Arabic speakers, maybe you could find a person through an online forum that would be willing to Skype with you on a consistent basis.

, In almost every state, there is an Arab cultural center that you can go visit to learn more about Arabic language and culture. These organizations host community-wide cultural events and often provide assistance for members of their local Arabic American community.


In Houston, Texas, there is a large Arab-American Cultural Community Centerthat aims to help integrate Arabs as Americans and to promote cultural education for those who are interested.
The Arab American Cultural Center of Silicon Valleyaims to promote aspects of Arabic culture in the United States and to provide resources for Arabic American members of their community.

Learn a few basic greetings.,
Learn a few commonly used words.,
Memorize a few common sentences.",How to Learn Basic Arabic Words and Phrases2," Egypt is a major hub for Arabic speakers, but it does have its own unique dialect.

In order to be understood by someone in Egypt or a nearby country (such as Sudan), you should learn a few basic terms in Egyptian Arabic.

, Just like in English, there are many ways to say hello or to greet someone. Even if you don't end up speaking all of these, learning them will be helpful when you hear them spoken to you. Here are a few basic greetings in Egyptian Arabic:


Assalaam aleykoom Or Salamo Aleko(peace be with you, used for starting a conversation)
Salaam (peace, used for ending a conversation)
Ezayek(female) Or Ezayak(male) (how are you?)
Ahlan wa sahlan (welcome)
Amla/amel eh (how are you?)

Aywa (yes)
La'a (no)
Shokran (thank you)
Affwan (you're welcome)
Law Samaht (please)
Kwayes (good)
Aasif (sorry)
Kol haga (everything)
Feen (where)
Leeh (why)

Be aware that there are several types of Arabic.,
Learn the Arabic alphabet.,
Learn how to use an Arabic dictionary.,
Learn at home.,
Consider online tuition.,
Try language classes.,
Practice your Arabic and befriend native Arabic speakers.",How to Learn Arabic," They are: Modern Standard Arabic, Classical (Qur'anic) Arabic, or Colloquial Arabic. Decide which kind of Arabic you want to learn:



Modern Standard Arabic. Unless your interest is confined to one particular country, the safest option is to learn a version of the classical language known as Modern Standard Arabic. MSA is used across the Arab World, but is generally confined to writing and formal contexts: literature, newspapers, education, radio/television news programs, political speeches, etc.

Classical (Qur'anic) Arabic. If your interest is more specific to Islamic or Medieval Arabic studies, a course in Qur'anic/Classical Arabic will meet your needs. It is the Arabic used in the Holy Qur'an, the Arabic of classical religious, intellectual, and legal texts, and the Arabic from which Modern Standard Arabic is based.

Colloquial Arabic. If you are planning on living in the Arab World or dealing with a specific Arab region or country, Modern Standard Arabic on its own is unlikely to meet all your needs. Arabs speak regional dialects as their mother tongue, and the differences between dialects can be significant enough to cause mutual unintelligibility. Broadly speaking, there are five broad families of dialects, each with sub-dialects according to country, city, neighbourhood, and even religion: Gulf Arabic, Mesopotamian Arabic, Levantine Arabic, Egyptian Arabic, and Maghrebi Arabic.;
, The Arabic script seems daunting at first, and some people try to avoid learning it by relying on transliterations of Arabic words. This merely stores up problems for later; it is much better to ignore transliterations and use the script from the start. The best you can do is to buy or borrow a book at the library, since this is a long and difficult project.

, Words in Arabic dictionaries are normally listed under their three-letter roots. So you would look for istiqbaal (""reception"") under ""q"" because the root letters are q-b-l. Getting used to this takes a little practice but it is not particularly difficult because additions to the roots follow set patterns. Something similar happens in English: ""unaccustomed"", for example, is actually ""un-a-custom-ed"".

, If you are able to study at home, there are self-tuition courses that will see you through the beginners’ stage, and perhaps even a little beyond. The traditional textbook-and-cassette courses vary in quality, as do their teaching methods. You may find yourself buying two or three before you find one that suits you.

, If you would like to try learning Arabic over the internet, the following courses are available:


BABEL Arabicis an interactive course for beginners with text, sound, transcriptions and translations. It teaches writing and reading in the form of conversations.
The Arabic Tutor is a beginners' course on CD ROM which can be sampled and purchased over the Internet.
Apprendre l'Arabe is basic Arabic for French speakers.

, For most people, part-time evening classes are perhaps the most accessible option. They can provide a leisurely introduction to the language, but don’t expect to learn very much very rapidly. Try researching what options you have in the area where you live.

, The Arab diaspora spans every corner of the world; the best way to develop your Arabic is to talk with Arabs and expose yourself to all things Arabic. Join pen-pal websites, listen to Arab music, watch Arab soap operas, news broadcasts, and children's shows, chat with your local Palestinian barber, Moroccan grocer, and Lebanese restaurateur, etc. Knowing even a few words opens doors.


Find someone who speaks Arabic. You might have someone in your family or in your friend group. You can also ask on Facebook if anyone knows an Arabic speaking person.
Contact the person and ask him or her to meet once a week for an hour. You can focus on words, for instance, words connected to living, travel, etc.
At the same time, focus on basic sentences, ready made chunks, such as how are you, my name is, how old are you, etc. You can also put these into different categories.
In the meantime, study the language points you have discussed with your tutor. When you meet next time, you will be able to understand more and have more insight into the language. You can also ask questions about the prior lessons.

, More casual is ""Hoi"",""Hai"" or ""Hey"". In the Achterhoek they say ""Môgge""

, Note that the ""i"" in ""ik"" is pronounced as the ""i"" in ""bin"".

, (Ya(w))

,, (Da(w)nk Yuh). ""wel"" can be added to the end of this expression to convey the English phrase ""very much"".

,, (NOTE: Politer is ""Mag ik"" but you'll probably starve before you can pronounce the dutch ""G"".)

, (wAAr is hat muu-zay-uhm). Note that the AA is pronounced as a German A, for example in ""mAchen"".

, Simply say ""Waar kan je iets drinken?"" (wAAr Cawn Yuh EEts drink-uhn)

, If you feel all icky-and-chilly-and-scared, just learn this one sentence; ""Spreekt u Engels?"" (Spraked ew Ang-uhls). If you can't even remember this, just ask ""Do you speak English?"". Because 90% of the population does. Just don't let the accent scare you away.

Listen to the sound so you know when you have it right.,
Get the air moving.,
Don't let your vocal chords vibrate.,
Make the sound by pressing the tongue against the roof of the mouth at the point where the uvula hangs down (point 9 on the chart).,
Try saying the word 'gek' which means 'crazy'.,
Practice.",How to Pronounce the Dutch 'g'," See the Sources and Citations section below for some example recordings.;
, The Dutch 'g' is a ""fricative"", meaning that the air is moving past a partly constricted opening in your mouth. Other examples of fricatives in English are ""f"" as in ""fee"", ""s"" as in ""hiss"" and ""th"" as in ""thistle"".

, This is a voiceless sound. For an example of voiced versus voiceless sounds, pronounce the word ""zap"" in English. The 'z' is voiced. Then pronounce the word ""sap"". The ""s"" is unvoiced. All the fricatives mentioned in the previous step are voiceless, too.

, The sound is similar to the 'ch' in 'loch', but to the Dutch that still sounds too much like a 'k' as in 'cat', because it is made against the ""velum"" (point 8 on the chart), rather than the uvula. The Dutch sound is also found in German (e.g. in ""Dach"" = ""roof"")To pronounce the 'g' like a native Dutch speaker, you should try make a sound as if you were gargling. It may sound kind of gross, but that is generally how it's pronounced.

, (See the sources section for a link to the audio.) The '-ek' part is pronounced exactly the same as the '-eck' part in 'check', so you would get a short gurgling sound followed by 'eck'. Or if you think the 'ch' in 'loch' works better for you it would be 'ch-eck'.

, This is not a usual phoneme in English, so practice using it. You'll get used to it after a while, and be able to produce it easily.

The translation of 'I miss you' is 'Ik mis je'.,
To say 'ik', take the 'i' in 'in' and say a very ""hard"" 'k'.,
Just say 'mis' the exact same way as 'miss'.

,
To say 'je', take the 'y' in 'you' and say 'uh' right behind it.,
Now say it out loud: I-g miss y-uh

",How to Say I Miss You in Dutch," 'I' means 'Ik', 'miss' means 'mis', 'you' means 'je'. That's not so hard, isn't it? Now all you have to do is say it out loud. That's where the problems step in.;
, The 'k' sound like the 'k' in the word 'kids' and does not sound anything like a G at all

,, y-uh

"
Say ""toh."",
Say ""dah."",
Put it all together with the accent on ""dah."",
Use this word as an all-purpose ""thanks.""",How to Say Thank You in Hebrew1," In Hebrew, the simplest, most common way to say ""thank you"" is ""toda"" (תודה).The first syllable is very similar to the English word ""TOffee.""


Try to pronounce it with the tongue and lips at the front of the mouth to give it a very slight ""oo"" sound. You don't want to say ""too,"" but the word shouldn't quite use a straight ""oh"" either.;
, The second syllable in ""toda"" uses a standard English d Some Hebrew speakers pronounce it with a short a sound (like the a in ""apple"").Try to open your mouth slightly when you pronounce this syllable. Say it with the middle or back of your mouth (not with your lips at the front) to get the perfect inflection.

, ""Toda"" is pronounced basically ""toh-DAH,"" with the emphasis on the second syllable. A good example of the proper pronunciation and stress is available from Omniglot.This is important — putting the stress on the first syllable (""TOH-dah"") will make the word sound bizarre and may make it hard to understand you. It's like pronouncing the English word ""enough"" as ""EE-nuff,"" not ""ee-NUFF.""

, In Hebrew, ""toda"" is very, very common. You can use it to give thanks in virtually any situation. For instance, it's a good choice when you are served food, when someone gives you a compliment, or when someone gives you a helping hand.


One of the nice things about the Hebrew language is that it doesn't have strict rules about which words to use in formal situations and which to use in informal ones (like, for instance, Spanish). You can say ""toda"" to your little brother or to the CEO of the company you're working for — it doesn't matter!"
"
Use ""toda raba"" (תודה רבה) for ""thank you very much."",
Alternatively, use ""rav todot"" (רב תודות) for ""Thank you very much."",
Use ""ani mode lecha"" (אני מודה לך) if you're a male.,
Use ""ani moda lach"" (אני מודה לך) if you're a female.",How to Say Thank You in Hebrew2," While ""toda"" is perfect for your everyday ""thank yous,"" sometimes, you'll want to express that you're especially thankful for something. In this case, try ""toda raba,"" which is roughly equivalent to ""thank you very much"" or ""thanks a lot.""


This phrase is pronounced ""toh-DAH rah-BAH."" ""Toda"" is exactly the same as above. The r in ""raba"" is pronounced very delicately at the back of the throat. It is very similar to the French r (as in ""au revoir"").Note also that the stress is on the ""bah"" in ""raba"" (just like in ""toe-DAH"").

, The meaning here is roughly the same as for ""toda raba"".However this word is used very rarely.This phrase is pronounced ""ruv toe-DOT."" Remember to use the soft, ""French"" r sound at the back of the throat, rather than a hard English r.

, While Hebrew doesn't have strict tenses and word forms for formal situations, but if you want to say thank you in a very polite, formal way, you can use gender-specific grammar. This specific phrase is used when the speaker is a man. It doesn't matter what gender the person being thanked is.


This phrase is pronounced. ""ah-NEE moe-DEH leh-HHAH.""The most difficult sound here is the ""hah"" at the end. It's not quite like the English ""ha"" used for laughter. The first h uses a raspy, almost r-like h sound produced in the back of the throat. It's the same sound used in traditional Jewish words like ""Chanukah,"" ""chutzpah,"" and so on.

, The meaning here is exactly the same as for the term above. The only difference is that it's used by females. Again, the gender of the person you're talking to isn't important.


""ah-NEE mo-DeH lach.Here, we're ending ""lach"" with the ""chutzpah"" h sound discussed above. Note also that the second word in the phrase ends with a ""dah"" sound, not a ""deh"" one.

Know the pronunciations of the Hebrew vowels known as nikudot (נְקֻדּוֹת).,
Understand how to read Hebrew consonants together with vowels.,
Understand the concept of the dagesh.,
Understand the concept of the geresh.,
Understand the concept of 'silent letters' in Hebrew.,
Understand the letter vav (ו).,
Get to know the pronunciation of the letters ח and כ.,
Get to know the pronunciation of the letter Tav (ת).,
Get to know the shva.,
Once you understand these rules, you are ready to transliterate.",How to Translate Hebrew Into English,", The nikudot are as follows:


Patach בַ - pronounced a as in father.
Kamatz בָ - in Ashkenazi dialect, pronounced a as in what. In Sephardi dialect, pronounced like Patach.
Segol בֶ - pronounced e as in bed.
Tzeirei בֵ - pronounced a as in cake.

Chirik בִ - pronounced e as in she.

Shva בְ - pronounced i as in bid or with no sound (see Shva below for explanation).

, In the Hebrew language, most vowel symbols are placed directly below the consonant. When such a combination occurs, first the consonant sound is pronounced, then the vowel. For example, when you see a קֻ, first pronounce the K sound of the ק, then pronounce the u sound of the koobootz. The full sound is ""ku.""

, A dagesh is a dot that appears in the center of a letter to disambiguate its sound when a letter has multiple sounds. Many Hebrew letters can be found with a dagesh, though only 4 letters have a distinct sound with or without one: ב, כ, פ, and ת, and ת only has a distinct sound in Ashkenazi dialect.
When Hebrew is written without vowels, the dagesh is not written, and the reader is expected to know the specific sound.

, A geresh is a symbol similar in appearance to an apostrophe that like a dagesh, disambiguates the sound of a letter, and is specifically used to identify sounds not traditionally found in Hebrew, but introduced into Hebrew through loanwords. Even when Hebrew is written without vowels, the geresh is frequently included.

, The Hebrew language has two letters that are always silent: א and ע. The letters ה and י are also sometimes used as silents. If a silent letter appears with a vowel, it is pronounced plainly as that vowel with no consonant sound. If a silent letter appears with no vowel, it is not pronounced.

, The vav can make the sounds of 4 English letters: O, U, V, and W.


A vav with a vowel is typical pronounced as a V followed by the respective vowel sound.
A vav with a dot above (displayed as וֹ) is pronounced O as in ""rope."" It is typically pronounced in conjunction with the previous consonant and treated just like a vowel together with that letter. This is known as a cholam.

A vav with a dot to the left (displayed as וּ) is pronounced as U as in ""glue.""' It is typically pronounced in conjunction with the previous consonant and treated just like a vowel together with that letter. This is known as a shuruk.
The letter vav is used to represent the English letter W. Though common dialects of Hebrew do not have a W sound, vav is used for loanwords in modern Israeli Hebrew.

, These letters make sounds not found in the English language. The sound is very much like a K and an H sound put together, rolling the back of the tongue. Sounds like this are also found in many Eastern European languages. While these letters are viewed as many as having identical sounds, the ח has more of an H-sound and the כ has more of a K-sound. Look at YouTube videos in Hebrew or Eastern European languages to get a sense of how to pronounce these sounds if you do not already know.

, Above, you see 3 versions of the Tav. But the actual pronunciations vary by dialect.


In Ashkenazi dialect of Biblical Hebrew, when vowels are included, תּ is used for a T-sound and ת is used for an S-sound. When no vowels are included, no dagesh is found, and the reader is expected to know which sound to use.
In Sephardi dialect, ת is used for a T-sound, with or without a dagesh. This is one of the most notable differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardi Hebrew used in sacred texts.
Modern Israeli Hebrew is like Sephardi Hebrew with the ת representing a T-sound. But ת׳ can also be used for a Th-sound.

, The shva, which appears as a colon (:) below a letter, can either be pronounced as a short i (as in kid) or no sound at all. To determine whether or not to use a sound, try to combine the letter under which it is found with the letter that follows as a cluster. If it is possible to pronounce the two letters as a cluster, the shva is silent, and it is a cluster. A shva can also be silent when it is at the end of syllable of a word, and another syllable follows. If neither of these can be accomplished, the shva is pronounced as a short i. The shva is also pronounced when it is beneath a prefix.

,


For consonants, use the English letter corresponding with the Hebrew letter as described.
For vowels, use the following:

For a patach or kamatz, use A
For a segol, use E
For a tzeirei, use EI or EY (or you could just use an E)
For a chirik, use I
For a shva that is pronounced, use I or '
For a shva that is not pronounced, use ' or no vowel
For a cholam, use O
For a shuruk or kubutz, use U

Don't worry about bullies, they are just jealous.
, Dutch is classified as a West Germanic language which is closely related to other languages in this branch, including German, English and West Frisian.


The Dutch language originally developed from the Lower Franconian dialect of Low German. However modern Dutch has departed from its German origins in that it did not undergo the High German consonant shift and does not use the German umlaut as a grammatical marker.
In addition, Dutch has more or less abandoned its original grammatical case system and has leveled a lot of its morphology. On the other hand, Dutch vocabulary is primarily Germanic in origin (although it contains more Romance loan words) and uses the same word order in sentences (SVO in main clauses and SOV in subordinate clauses)., Dutch is spoken as a first language by approximately 20 million people, mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium. It is spoken as a second language by approximately another 5 million.


In addition to The Netherlands and Belgium, Dutch is also used in parts of Northern France, Germany, Suriname and Indonesia and is an official language on the Caribbean islands of The Netherland Antilles.
The dialects of Dutch spoken in Belgium are known collectively as Flemish. Flemish differs from standard Dutch in several ways, including pronunciation, vocabulary and intonation.
The language of Afrikaans -- which is spoken in South Africa and Namibia by approximately 10 million people -- is a descendant of Dutch and the two languages are considered mutually intelligible., When beginning to learn any language, the alphabet is a good place to start.



A (ah) B (bay) C (say) D (day) E (ay) F (eff) G (khay) H (hah) I (ee) J (yay) K (kah) L (ell) M (emm) N (enn) O (oh) P (pay) Q (kew) R (air) S (ess) T (tay) U (ew) V (vay) W (way) X (eeks) Y (ee-grek or 'I') Z (zed).
However, in terms of actual pronunciation, Dutch contains many sounds which are not used in English and can therefore be difficult to learn. The only letters which have the same pronunciation in Dutch as in English are the consonants s, f, h, b, d, z, l, m, n, ng. The letters p, t, and k are formed in the same way, but they are not aspirated (there is no puff of air when they are spoken).
The best way to learn the pronunciation of some of the more unusual consonant and vowel sounds is to listen to them and repeat. The following overview is not exhaustive, but it will help you to get started:


Vowels: a (pronounced like ""ah"" in ""calm"", but shorter), e (pronounced like ""eh"" in ""bed""), i (pronounced like ""ih"" in ""bit""), o (pronounced like ""aw"" in ""paw"", but with rounded lips), oe (pronounced like the ""oo"" in ""too"" but shorter), u (pronounced like the ""u"" in ""upset"", or ""ir"" in ""dirt"") and y (pronounced like the ""i"" in ""pin"" or ""ee"" in ""deep"", but shorter).

Consonants: Some consonant sounds that are pronounced very differently in Dutch are ch, sch and g which all produce a guttural sound in the back of the throat (almost like the ""ch"" in the Scottish word ""loch""). The Dutch r can be rolled or guttural, while the j is pronounced like the ""y"" in ""yes"". , The Dutch language classifies all of its nouns into one of two genders -- common (de words) or neuter (het words). This is much less complicated than German , which has three.


It can be difficult to guess which gender a word is based on how it looks. Therefore, it's better to just memorize the gender of specific words as you learn them.
The common gender is actually a combined form of the masculine and feminine genders, which are no longer used. As a result, about 2/3 of all nouns belong to the common gender.
Therefore, a good technique is just to learn all of the neuter nouns. Then you can be confident that any of the nouns you haven't learned are most likely common.
You can identify neuter nouns by learning a number of rules. For example, all diminutive nouns (which end in je) and all infinitives that are used as nouns are neuter. This is also true for words that end in -um, -aat, -sel and -isme, and for most words that start with ge-, be- and ver-. The words for colors, compass directions and metals are also always neuter.

, As you progress on your journey towards learning Dutch, it is a good idea to memorize some of the most commonly used present tense verbs as they are necessary to start forming sentences.



Zijn: Present tense of ""to be"", pronounced ""zayn"".


Ik ben: I am (pronounced ""ik ben"")

Jij/u bent: You are (pronounced ""yay / ew bent"")

September = September (pronounced ""sep-tem-buhr""),
October = Oktober (pronounced ""ock-tow-buhr""),
November = November (pronounced ""no-vem-buhr""),
December = December (pronounced ""day-sem-buhr"").



, Learning the Dutch words for the different colors is a good way to build up your descriptive vocabulary.


Red = rood (pronounced ""rowt"")
Orange = oranje (pronounced ""oh-rahn-yuh"")
Yellow = geel (pronounced ""ghayl"")
Green = groen (pronounced ""ghroon"")

Black = zwart (pronounced ""zwahrt"")
Brown = bruin (pronounced ""bruyn"")
Grey = grijs (pronounced ""greys"")

Gold = goud (pronounced ""howt"")

, Adding a few key words to your vocabulary can make a huge difference to your Dutch conversation skills.


Hello = Hallo (pronounced ""hah-low"")
Goodbye = Tot ziens (pronounced ""toht seens"")
Please = Alstublieft (pronounced ""ahl-stuu-bleeft"")
Thank you = Dank u well (formal, pronounced ""dahnk-ew-vehl"") or dank je wel (informal, pronounced ""dahnk-yuh-vehl"")
Yes = Ja (pronounced ""yah"")

Today = Vandaag (pronounced ""vahn-dahg"")
Tomorrow = Morgen (pronounced ""more-ghun"")
Left = Links (pronounced ""links"")
Right = Rechts (pronounced ""reghts"")
Straight ahead = Rechtdoor (pronounced ""regh-dore"")

, Next it's time to move on to to some useful, everyday phrases which will help you to navigate basic social interactions.


How are you? = Hoe maakt u het? (formal, pronounced ""hoo mahkt uu hut"") or Hoe gaat het? (informal, pronounced ""hoo gaht hut?"")
Fine, thank you = Goed, dank u (formal, pronounced ""goot dahnk uu"") or Goed, dank je (pronounced ""goot dahnk yuh"")
Nice to meet you = Aangenaam kennis te maken (pronounced ""ahn-guh-nahm keh-nis tuh mah-kun"")
I can't speak Dutch well = Ik spreek niet goed Nederlands (pronounced ""ick sprayk neet goot nay-dur-lahnts)
Do you speak English? = Spreekt u Engels? (pronounced ""spraykt uu eng-uls"")
I don't understand = Ik begrijp het niet (pronounced ""ick buh-grayp hut neet"")
You are welcome = Graag gedaan (pronounced ""grahg guh-dahn"")
How much does this cost? = Hoeveel kost dit? (pronounced ""hoo-vale kost dit""), Check out your local library or book store or shop online to see what's out there. Several language publishing companies such as Assimil, Berlitz, Teach Yourself, Hugo, Pimsleur, Michael Thomas, Rosetta Stone, and Lonely Planet have an array of books, audio materials, and computer programs in English on Dutch.


You will also want to find yourself a good bilingual dictionary---one of the best for Dutch is published by Van Dale and available in a range of language combinations: Dutch-English, Dutch-French, Dutch-Spanish, etc.
As you advance, you will want to slowly cultivate a Dutch-language library filled with children's books (to start), word puzzle books, non-fiction books, novels, poetry anthologies, and magazines etc. Reading is an invaluable tool to building your language skills as well as exposing yourself to very natural Dutch. When you reach this point, you should also obtain a monolingual Dutch-Dutch dictionary and thesaurus.

, This may be a bit challenging if you don't know Dutch people or live in a Dutch-speaking country, however you can start with YouTube and other audio materials and work your way into eavesdropping on Dutch conversations. It is important to get a feel for the language---hear how it sounds, how it works, how it flows.

, If where you live has a Dutch or Belgian cultural center and/or has a community of Dutch speakers, ask around and inquire about what's available in terms of language classes or private tutors.


Proper lessons with native speakers can provide you with a better sense of the language as well as teach you elements of culture that books alone can't.

, Practice makes perfect. Don't be afraid if you make mistakes, that's how you learn.


If a Dutch speaker replies back to you in English, keep on speaking Dutch. Start with a handful of words and work your way up, bit by bit.
To get yourself to function in Dutch, start by changing your computer and social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) interface settings to Dutch/Nederlands. You have to surround yourself in the language in order to think in the language.

, Dutch is not as widely spoken or studied a language as say German, Japanese, or Spanish, so it may be difficult to hone your language skills without travelling to a Dutch-speaking country. Both the Netherlands and Flanders offer cultural exchange programs and intensive Dutch-language programs for foreigners through universities, schools, and private institutions.

, The best way to absorb a language and culture is to open all of your senses to it.


In order to speak Dutch, you have to think Dutch and be Dutch. At the same time, don't let stereotypes you've learned about Dutch speakers rule over your expectations, impressions, and mindset when you travel to a Dutch-speaking country.
Things are not just tulips, marijuana, wooden clogs, cheese, bicycles, Van Gogh, and liberalism.

,
Keep in mind that while English is written from left to right, Hebrew is written from right to left.,
Know the rules for representing all the different vowel sounds, as follows:


For A as in 'apple', use א when at the beginning of a word or when strongly accented (as in 'Harry,' which is spelled הארי).,
Note that most words are spelled as they sound, ignoring silent letters that are found in English spellings and deviations from customary pronunciations of English letters.,
Be aware that identical letters that are doubled for a single syllable are generally not doubled in Hebrew.,
Note that several pairs of Hebrew letters sound alike.,
Note that the letter ו (known as vav or waw), as mentioned above, can represent 4 different English letters.,
Learn some other useful transliterations:


For words beginning with a short A or E, use א (e.g.,
*.",How to Transliterate English Into Hebrew,",, Take notice of that on this page. Most computers and devices, if you switch to a Hebrew font, will automatically change this for you.

, For non-accented A-sounds (as in 'Canada,' which is spelled קנדה), omit א.
For A as in 'father,' park,' or 'what,' use א
For A as in 'cake,' use יי (spelled as קייק)
For E as in 'bed,' do not use a letter (bed would be spelled בד). If the E sound starts the word, use א (as in Ed, spelled אד).
For E as in 'green,' use י (spelled as גרין)
For E as in 'Megan' use יי (spelled מייגן)
For I as in 'big' use י (spelled ביג)
For I as in 'ski' use י (spelled סקי)
For I as in 'ride' use יי (spelled רייד)
For O as in 'hot' use ו (spelled הוט)
For O as in 'dog' use ו (spelled דוג)
For O as in 'go' use ו (spelled גו)
For O as in 'mother' use א (spelled מאת׳ר)
For U as in 'cut' use א (spelled קאט)
For U as in 'put' use ו (spelled פוט)
For U as in 'gnu' use ו (spelled נו)
For Au as in 'August' or Aw as in 'law,' use או (spelled as אוגוסט, לאו)
For Ou as in 'mouse' or Ow as in 'how,' use או (spelled as מאוס, האו)
For Ou as in 'young' use א (spelled יאנג)
For Oi as in 'coin' or Oy as in 'boy,' use וי (spelled as קוין, בוי)
For A followed by an L (as in 'fall') use ול (spelled פול)
For vowels with ambiguous sounds, use the Hebrew letter that represents that vowel (e.g. New York ניו יורק, London לונדון)

,


For example, the word 'doubt' is spelled דאוט, not including the silent B. The city of Houston is spelled יוסטון, ignoring the fact that the 'YOO' sound at the beginning is spelled with the letters HOU.

, For example, 'baseball' is spelled בייסבול, not בייסבולל.


Sometimes, exceptions are made to distinguish one word from another. For example, 'John' is spelled ג׳ון and 'Joan' is spelled ג׳ואן. 'Annie' is spelled אנני to distinguish from אני (pronounced ah-nee), the Hebrew word for 'I.'

,


ב and ו can both make the V sound. Generally, ו is used at the beginning of words and ב elsewhere in words, though ו can be used for a V sound elsewhere in words. This is to eliminate confusion, as ב can also make a B sound, and ו can also be used for O, U, and W.
ט and ת can both make the T sound. Generally ט is used by default for transliterations. ת is used when a Th makes a T sound as in 'Thomas.'
כ and ק can both make the K sound. Generally, ק is used for transliterations of both C and K. כ is used for a Ch pronounced like a K as in 'Christopher.'
ס and ש can both make the S sound. Generally, ס is used for transliterations. ש can also the Sh sound and is use for Sh.
א and ע are both 'silent letters' that can represent vowels. Generally, א is used for transliterations. ע is usually used only in native Hebrew words and for a vowel sound following an identical vowel sound. In Yiddish, ע represents the letter E, distinguishing it from א representing the letter A, though this is not done in Hebrew.
ח and כ/ך can both make the Ch/Kh sound not found in English, but found in other languages, such as German, Polish, and Scottish. When transliterating loanwords from languages with these sounds, ח is generally used to represent letters near the 8th position of the alphabet, and כ/ך is used to represent letters near the 11th position of the alphabet. Such loanwords are generally pronounced with the H or K sound respectively by English-speakers.

, In all, it has the potential, either as a standalone or in conjunction with other letters, to represent as many as nine phonetic sounds. ו is also a prefix that is added to the beginning of Hebrew words to represent the word 'and' proceeding any word. For this reason, care must be taken whenever a ו is used in any word.


For most words beginning with a V sound, use ו. When a ב appears at the beginning of a word, it is normally a B sound.
It is preferable to use ב for a V sound in the middle of or at the end of a word. If using ו in the middle of a word followed by A, E, or I, use two a double ו (e.g. Denver דנוור or Louisville לואיוויל). If the V follows an O or U, use a ב.
For a W sound at the beginning of a word followed by the letter A, use וו (e.g. Washington וושינגטון). For a W sound at the beginning of a word followed by other English vowels, use a single ו (e.g. West וסט, WikiHow ויקיהאו, Wolf וולף, Wuppertal וופרטל).
For a W sound in the middle of a word followed by an A, E, or I, use וו. For a W sound in the middle of a word followed by an O or U, use a single ו followed by a second ו for the O or U. Three or more vavs are never placed in succession, so words like 'wood,' which is a portion of many names (e.g. Brentwood ברנטווד), is spelled ווד.

, 'apple' אפל)
For words beginning with a long E or short I, use אי (e.g. 'internet' אינטרנט)
For words beginning with a long A or I, use איי (e.g. 'iPhone' אייפון)
For words beginning with a long O or U sound, use או (e.g. 'open' אופן).
For words ending in the A sound, use ה in most cases (e.g. 'Obama' אובמה).
When a word has an S at the end for a plural or possessive, use ס (e.g. twins טווינס, Frank's פרנקס).

To say ""to"" in Hebrew, there is no separate word.,The Hebrew word for life is ""chaiim"" pronounced (chai-yeem)

,
So ""To Life"" would be ""L'Chaim!"",
You might hear it pronounced leh-chai-im in Ashkenazi circles, where the ""im"" rhymes with ""him"".

",How to Say to Life in Hebrew," Instead, a letter is added on to already existing words, and that letter is Lamed, which makes the L sound.;
,, pronounced (leh-chai-yeem)

Take a Hebrew class or an immersion program.,
Surround yourself with Hebrew and Israeli culture.,
Buy or borrow Hebrew children's books.,
Learn how to do a throaty r, and a khet like in the German ""bach"".,
Apply masculine and feminine gender to nouns and verbs.,
Learn simple words and phrases, such as follow (Note that 'kh' and 'ch' are both transliterations of the throaty h sound, as the English soft-ch sound does not exist in Hebrew):


Yom Huledet Sameach - Happy Birthday
Chaim - Life
Beseder - Fine
Sebaba - Cool - Awesome
Tov/tova - Good
Boker tov - Good morning
Yom tov - Good day
Mazal tov - Congratulations
Ima - Mother

shiv'ah(male), sheva(female)
shmon'ah(male), shmonay(female)
tish'ah(male), tesha(female)
asarah(male), eser(female)

,
Understand that Hebrew is a complex Language: In English, verbs do not change very much for tense and person, gender or plural gender: I ate, you ate, he ate, she ate, we ate, they ate.,
Take care to conjugate properly.",How to Speak Hebrew," Whether it's at school, a local Jewish community center, or even a personal tutor, doing this will make you much more committed to learning the language as well as understanding it better. If you live in Israel, you can enroll in multi-level immersion programs called ""ulpan"" or ""ulpanim"", where you live and breathe nothing but Hebrew.;
, Instead of listening to your regular radio station, listen to Israeli radio (perhaps on line), buy/download music in Hebrew, read easy books, etc.

, Disney has many books in Hebrew translation, such as Aladdin, Cinderella and Hercules. There are also many well known Israeli writers of children's literature to choose from such as Leah Goldberg.


You can purchase books at many locations throughout Israel. One convenient location is the book shop located in Jerusalem's Central Station, you see the store when going up the escalators.
Jewish Community Centres also often have libraries filled with Modern and Classical Hebrew books for children and adults of all ages.

, These two sounds are very important to Modern Hebrew's inherent sound system and are foreign to that of English.

, Hebrew, like other Semitic languages, are similar to many European languages (i.e. German, French, Italian, Spanish) in that they use gender for subjects and objects. Masculine words often have no special ending, while feminine words end with ""it"", ""ot"", or ""ah"".

, How are you? (towards a female)
Ma shlomcha? How are you? (towards a male)
Shalom - Hello/goodbye/peace
Ma nishma - What's up? (male/female)
Korim li ___ - My name is (literally, ""they call me"")
Ani ben (number) - I'm (number years) old (if you're male)
Ani bat (number) - I'm (number years) old (if you're female)
Ha Ivrit sheli lo kol kakh tova - My Hebrew isn't very good.
Ani meh ___ - I'm from ___
Todah (rabah) - Thank you (very much)
Bevakasha - Please/you're welcome
Eich korim lekha/lakh? - What's your name? (speaking to male/female)
Eifo ata gar?/ Eifo at garah? - where do you live? (male/female)
Eich omrim (word you are trying to say) beh'Ivrit? - How do you say (word) in Hebrew?

, The plural for male usually ends with ""im"" and the plural for female ends with ""ot"". In verbs, the plurals end with ""oo"". There are a number of irregular verbs, however, and there is no pattern to them. You just have to memorize them.

,, However, in Hebrew, almost every form of the verb is different based on gender and who is being talked about and the tense. Take, for example, the word ""Ochel"", meaning eat:


(I) ate: achalti
(You singular for male): achalta
(You singular for female): achalt
(He): achal
(She): achla
(You plural for a group including even one male): achaltem
(You plural for a group of all females): achalten
(They): achlu

, Use a special dictionary of conjugation to help yourself, and don't worry. This is the part of Hebrew in which most people struggle and make mistakes, so you are in good company.

Learn the words for love in Hebrew:


The noun ""love"" in Hebrew is ahavah, pronounced ah-hah-vah.,
Say ""I love you"".",How to Say Love in Hebrew,"
The verb ""to love"" is something different. It changes depending on your gender, and if you are saying ""I love you"" it changes depending on the gender of the person you are speaking to.

For a female to say ""I love"" it would be Ani Ohev et (ah-nee oh-hev-et)
For a male to say ""I love"" it would be Ani Ohev (ah-nee oh-hev)

;
, From here it just becomes a matter of adding the ""you"" onto the sentence, as you already know how to say ""I love."" Here are the ways to say it, depending on your gender:


For a female speaking to a male: Ani ohevet otcha (ah-nee oh-hev-et ot-kha)
For a male speaking to a female: Ani ohev otach (ah-nee oh-hev ot-akh)
For a female speaking to a female: Ani ohevet otach (ah-nee oh-hev-et ot-akh)
For a male speaking to a male: Ani ohev otcha (ah-nee oh-hev ot-kha)

Say ""Sameach"" for ""happy."",
Use ""Pesach"" for ""Passover."",
Flip the order of the words.",How to Say Happy Passover in Hebrew1," In Hebrew, the idea of happiness is expressed with the word ""Simcha."" To say ""happy"" as an adjective, we use ""sameach,"" which is derived from the noun.


This word is pronounced ""sah-MEY-akh."" Use a hard ""k"" sound with a raspy quality from the back of the throat. Don't use an English ""ch"" sound.;
, This is the traditional Hebrew name for the holiday.


""Pesach"" is pronounced ""PAY-sock."" It's pronounced almost exactly like these two English words. Again, end the word with a hard, raspy ""kh"" sound, not a ""ch"" sound.

, In Hebrew phrases, the words in a sentence aren't always in the same order that they are in English.In this case, the adjective comes after the noun, so ""Happy Passover"" is actually ""Pesach Sameach"".


To pronounce the whole phrase, just put the pronunciations above together: ""PAY-sock sah-MEY-akh."" Congratulate yourself for learning a new Hebrew phrase!

"
"
Optionally, put ""chag"" at the start of ""Pesach sameach."",
Drop ""Pesach"" for ""Chag Sameach."",
Use ""Chag kasher v'sameach"" to impress.,
Try ""Chag Kashruth Pesach"" for a Passover-specific greeting.,
Use ""Happy Pesach"" if you want to cheat.",How to Say Happy Passover in Hebrew2," ""Chag"" is the traditional Hebrew word for ""festival"" from scripture.Saying ""chag Pesach sameach"" is basically like saying, ""Happy Passover Festival!"" This isn't really any better or worse than the basic phrase above — just different.


""Chag"" is pronounced ""KHAHG."" It's similar to the English word ""cog,"" with the same breathy, raspy sound described above used for the c.
Some sources suggest that ""chag"" is used especially by Sephardic Jews., Literally, this means ""Happy festival."" It's a little like saying ""Happy holidays"" in English.


You can use this for most Jewish holidays, but it's best of all for Passover, Sukkot, and Shavu'ot, which are technically the only religious festivals.Chanukah and other days of celebration are technically holidays.

, This is a somewhat fancy way of wishing someone a happy holiday. The rough meaning is, ""Have a happy and kosher holiday."" Here, you're referencing the Jewish concept of Kashrut (religious dietary laws).


This phrase is pronounced ""KHAGH kah-SHEHR vuh-sah-MEY-akh."" ""Chag"" and ""sameach"" are pronounced the same as above. ""Kasher"" uses a light r sound pronounced at the very back of the mouth — almost like a French r. Don't forget to add a very quick v sound before ""sameach.""

, The meaning here is similar to the phrase above: ""Have a happy kosher Passover."" The difference is that this phrase specifically mentions Passover, while the one above is used for many holidays.


You can pronounce ""kashruth"" as ""kash-ROOT"" or ""kash-RUTH"" — both are acceptable.In either case, use the tip of your tongue to make a light r sound. This is quite similar to the Spanish r sound.

, Can't handle the tricky Hebrew pronunciations in this article? Try this ""Henglish"" alternative. Though it's not exactly a traditional holiday greeting, many English-speaking Jews use this as a convenient ""shortcut"" during Passover.

"
"
Good Morning: ""Good Morning"" is ""Boker Tov"" which is pronounced ""Bok-ehr To-v"";
,
Good Afternoon: ""Good Afternoon"" is ""Tzaraiim Tovim"" which is pronounced ""Tz-ah-rai-eem Toe-veem""

,
Good Night: ""Good Night"" is ""Laila Tov"" which is pronounced ""Lai-luh Toh-v""

,
Good Day: ""Good Day"" is ""Yom Tov"" which is pronounced ""Yo-m Toe-v"".","How to Say Good Morning, Good Night, and Good Day in Hebrew",",,, You should be aware though that saying Yom Tov in certain contexts can get confusing, as it is also means ""a holiday where observant Jews are prohibited from doing the 39 categories of things"" which includes using electricity, cooking, etc."
"
Know what to say.,
Know how to pronounce it.,
Try to approximate the sounds in SAMEACH.",How to Say Happy Birthday in Hebrew," The proper Hebrew phrase which means Happy birthday is ""yom hu'ledet sameach"";
, The proper pronunciation of these words best described would be YOM= Yome rhyming it with the English word tome HU'LEDET= ""WHO"" ""LEAD"" (as in the metal) ""ET"" putting the emphasis on the Lead part.

, The word SAMEACH is the hard one cause it has that Jewish ""ch"" in it which does not exist in English. It is however similar to the ""J"" in Spanish and sounds like someone who is clearing their throat from phlegm.


""SAMEACH"" is pronounced as ""SA"" as in the beginning of the words ""sorry"" ""MAY"" and then finally ""ACH"" with the a sounding like the ""O"" in the word on.

Say “chag” for “holiday.” This is the first word of the phrase.,
Use the word “sameach” for “happy.” In Hebrew, “simcha” is the word for happiness and “sameach” is the adjective form.,
Combine “chag” and “sameach.” Try saying the words together as a phrase, “chag sameach.” Concentrate on the correct pronunciation of the individual words in the phrase.",How to Say Happy Holidays in Hebrew1," “Chag” is pronounced “KHAHG” and is the biblical Hebrew word for “festival.” It is the Hebrew equivalent of the English word “holiday.” “Chag” sounds like the English word “cog.”;
, The word is pronounced “sah-MEY-akh,” using a hard “k” sound from the back of the throat. Say it after you say “chag.”Do not pronounce it with the English “ch” sound. , Practice saying the entire phrase and pronouncing it “KHAHG sah-MEY-akh.” Sephardic Jews prefer using the greeting “chag sameach.”

"
"
Learn the letters, and how to pronounce them.,
Learn the vowels.,
Practice reading Hebrew.",How to Read Hebrew," The Hebrew Alphabet has twenty-two letters, and five of them appear different at the end of a word. Keep in mind that none of these letters are possible to pronounce because they are consonants. If you try to pronounce them, it will be like pronouncing consonants of the English alphabet. Here are all of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet, in order;


א Aleph. This is possibly the easiest letter of the alphabet to learn. This is because it has no sound! In order to make it have a sound, one needs to put a vowel with it. It will often be found at the end of a word, making no sound. Think of it like the letter ""E"" in the English alphabet; it is at the end of a lot of words, but it's silent.

Bet(בּ) and Vet(ב). Although these letters seem different because of their two different sounds, they are actually considered the same letter. Bet has a dot, and Vet doesn't. Bet makes the ""B"" sound, but doesn't actually have a pronunciation until a vowel is added. Vet makes the ""V"" sound, but needs a vowel to actually be read.

ג Gimmel. Because Bet and Vet are essentially the same letter, this is the third letter in the Hebrew Alphabet. It has the ""G"" sound, like ""gate"". However, it never has the ""G"" sound as in ""giraffe"". Keep this is mind while pronouncing it in a word. Although, a gimmel with a flick or apostrophe (') is a 'giraffe' gimmel.

ד Dalet. As it may be easy to guess, Dalet makes the ""D"" sound. Like all other letters in the Alphabet, it needs a vowel added to have a pronunciation.

ה Hey. Hey makes the ""H"" sound, as in the ""H"" in ""hey"". It never makes the ""CH"" sound as in ""chewy"", and is often put at the end of a word as an ending, just like how Aleph is added to the end of a word sometimes.

ו Vav. Vav makes the same sound as Vet, but is a different letter.

ז Zayin. This letter is pronounced just like the ""Z"" in ""crazy"".ח Chet. Chet is one of the more well known letters in Hebrew. It sounds almost as if you're hacking on something in your throat, or gargling without water. If those examples still aren't helping you hear the Chet, try growling in the back of your throat. It is a softer version of the noise you get from that. Remember, Chet never makes the ""CH"" sound as in ""chewy"".

ט Tet. Tet makes the ""T"" sound as in ""tango"". It can never make the ""TH"" sound as in ""thicket"".

י Yod. This letter sounds like the ""Y"" in ""you"". Sometimes, it is softened into the sound of ""EE"", as in ""Greek"". Most of the time when this letter is in the middle of a word, it is pronounced more like ""EE"" than ""Y"".

Kaf,(כּ) Chaf(כ), Kaf Sofit(ךּ), and Chaf Sofit(ך). This is one of the more confusing letters. Although it may seem like four different letters, it's all actually the same letter. Chaf is pronounced just like Chet, and Kaf is pronounced like the ""C"" in ""cow"". Chaf Sofit is pronounced the same as Chaf, but it comes at the end of a word. Kaf Sofit is pronounced the same as Kaf, but is also only at the end of a word. Although it seems confusing at first, just keep practising. It will all become as clear as your first alphabet after some practise.

ל Lamed. Lamed makes the ""L"" sound, as in ""lightning"".

Mem(מ) and Mem Sofit(ם). Once again, these are actually the same letter, but they have a different version at the end of a word. They make the ""M"" sound, as in ""Mike"". Mem Sofit looks like Mem, only it is closed off at the bottom, and looks more boxy.

Nun(נ) and Nun Sofit(ן). Nun and Nun Sofit are pronounced like the ""N"" in ""November"". You'll only find Nun in the beginning or middle of a letter, and you'll only find Nun Sofit at the end.

ס Samech. Samech makes the ""S"" sound in ""sierra"". However, it never makes the ""SH"" sound in ""shipwreck"".

ע Ayin. This is one of the trickier Hebrew letters to pronounce for non-natives, since Latin and Germanic languages do not have this sound. It is pronounced differently in different areas to ease pronunciation. Technically it is a ""voiced pharyngeal approximant/fricative,"" and has equivalents in other Semitic languages, like Arabic and Syriac. In general, non-natives (and even many native Israelis) treat it like an aleph, which is to say, they do not pronounce it, only the vowel underneath it. If you want to try to pronounce the ayin, but can't quite get the voiced pharyngeal approximant/fricative, try pronouncing it like the ""ng"" in ""singing"" or the ""nk"" in ""sink."" Jews in various parts of the Diaspora pronounce the ayin in this manner. But it is perfectly acceptable to leave it silent. Pey(פ) Fey,(פּ) Fey Sofit(ףּ) and Pey Sofit(ף) Pey is pronounced like the ""P"" in ""papa"", and Fey is pronounced like the ""F"" in ""foxtrot"". Fey Sofit is a different version with the same pronunciation as Fey, but it comes at the end of a word. Pey Sofit also has the same pronunciation of its other version, but it only comes at the end of a word.

Tsadie(צ) and Tsadie Sofit(ץ)(Pronounced Tsadi, very often pronounced Tsadik - as a mistake). Tsadie and Tsadie Sofit are pronounced like the ""zz"" in ""pizza."" Tsadie Sofit is the same as Tsadie, but it only comes at the end of a word. It is also pronounced 'tz', and if you put a flick or apostrophe ( ' ) next to it, it's CH, like chocolate. ק Qof. Qof makes the ""K"" sound, as in ""kilo"". It can also be pronounced as a ""Q"" sound, but the ""K"" sound is more common.

ר Resh. This letter makes the ""R"" sound, as in ""roger"".

Shin(שׂ)and Sin(שׁ). Shin and Sin only have one difference: Shin has a dot over the line furthest to the left, and Sin has a dot over the line furthest to the right. Shin is pronounced ""SH"", as in ""Shucks"". Sin makes the ""S"" sound, like Samech and Tsadie.

ת Tav. Tav has the same sound as Tet; like the ""T"" in ""tango"".
;
, Hebrew vowels are added to consonants to make one sound. For instance, Samech may simply make ""S"" on its own, if you add a line under it, it becomes ""sah"". The Hebrew vowels are generally easy to understand with a bit of practice.


אֵ Patach. Patach is basically a line to place under any letter, which becomes that letter with the ""AH"" sound after it, as in ""aqua"".

אָ Kamatz. Kamatz makes the same sound as Patach, and looks almost exactly like it. The only difference is that it has a tiny line in the midsection.

וֹ Cholam Malei. Cholam Malei is basically the letter Vav with a dot over it. This creates the ""OH"" sound, as in ""doe"". However, this doesn't create the ""VO"" sound, as the v is lost when the dot is added.

בֹּ Cholam Chaser. This vowel can't go over all consonants, which is why there is also Cholam Malei. When this little dot is over (or a little to the left, but still on top) of any consonant, the consonant gains the ""OH"" sound, in addition to its consonant sound.

אֶ Segol. Segol is three dots under a letter that create a triangle shape. These three dots add the ""EH"" sound as in ""echo"" to the consonant. For example, adding this to Bet would create the ""beh"" sound.

בֵּ Tzeirei. Tzeirei is two dots under a letter, creating a horizontal line, (not to be confused with sh'va, which creates a vertical line). This adds the ""EH"" sound to a consonant, just like Segol. For instance, adding this vowel to Vet would create the ""veh"" sound.

מְ Sh'va. Sh'va adds the ""UH"" sound to a consonant. It also has two dots, but they create a vertical line instead of a horizontal one. Adding this to Mem would make ""muh"".

וּ Shuruk. This vowel creates the ""U"" sound, as in ""blue"". It never makes the ""UH"" sound, which Sh'va does. This vowel can only be added to Vav, which loses its v in the process.

אֻ Kubutz. Kubutz is three dots that are horizontal under any consonant, going to the right. It creates the ""OO"" sound, like ""food"" or ""shoo"". Adding this to Bet would make ""boo"".

אֲ Chataf Patach, Chataf Segol, and Chataf Kamatz. Chataf is two dots creating a vertical line, however, it is added to Patach, Segol, or Kamatz to shorten the vowel. Think of it as a sticatto in music, which shortens the note.

נִ Chirik. Chirik makes the ""ee"" sound, as in ""Greek"" or ""me"". It is one dot under any consonant. For example, Chirik under Bet creates ""bee"".

רָ Kamatz Katan. This vowel looks like Kamatz, only the second line doesn't actually connect to the midsection. Kamatz Katan creates the ""O"" sound, like ""flow"".


, Learning a new language is never easy, but the more you practice, the easier it will become.

Use “Chag sameach” for many Jewish holidays.,
Understand that certain holidays have specific sayings.,
Know that Hebrew syntax is different than that of English.,
Learn the Hebrew alphabet.,
Listen to Hebrew.,
Immerse yourself in Hebrew.",How to Say Happy Holidays in Hebrew2," This greeting can be used for most Hebrew festivals and holidays. It is particularly appropriate for Sukkot, Shavu’ot and Passover since they are technically the only festivals. If you are unsure on what to say, what for the other person to speak and repeat what they say.

, Although “chag sameach” may work as a catchall holiday greeting, there are Hebrew sayings that are more specific and appropriate depending on the holiday. Be sure to learn these alternative sayings as well. You can often place the holiday name in between “chag” and “sameach” to create a more specific greeting.

, In Hebrew, word order is not as important as it is in English and whether an adjective comes before or after a noun is less relevant. Because of this, adjectives can come before or after a noun and still have the same meaning.Although “holiday happy” may sound strange to English ears, “Chag Sameach” makes perfect sense to Hebrew speakers.
Try not to say “Sameach Chag” since that is not the saying and you might get laughed at.

, Hebrew uses a different alphabet than English and is read from right to left. Hebrew characters look different and have different accompanying sounds than their English counterparts. Knowing this alphabet, and the accompanying pronunciations, will help you better understand Hebrew and communicate it to others. Hebrew is a combination of an early Semitic alphabet with some Greek characters.
There are no vowels in Hebrew. However, there is a system of dots and dashes known as nikkuds that indicate vowels.

, One of the best ways to learn a language is to hear it spoken by native speakers. Find recordings online of people speaking in Hebrew. You can also immerse yourself by watching Israeli television and movies.


Begin by learning the pronunciations of the individual letters in the Hebrew alphabet.

, If you have the time and resources, try living in Israel for an extended period of time. The experience will force you to develop an ear for Hebrew and pick up much of the language. Although it may be difficult at first, immersion is the best way to learn another language quickly.Many people in Israel speak English, so be sure to use Hebrew at every opportunity.

Make “Chag Sameach” more holiday specific.,
Impress others with “chag kasher v’sameach.” Pronounced “KHAHG kah-SHEHR vuh-sah-MEY-akh,” this is a fancier way of saying happy holidays.,
Say “Gut Yom Tov” for a traditional Ashkanazi greeting.,
Try “Gut Yontiff” for a well-known Yiddish greeting.",How to Say Happy Holidays in Hebrew3," Insert the names of Jewish holidays between “chag” and “sameach” to speak a create a specific Hebrew greeting. You can use this style of greeting for nearly any holiday. However, it most appropriate with Sukkot, the Feast of Weeks, and Passover, which are technically the only festivals.For Passover say, “Chag Pesach Sameach.” It is pronounced “KHAHG PAY-sahk sah-MEY-akh.”
For Sukkkot say, “Chag Sukkot Sameach.” It is pronounced “KHAHG suu-KOHT sah-MEY-akh.”
For the Feast of Weeks say, “Chag Shavu’ot Sameach” It is pronounced “KHAHG shah-voo-AWT.”

, It means “have a happy and kosher holiday.” It is a reference to Jewish dietary law known as Kashut or Kosher. Although it can be used for any holiday, it is typically said at Passover., This saying combines the Yiddish word “gut,” or “good,” with the Hebrew words “yom tov,” or “good day.” It is pronounced “YUHN tuh-vz” This phrase, which literally means “good good day,” can be used for any holiday.Gut rhymes with put.
Although not strictly Hebrew, this phrase is not uncommon in the Jewish world.

, This Yiddish saying is a derivation of “gut Yom Tov.”Pronounced “Gut YAHN-tiff,” this phrase was used by Europe’s Jews for centuries and it was not until the early twentieth century that it fell out of style. “Gut Yontiff” was particularly popular Jewish communities of the Pale in Eastern Europe.Many Jewish people in the United States and Israel still use or recognize “gut yontiff” as a holiday greeting.

Know that you must learn the four aspects of a language in order to be fluent:



Reading.,
Learn to read Hebrew.,
Learn to write in Hebrew.,
Learn to speak Hebrew.,
Learn to understand Hebrew.",How to Learn Fluent Hebrew," Reading is an important aspect of fluency, as reading will help improve vocabulary, and you are likely to have a very limited vocabulary if you can't read. Reading will also allow you to use the Internet, read newspapers, read mail, read Email, and read books.
Writing. Writing is yet another important aspect of fluency. If you can't write, then you can't use the Internet, write papers, write mail, and write anything you would ever need to write.
Listening. If you can't understand Hebrew, where would you be? Certainly not in Israel. Listening is a very important aspect of fluency, because if you can't listen and understand, then you just don't know Hebrew.
Speaking. Contrary to popular belief, only being able to speak and listen does not make you fluent. Speaking is the most basic part of fluency, because if you can't speak, then you can't communicate in the language, and so the purpose of the language is destroyed.;
, If you want to be able to improve your vocabulary enough to sound like a native speaker, and to be able to use the Internet, you'll need to know how to read. Reading is quite easy as a matter of fact; it takes much less time than learning how to speak and listen. But to learn to read Hebrew, you're going to need to know the letters and vowels.





א Aleph. This is possibly the easiest letter of the Hebrew alphabet to learn. This is because it has no sound! In order to make it have a sound, one needs to put a vowel with it. It will often be found at the end of a word, making no sound. Think of it like the letter ""E"" in the English alphabet; it is at the end of a lot of words, but it's silent.


Bet(בּ) and Vet(ב). Although these letters seem different because of their two different sounds, they are actually considered the same letter. Bet has the dagesh or dot, and Vet does not. (Remember, you put money--the dagesh or dot--in a Bank, not a vank.) Bet makes the ""B"" sound, but doesn't actually have a pronunciation until a vowel is added. Vet makes the ""V"" sound, but needs a vowel to actually be read.


ג Gimmel. Because Bet and Vet are essentially the same letter, this is the third letter in the Hebrew Alephbet. It has the ""G"" sound, like ""gate"". However, it never has the ""G"" sound as in ""giraffe"". Keep this is mind while pronouncing it in a word. Although, a gimmel with a flick or apostrophe (') is a 'giraffe' gimmel.






ד Dalet. As it may be easy to guess, Dalet makes the ""D"" sound. Like all other letters in the Alephbet, it needs a vowel added to have a pronunciation.


ה Hey. Hey makes the ""H"" sound, as in the ""H"" in ""hey"". It never makes the ""CH"" sound as in ""chewy"", and is often put at the end of a word as an ending, just like how Aleph is added to the end of a word sometimes.


ו Vav. Vav makes the same sound as Vet, but is a different letter. It can also have an oo sound as in spoon.


ז Zayin. This letter is pronounced just like the ""Z"" in ""crazy"".ח Chet. Chet is one of the more well known letters in Hebrew. It sounds almost as if you're hacking on something in your throat, or gargling without water. If those examples still aren't helping you hear the Chet, try growling in the back of your throat. It is a softer version of the noise you get from that. Remember, Chet never makes the ""CH"" sound as in ""chewy"".


ט Tet. Tet makes the ""T"" sound as in ""tango"". It can never make the ""TH"" sound as in ""thicket"".

י Yod. This letter sounds like the ""Y"" in ""you"". Sometimes, it is softened into the sound of ""EE"", as in ""Greek"". Most of the time when this letter is in the middle of a word, it is pronounced more like ""EE"" than ""Y"".


Kaf (כּ), Chaf (כ), Kaf Sofit (ךּ), and Chaf Sofit(ך). This is one of the more confusing letters. Although it may seem like four different letters, it's all actually the same letter. Kaf and kaf sofit have the dagesh or dot while chaf and chaf sofit do not. (Remember to feed the Kitty some food--the dagesh or dot.) Chaf is pronounced just like Chet, and Kaf is pronounced like the ""C"" in ""cow"". Chaf Sofit is pronounced the same as Chaf, but it comes at the end of a word. Kaf Sofit is pronounced the same as Kaf, but is also only at the end of a word. Kaf sofit is also rarely used in Modern Hebrew. Although it seems confusing at first, just keep practising. It will all become as clear as your first alphabet after some practise.


ל Lamed. Lamed makes the ""L"" sound, as in ""lightning"".


Mem(מ) and Mem Sofit(ם). Once again, these are actually the same letter, but they have a different version at the end of a word. They make the ""M"" sound, as in ""Mike"". Mem Sofit looks like Mem, only it is closed off at the bottom, and looks more boxy.


Nun(נ) and Nun Sofit(ן). Nun and Nun Sofit are pronounced like the ""N"" in ""November"". You'll only find Nun in the beginning or middle of a word, and you'll only find Nun Sofit at the end.


ס Samech. Samech makes the ""S"" sound in ""sierra"". However, it never makes the ""SH"" sound in ""shipwreck"".


ע Ayin. This is one of the trickier Hebrew letters to pronounce for non-natives, since Latin and Germanic languages do not have this sound. It is pronounced differently in different areas to ease pronunciation. Technically it is a ""voiced pharyngeal approximant/fricative,"" and has equivalents in other Semitic languages, like Arabic and Syriac. In general, non-natives (and even many native Israelis) treat it like an aleph, which is to say, they do not pronounce it, only the vowel underneath it. If you want to try to pronounce the ayin, but can't quite get the voiced pharyngeal approximant/fricative, try pronouncing it like the ""ng"" in ""singing"" or the ""nk"" in ""sink."" Jews in various parts of the Diaspora pronounce the ayin in this manner. But it is perfectly acceptable to leave it silent. Pey(פּ), Fey(פ), Pey Sofit(ףּ), and Fey Sofit(ף) Pey and pey sofit have the dagesh or dot while fey and fey sofit do not. (Remember to Pay or Put a coin--the dagesh or dot-- in the machine.) Pey is pronounced like the ""P"" in ""papa"", and Fey is pronounced like the ""F"" in ""foxtrot"". Fey Sofit is a different version with the same pronunciation as Fey, but it comes at the end of a word. Pey Sofit also has the same pronunciation of its other version, but it only comes at the end of a word.


Tsadie(צ) and Tsadie Sofit(ץ)(Pronounced Tsadi, very often pronounced Tsadik - as a mistake). Tsadie and Tsadie Sofit are pronounced like the ""zz"" in ""pizza."" Tsadie Sofit is the same as Tsadie, but it only comes at the end of a word. It is also pronounced 'tz', and if you put a flick or apostrophe ( ' ) next to it, it's CH, like chocolate. ק Qof. Qof makes the ""K"" sound, as in ""kilo"". It can also be pronounced as a ""Q"" sound, but the ""K"" sound is more common.


ר Resh. This letter makes the ""R"" sound, as in ""roger"". Many Israelis pronounce this like a French or German ""r"" or the Spanish ""r"" (not the ""rr"") rather than an English ""r.""


Shin(שׁ) and Sin(שׂ). Shin and Sin only have one difference: Shin has a dot over the line furthest to the right, and Sin has a dot over the line furthest to the left. (If you look at them as stick figures where the dot is the head, the shin looks mermaidiSH and the sin looks like a person freefalling without a parachute which is Stupid.) Shin is pronounced ""SH"", as in ""Shucks"". Sin makes the ""S"" sound, like Samech and Tsadie.


ת Tav. Tav has the same sound as Tet; like the ""T"" in ""tango"".



Learn to read the vowels. Unlike most languages, Hebrew letters do not make vowel sounds.


אֵ Patach. Patach is basically a line to place under any letter, which becomes that letter with the ""AH"" sound after it, as in ""aqua"". Patach is considered a short vowel.


אָ Kamatz. Kamatz makes the same sound as Patach, and looks almost exactly like it. The only difference is that it has a tiny line in the midsection. Kamatz is considered a long vowel.


וֹ Cholam Malei. Cholam Malei is basically the letter Vav with a dot over it. This creates the ""OH"" sound, as in ""doe"". However, this doesn't create the ""VO"" sound, as the v is lost when the dot is added. Cholam Malei is considered a long vowel.


בֹּ Cholam Chaser. This vowel can't go over all consonants, which is why there is also Cholam Malei. When this little dot is over (or a little to the left, but still on top) of any consonant, the consonant gains the ""OH"" sound, in addition to its consonant sound. Cholam Chaser is considered a long vowel.


אֶ Segol. Segol is three dots under a letter that create a triangle shape. These three dots add the ""EH"" sound as in ""echo"" to the consonant. For example, adding this to Bet would create the ""beh"" sound. Segol is considered a short vowel.


בֵּ Tzeirei. Tzeirei is two dots under a letter, creating a horizontal line, (not to be confused with sh'va, which creates a vertical line). This adds the ""EH"" sound to a consonant, just like Segol. For instance, adding this vowel to Vet would create the ""veh"" sound. Tzeirei is considered a long vowel.


מְ Sh'va. Sh'va adds the ""UH"" sound to a consonant. It also has two dots, but they create a vertical line instead of a horizontal one. Adding this to Mem would make ""muh"". Sh'va may also cause the consonant to be shortened so that it sounds like it has a quick i sound after it or no vowel at all just as if one started to utter something but realized he made a mistake and stopped suddenly. An example would be the sh'va under the bet in the Hebrew word for ""in the hand"" בְיַד. It would be pronounced biyad or b'yad.


וּ Shuruk. This vowel creates the ""U"" sound, as in ""blue"". It never makes the ""UH"" sound, which Sh'va does. This vowel can only be added to Vav, which loses its v in the process. Shuruk is considered a long vowel.


אֻ Kubutz. Kubutz is three dots that are horizontal under any consonant, going to the right. It creates the ""OO"" sound, like ""food"" or ""shoo"". Adding this to Bet would make ""boo"". Kubutz is considered a short vowel.


אֲ Chataf Patach, Chataf Segol, and Chataf Kamatz. Chataf is two dots creating a vertical line, however, it is added to Patach, Segol, or Kamatz to shorten the vowel. Think of it as a staccato in music, which shortens the note. These vowels are therefore considered reduced.


נִ Chirik. Chirik makes the ""ee"" sound, as in ""Greek"" or ""me"". It is one dot under any consonant. For example, Chirik under Bet creates ""bee"". Chirik is considered a long vowel.


רָ Kamatz Katan. This vowel looks like Kamatz, only the second line doesn't actually connect to the midsection. Kamatz Katan creates the ""O"" sound, like ""flow"".




, For this aspect of Hebrew, you will need to know how to write the letters and vowels as you do in Reading. But, you will not only need to know how to recognize the letters, you will also need to know exactly how to write them.


Practice writing basic sentences and phrases at least 30 minutes a day, every day of the week (unless you don't write on Shabbat as you are probably Jewish if you are reading this article).
Buy activity books that teach how to read and write in Hebrew meant for children, as they will teach you how to read and write quite quickly.

, Learning to speak Hebrew will also teach you how to understand Hebrew. You must put a lot of work into this aspect of the language, as this is the most difficult part of learning a language. You will need to study grammar and know several thousand words in order to master this aspect of the Hebrew language.


Study pronunciation. Do you want to sound like a native? If so, you will need to learn pronunciation. Even if you don't want to sound like a native, you will need to learn the pronunciation eventually. When you learn a new Hebrew word, study the pronunciation and syllables of the word, until you can pronounce the word with ease.
Study grammar. Grammar is very important so that people can understand you, and so that you don't sound ridiculous. But, don't be afraid to make grammatical errors. You will end up learning the grammar fairly quickly.
Study vocabulary. Vocabulary is very important in order to communicate in the first place. 1,000-2,000 words is enough to hold a decent, non-politically related conversation. Try using flash-cards. Put a Hebrew word on the front, and put the English word (or whatever your native language is) on the back. Be sure to not only learn what the English word is for the Hebrew word, but you also need to learn what the Hebrew word is for the English word, because you will be able to easily use the Hebrew word in conversation like this.

Once you know at least 600 Hebrew words, and you understand the grammar fairly well, now is the time to spend a substantial amount of time in Israel. You aren't going to learn how to speak like a native until you visit Israel. You will learn all the vocabulary needed to have virtually any conversation, and you will learn some slang terms. Using the language will also make the words you do know easier to remember. Many people interested in learning Hebrew enroll in an ulpan, a school for intensive Hebrew studies, during their stay in Israel. Ulpan programs range from a few weeks to over a year, depending on how well you want to learn Hebrew.



, Most of the understanding will be tackled by learning to speak Hebrew, but many people have trouble understanding Hebrew when it is spoken very quickly. To avoid this, listen to the Israeli radio a lot, and speak with native speakers as often as possible. Also, learn read books and watch Israeli television. After a few months of this, you will probably be able to understand most of the ""quick talk"" that you hear.

Learn color vocabulary.",How to Count to Ten in Polish," Start at the beginning and practice the first few numbers. Look at how they are spelled in Polish, but also pay attention to their pronunciation, given in parentheses:One: jeden (ye-den)
Two: dwa (dva)
Three: trzy (tshih)
Four: cztery (chte-rih)
Five: pięć (pyen’ch’);
, After the first few numbers, you’re ready go the rest of the way to ten. Pay close attention to the numbers nine and ten, which sound very similar.Six: sześć (shesh'ch)
Seven: siedem (sh'ye-dem)
Eight: osiem (o-sh'yem)
Nine: dziewięć (d'ye-vyen'ch)
Ten: dziesięć ( d'ye-sh'yen'ch')

, To give your tongue a bit of a break, try saying zero in Polish. It’s almost the same as in English: zero (zyeh-ro). Now you can count from zero to ten in Polish!, To make the numbers stick and to make yourself comfortable saying them, take every opportunity to use them. You can write the numbers on flashcards and quiz yourself, but you’ll get even more comfortable using Polish numbers if you use them as often as you can in everyday situations like:Counting money and objects like apples or bottles
Doing mental math
Playing games that require numbers like Go Fish or Monopoly
Using things like phone numbers, addresses, etc.

, The numbers 1-10 in Polish use a majority of the letters from the Polish alphabet. Ordinarily, each letter in Polish has just one sound associated with it (unlike English, where letters like e, a, s, and many others can be pronounced several ways). A few letters in Polish, including several vowels, can have diacritics (small marks) that change they are pronounced.a is like in the ""a"" “cat”

e sounds like the “e” in “red”

ą, and ę sound like nasalized versions of the a and e sounds

i is like “beet” except when it comes before e. The letters ie together have the sound “ye.”

ó and u are pronounced the same, like the “oo” in “boot”

y is pronounced like the ""y"" in “syllable”

, Several Polish consonants (b, d, f, h, k, l, p, n, t and z) sound basically the same as corresponding English consonants. Other consonants look familiar, but are pronounced differently, and a few have diacritics.c is a “ts” sound like at the end of “bats”

ć sounds like the “ch” sound in words like “cheap” and “chipper”

g sounds like a hard “g” in English, like in “give”

j sounds like the beginning of “yellow” or “yet”

ł is pronounced like the “w” in “water”

ń sounds like the “ny” in words like “canyon”

r in Polish is rolled, like in Spanish

s is pronounced like the “s” in words like “salad,” not with a “z” sound like in words such as “laser”

ś sounds like the “sh” sound in “shift” or “shame”

w is pronounced like the English “v” in words like “vat” or “van,” except at the end of words, when it sounds like “f”

ź sounds roughly like the “zh” sound in “azure”

, These can look intimidating, but they only have one sound--once you get the hang of them, just treat the clusters as though they were individual letters.ci and cz all sound ‘’ć’’ and like the “ch” sound in words like “cheap” and “chipper”

ch together make the sound like at the end of “loch”

dzi, dź, and dż sound like the “j” at the beginning of “jab”

rz is either like the “zh” sound in “azure” at the beginning of a word, or a “sh” sound when it comes after other letters

si and sz sound like ś, and like the “sh” sound in “shift” or “shame”

szcz sounds like “sh” and “ch” running together as a single sound, as in “fresh cheese” said quickly

ż and zi sound like ‘’ź’’, roughly like the “zh” sound in “azure”

, Accent (where the stress in a word falls) is also very regular in Polish. In almost every case, it falls on the next-to-last (penultimate) syllable. With the letter sounds and word stress being so regular, you’ll be able to see right away how to say most words in Polish, including the numbers., If you’ve mastered the numbers and the basics of pronouncing Polish, you can start picking up some everyday words and phrases. To make some quick progress, try language learning apps like Duolingo or Babbel. You can also look for videos in Polish on YouTube or other sites to get used to the sound of the language., A great place to start expanding your Polish vocabulary is with higher numbers. Once you’ve covered one through ten, try learning some more, like:eleven - jedenaście (yeh-den-ahsh-chye)
twelve - dwanaście (dvah-nahsh-chye)
thirteen - trzynaście (tshi-nahsh-chye)
fourteen - czternaście (chter-nahsh-chye)
fifteen - piętnaście (pyeh-nahsh-chye)
sixteen - szesnaście (shes-nahsh-chye)
seventeen - siedemnaście (shye-dem-nahsh-chye)
eighteen - osiemnaście (o-shyem-nahsh-chye)
nineteen - dziewiętnaście (dzyev-yeht-nahsh-chye)
twenty - dwadzieścia (dvahdzh-yesh-chya)
thirty - trzydzieści (tshi-dzhyesh-chi)
fourty - czterdzieści (chter-dzhyesh-chi)
fifty - pięćdziesiąt (pyehch-dzhyesh-yaht)
sixty - sześćdziesiąt (shyeshch-dzhyesh-yaht)
seventy - siedemdziesiąt (shye-dem-dzhyesh-yaht)
eighty - osiemdziesiąt (o-shyem-dzhyesh-yaht)
ninety - dziewięćdziesiąt (dhyev-yehch-dzhyesh-yaht)
one hundred - sto (sto)

, If you want to start speaking Polish with others, you’ll want to learn some basic phrases like introductions and greetings. Master phrases like:Hello - Dzień dobry (Dzyen doh-bri)
How are you?- Jak się masz? (Yak she mash)
My name is Loretta - Mam na imię Loretta (Mahm nah eem-ye Loretta).
Please - Proszę (Prosh-ye)
Thank you - Dziękuję (djen-koo-ye)
Excuse me! / Sorry! - Przepraszam. (pshe-prah-sham)
Goodbye! - Do widzenia! (Do veed-zhe-nya)

, Polish uses what is called a case system, meaning that most words will change their form based on how they are used in a sentence. This includes words like colors. However, learning their basic, ""dictionary"" forms will still be very useful for trying to communicate in or understand Polish. Start with these:White - biały (bya-wi)
Black - czarny (char-ni)
Red - czerwony (cher--woh--ni)
Blue - niebieski (nyeh-byeh-ski)
Green - zielony (zyel-o-ni)

Search into losses of the American family average totaling 39% of its wealth from 2007, 2008, 2009 plus 2010 as the ""Great Recession"" brought HNW down and back 20 years to as low as the early 1990s level of family wealth.,
Notice, also, the HNW fell, in four years, a chilling total of $49,100 to $77,300, including 2010, starting from an over-heated $126,400 in 2007, adjusted for inflation, in the Federal Reserve report June 11, 2012.,
Check this drop-off, steeper than the Fed's quarterly reports had previously indicated showing the severity of the 2007-12 recession and the minimal recovery that has been meandering sluggishly.Young middle-age heads of family (35- to 44-year-olds) have had median HNW drop 54% to $42,100 over the period.,
Look at all families' finances, as the median income fell to $45,800 in 2010 from $49,600 three years earlier — a 7.7% decline, spread through all population groups.Families headed by people ages 65 and over, many on fixed incomes, and doing more-conservative investing, didn't see much erosion of real incomes between 2007 and 2010.,
Look into the biggest percentage drop occurring in families headed by people with ""some college education"": Their incomes fell to $42,900 from $47,800, down 10.3%.,
Recognize the survey of U.S. households, that was first performed in 2007, repeated in 2009 to gauge the effects of the recession, shows the median/middle HNW fell $29,000 from $125,000 in 2007 to $96,000 in 2009:,
Understand that in the 2008 financial crisis trillions of dollars of ""value evaporated"" from household wealth.,
Pay off debt, if possible, as some have been doing -- getting ""out of debt"" -- as the Fed report notes: The share of families with debt decreased 2.1 percentage points to 74.9 percent over the 2007–10 period.,
Look at earnings of other families (those below and above median):Families starting above the national average in 2007 saw their incomes decline.,
Read about families in the top 10% of HNW in 2007 saw their incomes down by 13% on average, a phenomenon the Fed attributed to large declines in capital gains and in business, farm or self-employment income.,

47.6% of these families said they had saved in 2010, the lowest of all age groups. Overall, 52% of all families put money into savings that year.
In 2001, 62.3% of families headed by the 35- to 44-year-olds had saved money that year, the highest percentage savings in all age categories in the Fed report! This indicates the decline in those saving has gone -- down a raw 8.4% which is 13.5% of 62.4%, the previous amount -- falling to only 54% from 62.4%.

,
By contrast, the young families, headed by those under 35 years old, had the biggest drop in median income, falling more than 10% to $35,100 in 2010.

, Families headed by college graduates saw their median incomes fall just a hair less than 10%, to $73,800 from $81,900.,, Now the 2012 Federal Reserve official report states how harshly the recession has hit families, and how they reacted. Families who were in ""median or middle"" values had or owned:Stock -- dropped more than a third to $12,000 from $18,500, on average.
Home real estate -- decreased an average of $18,700.
Credit or debt -- worsened to $75,600 from $70,300.
Income dropped -- down to $49,800 from $50,100.

,
That was reverse of the continual increase of ""carrying"" debt to: ""paying off"" all debt -- for the first time since 2001.

,
Those below the median national income in 2007 actually saw their earnings recover a little by 2009.

, The report also reveals that:


Over 60% of families saw their wealth decline over the period.
Americans have increased their savings rate across the board so less money is being spent or pumped into the economy.

, Real estate is such a big share of the economy -- and its drop in value has taken a big chunk out of HNW of families, and it can take years to settle and recover. It could likely be near a decade.

Henry VII

Life: 28 January 1457 – 21 April 1509
Reign: 22 August 1485 – 21 April 1509
Religion: Catholic

Henry famously finalised the War of the Roses (two rival branches of the French Plantagenet house that had ruled England since the French-Norman invasion.) and took the crown from the defeated Richard III. Much of the infamous history of Richard is possibly Tudor propaganda which was used to help cement the Tudor dynasty in place and weaken any further Plantagenet uprisings. Henry was overall a prudent monarch, whose greatest wisdom was to learn from the folly and examples of other European monarchs. He placed great pressure on his sons to bear sons of their own, to help maintain the delicate and fragile peace after the War of the Roses and continue the dynasty.



;
, It was in this era there was more (although limited) parliamentary power given to civil servants which is the foundation of Parliament as known today. Foreign policy, the military and many reforms and policies still came directly from the palace however.


The Tudors had a highly defined class system and there was typically little movement between the classes, so the wealthy classes tended to be highly powerful and influential. The wealthy typically were engaged in merchant trade or civil service as the aristocracy revelled in Crown sponsored monopolies in various products which would be the gift of the crown and make fortunes - the average nobility was paid wages between 1500-3000 pounds per year, where the common man might earn between 5-20 pounds a year. The Aristocracy typically was expected to be involved at court and later monarchs, particularly Elizabeth, was known to visit and stay at favourites at their expense, often to their ruin.
Religion was incredibly important as it generally formed the backbone of society, supplied most of the educational resources and controlled many large areas of land. It was the time of Henry VIII that started the Protestant reformation within England against the older Catholic Christianity. Religion in this way became a major source of problems in this dynasty and subsequent dynasties and during the reign of Henry VIII, the monasteries were dissolved and their assets seized by the crown which gave much wealth and power to the ruling dynasty.
Punishments were severe, including (if you were lucky) lifelong imprisonment in the tower of London (not entirely a prison, the tower did have fairly comfortable apartments for wealthy incumbents, the tower was originally a palace), exile or swift beheading. However, for those deemed traitors, the penalty was often being dragged through the streets, hung until almost dead, the stomach drawn open with a blade and the entrails spilled onto a red hot plate. After that, they were cut in quarters with axes, all while still alive, then their head would be placed on a spike over the city or town gates. The Tudors wished to make a clear point about law and order. Alternatively criminals may be burned alive at the stake, sometimes with gunpowder used to speed up the process (which was deemed as merciful). The poor were often hung, imprisoned or executed for small crimes.
England was in a perilous time during this dynasty, not only recovering from a terrible civil war called the War of the Roses between the two rival branches of the ruling House of Plantagenet known as the House of York and Lancashire.
After this came the conflicts of the Protestant reformation, of succession and of royal marriage contracts. The English had long had wars with France and had an on and off relationship with Spain - a powerful nation at the time, but the people of England feared not only the religious conflicts but being embroiled in Spain’s many conflicts. Most monarchs, especially Elizabeth, had large and powerful secret services to spy on their people as well as foreign nationals, this pattern continued right through to the Stuart era.
While the nation at large became very wealthy and powerful during this dynasty, things went from bad to worse for the poor, who traditionally relied on support and charity of the monasteries. During the Tudor period, laws were passed requiring licenses to beg. Poor people were often forced to work in textile, metalworking and agriculture on pains of being whipped or executed on multiple offences.
The role of women in Tudor England seemed to be far more liberal than many of the neighbouring kingdoms in Europe. While it was still a vast way away from the freedoms of today, foreign visitors had noted that at the time the wealthy English women were more educated and cultured than anywhere else in Europe. Virtue, manners and honour was an exceptionally important aspect for both genders.
Tudor currency of the time was highly complex, with many small coin variations and a complex rate of exchange that confused many visiting international traders. Common currency (in no fixed order) included the three-farthing, pence, farthing, halfpenny, half groat, groat, pound, sixpence, half crown, crown, quarter angel, half angel, angel, sovereign, half pound and shillings.

,

New and popular spices includes cloves, nutmegs, mace as well as medieval spices such as cumin, ginger, garlic and cinnamon. Dried and sugared fruits such as raisins, dates, prunes also found their way into savoury dishes. The people of this era and long before then loved garlic, onions, leeks but as they had a strong fragrance, they were deemed as peasant food and so their use was limited, gradually to the point many centuries later that garlic became a foreign, exotic ingredient.
Meats of all kinds were very common yet vegetables were distrusted for being dirty and peasant-food, people of this era engaged in what’s called nose to tail eating, which involved organs such as tripe, lungs, heart, liver, kidneys, brains, marrow and essentially that was edible was consumed. Fish was very common and as the Navy of the Elizabethan era doubled up as the fishing fleet when it wasn't in active service, eating fish was made mandatory on certain days (Wednesday, Friday and Saturday) to be able to fund the navy.
Water was almost never consumed. Bacterial infections and other contaminants were rife so ale, beer, wine and mixed drinks were consumed instead, although milk drinks were also popular. Tea, chocolate and coffee were not available during this time, so many of today’s favourite beverages and flavourings were not familiar to the diet.
Bread was a major staple for all classes, with Manchet Bread, being a near white bread in today’s standard but certainly an expensive variety in its day, most common people lived off brown bread.
In the Tudor era, salads started to make their way into the diet, after cultural exchange from the Ottoman empire. These salads were often made more of flowers, leafy greens and herbs. Henry the 8th is said to have been fond of a salad made of young lemon leaves.
While not commonly consumed by the wealthy, this era introduced the potato, pumpkin, corn, tomatoes and many of the ""new world"" vegetables to Europe. Tomatoes, being closely related to deadly nightshade, were originally considered poisonous and was kept as an ornamental.
With the expansion of travel and exploration, many new methods were devised to preserve food for these voyages which also affected the local cuisine. Examples such as cooked beef and meat shredded and preserved with large corns of salt and covered with fat (which is the source of corned beef); dried and smoked fish and meat, clotted cream preserved with extra sugar and other pickles. Pickling became an important preservation technique and even seafood and oysters were pickled.
Sugar was originally reserved as a medicine as it was so expensive, but with sugar cane plantations growing sugar became a major ingredient even while still very expensive, but wreaked havoc with the teeth of the Tudors, so many Tudors had serious toothache and dental problems.
At this time, pies were a very popular meal, usually cooked in a thick pastry layer which was referred to as a coffin. This coffin was sometimes eaten, but often a decorative and inedible) pastry was used as a lid and / or container of the pie and was used and reused many times.
The meal for the wealthy was often finished with a banquet of sweet dishes such as candied fruits, marzipan, (originally called marchpane) and cheese curds.

,


The people typically followed the fashion style of the monarch, including using makeup called ceruse which is made of white lead and vinegar (lead poisoning being a common problem of the time) and other dress and fashion codes. The makeup was often important to hide scars from smallpox as well as from other diseases that were rife at the time.
The monarch also set strict laws known as Sumptuary Laws in what was and was not acceptable according to your class. With a rising wealth and aristocracy many of them wanted to display their wealth that threatened to outshine the monarchy so this was curbed quickly.
Clothing also identified your class. Purple, gold & silver, crimson, scarlet and bold blue in velvet, fur, silk, lace, cotton and taffeta were only for the royalty and upper nobility.
The poor people were forbidden to wear those types and so mostly relied on wool, hemp, linen and were allowed earthy colours such as brown, beige, yellow, orange, russet, green, grey and light blue. The middle classes (which were a minority) were allowed some décor and trimmings but nothing too excessive unless their fortunes changed.
Wealthy men often wore elaborate hats, corsets, a lot of jewellery (if they could afford it), as well as doublets, hose stockings, belts, separate sleeves and frequently a cloak.
The ideal complexion for men & women was light hair colour and very pale skin, which reflected they were not working classes who spent their time in the sun. Hair die or wigs were popular as well as makeup to accentuate pale skin, blushed red cheeks and red lips.
A fairly unique fashion in this era was the idea of designing slits in clothes to reveal layers underneath, which were often pulled or puffed to be to express a wide range of colours and textures. This was largely because the costumes already had many layers and took much time to prepare so it was popular to reveal these layers as well as to bulk out and accentuate a muscular frame.
The ruff came into its own in this era as while they were certainly known in medieval times, the Tudors made them more elaborate, decorative and large to express elegance and wealth.
Weaponry such as a rapier sword were commonly worn, after all it was the duty of men to protect their honour and their family, wealthy men were often taught fencing and other skills, however it was almost customary to wear the swords as a decorative addition to civilian dress.

, The Tudors loved entertainments, such as music, poetry, dancing, plays and theatre - early Tudor theatre was often quite grotesque in violence, such as Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus, but later as England became more wealthy, the standard and quality became much higher and more intellectual leading to the greater literature we admire today. The Globe theatre was a main center of theatre but was burnt down and later reconstructed.


Life expectancy was low, like the medieval era and the average age was 35, child mortality as well as deaths in childbirth and other medical complications was high - as many as 1 in 2 children would die before 16 years of age. Diseases and venereal diseases such as syphilis, smallpox, measles, black death, malaria, typhus and tuberculosis were very common.
Medicine and surgery was rather primitive, which included the use of leeches, cupping and other practices in order to remove impurities from the blood, which was believed to be the source of most illnesses.
The majority of people lived in small villages - the city of London was densely occupied, but nowhere near as densely populated as in the 19th century.
Food pricing in rural areas were set by law, so in harsher times the portion sizes sold of bread and other produce was reduced. Famines tended to be rare and more localised, but when times were tough and the money bought less food, there were frequently malnutrition and disease related deaths.
Most houses had several fireplaces, both for cooking and heating, but smaller houses tended to have simply a hole in the roof to let the smoke out.
Education was limited and if the family was not wealthy enough to afford a private tutor, who typically taught Greek, Latin and other languages, as well as mathematics and classical philosophy they had the local parish church or monastery (until their dissolution) for a limited education. At this time, there was only two universities and students were sent at a young age of 14. School was a long day and teachers were often violent and abusive which lead the wealthy to employ a 'whipping boy' who was paid to take the punishment of the original student.
The poor lived a hard life, as they worked most of the hours of the day on the fields or in industry, the wealthy in their spare time enjoyed hunting including with hawks, bear baiting, fencing, jousting and other activities.

No matter how well-written, well-argued, or well-evidenced your essay is, if you don't answer the answer the question you have been asked, you cannot expect to receive a top mark. Think about the specific key words and phrasing used in the question, and if you are uncertain of any of the terms, look them up and define them.The key words will often need to be defined at the start of your essay, and will serve as its boundaries.For example, if the question was ""To what extent was the First World War a Total War?"", the key terms are ""First World War"", and ""Total War"".
Do this before you begin conducting your research to ensure that your reading is closely focussed to the question and you don't waste time.;
, With a history essay there are a number of different types of question you might be asked, which will require different responses from you. You need to get this clear in the early stages so you can prepare your essay in the best way. Look at your set essay question and ask yourself whether you are being asked to explain, interpret, evaluate, or argue. You might be asked to do any number or all of these different things in the essay, so think about how you can do the following:


Explain: provide an explanation of why something happened or didn't happen.
Interpret: analyse information within a larger framework to contextualise it.
Evaluate: present and support a value-judgement.
Argue: take a clear position on a debate and justify it., Once you have done some research you will be beginning to formulate your argument, or thesis statement, in your head. It's essential to have a strong argument which you will then build your essay around. So before you start to plan and draft your essay, try to summarise your key argument in one or two sentences.


Your argument may change or become more nuanced as your write your essay, but having a clear thesis statement which you can refer back to is very helpful.
The main point of your essay should be clear enough that you can structure the essay plan around it.For example, your summary could be something like ""The First World War was a 'total war' because civilian populations were mobilized both in the battlefield and on the home front"".

, Once you have evaluated the question, you need to draw up an essay plan. This is a great opportunity to organise your notes and start developing the structure which you will use for your essay. When drawing up the plan you can assess the quality and depth of the evidence you have gathered and consider whether your thesis statement is adequately supported.


Pick out some key quotes that make your argument precisely and persuasively.When writing your plan, you should already be thinking about how your essay will flow, and how each point will connect together.

, A history essay will require a strong argument that is backed up by solid evidence. The two main types of evidence you can draw on are known as primary and secondary sources. Depending on the essay you are writing, you might be expected to include both of these. If you are uncertain about what is expected be sure to ask your teacher well in advance of the essay due date.


Primary source material refers to any texts, films, pictures, or any other kind of evidence that was produced in the historical period, or by someone who participated in the events of the period, that you are writing about.
Secondary material is the work by historians or other writers analysing events in the past. The body of historical work on a period or event is known as the historiography.It is not unusual to write a literature review or historiographical essay which does not directly draw on primary material.
Typically a research essay would need significant primary material.

, It can be difficult to get going with your research. There may be an enormous number of texts which makes it hard to know where to start, or maybe you are really struggling to find relevant material. In either case, there are some tried and tested ways to find reliable source material for your essay.


Start with the core texts in your reading list or course bibliography. Your teacher will have carefully selected these so you should start there.
Look in footnotes and bibliographies. When you are reading be sure to pay attention to the footnotes and bibliographies which can guide you to further sources a give you a clear picture of the important texts.
Use the library. If you have access to a library at your school or college, be sure to make the most of it. Search online catalogues and speak to librarians.
Access online journal databases. If you are in college it is likely that you will have access to academic journals online. These are an excellent and easy to navigate resources.Don't go straight to an internet search engine. If you are tempted to just type your topic into the search bar, you will find lots of results, but the scholarly value will be questionable and you will have to spend a lot of time wading through sites before you find the good sources.

, It's very important that you critically evaluate your sources. For a strong academic essay you should be using and engaging with scholarly material that is of a demonstrable quality. It's very easy to find information on the internet, or in popular histories, but you should be using academic texts by historians. If you are early on in your studies you might not be sure how to identify scholarly sources, so when you find a text ask yourself the following questions:


Who is the author? Is it written by an academic with a position at a University? Search for the author online.
Who is the publisher? Is the book published by an established academic press? Look in the cover to check the publisher, if it is published by a University Press that is a good sign.
If it's an article, where is published? If you are using an article check that it has been published in an academic journal., Once you found some good sources, you need to take good notes and read the texts critically. Try not to let your mind drift along as you read a book or article, instead keep asking questions about what you are reading. Think about what exactly the author is saying, and how well the argument is supported by the evidence.


Ask yourself why the author is making this argument. Evaluate the text by placing it into a broader intellectual context. Is it part of a certain tradition in historiography? Is it a response to a particular idea?
Consider where there are weaknesses and limitations to the argument. Always keep a critical mindset and try to identify areas where you think the argument is overly stretched or the evidence doesn't match the author's claims., When you are taking notes you should be wary of writing incomplete notes or misquoting a text. It's better to write down more in your notes than you think you will need than not have enough and find yourself frantically looking back through a book.


Label all your notes with the page numbers and precise bibliographic information on the source.
If you have a quote but can't remember where you found it, imagine trying to skip back through everything you have read to find that one line.
If you use something and don't reference it fully you risk plagiarism., When you begin writing up your essay, a strong introduction can set the scene, create interest in the reader, and provide an outline of what is to come in your essay.Try to begin with one or two sentences which announce the topic of your essay and indicate what you will be writing about. The first sentence or two can give a broader view of a problem which you will then focus in on in the rest of the introduction.For example you could start by saying ""In the First World War new technologies and the mass mobilization of populations meant that the war was not fought solely by standing armies"".
This first sentences introduces the topic of your essay in a broad way which you can start focus to in on more.

, In your introduction you should give a clear outline of how you are going to answer the question, and what your argument is. You should give a brief overview of your main points and the type of evidence that you will use to support them. Try to explicitly answer the question in one sentence, and then expand on how you are going to argue your case.This will lead to an outline of the structure of your essay and your argument.
Here you will explain the particular approach you have taken to the essay.
For example, if you are using case studies you should explain this and give a brief overview of which case studies you will be using and why., Depending on the type of essay you are writing, it will be necessary to provide a brief overview of the main historiographical debates for your topic. It is important to demonstrate that you have a good understanding of what other historians have written about your topic, and be able to situate your own argument within this broader context.

, When you come to write the body of the essay it is important that you have a clear structure to your argument and to your prose. If your essay drifts, loses focus, or becomes a narrative of events then you will find your grade dropping. Your introduction can help guide you if you have given a clear indication of the structure of your essay., The body of the essay is where your argument is really made and where you will be using evidence directly. Think carefully about how you construct your paragraphs, and think of each paragraph as one micro-sized version of the essay structure. In other words, aim to have a topic sentence introducing each paragraph, followed by the main portion of the paragraph where you explain yourself and draw on the relevant evidence.Try to include a sentence that concludes each paragraph and links it to the next paragraph.
When you are organising your essay think of each paragraph as addressing one element of the essay question.
Keeping a close focus like this will also help you avoid drifting away from the topic of the essay and will encourage you to write in precise and concise prose.
Don't forget to write in the past tense when referring to something that has already happened.

, How you use your evidence will play a large part in how convincing your argument is and how well your essay reads. You can introduce evidence by directly quoting it, or by summarising it. Using evidence strategically and intelligently will seriously improve your essay. Try to avoid long quotations, and use only the quotes that best illustrate your point.Don't drop a quote from a primary source into your prose without introducing it and discussing it.
If you are referring to a secondary source, you can usually summarise in your own words rather than quoting directly.
Be sure to fully reference anything you refer to, including if you do not quote it directly.

, The fluency of your text is an important element in the writing a good history essay that can often be overlooked. Think carefully about how you transition from one paragraph to the next and try to link your points together, building your argument as you go. It is easy to end up with an essay that reads as a more or less disconnected series of points, rather than a fully developed and connected argument.


Think about the first and last sentence in every paragraph and how they connect to the previous and next paragraph.
Try to avoid beginning paragraphs with simple phrases that make your essay appear more like a list. For example, limit your use of words like: ""Additionally"", ""Moreover"", ""Furthermore"".
Give an indication of where your essay is going and how you are building on what you have already said., A good conclusion should precisely and succinctly summarise your argument and key points. You need to make sure your conclusion reflects the content of your essay, and refers back to the outline you provided in the introduction. If you read your conclusion and it doesn't directly answer the essay question you need to think again.


Briefly outline the implications of your argument and it's significance in relation to the historiography, but avoid grand sweeping statements.A conclusion also provides the opportunity to point to areas beyond the scope of your essay where the research could be developed in the future.

, Once you have written up essay, it is important that you set aside sometime to proofread it thoroughly and work on any revisions. Proofreading is not just about picking out typos and grammar mistakes, but can be a good opportunity to evaluate your work more closely, both for style and content. As you read through, think about the language you use as well as your sentence construction.


Try to cut down any overly long sentences or run-on sentences. Instead, try to write clear and accurate prose and avoid unnecessary words.
Concentrate on developing a clear, simple and highly readable prose style first before you think about developing your writing further.Reading your essay out load can help you get a clearer picture of awkward phrasing and overly long sentences., One thing to look out for when you read through your history essay is whether or not you have allowed any overly descriptive passages to creep in. Remember a history essay is an analysis and not just a narrative of events. History students can find themselves re-telling a series of events rather than analysing them and the historiographical debates about them.


When you read through your essay look at each paragraph and ask yourself, ""what point this paragraph is making"".
You might have produced a nice piece of narrative writing, but if you are not directly answering the question it is not going to help your grade.

, Your essay is not complete until you have included and checked all your references together with your bibliography. There are many different style conventions for the formatting of these, so be sure to check with your teacher what style you should be using if you don't already know. Although it might seem like an annoying task, if you don't use the right style it suggests laziness to the person marking your essay.


A bibliography will typically have primary sources first, followed by secondary sources.Double and triple check that you have included all the necessary references in the text. If you forgot to include a reference you risk being reported for plagiarism.

Try to choose a subject in history that interests you, no matter how much you already know about the subject.Remember, this doesn’t have to be a school subject, it can also be a hobby or point of interest.;
, Knowing why you want to study history, and what specifically you would like to study, will help you better find relevant resources and materials. Try to narrow down your subject to searchable periods in order to have the best possible search results and the most comprehensive study possible.


Examples of specific interests can range from larger periods, like the Renaissance, to specific events, like the war of 1812.
Remember that this doesn’t mean you have to choose between one or the other. You can make plans to pursue all of your many interests.

, Ask parents, friends, and former teachers for advice. Studying alone can sometimes be overwhelming, especially when trying to navigate material that you are unfamiliar with. Reach out and get in touch with others you know who have spent time studying, whether it has been independently or in school.


Try asking teachers questions like, “I’m trying to study Colonial American history independently, do you know of any good resources?” “Do you have any good tips for studying independently?” or “How quickly do you think I’ll be able to learn this material?”

, Local libraries are great resources for information and material. Go to your local library and talk to your librarian about what resources the library offers. Be sure to ask them about the subject or period you are interested in studying. Many libraries have connections with other libraries, which means they can reserve resources that they do not have.


Most public libraries require a library card. If you don’t have a library card ask your librarian about the registration process.
Libraries are also a quiet place where you can spend time studying.

, Online resources can be particularly helpful, especially if you live in a remote area or have a schedule that won’t allow you to frequently go to a library. There are many comprehensive online learning resources that can help you source material, test your knowledge, and take part in conversations with others who are also interested in history.


Try looking up scholarly articles and peer-reviewed essays on online resources, like Google Scholar and JSTOR.Look for period or subject specific blogs or forums online, like history subreddits on Reddit or personal blogs devoted to your area of interest.
Many online resources, like universities and scholarly sites, also offer multimedia material, like recorder lectures, slideshows, and interactive websites.

, Many acclaimed universities also post their syllabi online, which can be a great resource of information and time management. Looking at syllabi for examples may also point you in other directions that are only accessible through specific educational institutions, like libraries, that might not otherwise be available or discussed online.


Many of the Ivy League schools, like Harvard, post their syllabi on their website. Try contacting their department or searching out a specific subject., Participating in historical reenactments can be a great way to get involved in learning about historical events that are of interest. Historical reenactments can occupy a wide range of events, from reenacting sieges and treaty signings to historical meetings and roleplay. Most historical reenactment groups are run by a community of others who share interests and have a passion for history.Look into historical reenactments groups, like the American Heritage Festival, or consult online resources like Reenactor., Planning a visit to a historical site can also be a great way to involve friends, family, and loved ones in your passion for history. Visit a site that you already know a lot about so that you can involve others in your passion. You can also visit sites that you don’t know much about to excite an new historical passion.


Many travel sites and agencies, like TripAdvisor, offer comprehensive reviews of historical trips and vacations.There are also many online blogs devoted to visiting historical sites around the world, like Travelthruhistory., Collecting historical memorabilia is a great way to continue learning about events that interest you. There are many ways to collect memorabilia. You can source it from specific collectors, or you can browse pawn shops and antique stores. It will be helpful to have an idea of what you are looking for when contacting specific collectors. However, browsing pawn shops and antique stores can be a great way to stumbleupon hidden finds.


Try looking for historical memorabilia on online vendors, like Heritage Auction or Ebay."

Press and hold your floor.,
Use the ""Close Door"" button.,
Cancel other highlighted floors.,
Use your foot.,
Ask your building manager.",How to Make an Elevator an Express Elevator1," In some elevators, simply pressing your floor and holding it will do the trick. You have to hold the button all the way to your floor., When you get on the elevator, press the ""Close Door"" button. Often, this button will be two triangles pointing in towards each other. Continue holding the ""Close Door"" button as you push your floor. In some elevators, this combination will give you an express ride.This combination often works on Otis, Desert, and Dover elevators.
Note that sometimes the ""Close Door"" button is just a placebo for impatient riders, so this trick may not work.

, In some elevators, you can cancel floors that have already been pressed. Of course, if people see you do so, they will probably not be very happy. Or, they may press their floor button again. The simplest method is to double press the button, which works in Mitsubishi Electric. In other brands, such as Fujitec, pressing it five times works. Another method is to hold the ""Open Door"" button while pressing the floor button twice., Some people suggest that you can use your foot to keep the door from opening. Simply put your foot on the middle of the elevator door, covering the edges of the door. In theory, the sole of your shoe will keep the door from opening on floors., If you're cozy with your building manager, you may be able to get the secret elevator code from him or her. However, you may need to promise to use it only for good."

Identify and understand the purposes of your opening statement.,
Identify and understand what content belongs in your opening statement.,
Identify and understand your audience and what your tone should be.,
Write your introductory remarks.Be aggressive here and give the jurors a good impression of your case.Begin with remarks that summarize the case, state your theme, and arouse the interest of the jurors.The first couple of minutes during your opening statement is when all the jurors are likely paying the most attention, so you want to capture them immediately.Consider the following example: ""On January 23, 2001, Chris McGuigan walked into Riverside Hospital through the front door to have a minor operation to remove a growth on her arm.,
Introduce your actors, places, and things.In this section you want to first introduce your client, followed by an introduction of other important witnesses.When you introduce your client, you want to make him or her seem real and likeable.At the end of the day, the jury is going to see your client throughout the trial so you want them to relate to and empathize with your client.,
Identify your disputes.When you identify the points of contention in your case, you want to tell the jury in plain language what is claimed in the complaint and how the complaint was answered.You want to state the general nature of the disputes the jury will have to resolve while making sure you are not attacking your opponent's case at this stage.,
Tell your story.This is the body of your opening statement and should tell your story of what happened from your client's point of view.You want this section to be simple and easy to follow because this will be the jury's first impression of the facts.,
Discuss your weaknesses.You want to bring up any glaring weaknesses in your case at the beginning in order to look honest, lessen the impact when your opponent brings them up, and it allows you to portray them in the most positive light possible.You want to keep this section as brief as possible and only bring up weaknesses that are going to emerge from your own presentation of evidence.Consider this good example: ""At 9:00, Jim McCutcheon left the steak house, and got into his car to head home.,
Provide a conclusion.Your conclusion should summarize the theme of your case and you should ask the jury for a specific verdict.You can accomplish this by suggesting that the evidence adds up to a favorable outcome.Look at this example to see how to effectively summarize your case and ask the jury for a verdict: ""The bottom line is that the evidence will show that the defendant knew what he was doing when he killed Boyd Farnam.,
Prepare your speech for the day of the trial.,
Practice your opening statement in front of an audience or in front of a mirror.Practicing will help you become comfortable with your delivery and timing.Also, practicing with others will allow you to get feedback from friends, family, and/or colleagues regarding your content and mannerisms.

,
Make final changes if necessary.",How to Write an Opening Statement," An opening statement is meant to help jurors comprehend the case, focus on important evidence, and provide context.Before writing your opening statement, you are going to want to grasp why the opening statement is so important. This will help you write the best opening statement possible. Your opening statement should do at least the following things:



Present a clear picture of the case.Your opening statement is one of the only times at trial you will be able to tell a complete, uninterrupted story.After your opening statement, the case will unfold in bits and pieces and may seem unorganized to the jurors.Arouse the interest of your jury.You want the jury to be engaged and interested in the case.If they are not, you may find your jury getting bored and becoming inattentive during your presentation of witnesses and evidence.Build rapport with your jurors.You want the jurors to like you, as you will ultimately ask them to decide the case in your favor. You want to speak to them as the intelligent people they are, and you want to be sincere in the beliefs you convey.;
, Before you start writing your opening statement, you want to brainstorm what type of information should be included and what should be left out. An opening statement is an opportunity for you to discuss the facts of your case while generally avoiding arguments and the application of law to facts.Discuss the facts of your case.Your opening statement should be limited to a discussion of the anticipated evidence and what the main issues are.You must not exaggerate or misstate your evidence, you must not refer to inadmissible evidence, and you must not discuss matters that will not be a part of your own case.Avoid arguing during your opening statement.Because the point of your opening statement is to introduce the jury to your case, you do not want to turn your opening statement into a series of legal arguments.So long as you are assisting the jury in understanding your evidence, your comments should be permissible. However, once you begin asking the jury to make inferences, interpret facts in your favor, and/or resolve disputes, you are most likely making impermissible arguments.Avoid discussing the law in detail during your opening statement. Your opening statement can most likely have a brief introduction to the legal issues on which your case depends.However, you should avoid discussing how the law should be interpreted, and you should avoid applying any of the facts of your case to the law., When you deliver your opening statement at trial, your audience is going to be the jurors. In order to write the best possible opening statement, you will want to know as much about your jurors as possible. Understand the educational and cultural diversity of your jurors, as well as any likes or dislikes they may have hinted at during prior proceedings.The tone of your article should match the audience you are speaking to. You will want to craft your opening argument to make it easily accessible to your jurors without making it oversimplified or rude., One week later, on January 30, she was carried out of the back door dead. What happened in that short week to turn a routine operation into a life and death struggle, and why it never should have happened, is what this case is all about."", You should also familiarize the jury with important locations and times that are going to play a big role in the trial.When you introduce these things, you should attempt to make them as real and tangible as possible because you want the jury to stay engaged and believe your story.,, Your focus should be on who did what to whom, what their reasons were for doing it, and what the consequences were., The car was in good condition, and Jim was alert, sober and not at all tired. He had drunk two beers with his dinner, but was still in full control of his faculties. He would not have driven if he had been feeling any effects from the beer. Jim won’t even drive with a cell phone on."", He killed Boyd for revenge - an eye for an eye - because he blamed Boyd for the death of his daughter. The people of this state will therefore ask you at the close of the evidence to find him guilty of murder."", You should strive to deliver your opening statement from memorization. Doing so will make your opening statement more genuine, believable, and effective.In order to accomplish this, you should:


Write your opening statement exactly as you want to present it;
Reduce it to a general outline; then
Reduce it one last time to a key word outline that you may or may not use during your opening statement itself.,, Before you go into the courtroom to deliver your opening statement, you will want to make any final tweaks you think will make the opening statement perfect. You will have spent so much time preparing and practicing, you will know by this point if anything needs to be added or taken out. Do this at least a day before you deliver your opening statement so you have time to practice your final version.

Ask for the other party’s signature.,
Store your copy safely.",How to Write an Agreement Letter," Before drafting an agreement letter, you need to know what you and the other person agree to. You should sit down and talk, whether in person or over the phone. Take notes so that you can remember the terms of the agreement.


Try to come to as much agreement as possible. An agreement letter can be less formal than a contract. However, it needs to be sufficiently definite so that both parties understand what is expected.;
, You might be anxious to start a new project but be unhappy with some of the terms the other party is offering, e.g., the amount of pay or the short deadlines. You can try to negotiate with the other party.


To successfully negotiate, you should be prepared to give something away to get something in return.For example, if you want a little more money for the project, then agree to an extra round of revisions. Or if you want to lower the overall cost of the project, then offer to pay more upfront.

, Before typing up the agreement letter, you should outline it. Look at your notes and try to organize the information in a meaningful manner. The outline for an agreement letter can look like this:


the nature of the agreed upon work
deadlines
terms of payment (how much, method of payment, etc.)
when the agreement begins and ends
other details

, You should type your agreement letter. Set the font to a readable size and style. For example, Times New Roman 12 point is fairly standard. Choose whatever looks comfortable.


If you have letterhead, then you should use it when you print off the agreement letter. Be sure to space down five or six lines so that the letter doesn’t print over the letterhead.

, At the very top of the page, you should place the words “Letter of Agreement” in bold. Center the text., You will write your letter like a regular business letter.Make sure that the date and the other person’s address are lined up on the left-hand margin.


Two lines below the title, insert your address if you are not using letterhead. Two lines below your address, put in the date.Two lines below that, insert the other party’s address.Insert the salutation two lines below the address. For example, “Dear Ms. Jones” or “Dear Mr. Faulkner.”

, In the first paragraph, you should state why you are writing the agreement letter.For example, you could write, “The purpose of this agreement letter is to outline the requirements for the wedding reception Madelyn Smith will organize for me, June 12, 2016.”

, In as much detail as possible, the letter should outline the tasks to be performed. For example, if someone is to write a rough draft of a book, then you would want to state the subject matter of the book, its length, and the theme of the book.


If you are hiring someone to plan a wedding, then you would want to list what the event planner should do. For example: hire a band, coordinate with a florist, provide one meal for 55 guests, and rent the reception hall.

, In as much detail as possible, explain any benchmarks or timelines. If you want to see a rough draft of a document, state when it is due.If you want the other party to make progress reports to you, then list the dates that the reports should be submitted.


For example, you could state, “Quarterly status reports will be made as follows: April 1; June 30; and September 30. The final draft should be submitted no later than December 31, 2016. These deadlines can be amended by the signed written agreement of the parties.”

, If the agreement involves creative works (writing, artwork, music, etc.), then you might want to come to an agreement about how revisions will be handled. Revisions can sometimes cause conflict, because one party might find the number of revisions excessive. Explain the revision process.


For example, you could state, “Revisions may be made by the artist only after completion of the first mock-up. Once the client has approved of the mock-up, additional fees will be charged for revisions made after this fact.”
You can also state the number of revisions.For example, you could state, “The maximum number of free revisions is two. If client wants more, then client will be charged additional fees.”

, You will want to include information about how much you will be paid, but also when payment must be made. You should also state how much must be paid upfront, if anything.


For example, the letter could say, “A sum of $1,000 will be paid to Mr. Jones within five business days of signing this agreement. Mr. Jones will bill the balance for the project at the completion date (tentatively June 1, 2016) and payment in full will fall due within 14 business days.”Also include a clause on cancellation.The other party might want to cancel before you have completed the project. In this case, you will need to explain how much they will owe for partial work. For example, you could write, “Cancellation fees will be calculated as follows: 50% of the final fee is due within 15 business days if the project is cancelled for any reason before completion. One hundred percent (100%) of the total fee is due despite cancellation if the project has been completed.”

, If it is not apparent from the rest of the letter, then you should specify how long the agreement is in effect for. For example, if you are establishing a continuing work relationship in the letter, then set the end date.


You could state, “This agreement comes into effect January 1, 2016. It will expire December 31, 2016. At that point, both parties will consider whether to extend the agreement.”

, Just as you would in a contract, you should state which law governs the agreement in case there is a dispute.Sample language might read, “This Agreement will be governed by the law of the state of Texas.”

, If the parties are trading or using confidential information, then you will want to add a non-disclosure provision.Confidential information includes trade secrets, patented materials, or customer lists.


A typical non-disclosure clause might read, “The parties agree that in their performance under this letter all intellectual property or information marked as confidential will be handled with the standard of care normally given to confidential information.”

, If the letter serves as the final agreement, then you will want to make that known. However, if the letter only contains some of the agreements between you and the other party, then you shouldn’t add this clause.


You could write, “This letter contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter. No promise or condition not contained in the letter is binding. If any term is held invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of the agreement should remain in effect. No modification of this agreement shall be valid unless made in writing and signed by both parties.”

, Both you and the other party should sign the letter. Make two signature blocks, one for each party. Type your name under the signature line and create another line beneath the signature line for the date.Just above the signature block type the words “Understood and Agreed.”, You should send a copy to the other party to review. If you are expecting them to sign the letter, then you need to give them a chance to object to anything in the agreement. It is better that the other party offer suggestions for revisions than to scrawl all over the letter, striking out sentences and writing other sentences in.


Give the other party a week to review the letter and return it to you with corrections. You will then type up a new master letter.
If you don’t agree with suggested corrections, then call the other party and discuss your disagreement. You cannot sign a letter unless you both agree to the contents contained in it.

, Once you come to an agreement, print off the letter and sign it, using black ink. Add the date. Keep a copy of the letter for your records.

, Mail the revised letter to the other party and include a note asking the other party to sign and return the original to you.Mail the letter certified mail, return receipt requested. This way, you will know that it was received.
Also include a copy of the letter in the envelope for the other party’s records.

, When you get the signed letter returned, be sure to store it safely where it won’t be damaged. You may need to rely on the agreement letter should a dispute arise between you and the other party. The letter could serve as evidence in a lawsuit, for example.

Have guest speakers.",How to Teach American History," If you're teaching older students, create a syllabus to give them. The syllabus should list the grading scale, historical events or themes they will understand, course expectations, all readings, and assignments (which should include a mix of essays, exams, and discussion groups). If you're teaching younger students, you don't need to give them a syllabus, just make the important points of the lessons clear. For example, your young students should be able to understand why the 4th of July is important if you're teaching the American Revolution.Make sure that you're including any school requirements in your course (like standardized testing or academic writing).;
, In courses where students only have one exam and one writing assignment, it may be hard for them to gauge how they're doing academically. Try to assign a variety of smaller assignments so you can see how your students are doing. Spend some time writing details of how they can improve, especially if it's early in the term. You might try assigning short answer assignments in which your students write a few sentences to identify significant Americans or events in American history.For example, you might assign short answer or identification questions at the end of every week. For example, you could have them explain the significance of the Boston Tea Party, the Stamp Act, and Federalists if you're covering the American Revolution.
Try to quickly return assignments with your feedback so the students can make adjustments.
Don't overwhelm the student with feedback. Make two or three suggestions for how they can improve.

, It's easy to fall into a routine of teaching the same material year after year. To keep yourself and your students interested in American history, continue reading new articles or papers. Attend new exhibits or watch new documentaries that add to your knowledge about the subject.


Your students may be more motivated to learn if you help them connect current events to historical events that you're teaching. For example, if there's an election coming up, you may want to talk to your students about how people have voted to change or amend the Constitution in the past. You could also compare historical elections to modern elections., If you're feeling overwhelmed, frustrated or bored by teaching American history, reach out to other history teachers. They may have experienced similar things in the past and have learned useful strategies. If you're one of the only history teachers at your school, consider attending a history conference or teaching workshop.


Check with your school or institution to see if attending a conference or workshop earns you any professional development points., If you're teaching American history to very young children, you'll probably want to provide the basic and teach using play. They'll enjoy watching a little show or listening to a picture book. If you're teaching students in middle school, consider taking them on a field trip (like to a museum or historical battle field). Hands-on experiences can get the students excited about history. You an then assign a short review on what they learned.


For older students, you can encourage them to think critically. Use a variety of teaching methods, assignments, and discussions to get them thinking about social, political, and economic implications of historical events. Plan mock debates where your students argue historical sides of an event (like women getting the vote or prohibition).

, Many students who complain they don't like history say they don't like just memorizing dates and names. Instead of making students feel as though history is completely factual, use themes or time periods and point out different ways of seeing the events. Each theme could include a variety of events throughout American history, not necessarily in chronological order.Example themes include the discovery of America, the colonial era, American expansion, immigration, temperance reform, war, balance of power, the American Dream, and American identity.
For example, if you're teaching the American dream, you could discuss what the American dream means to your students, how it has its basis in colonial history and how it's changed throughout the 20th century. Have your students read Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream Speech"" and discuss what the founding father's would have thought of King's sentiments.

, Write up a detailed lesson plan for each class period. You can work with other teachers or find examples of lesson plans through online national history sites. Your students won't need to see the lesson plans, but they'll help you focus on important themes for the day, what readings you want to cover, and specific information you want to give to students (especially if it will appear on an exam).Don't be afraid to change lesson plans as you go along. If you find yourself needing to take more time covering a topic, do so, but make a note so you can try to pick up at the next lesson.
For example, one day you might note that your students need to have read a chapter in their textbooks, read a historical document, and be prepared to discuss the significance of a famous battle (if you're covering something like the Civil War).

, You can do this for any level of history you teach. If you're teaching younger students, you're probably also teaching social studies (which may include geography and civics issues). If you're teaching older students, you can break up a standard lecture by including:Music: play music or popular songs from the time period you're teaching. For example, play jazz if you're teaching your students about the Harlem Renaissance.
Art: show your students paintings, sculptures and architecture from areas you're teaching. For example, you may want to show pop art and discuss how it reflected changing American mindsets after World War II.
Science: do experiments or discuss technological developments or inventions that were new to an era you're teaching. In a unit on postwar America, talk about how modern conveniences changed the American Dream.
Literature: have your students read excerpts from novels. Choose books that were popular, controversial, or written by influential people of the time period. Assign parts from Uncle Tom's Cabin and discuss how the book influenced perceptions of slavery.
Films/plays: Show clips from movies or plays that represent what it might have been like to live during the time you're teaching. You can also discuss historical inaccuracies in the clips you watch. For example, you could watch scenes from ""Gettysburg"" or ""Sons of Liberty.""

, If your students are old enough, schedule at least one class period a week for small group discussions. Earlier in the week, assign primary documents (like speeches, diaries, and government documents) or passages you want your students to read. Let them come up with questions and things to discuss. During discussions, have one or two students lead the group(s) so you don't end up taking over their discussion time.If your students are too young to do traditional weekly discussions, try doing a gallery walk. Put pictures of historical people, places, or themes you taught during the week. Let your young pupils walk around and talk about what they see and understand.

, Some students may struggle to find history interesting if you simply states facts and list names and dates. Your students might start tuning you out if you rely too much on just reading material. Instead, ask your students questions, get your students to read out passages of documents, or break them into small groups to argue sides of a historical situation. Include visuals for those students who learn better by reading or viewing things.For example, you might start the lecture by asking students what they know about the day's topic. Let them know it's alright if they don't know much or are confused. You could also break up the lecture by asking how they think they would have reacted or behaved if placed in a similar situation.
If you break the class into small groups to discuss documents or themes, be sure to walk around each group to see how they're doing or if they need help.

, If you've spent most of the period teaching and lecturing, save 5 to 10 minutes at the end of the class to answer student questions. If your students don't have any questions for you, ask them questions to ensure they understood the day's material. If they don't, you may need to go over some elements of the lecture again.If you struggle to save time at the end of your lectures for questions, try offering pauses throughout the lecture where you ask if anyone has questions.
You should also offer regular office hours. Tell your students what days and hours you're available for them to drop in and ask for questions and help. Remind students that they should come in for help throughout the term and not just right before big tests.

, It's nice to break up the classroom routine by inviting guest speakers to speak. A guest speaker can give a short talk about a historical theme or issue you're covering and can take questions from your students. This will also make you classroom more interactive. Good choices for guest speakers include:War veterans
Historians
Librarians (even if they're only there to speak about how to research for an assignment)
Political activists
Museum curators

Keep up with the news.,
Read your foreign affairs' departments advisories on travel.,
Read the information being given to sports participants.",How to Stay Safe During International Sports Games in Unsafe Cities or Countries1," When the news stories start coming in that there is unrest, strife, increased crime, or terrorist attempts taking place where the sports event is happening, it's time to sit up and listen. Keep a watching brief on events as they unfold. Do additional research online, looking at news sites from your own country and from the country or region you'll be traveling to. From this information, consider what your gut reactions are about what is happening. Maybe if it doesn't feel right already, it's a good idea to stay home.;
, Go to your government's foreign affairs site and look up the travel advisories provided by the foreign affairs' officials. If they are suggesting no travel, or extremely limited travel, then the situation is very serious and it's likely that they have more information than the news stories you've been watching.

, Another good indication of whether or not it's a safe bet to still attend is to see how the sports teams or individuals have responded to the crisis. Has their government or sports body decided to prevent them from traveling? Not only does that provide you with a big disincentive if your own country's team pulls out but it's also an indication that you're best at home too. If those responsible for the sports team individual's safety don't feel they can secure this, then this is highly indicative of the possible dangers involved.


Be careful to read between the lines, all the same. Sometimes countries or officials play brinkmanship diplomacy and end up going at the last minute after certain demands or assurances are met that don't always relate to the security situation. Keep a close eye on both the news and your government's travel advisories.

This is particularly important if you are a woman or if you are young.Licensed taxi services have dispatch numbers you can call to schedule your cab in advance. Ask the operator for the name or car number of the car that is scheduled to pick you up. This is especially important at airports, where there often are unlicensed cabs waiting outside to pick up desperate travelers.
You might also give your destination to the operator and ask about fares and traditional tips so you can get a reliable estimate of how much your trip will cost.
When the cab arrives, make sure it is the car you ordered.;
, If you're out in public and need to call a cab to come and pick you up, try to make your call from a relatively private place to avoid being overheard. Someone might overhear you and take advantage of the situation.For example, someone who works for an unscrupulous or illegal taxi service could call a car to come pick you up. You could mistakenly get into that car, thinking it was the one you just called.
Generally, avoid talking on the phone on a busy sidewalk. This not only increases the odds that you could be picked up by an illegal taxi, but also makes you vulnerable to muggers because you are distracted.

, When you call ahead to order your taxi, make sure you understand how much the trip will cost, whether you'll pay a metered fare or a flat rate, and what tip is customary in the area where you're traveling.Once you enter the cab, explain to the driver that you already know how much the trip will cost. For example, if the taxi company charges a flat rate for trips to the airport, let the cab driver know that you're expecting that flat rate and not a metered fare.
If the driver disagrees or insists on charging you something different than what you were told in advance, get out of the car and call the taxi service immediately to report the discrepancy.

, In most countries, taxi cab drivers must have a badge or identification card in their car and available for your inspection. Look at it carefully and, if there's a photo, compare that photo to the driver to make sure it is the same person.If the badge looks damaged, or as though it has been tampered with, get out of the cab and call the taxi service immediately. While there may be no issue, you are better safe than sorry. The badge could have been stolen by an imposter who is posing as a legitimate cab driver.
A legitimate cab driver should have no qualms about showing you their identification. If they refuse to do so, get out of the cab and call the taxi service immediately.

, Most countries, particularly in North America and Europe, require licensed cab drivers to keep their cars in good condition with routine maintenance up to date. If the cab looks beat-up or doesn't run properly, it may not be legitimate.Keep in mind that if something turns you off or just doesn't ""feel right"" about the cab itself, or the driver, you don't have to get into the car. Simply call the taxi service and tell them that you had a bad feeling, or otherwise explain your concerns. If you're embarrassed to do this, you might want to call a different cab company.
In less developed countries, taxis may not be as well maintained as they are in North America and Europe. Take some time to look around the area and get a feel for the average condition of cabs so you know what to expect.

, Ride-sharing can save you some money, but to stay safe when traveling by taxi you need to make sure no one that you don't know gets into the cab with you. A stranger could put your safety and security at risk.Sometimes this is a ploy between an unscrupulous cab driver and a friend to rob or assault passengers. You get in the car, then the other person gets in the car. When you are robbed, the cab driver and the other person split the loot.
If you've gone out at night, you may meet somebody who offers to share a cab with you, saying they are staying in the same hotel as you are, or that they live close by and you would be going in the same direction. This too can be a ploy to rob, assault, or otherwise take advantage of you. Don't do it. Your safety is worth spending a little more for your ride.

Figure out how much time you have.,
Plan your route.,
Set a budget.,
Explore train options.,
Apply for the necessary visas.,
Obtain a passport.,
Book your train tickets.,
Pack only the essentials.",How to Travel from London to Beijing by Train1," Some routes take longer than others. You will need at least eight days to make the journey. If you want to stop and visit other cities along the way, set aside additional time., You will first have to travel from London to a European city that has direct trains to Moscow. You will then travel from that city to Moscow. In Moscow, you will board the Trans-Siberian railway and travel to Beijing via one of two routes.Consider traveling to Moscow from a European city, like Paris or Berlin, that has direct trains to both Moscow and London.
You will travel from Moscow to Beijing via Manchuria or via Mongolia. Keep in mind that there is often only one train per week on these routes.

, The cost of the trip will depend on what European city you stop over in, how long you stay in that city or in Moscow, and what class of train tickets you purchase. Research the costs of train tickets, hotels if you plan to stop over, and food and drink on the trains to help structure your budget.


For example, tickets from Moscow to Beijing cost anywhere between 500 and 900 Euros, with first class tickets costing the most.

, There are multiple options for trains between European cities. Once you decide where you will board the train to Moscow, you can begin researching specific trains and routes. Things to take into consideration include cost, length of trip, and available class compartments.First class tickets are the most expensive, and often include a sleeper car.
You can also purchase a second class ticket that does not include a sleeper car.
All of the trains going from Moscow to Beijing include dining options. The type and availability of food on trains between London, Europe, and Moscow varies.

, You may need visas to visit the countries along your journey, depending on your nationality and the route you travel. Once you plan your route, research each country’s visa requirements online. Then, apply for the visas well in advance of your trip. You will likely need the following visas:You will need a transit visa in Belarus, where most trains pass through on their way from Moscow to Beijing.
Unless you are a Russian citizen, you will need to obtain a Russian tourist visa.
If you are not a Chinese citizen, you will need a Chinese tourist visa.

, You will need a valid passport to travel from London to Beijing. If you already have a passport, make sure it is still valid and does not expire before the end of your trip. If necessary, renew your passport. If you do not currently have a passport, apply for one at least six months before your trip., Reservations are required on the trains between Moscow and Beijing. While some train types for the other legs of your journey may not require reservations, it is usually a good idea to book ahead of time to guarantee a seat. For example, trains like the Eurostar and Thalys, do require reservations and are quite popular.Try visiting www.bahn.de to view timetables and fares for train travel in Europe.

, A lighter suitcase will make for a more efficient journey. Try packing five or less changes of clothes. You should also make sure you bring maps and guidebooks for any city you stop over in, reading materials, a journal, a flashlight or headlamp, snacks, and proper outerwear depending on the season. You might also want to wear a money belt to hold your currency, passport, and/or credit cards.

Immediately lock your door.,
Close and lock any windows if they are open.,
Turn off all lights.,
Find somewhere to hide (in the closet, under the bed, etc) or sit quietly in a spot as far from the door as possible.,
Call emergency services for further instructions.",How to Hide in a Hotel Room During a Lockdown," For extra precaution, quietly prop a sturdy chair or small piece of furniture against the door to serve as a barricade.
, Then, draw the blinds/curtains all the way., Take out a flashlight or use your cell phone to help you see if it is too dark in the room., If you must talk, whisper., Stay on the line with them as they will be able to provide updates on the situation and other guidance, as well as notify the authorities to help you should you need to defend yourself."
"
Talk to consular officials if you're already on location.,
Take all the usual precautions for safe travel.,
Stay alert at all times.,
Keep a list of all emergency numbers both local and back home.,
Know the normal standards of safety for regular tourist activities.,
Know what you can and cannot take into the sport's event areas.",How to Stay Safe During International Sports Games in Unsafe Cities or Countries2," If you're already on site, contact your consulate or embassy to ask them for advice. They will be best placed to assist you.


Register your travel and contact details with your consulate if they provide this facility. This will help them locate you in the event of an emergency.
If your foreign affairs department or consulate provides travel updates via email, be sure to subscribe to these.

, As with any travel, it pays to keep in mind the methods for staying safe, such as:


Wearing a money belt, not carrying enormous amounts of cash on you, and dividing your finances between plastic, traveler's checks, cash, and bank funds.






Only visit places that are known to be safe for tourists. Don't wander off the beaten track. Tourist meccas can be unsafe in times of unrest, however. They might be targeted for terrorist activities, so avoid gathering anywhere that attracts large numbers of tourists.






Don't draw attention to yourself. Dress modestly and try to blend in with the locals.






Maintain curfews. If you are visiting somewhere that is unsafe, it pays to be off the streets before it gets too late in the evening. A self-imposed curfew of being indoors before dark makes good sense when there is unrest at night.






Try to meet up with some trusted locals. If you know people in the country or city, try to connect with them and have them take you to events. Their local knowledge will be invaluable, as well as the fact that they'll be keeping updated with local news on any relevant events.






Be sure that you have had all your vaccinations and that they're up to date. If an outbreak of a disease is the major concern, talk to your doctor.







, Beware of any suspicious activities around you and get clear of them. Monitor your surroundings constantly and don't do anything to provoke people.


Monitor the media constantly and keep checking your foreign affairs' site for travel advisory updates.






Know the uniform, transportation and logos of official security (police, army, etc.) in the country you're in. This will help you to identify the authorities quickly if needed.







, Have police, fire, and ambulance numbers for the city or country you're in, as well as your consulate or embassy numbers and your hotel number (or the numbers of friends you know locally). In addition, have the numbers of family, your foreign affairs department back in your home country, your insurance agency, your credit card company, and your airline.


Keep all numbers neatly written down or printed in one place, on a small laminated card if possible. Try to make several copies for different bags and pockets that you carry with you and leave in your luggage as well. If you have a phone that travels, add these numbers to it, as well as keeping some numbers in an email or online document that can be easily retrieved.

, In part, you can gauge the safety or otherwise of certain activities by their usual standard of safety. Reading tourist guidebooks will tell you some of the more pertinent safety information. For example:


Is public transportation always a risky business or is it usually safe and efficient?
Is eating out in certain areas safe or dangerous?
Is it safe to travel alone? To travel alone as a woman? To travel as a group?
What areas are known for pick-pocketing, hustlers, thieves, etc.?
Where do the guidebooks recommend that you never go for the sake of safety?

, You might not be allowed to carry anything that could be used as a weapon, or any camera or computer equipment, large bags, any alcohol, etc. It's wise to check out lists of prohibited items on the website of the relevant sporting body holding the event, as often there will not be any storage facilities provided for items you've brought along that are prohibited.

"
"
Keep your things close by.,
Hide electronics and expensive items.,
Sit in the middle of the backseat.,
Have your keys ready.",How to Stay Safe when Traveling by Taxi2," When you're riding in a taxi, the further away from you your belongings are, the more likely they are to get lost or stolen. If you have a large suitcase it might not be possible to keep it with you, but try to place it somewhere in the cab where you can keep an eye on it.If the cab has a trunk that locks, ask to put your suitcase there. Watch the cab driver place your suitcase in the trunk and make sure he closes the trunk door completely before you get in the car.
Don't part with smaller bags, backpacks, or purses – especially if they have your wallet or cash inside them. The best place for these items is on the floor between your feet. For additional security, you can loop the strap around your leg.
Don't allow your belongings to be stowed on the exterior of the cab, such as on an overhead rack, as they can easily be stolen.

, If you are carrying items such as your mobile phone, a tablet, or a laptop computer, make sure they are well hidden before you get into the cab, and keep them out of sight the entire trip.You may not think of these things as all that valuable or expensive, especially if they are commonplace in your home country, but they make you a target for thieves.
If at all possible, transfer such items to a bag you will keep with you, if you are carrying them in a larger suitcase that must be stored in the trunk.

, In the middle of the backseat you are less vulnerable to passers-by who might mug or assault you. This also keeps your belongings, which you have on the floor between your feet, out of arm's reach.No matter how tempting it might be, keep your windows rolled up at all times. This may mean the cab becomes stuffy or overheated, but with the windows down someone can easily reach in and assault or rob you.
These precautions are particularly important if you are a woman who is traveling alone. Almost anywhere in the world, a woman traveling alone is vulnerable to opportunistic criminals.

, When you get out of the cab, you don't want to be fumbling for your keys or anything else you might need at your destination. Having everything ready to go makes you less vulnerable to street crime.Being organized and ready also shows that you are confident and in control. This makes you less likely to be targeted for an attack.
Keys threaded between your fingers also can be used for self-defense in the event you are assaulted or approached in a way that makes you uncomfortable.

"

Review maps of the area.,
Let someone know you are traveling.,
Avoid traveling alone if intoxicated.,
Keep conversation strictly professional.,
Pay attention to local currency.,
Be familiar with emergency numbers.,
Keep your phone close at hand.",How to Stay Safe when Traveling by Taxi3," If you're completely unfamiliar with an area, you're more likely to be taken advantage of. This can impact your safety as well as costing you more money than you anticipated.For example, if the taxi driver knows that you don't know anything about the area, they may take you on a long, meandering route to run up the fare.
However, in most countries if you give the driver a specific route they must follow it.
If the taxi driver goes in the wrong direction, or tries to take you on a different route or argue about which way to go, thank them for their time and exit the cab immediately.

, Maintain your safety by ensuring that someone else knows when you are getting in the cab and approximately how long your trip will take – even if that person isn't local.If someone knows you're in a cab, they'll know that if they don't hear from you within a certain amount of time that something might have happened to you. They can take steps to call the appropriate authorities.
If you are meeting someone at your destination, call or text them when you leave so they know when to expect you and can take action if you don't show up on time.

, When you are intoxicated, you are vulnerable – especially if you are in a strange location far from home. This vulnerability is intensified if you're traveling in an area where you aren't fluent in the local language.Protect yourself by not consuming alcohol if you are traveling alone, unless you are in your hotel or other protected place and won't need go anywhere.
If you do have alcohol – say, a couple of glasses of wine at dinner – drink a cup of coffee to sober up a little before your taxi arrives. Don't tell the cab driver that you've been drinking.

, Women in particular should avoid any sort of personal conversation with the cab driver. It can be difficult, particularly if you're on a long ride, not to engage in small talk. However, you will be safer the less the cab driver knows about you personally.If the cab driver asks you personal questions, you can simply say ""I don't feel comfortable talking about that."" Remember that you are under no obligation to talk to your cab driver.
You also can tell the cab driver initially that you are not interested in carrying on a conversation. Tell them that you've had a long day and you simply want silence.

, Unscrupulous cab drivers who've pegged you for a foreigner may attempt to pass off counterfeit or out-of-date currency as the real thing when giving you your change.Learn about the local currency before you travel to an area, and know what to look for. If the cab driver gives you currency that you suspect is fake, ask them to exchange the bills. If they refuse, call the cab service immediately.

, If you're traveling in a foreign country, make sure you know what number to call if the cab ride takes a turn for the worse and you need assistance from law enforcement.Ideally, you should program this number in your phone so you can call it as quickly as possible if the need arises.

, While you should take care to hide expensive electronics, your phone also is a safety line. If trouble arises or you sense danger, you need to be able to get to your phone quickly.If you have your phone in your hand, keep it lowered at lap level so no one on the street can see it.
Don't put your phone in your back pocket so that you're sitting on it. This can make it difficult to get out in an emergency situation.
If your phone is in a front pocket, make sure the pocket is deep enough that your phone won't slip out when you sit down.

Time your journey.,
Find an optimal time of year.,
Find a cheap flight to get there.,
Decide how you will travel through the country.,
Plan your overnight stays.",How to Travel Around Portugal," Portugal is fairly small in terms of area. However, because of its shape (the coastline is 1,214 km (754 mi) long), distances to travel are substantial. Major points of interest (Lisbon, Porto, the Algarve) lie along the coast. Plan at least a week to visit the most interesting spots; two weeks will be optimal!
, The summers in Portugal can be really hot. In July and August, the average temperature is around 28 °C (82 °F), often exceeding 35 degrees. Moreover, most tourists come in the summer, which makes the beaches as well as the monuments really crowded. Consider coming in Spring (April-May) or in Fall (September-October). The temperatures are optimal for both beach vacation as well as city tours, and you will not have to stumble upon thousands of tourists.

, The three major airports are located in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. You can easily fly to one of them with one of the low cost airlines: Lisbon is operated by Easyjet and Germanwings, Porto and Faro by Ryanair. A one-way ticket from London to Porto will cost you only around 35 Euro!

, There are train and coach connections across the main cities and the Algarve. For both trains as well as coaches the price of a one way long distance ticket (e.g. Lisbon to the Algarve) is around 20 Euro. If you wish to travel more independently, rent a campervan, which will allow you to travel without having to think about tourist infrastructure or timetables. The price of such a camper van is around 60 Euro for four people per day.


Another option is rent a private car. Particularly the south of Portugal is a great place to go on a roadtrip with countless wild Atlantic beach coastline.

, Lisbon is well-known for its high quality/low price hostels. An overnight stay in the center of the city will cost you as little as 10 Euro. Another fair price option is an apartment. You can easily find them on AirBNB and Housetrip. If you opt for the campervan, you can stay in more secluded places such as directly at the beaches.

If you pack basically everything you own thinking you will need it you will be adding too much weight to your bag. You also want to lessen the chances of losing stuff while on vacation.


Only pack what you'll absolutely need. If you're going to the beach or will be staying in a hotel with a pool pack two bathing suits, sunscreen, 1-2 towels, a hat, and sunglasses. If you are going somewhere for just a weekend pack 3 shirts, 3 pairs of pants/shorts, 4 bras (if you're a girl), 4-5 pairs of underwear, and pads (once again- if you're a dude this does not apply to you). If you're going somewhere for a week maybe double this amount. If you're going somewhere for a month or more do the math.;
,


If it is only a matter of a few days between booking and travel date, research the upcoming weather for the location.

,, In your carry on take your cell phone, charger, iPod, book, journal, whatever. Also bring headphones and some cash.

, If you're going somewhere where people speak a different language than you make sure you know the language at least a little or else it will turn into an awkward situation.

, It will not be very fun if you do and you want this trip to go as smoothly as possible, right?

It also pays to know any travel advisories so you can decide whether or not to pursue the trip.;
, This will determine a whole lot of other things, including your budget. From here, you can also predetermine if the trip is feasible, considering you have a family to attend to, a business to run, or a job to take care thereafter.

, Indicate the places, activities, and costs and chart them on a time-line based on step two. This will help you stick to your schedule and budget, thus eliminating side-trips you can't afford time- and money-wise.

, You may ask the help of a travel agent to help you with these. A detailed map is also a helpful document to bring.

, If you can apply for a travel loan, great. If you have ready cash, better. Canada's currency is the Canadian dollar, but US dollar and other primary currencies can easily be exchanged or traded. Credit cards and debit cards are also widely accepted. There are also quite a number of banks that process international fund transfers and withdrawals.

, The inclusive dates of your trip and the places you want to visit will guide you on what clothes to bring. Bring one set each for day trips, night outs, church visits, swimming, etc. Pack light - in small amounts/quantities. If you have the penchant for adventure, do not bring everything but do some quick shopping in Canada for toiletries and additional clothes shortly after you've arrived. Also, bring your medications and a first-aid kit.

, A poorly designed bag will be difficult to handle or uncomfortable to carry. Bring a check-in bag with wheels or something that is easy to carry around, as well as a bag or two you can use as carry-on. Place inside your carry-on bags essential toiletries, medicines, snacks, and entertainment stuff like toys and books, especially if you bring your kids with you.

, This way, you can avail of discounts and promos, as well as select the best seat. It is also possible to buy tickets at the last minute, as they are cheaper, although a good seat may not be guaranteed available.

, Choose where you're going to stay. If you're visiting Canada for shopping, city life or business trip, then it's best that you get a hotel at the heart of the metropolis. If you're visiting Canada for outdoor adventures like trekking, fishing, etc. a resort, inn or cabin near these activities is ideal.

, Decide how you want to go sightseeing - whether by public transport, for-hire car or others. If you want to hire and drive a vehicle, be sure you have an international driver's license with you. If possible, get a GPS-equipped car.

, If everyone at home goes with you, decide how you are going to keep your house secure while you're away. Make sure you have installed and activated the needed alarms and security systems. Have your pets cared for by neighbors or friends.

, These precautionary measures can be a blessing when untoward incidents happen.

, You will also be able to do a little research and see what kind of sites there are along the road you are going. Once you have figured out the direction you are heading on your road trip it will be easier for you to pack accordingly. You might need flip flops in one place and then sneakers in the next. You’ll want to be prepared for wherever you go.

, Most importantly, before you hit the open road you should get your used car inspected. Get the oil changed, rotate the wheels, possibly get the tires changed, have the brakes checked and make sure you have a good battery. The last thing you want on any road trip is your used car breaking down in the middle of nowhere.

, After all, what’s a road trip without snacks? Try to pack food that everyone likes. If you are bringing your kids, for instance, consider packing foods they enjoy, such as peanut butter sandwiches and ants on a log. You could also stop at fast food restaurants along the way, such as McDonalds and Burger King. Be sure not to do this too much, though, as fast food is very unhealthy and can sometimes contain trans fats.

, This is an important step, as knowing about the forecast will help you in deciding what to pack. For example, if it is winter in your destination, pack warm clothes such as a jacket, and remember to layer up.

, Road trips can get boring, especially if they are long, and the trip could be even more boring for kids. Try electronics and DVD players, along with books, and many other types of entertainment you love.

, Even on our most relaxing and enjoyable vacations, there is always the chance of an emergency ruining your trip (but it can be an even worse situation if you're unprepared), so it is important to pack essentials you might need. These essentials might include:


Water bottles
Blanket
Whistle
Jumper cable
Duct tape
A first-aid kit

, By having activities planned beforehand, everyone will be entertained and your trip won't turn into a boring stay at your hotel/campsite/cottage/rental home. These activities include swimming, hiking, and going to museums. Be sure to bring a camera and take some pictures, too!

, Summer is one of your only chances to relax and unwind from priorities such as school and work. It's important that you have a great time and enjoy your special getaway from town.

Understand the differences between soft law and hard law in the international law context.,
Consider that soft law is often preferable to doing nothing at all.,
Check the issue itself.,
Look to see how the political consensus is progressing.,
Consider whether there is scientific uncertainty.,
Question whether there are any ""free riders"" trying to get benefits without doing their part.,
Check the possibility of soft law being used to resolve ambiguities.,
Consider other constraints.",How to Understand Why Countries Choose Soft Law," Read How to know the difference between soft law and hard law for more information.;
, A country or group of countries may decide that it is preferable to make aspirational statements about a matter that needs dealing with globally than to simply ignore the matter or let it slide into the hands of non-state players instead. Soft law can serve as a way of notifying everyone that the countries in question are paying attention and intend to get around to doing something more concrete in the near or distant future.

, If the issue at hand is one that requires a fast response time, soft law may be the best way to get things started. For example, a fishery that is declining rapidly may need immediate response, something that a fully negotiated and binding treaty won't bring about for years given all the formalities needing to be met with a treaty. A soft law instrument is fast to adopt, and it can contain technical measures that motivate and give a green light to states getting on with any measures they want to put into place. At the same time, there is no necessity placed on those states unable to help out for technical, financial, political, or other reasons.


Soft law is an excellent choice for frequently changing technical or environmental situations because revisions are likely to be frequent.

, The slower and more cantankerous the process of political consensus, the more likely soft law is to be used because it can work around a lack of consensus and at least allow those interested states to begin working on issues while at the same time aiming to convince other states to come on board and eventually create a binding instrument and obligations.


In this case, soft law buys time to meet disagreements and competing viewpoints while still encouraging actions to be taken.

, This is another reason why soft law gets used; when the science isn't certain or is evolving, soft law can build a framework that can be built upon as scientific certainty begins to firm. In the meantime, states aren't committing to something solid but they are indicating a willingness to remain receptive to the possibilities that the science is revealing.

, Soft law is often resorted to where states have big concerns that some states will benefit from a binding agreement while other states are giving up benefits, thereby enhancing the position of the free rider state at the expense of the other states. Soft law allows ""wriggle room"" while at the same time it can enable more motivated states to spend time persuading potential free riders that being involved in a collaborative way is in their interests.


Soft law can overcome the objections of a few states that are responsible for a problem. The international pressure can then begin to increase on those states as it becomes clearer that those states that are conforming to the desired pathway out of voluntary commitment are beginning to reflect the desired norm for all countries.
As time goes on, even though soft law commitments are essentially ""toothless"", they carry much aspirational and fairer world value. This can lead citizens, NGOs, civil society, and other non-state actors to start demanding that their own country or other countries fall into line and make the commitments obligatory. This can be a powerful force if used persuasively and with concerted effort. With the increasing reach of social media, this may become an even more evident practice.

, Sometimes there is a binding treaty in place but its text contains ambiguities or gaps. Rather than going through the long-winded process of amending the treaty or even passing a new one to fix this, soft law can be used to infill the gaps and to clarify. MOUs, principles, standards, instruments, etc., are commonly used soft law responses to this type of problem.

, It may simply be that a state has no other alternative than to turn to soft law. For example, international organizations do not tend to have the power to adopt binding texts but they still need to function from day-to-day.

Look to treaties first.,
Be careful to ensure that your country has signed and ratified the treaty in question before applying it to your domestic situation.,
Consider custom.,
Be aware of the concept of General Principles of Law.,
Read Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.,
Note that in the last example the ""subsidiary sources"" are not sources of international law in their own right but are influential in elucidating the content and interpretation of treaties and customary international law.

,
Learn these sources well in conjunction with their limitations as sources.",How to Find Sources of International Law," Treaties are the main source of international law. Treaties can go by various names, such as international agreements, conventions, protocols etc. but they are in essence the same thing - a written international agreement concluded between two or more countries.;
, Signature is only an indication of intent by a country to be bound to the treaty. Ratification is the point at which a country accepts its legal obligations under the treaty. Treaties only come into force when a specified number of countries have ratified it. Once in force, however, a treaty serves as a principal source of international law.

, Custom comes into play when a country follows a law or legal principle consistently and uniformly in its everyday conduct, so as to indicate ""state practice"" (conduct). When this occurs, it tells the rest of the international community that this country is acting as if the international law or principle binds it. While a very useful source of international law (treaties often build on the foundation stones of custom), it can be very hard to establish universal practice. The Law of the Sea is a good example of state practice that is established and some that is not considered established. In addition, be aware that there is one principle of customary international law that applies no matter what:



jus cogens - this refers to the rule that there are some laws that can never be violated. While there are few of these rules, the ones that do exist are very important ones, namely, the prohibitions on genocide, slavery and torture.

, These are said to be legal principles that are common to the majority of the world's legal systems. Equity is considered to be one such principle. However, it is important to note that this source of international law is considered to be very much under debate and is frequently questioned. Be aware of it and its limitations.

, Here you will find what international lawyers call ""subsidiary sources"" of international law:Judicial decisions - although not a requirement to do so, international courts aim to follow the previous decisions of their own court and other international courts and tribunals. If they do follow precedent in this way, it may evidence growing acceptance of a principle or concept of international law.

Writings of publicists - merely influential in the case of the writer being ""highly influential"" in the relevant international field. Generally cited in international courts.

,, That way, you will be able to write a coherent and convincing defence of international law in an exam or article.

Determine how nations are required to to conform to international law.,
Assess how international law interacts with municipal law.",How to Distinguish International Law from Municipal Law," When questions and conflicts arise in the relationships between sovereign nations, they are solved under the rules of public international law. This body of law consists of the treaties and legal decisions interpreting those treaties.International law assumes that all the parties, as sovereign states, are equals.
Conflicts arising under public international law can be settled either through diplomatic negotiations or in the International Court of Justice.This is the court of the United Nations. Fifteen judges, elected by the UN General Assembly, use international legal precedent to issue advisory opinions and solve legal disputes between governments.The International Court of Justice has jurisdiction in two types of cases. The first is where the two countries agree to submit the conflict to the court. The second is when a treaty specifies the court as the legal authority over disputes.;
, When citizens of different states have a legal dispute, there is often a question about what law applies. This choice of law question in civil issues, ranging from contracts to family law, is discussed in the Hague Conference on Private International Law.In general, courts will first defer to any contract or agreement clauses that identify what courts will have jurisdiction.In the absence of explicit choice of law language, the court will look to the overall circumstances of the contract, the behavior of the parties in creating the contract (called parol evidence) and if the parties can agree on jurisdiction.

, The customary international lawis codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.Under this custom, states consistently adhere to certain practices out historical and legal obligation., In common usage, especially in the United States, municipal or municipality, refers to a city or town. However, in the realm of international law, municipal refers to any sovereign entity, including countries, states, counties, provinces, cities, and towns. In short, municipal refers to the internal law of a sovereign government., There are two primary forms of municipal, or domestic, law. The first is civil law, composed of the statutory law and regulations to administer those laws.Statutes are passed either by the legislative bodies of the state or by popular vote.Domestic law is also formed by the common law, which is law handed down by the lower and upper courts of the country.Common types of municipal law are criminal statutes, traffic laws, and government regulations. Basically, municipal law regulates the relationship of citizens with the government.

, Civil and common law are enforced in very different ways. For example, law enforcement agencies, ranging from local police to the federal investigative branches, have jurisdiction over civil criminal statutes. On the other hand, most common law, often called judge-made law, is referred to during legal issues such as contract law or disputes between domestic businesses., There are no international statutes. The United Nations agrees on conventions that member nations may choose to ratify and abide by, but there is no international governmental body. International law is created by treaty, by custom, and by agreements between nations. This is in stark contrast to the legislative process that creates the internal municipal laws of nations and states.


International treaties are legally binding agreements between nations. In a nation like the United States, a treaty is an agreement ratified by Congress. Once it has been ratified, it holds the same status as federal legislation (i.e., statutes). Therefore, treaties can mean different things depending on the nation or international body discussing them.An example of a treaty is the Treaty of Versailles, which was the peace settlement signed after World War I.International agreements are usually less formal than treaties, although the international community often sees them on the same level as treaties. In the United States, an international agreement does not need to be ratified by Congress and they are only applicable in domestic law (i.e., they are not enforceable themselves).An example of an international agreement is the Kyoto Protocol, which sets international emissions reductions with the hope of curbing climate change.International customs are created when a nation generally and consistently adheres to a certain practice due to a sense of legal obligation. They are not necessarily written down and are the least formal of all the sources of international law., There is no police agency with complete international jurisdiction. Even INTERPOL, the organization with 190 member countries, acts only as a coordination agency, passing information and training to municipal police forces.When there is a dispute between nations, the international law is enforced through treaties, United Nations conventions, and the ICJ.


In municipal law legal disputes, the case will be decided based either on the civil laws, in the form of statutes, or by the body of common law in the forum state.

, If the two sides in the legal dispute are sovereign nations, you can assume that international laws, enforcement methods, and dispute resolution will apply. Conversely, if both parties are citizens of the same nation, municipal law enforcement, court systems, and jurisdictional rules will be used to settle the dispute.


When the citizenship is mixed, such as individuals of different countries or an individual in a dispute with a government of another sovereignty, the courts will look to any treaties, UN conventions, or contracts that may shed light on the jurisdiction before agreeing to accept jurisdiction.

, Many people in the international community see international and municipal law as two separate entities. These people would say each system regulates separate subject matters and each exists in its own sphere. They would say international law regulates the conduct of states and their interactions with one another. On the other hand, they would say municipal law regulates the conduct of people within a sovereign state.


If you are a dualist, you would likely say the two barely interact at all. However, if they do, it would usually be when municipal law is recognizing and incorporating the rules of international law. Therefore, the national law would have supremacy over the international law. In case of conflict between international and municipal law, a national court would apply municipal law., Monists believe international law and municipal law are all part of one legal system. To them, both laws are based on the same premise, which is regulating the conduct of people and things.


If you are a monist, international law will trump municipal law, even in national courts., While nations are under a general obligation to follow international law, there is usually a great amount of leeway in how they choose to do so. Nations are generally free to decide how they incorporate international law into municipal law. While different nations handle this issue in different manners, the prevailing position seems to be dualist. Therefore, most nations require the formal integration of international law through the passage of some municipal law., In the international sphere, international law wins out over municipal law. However, municipal law is useful evidence of international customary law and general principles of law. In addition, international law often leaves questions to be answered by a nation's own laws. Therefore, if you found yourself in international court, you might use municipal law to help you decide whether there has been a breach of international law. An international court may even look to municipal law to help them interpret international law.


In the municipal (i.e., national) sphere, the interaction is more difficult to assess. In general, less formal international agreements and customs are accepted and followed so long as there is no conflict with municipal law. If there is a conflict, municipal law will usually win. However, more formal treaties, so long as they are self-executing (i.e., operate within a nation automatically), are usually seen as being on par with municipal law. However, some nations take different views."

Learn the rhyme that tells the queens’ fates.,
Rhyme “wedded” with “beheaded.” Another poem runs: “King Henry VIII, to six wives he was wedded.,
Rhyme the queens’ first names.",How to Remember Henry VIII's Wives1," “Divorced, beheaded, died; Divorced, beheaded, survived.” This ditty has been memorized by generations of British schoolchildren.It is not strictly accurate. The marriages to Catherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves legally ended in annulment, not divorce. And both Anne of Cleves and Katherine Parr survived the king, in the sense of outliving him.;
, One died, one survived, two divorced, two beheaded.” This version is inaccurate in the use of the term divorced, which should really be annulled. It also doesn’t tell you the order of the queens. However, it has a catchy meter and is easy to remember.

, “Kate and Anne and Jane, and Anne and Kate (again, again!)”For this poem, it helps to adopt an English accent, so that Jane rhymes with again. Note that “again, again” is a reminder that there are two “Kates” at the end of the list: Catherine Howard followed by Katherine Parr.

Use a phrase that sounds like the queens’ names.",How to Remember Henry VIII's Wives2," The most widely cited version runs: All Boys Should Come Home Please. If you remember this, you can remember: Aragon Boleyn Seymour Cleves Howard Parr.

, This version runs: A Big Secret Concealing Her Past. It is easy to remember because of all the drama connected with the lives – and deaths – of Henry’s wives. Think about Anne Boleyn scheming to rise the ranks in the palace and get close to the king. Or imagine Catherine Howard, cousin to the dead Anne, carrying on her affair behind the king’s back.

, This is a rarer mnemonic but a good one: Arrogant Anne Seemed More Clever at How to Catch the Ring. Arrogant sounds like Aragon; Anne is Anne Boleyn; Seemed More sounds like Seymour; Clever is like Cleves; How to sounds like Howard; and Catch is like Katherine Parr. It has the benefit, too, of being historically accurate. Anne Boleyn was certainly arrogant and interested in catching the wedding ring.

Catherine of Aragon came from Spain to marry Henry’s brother, Arthur.Arthur soon died, however.,
Anne Boleyn, already pregnant, married Henry in 1533.,
Jane Seymour finally gave Henry a son.,
Anne of Cleves came from Germany to enter into a brokered diplomatic marriage in 1540.,
Catherine Howard was yet another doomed lady-in-waiting.,
Katherine Parr was Henry VIII’s last wife but only the second to outlive him.",How to Remember Henry VIII's Wives3," It’s much easier to remember the order and fates of Henry VIII’s wives if you know a little bit about their lives. That way, they’re real people, not just a list of names.

, Henry and Catherine married in 1509.


Catherine of Aragon had one child, a daughter, who would reign as Mary I (also known as “Bloody Mary”).
Henry’s first marriage was also his longest, lasting from 1509 until 1533.
Desperate for a son, Henry sought an annulment, claiming that the marriage was invalid because Catherine had been married to Arthur. When the pope refused, Henry broke with the Catholic Church, declared himself head of the church in England, and arranged for his own annulment.

, They had been having an affair while she served as one of Queen Catherine’s ladies in waiting.Anne, too, had just one child, another daughter, who would become the famous queen Elizabeth I.
After several miscarriages, Henry decided to end this marriage, too, on the pretext that Anne was having an affair with another man.
Anne was tried for treason and beheaded in 1536.

, Like Anne, she had been a lady-in-waiting who caught the king’s eye.In 1537, she gave birth to Edward, who would reign only briefly before his early death.
Jane Seymour died just days after giving birth, plunging the king into grief.

, Henry found her unattractive. What was even worse, the diplomatic situation shifted and made the marriage less advantageous.Anne of Cleves co-operated in arranging the annulment of the marriage. She outlived Henry by a decade, dying at her castle in 1557.

, At the age of just nineteen, she married Henry only days after his previous marriage was annulled in 1540.Catherine Howard was Anne Boleyn’s first cousin, and she shared her fate. She was caught having an affair with Thomas Culpeper and was beheaded for treason in 1542.

, They married in 1543, just four years before the king’s death.Learned and pious, Katherine sought to reinforce the Protestant Reformation.
Katherine was the first woman and Queen of England to publish a book under her own name. She would publish another after the death of King Henry.
She remarried after his death to Sir Thomas Seymour; uncle to King Edward VI.
After giving birth to her only child, christened Lady Mary (after her royal stepsister), Katherine died five days later on September 5th, 1548.
Katherine's tomb at Sudeley Castle, which features an elaborate effigy, is the most ornate tomb out of all of Henry's wives.

Note whether the agreement creates or uses an independent international organization.",How to Know the Difference Between Soft Law and Hard Law (International Law)," One simplistic distinction between soft law and hard law states that hard law is legally binding, while soft law is not. This distinction can lead scholars into a semantic debate over whether any agreement that isn’t legally binding can rightfully be called a law. Nonetheless, some types of agreements are automatically considered hard law.Treaties are a prime example of an agreement traditionally considered hard law by default. When countries ratify a treaty, if they have national laws that contradict the treaty, they are obligated to change those laws to comport with the treaty.
The U.S. considers treaties legally binding both internationally and domestically. After the Senate ratifies a treaty, Congress passes any federal law necessary to comply with its terms.UN Security Council resolutions legally bind all UN members under the power vested in the Council under Article 25 of the UN Charter. ;
, A high level of legal obligation indicates an international agreement probably is a harder law, depending on other factors.


Since international contracts advance the interests of the countries that sign them, those countries may have little motivation to breach the contract. In recognition of that fact, the agreement itself may not have much language indicating its legally binding nature.
Sometimes treaties that deal with human rights or other normative principles are called “covenants.” These agreements typically are legally binding to the same extent as treaties, although they may lack centrally enforced legal obligations.A country may sign a treaty, but lodge a formal reservation to certain provisions. The reservation decreases that country’s legal obligation in relation to the specific provision with which it disagrees.International agreements that are not considered legally binding at all are soft law. Often these agreements contain conditions or escape clauses that allow the countries signing them to declare a common commitment to certain principles while retaining their own sovereignty and independence., Regardless of whether an international agreement is legally binding, if a large number of countries are on board with its principles, they may exert political pressure on other countries to comply.


Some international law may be legally binding on some countries but not others. For example, a decision handed down by the European Court of Human Rights is only legally binding on the countries involved in that particular case. However, that same decision may help sway the opinion of another court or international organization faced with a similar case.Soft law may set forth broad principles on which there is multinational agreement, although the countries disagree on the particulars. These softer agreements can serve as the foundation for harder agreements in the future.A country that agrees with a treaty in principle, but cannot complete the ratification process, may nevertheless adopt domestic legislation that complies with the overall thrust of the treaty.

, Generally, a harder law will have a high degree of precision, while a softer law will use more vague generalities or appeals to ideals and broad moral or ethical principles.


Describing commitments in precise terms ensures participating countries understand the limits of their obligations, and prevents self-serving or opportunistic behavior in the future. 
Harder laws also use precise language in outlining conditions or exceptions to obligations. This helps avoid the possibility that one country could take advantage of a loophole to undermine the purpose of the agreement.

, Verbs such as “will” or “must” tell you someone is being required to do something, while verbs such as “may” or “can” tell you someone is allowed to do something.


Harder laws include demands or obligations with which participating countries must comply. Typically the agreement applies sanctions or other punishment to countries that don’t fulfill their obligations under the agreement by a certain date.
In contrast, softer laws typically list a number of things participating countries are permitted to do within the confines of the agreement, but do not require them to do anything in particular.
If the agreement includes promises from participating countries to investigate an issue or conduct feasibility studies within a period of time, but does not require the implementation of any concrete measures, these are soft law provisions.

, International law documents use operative language that diplomats, heads of state, and other government or industry leaders will have to interpret. The length and specificity of definitions are crucial to determining the relative hardness or softness of the law.


Softer laws leave broad terms open to interpretation, while harder laws contain extensive descriptions of what is being regulated. An example of a lengthy description in hard law can be found in the European Union’s directive defining allowable ingredients in fruit jams, jellies and similar spreads, which runs 12 pages.Not all hard laws have such detailed definitions. For example, the European Convention on Human Rights leaves a number of key terms, such as what constitutes ""inhuman and degrading treatment"" open to interpretation. This allows a degree of flexibility in dealing with situations national leaders couldn't have contemplated when they drafted the agreement.Defining a term as narrowly as possible limits the ability of countries to argue for a self-serving interpretation in the future, and eliminates gray areas. However, countries may construct a softer law with the full intention of allowing differing interpretations to coexist as long as they all agree on the same overall concept.

, Harder laws typically delegate the authority for interpretation of the agreement to an independent third body, while softer laws leave interpretation up to participating countries.


Independent bodies that produce binding interpretation and settlement of disputes are most common in international organizations, and their decisions are binding on member countries. For example, the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea resolves disputes between countries under the 1982 Convention on the Law of the Sea.
Often, decisions of these international courts are only binding on the parties involved in that particular dispute. , Because of the complex interplay between international law and state sovereignty, even the hardest laws often are lacking in strong enforcement provisions.


Under the UN Charter, countries can seek authorization from the Security Council to enforce international agreements using collective armed force. This is the strongest enforcement mechanism available in international law.
Realist legal scholars point to the lack of enforcement measures in international law to argue that all international law is inherently soft.

,


International governing bodies such as the European Union tend to have the strongest enforcement powers. The EU also has its own government institutions.
Harder laws often establish their own institutions to interpret and enforce the agreement. For example, the European Convention on Human Rights is interpreted and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights."

Note that there is a general obligation of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex provided for in several key UN instruments.,
Read the relevant Articles outlined in the step above.,
Read CEDAW.,
Note that there are quite a number of other relevant international instruments that cover more specific areas of interest and concern to women.,
Check regional conventions also.,
Consider soft law options as well.",How to Find International Sources of Protection Against Discrimination on the Grounds of Gender," These include:


The United Nations Charter, Articles 1(3), 55 and 56
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948 (UDHR), Articles 1 and 2
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights1966 (ICCPR), Articles 2, 3 and 26
The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights 1966 (ICESCR), Articles 2 and 3;
, You will find a relative consistency across the Articles in terms of the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of sex. This principle is considered to be customary international law and as such, is binding on all countries, whether or not they have signed relevant treaties. It is important to note that most countries are a part of the United Nations and are therefore bound by the UN Charter.

, CEDAW stands for the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. This convention has been signed by over 160 countries. The explicit objective of CEDAW is to support the principle of the elimination of discrimination between women and men and the achievement of women's equality. It provides the basis for achieving equality between women and men by ensuring that women have equal access to, and equal opportunities in, political and public life. In addition, it supports the rights of women in education, health and employment. Under CEDAW, countries who are parties to the agreement must take all appropriate measures to ensure that women can enjoy all their human rights and fundamental freedoms.

, These instruments do not always have a human rights approach but as a whole, the additional treaties support the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of sex. Many of these instruments can be found in ILO (International Labour Organisation) Conventions which are concerned with employment, maternity protection, equal pay, part-time work and work from home. In addition, a range of other instruments of importance for protecting women's human rights include conventions dealing with human trafficking, refugees, slavery, education, marriage, racial discrimination, torture, rights of the child and migrants, amongst others.

, There may be conventions made at a regional level that are applicable to your country. Examples that are supportive of women's human rights include the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights, 1981 and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, 1950. Both these treaties prohibit discrimination on the grounds of sex.

, Although soft law instruments are not binding, they are very influential and indicative of country intentions in the relevant field. In the area of protecting women's human rights, relevant non-binding but key instruments include:


The Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Violence Against Women, 1993
The Beijing Platform for Action, 1995
The Beijing +5 Outcome Document, 2000

During summer, it can get very hot and humid, about 86°F (30ºC), and extremely crowded, due to the coastal location and numerous cultural events taking place in September, both of which are strong tourist draws.;
, Barcelona has multiple accommodation possibilities. You can choose from many reliable travel agencies to accommodate all your needs or you can simply reserve your room and travel insurance online. The beach hotels have a lot of seaview rooms with balconies, pools and spas to make the most of your experience in Barcelona.

Museum Nacional d'Art de Catalunya (MNAC): With the best Romanic paintings in the world, this museum preserves the wall frescoes of a great part of the Romanic churches in the Pyrenees (els Pirineus).
Museum Picasso: The museum is located in a medieval palace on Montcada Street (Via Montcada), 15-23 in the Gothic area. Inside you will discover a magnificent compilation of early Picasso paintings. Both oils and drawings displayed in this permanent collection span the artist's years, both his formative periods and his later, more illustrious periods. The entire collection (over 3,500 works) includes 24 masterpieces such as Man in a Baret, The Divan, Margot or the Period of Waiting, and Blanquita Suarez just to name a few.
Fundació Miró: Located in a good modern building from Sert, you'll find a wide sample of Joan Miró works.

Roman period: Roman walls, 4 remaining columns of the Temple at Centre excursionista, Museu d'història de la Ciutat (walk underground through the Roman past).
Gothic period: Santa Maria del Mar (best Gothic church), Plaça del Rei, Saló del Tinell, Drassanes, Catedral, Santa Maria del Pi, Llotja de Barcelona, Hospital de la Santa Creu, streets within Barri Gòtic (Gothic ward).

, From Forum to Barceloneta, they are all fine, but always crowded in summer. That's the only standing rule on Barcelona beaches and Barcelona beach hotels, especially with its sunshiny weather all year round. This is one place where the beaches are teeming with non-stop action especially with the opening of the city to the sea, a project first undertaken in the 1980s.


The redeveloped seafront, from the Moll de la Fusta and the area around the Palau de Mar to the Rambla de Mar and the Olympic Port area, has become one of Barcelona's most popular spaces for recreation and leisure.

, If you are in search of an enjoyable night out on the town, the big problem lies in choosing what would be most to your liking from among all that Barcelona has to offer. In a nutshell, Barcelona nights are all about fun, fun, fun, and one can simply go insane just ticking off the choices on how to achieve it in one night. Even the most hedonistic person's standards for pleasure and enjoying the night away will be challenged in this great city!


El Raval is Barcelona's most diverse area with a mixture of cultures and atmospheres. It was much neglected until recently, but it is full of small, hip bars.
El Born and La Ribera, two of the trendiest areas to be in, and sometimes considered one area due to their proximity, combine the romantic aura of the old city with the newly designed interiors of its numerous bars, clubs and restaurants. This area attracts couples and groups in their 30s looking for sophisticated, relaxing, and intimate bars.
Poblenou area: Take some beers at l'Ovella, and after that try Razzmatazz (one of the best clubs in town). Many popular bands, such as the Chemical Brothers, Massive Attack, Coldplay, Blur, and Oasis all played in this hall during their early tours.
Poblenou area, Vila Olímpica area: For nice people, Barcelonans say ""ambient una mica més pijo"". Try the Baja club or Catwalk.
Zona Alta area: Take your first beers at La Borsa (imported beers from worldwide), and after that go to a disco or club in the area. The top is Luz de Gas, where you´ll find people up to 50-year-old men trying to meet 20-year-old girls, and 40-year-old women trying the same with 20-year-old boys. If you want to meet rich socialites, this is the place. For the nicest people, ""Ambient molt pijo"".

Research treaties.,

Find a state’s pronouncements.,
Consult with a law librarian.",How to Determine the Elements of International Custom Under International Law," International customary law should be practiced over time. You should look for this widespread repetition of similar international actions.It isn’t enough that a state did something once. The action must be repeated throughout time. For example, a state might give aid to another country once after a natural disaster. This does not establish a widespread practice of giving aid to countries.
Remember not to confuse international custom with what you would like the law to be. For example, you might think it is irrational that countries haven’t adopted binding agreements to stop climate change. However, there isn’t a general and consistent pattern over time simply because you would like there to be.;
, To qualify as international customary law, a significant number of states must take these actions. Furthermore, the action must not be rejected by a significant number of states.There is no bright-line test. However, you can tell that the clear majority of nations have outlawed the international slave trade.
Silence might be proof that the state agrees with the practice or proof that the practice hasn’t become controversial in a country. Generally, a state must consent to a practice before being bound. However, as an advocate practicing international law, you want to interpret silence in the best possible light. If you are arguing for the recognition of an international custom, then you could claim silence equals tacit agreement.

, Not all widespread acts rise to the level of customary international law. Instead, states must also feel a sense of obligation to act that way.In other words, they must feel that if they violate the custom they will or should face sanction.It’s difficult to determine what states “feel.” However, a state probably feels a sense of obligation not to commit war crimes against civilians because states have been prosecuted in international courts for doing so.
If a state changes its practices, then it might not feel a sense of obligation. For example, a country might have returned artwork stolen during a war. If the country changes its mind and stops returning the art, then it will be difficult to argue they felt a sense of obligation to return the work in the first place.

, You’ll need proof that certain actions are customary, so you should begin searching for these materials. The following are authoritative sources of international custom:treaties
national court decisions
national legislation
diplomatic correspondence
national legal advisor opinions
practices of international organizations, such as the United Nations
decisions of international courts

, To find a treaty, you should check different websites, depending on the country. You can easily find U.S. treaties. However, if you are searching for other nations' treaties, then you’ll need to use different websites. Look for treaties in the following places:United States Statutes at Large (which contains U.S. treaties until 1948)
Treaties in Force from the U.S. Department of State website: https://www.state.gov/www/global/legal_affairs/tifindex.html

Treaty and International Agreements Online, which is part of the Oceana Online website, TIARA

, A nation’s laws include court opinions, legislation, and administrative rules. You might want to research a nation’s laws to find out if it feels a sense of obligation to act a certain way.


To research a nation’s laws, you probably will need to use a law library. Your nearest law library might be at your nearest court house or at a nearby law school. Stop in and check whether you can research.
Columbia University’s Law School has a helpful webpage full of links for regional and national guides. The website is here: http://library.law.columbia.edu/guides/A_Selective_List_of_Guides_to_Foreign_Legal_Research. Click on a country to find helpful links and other information for doing legal research.

, You’ll want to research United Nations resolutions and the legal opinions of different international courts, both of which are helpful for establishing an international custom. You can find this information online.


United Nations resolutions are available at their website: http://research.un.org/en/docs/find/resolutions. You can do a search for words appearing in a resolution’s title.
You can find opinions from international courts at http://worldcourts.com/icc/eng/index.htm. Click on the court you want to research.

, International customary law can be created through official pronouncements from states. These can include the opinion of legal advisors, memoranda, position papers, and oral remarks.For the United States, you can visit the Department of State’s website, which contains speeches, briefings, testimony, and actions taken according to treaties. The website is here: https://www.state.gov/. Click on “Policy Issues” or “Press.”
For other nations, check their Ministry of Foreign Affairs or their State Department. They should have information available on their websites.

, If you have questions about how to find materials, you should stop in and talk with a law librarian. They can identify the search engines to find relevant international legal materials.


Contact your nearest law library to talk with a librarian. Larger law libraries have international law librarians. However, smaller libraries will only have one or two librarians.
Before meeting, take some time to properly identify the potential international custom that you are researching. For example, it’s helpful to tell the librarian that you are researching what qualifies as “torture” in military conflicts. Also tell the librarian what material you have already found on your own.

Each tour of the close can only hold 20 people, and one sets off every 20 minutes, so young children might get bored waiting around.;
, Mary King's Close probably isn't suitable for anyone under the age of twelve.

, The floor is quite uneven and there are lots of hills and stairs to walk up - some which have cobbled ground. Also, make sure they don't slip easily. Don't wear high heels, Ugg boots or flip flops.

, Being underground, it can get very dusty which may set off an asthma attack. Also, some flashing lights are included in the tour, which may be uncomfortable for visitors who suffer from photo sensitive epilepsy. Make sure the staff know if you have either of these conditions so they will be able to get help if needed.

, The underground closes are very tight, and it can be a bit of a squeeze trying to fit the 20 visitors into some of the smaller rooms. That being said, the attraction is inaccessible to pushchairs and wheelchairs.

, Upon arrival, each group of 20 people will be given a character from the 16th century as their tour guide. You will either be assigned 'The Merchant', 'The Foul Clenger', 'The Maid' or 'Mary King's Daughter'. It's important to listen to all the safety precautions they give you - in some rooms, it's unsafe to lean against the walls, and in one, the roof is held up by scaffolding, so listen to all precautions and instructions given to you.

, Some years ago, a Japanese physic named Aiko Gibo came to visit the Close while making a film about Britain's most haunted places, and could barely set foot inside one room for the pain and unhappiness she could feel there: ""I cannot enter this room... it is too strong... there is a child beside me, her little hand is clutching my trouser leg. I... I just cannot go into this room... she was separated from her parents. She wants to go home and see her family... her desire haunts this place very strongly."" Eventually, she was able to cross the threshold, and began communicating with the young girl's spirit. Gibo stated: ""She wants me to ask her mummy why she left her. She didn't know that she had the plague. Her mum lied to her to take her here and then abandoned her, probably to protect her siblings... can you get a small doll for the little girl? She has lost her favourite doll and is heartbroken."" And so, Gibo had a doll brought to comfort the child, who was ""absolutely delighted"" . That doll remains in Annie's room to this day, and ever since then, people from all over the world have been bringing Annie toys, dolls and jewellery. This is not compulsory, but it's a nice thing to do.

Check out the town of Windsor.",How to Visit Windsor Castle in England," Naturally, it helps to have a bit of background information on what you're visiting before you arrive. Windsor Castle is, obviously, a castle. But it isn't just any castle. It is, perhaps, one of the most beautifully preserved castles in all of Britain with a history spanning several centuries. Originally built by William the Conqueror in the 11th century to defend Norman invaded Britain, the castle has since served many purposes. The castle was rebuilt many times, but has been largely unchanged since the nineteenth century. However, in 1992, the castle was subject to a terrible fire which did great damage. Fortunately, repair work was done, and the castle remains a popular tourist attraction.;
, Good news for those of you who are visiting London and would like a nice day trip -- Windsor is only about an hour west of London, and only 15 minutes from Heathrow Airport.


By car: from central London - Follow A4 road towards Kensington and Knightsbridge, merging onto the M4 WEST, towards Heathrow Airport. Take junction 6 to Slough/A355, towards Windsor/A332. Stay left to A355, which becomes A332. Follow signs into Windsor for parking. Parking is £6 for a full day. For exact directions from your location, whether it be a hotel or your home, use Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, Mapquest or your mobile device's mapping service for step-by-step directions.
By train: There are TWO railway stations in Windsor, both near the castle. London Paddington serves Windsor & Eton Central station. Trains from London Paddington change in Slough, then onwards to Windsor Central Station. The other station is Windsor & Eton Riverside station served direct by London Waterloo Station. You can plan your rail journey online at the National Rail website.
By bus: There are various coach companies that provide service to Windsor Castle from London. First Group buses provide service from various points in London to Windsor.

, Like any popular tourist attraction, there is an admissions cost.


Adult: £16.00
Over 60 or Student ID: £14.50
Under 17: £9.50
Under 5: Free
Family: £42.00 (2 adults and 3 under 17s)
Admission costs are reduced when the state apartments are closed.

, From March to October, the castle is open daily from 9:45 am to 5:15 pm. From November to February, the castle is open daily from 9:45 am to 4:15 pm. The castle is closed to the public on all major public holidays.

, You need tickets to enter the castle. Tickets can be purchased online, or by calling their number, both available at the Royal Collection website. Tickets can also be purchased at the castle admissions centre.

, Inside the castle are the magnificent state apartments, which are lavishly decorated rooms used for various state functions. The state apartments may be viewed during open hours and are the highlight of a visit to Windsor Castle.

, The Gothic St George's Chapel, Queen Mary's Dolls' House, and the various art exhibitions that take place throughout the year are all worth the trip to Windsor Castle as well. At an additional cost, there is a guided tour of the state kitchen. Be sure not to miss the Changing of the Guard which takes place at 11:00 am Monday - Saturday from April to the end of July.

, It takes at least 2-3 hours to fully take in the Castle. It's best to allow for a full day in Windsor.

, The aptly named Windsor Castle is clearly the highlight of Windsor, but the town of Windsor itself offers a lot more as well. There are many great restaurants, shops and pubs to check out. In addition, there is also LEGOLAND (a popular amusement park similar to the one in California), the Royal Windsor Wheel (a large Ferris wheel), the 20 kilometers (12 mi) long Windsor Great Park, and riverboat cruises on the lovely Thames River.

Food at the airport, however, can be notoriously overpriced. Try to eat before you leave for the airport, and take some light food with you.;
, While this may sound obvious, many people still forget to do it or leave it till they arrive to the airport. Transaction fees at the airport differ significantly from those in other places and not in your favour.

, Yes, there is an exciting journey ahead of you and the mood is right to have just a brief look at the souvenirs and other small items in the airport shop. But almost all of it is probably available at your travel destination, and the prices may be significantly lower.

, Some airlines provide good discounts if you check your bags online.

, Besides being extra convenient, travelling with a carry-on only is cheap. No payments for an overweight suitcase, no extras, no long lines and unnecessary trouble. Do check your carry-on complies with the airline's size and weight requirements - if it doesn't, the airline has the right to ask you to check your bag.

, If you have nothing to do before boarding, you may be drawn to the magazines sold at the airport shops. Why spend on something unnecessary if you can take out your own newspaper or book? You may as well have them on your smartphone or tablet.

, Carry it through security and then fill with water from the drinking water fountain to avoid buying overpriced bottled water or soft drinks at the airport.

, Many policies will protect you in case of trip cancellations, delayed departures, or scheduled airline failure. Your personal possessions and valuables will be covered as well.

, Depending on the country, baggage regulations may be quite surprising. The last thing you want is to see your belongings being thrown away at security - only to have to buy them again afterwards.

, Pack your prescribed medicine if you have any (and remember to take a copy of the prescription with you!) and also take some basic medication for colds, headaches, diarrhea. Buying them at the airport could be costly.

If you aren't currently incarcerated, asking for a continuance can give you time to gather your resources and find your own attorney.The court usually schedules an arraignment within 48 hours of your arrest, but it may be longer if the courts are not in session, such as if you were arrested on a Friday afternoon.
You have the right to be represented by an attorney at your arraignment. If you can't afford an attorney, the judge will appoint a public defender to represent you and may postpone the arraignment anyway to give you a chance to discuss the charges with them.
If you want to challenge probable cause, hiring a private criminal defense attorney may be a better option for you.;
, You will be given a written summary of the charges against you, which typically also will be read aloud, and asked how you plead. If you want to challenge probable cause, you must plead ""not guilty.""The judge will ask you questions to make sure you understand the charges against you and are generally competent to enter a plea. Answer these questions honestly.
If you have any questions or concerns about the charges and the potential penalties, you can ask the judge at this time. The judge must make sure you understand the charges before he or she can accept your plea.

, Even if you've already had a bail hearing, you can ask the arraignment judge to review that status and reduce or eliminate your bail. If bail hasn't been set yet, the arraignment judge will set it.The prosecutor will be at your arraignment, and may argue that newly discovered information justifies an increase in bail, even if you've already posted bail.
The judge will review all the circumstances related to bail and determine whether bail should be increased or decreased. Factors involved in this decision include the severity of the charges against you and how much of a flight risk you represent.
The judge also may impose conditions of your release, such as requiring you to stay in the state or even in the county, or forbidding you from drinking alcohol. These conditions typically vary depending on the charges against you.

, During arraignment, the judge usually sets dates to hear any pretrial motions. Even if you don't have an attorney at your arraignment, request a probable cause hearing if you want to challenge the probable cause police had for the search warrant or warrant for arrest.The court typically will schedule the probable cause hearing no more than two or three weeks after the date of your arraignment.
If you don't have an attorney at arraignment, the attorney you hire may request a continuance of this hearing. However, it's still important to request one and get the issue on the court's docket.
There may be a form for you to fill out and request a probable cause hearing. The form requires basic information about you and the charges against you.

, Often the best attorney recommendations come from people you know and trust. Similarly, if you've used an attorney for a different matter, they might know a criminal defense attorney they can recommend.If you know somebody who recently had criminal charges dismissed, you might ask what attorney they used and whether they would recommend him or her.
Attorneys can be great sources of recommendations, even if they practice in another field of law. Through law school as well as various professional functions, attorneys tend to know other attorneys who practice in different fields than they do.
However, keep in mind that just because you get a recommendation doesn't mean that attorney will automatically be your best choice. You still need to make sure that attorney handles cases like yours.
For example, an attorney who specializes in DUIs may not necessarily be the best person to handle burglary charges.

, The website of your state or local bar association typically has a searchable directory of attorneys licensed to practice law in your area. You can use this directory to find a criminal defense attorney with experience challenging probable cause in cases similar to yours.Once you have the names of a few attorneys from the directory, see if they have their own websites that you can visit. There, you can learn more about each attorney's background and the focus of their practice.
Check each attorney's reputation by searching online for client reviews. Your state or local bar association also typically has information regarding whether the attorney has been subject to discipline for violations of professional rules.

, If time and circumstances permit, try to talk to several attorneys before you choose one, so you can compare and contrast to find the best attorney to meet your needs and budget.Typically attorneys will give a free initial consultation. Make sure you provide any requested information to the attorneys you're meeting before the consultation.
Prepare a list of questions to ask the attorney regarding your case. Since you want to challenge probable cause, ask each attorney about their experience filing motions to dismiss for lack of probable cause, as well as their success rate.
If you have financial concerns regarding your ability to pay attorney's fees, bring this up during the initial consultation. Criminal defense attorneys are accustomed to clients with limited funds, and they may be willing to work with you regarding payment arrangements, but they need to know about financial issues up front.

, Once you've talked to a few attorneys, you're ready to choose the one you think will be your strongest defender and advocate. While it's important to choose an attorney with experience, don't be afraid to go with your gut if there's one attorney you feel good about.Take fees into consideration, but try to avoid making your decision based solely on financial issues. While a private criminal defense attorney can be costly, time in jail potentially would have a greater negative impact on your life.
Meet with your chosen attorney as soon as possible to get a retainer agreement in writing. Your attorney typically will go over the agreement with you to make sure you understand it before you sign it.
Once you've retained your attorney, he or she will discuss defense strategy with you and plan the next steps you'll be taking to file a motion to dismiss the charges.

, While the Fourth Amendment doesn't specifically define probable cause, the circumstances set forth in the warrant must show that the information is reliable enough to constitute a search or arrest.Keep in mind that the information used to justify a warrant does not have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a crime has taken place.
The standard for probable cause is quite a bit lower than that, requiring only that the police officer have an objectively reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.
The information to justify a warrant doesn't even have to be admissible at trial. The magistrate or judge who approves a warrant can rely on hearsay or other evidence that could never be admitted in court to prove your guilt.
However, the information must seem reliable, and must be based on named sources that would have some reason to know what they told the officer.

, To challenge probable cause, your attorney must draft a motion to dismiss the case, which asks the judge to dismiss the charges the prosecutor has brought against you because your Fourth Amendment rights were violated during the process of search or arrest.The motion includes basic reasons you believe the warrant was not supported by sufficient probable cause.
For example, if a warrant is based on an affidavit from a police officer stating that the officer believes you are using a shed in your backyard to produce methamphetamine, but does not name any source for that information, your motion to dismiss would argue that the information was too vague to constitute probable cause.

, After the motion to dismiss is complete, it must be filed with the court and delivered to the prosecuting attorney, who typically will file a response to the motion before the pretrial hearing on the motion is scheduled.When your motion is filed, the court will schedule the hearing. Generally the hearing must be scheduled within a couple of weeks, so there isn't much time for extensive preparation.
If you are still in custody and the prosecutor requests more time or the court can't schedule the hearing within a couple of weeks, your attorney may move to have the court release you pending the outcome of the probable cause hearing.

, The judge will hold a pretrial hearing on the motion, which essentially screens the charges for validity before a trial is scheduled. You are allowed to present evidence at this hearing to support your arguments.At the hearing, the court will determine whether probable cause existed to believe the charged offense was committed and whether probable cause existed to believe you committed the offense.
The standard rules for the introduction of evidence apply, which means some of the evidence on which the officer relied in the affidavit supporting the warrant may not be allowed.
You will have the opportunity to have witnesses testify on your behalf, and to introduce evidence that supports your argument that the warrant was based on insufficient probable cause.
However, in most cases neither you nor other witnesses will be called to testify at a probable cause hearing, particularly if your attorney believes testimony could harm your chances at trial.
The prosecutor also will call witnesses, typically the police officer and possibly any informants upon whom the officer relied when requesting the warrant.
You (through your attorney) have the right to cross-examine any witnesses called by the prosecution by asking them questions related to their knowledge and the facts to which they testified.

, If the judge rules in your favor that the warrant was not supported by probable cause, the charges against you will be dismissed. The prosecutor cannot appeal this ruling. However, they typically can refile charges against you after establishing probable cause.If the judge denies your motion, there typically isn't an option for you to appeal that ruling. Your case will proceed to trial, and the issue may come up at trial or in subsequent post-conviction appeals.
If you were charged with a misdemeanor offense, the judge typically will go ahead and set your case for trial if your motion to dismiss is denied.
Typically the judge will review your bail and pretrial release conditions if he or she has denied your motion to dismiss. For example, if your attorney got you released on your own recognizance pending the outcome of the probable cause hearing, the judge may order you to post bail for continued release.
Keep in mind that judges do not often dismiss criminal charges for lack of probable cause. However, the probable cause hearing gives you and your attorney a chance to learn more about the prosecution's case against you and expose possible weaknesses that can be exploited at trial.

Fly in via plane to LAX airport, which is the way most people visit it.,
Ride a car over to the parking garages for the terminals (unless you have a rental).

,
Take a bus to get to LAX airport.,
Ride in with your hotel's shuttle van/bus, which can be very effective if the hotel is nearby.,
Recognize that this airport contains two levels.,
Realize that LAX has several terminal buildings, and that these buildings are positioned in a sideways U-shape formation.,
Realize that baggage claim will almost indefinitely be found on yet a third level of each building.

,
Realize that there is no effective shuttle that can take you from one terminal to another, despite the complexity of the airport's setup, but if you ask, terminal staff may be able to assist in helping to hire you some help without charging you a fee in turn.,
Recognize that, you'll find a parking garage (patron) entrance for each terminal building.

,
Read road signs carefully.,
Look for the world-famous LAX theme building which is a three-story landmark with two ""arches"" holding up the building, and that can be found on/near the airline areas nearest ""center court"" containing the planes.

,
Look for the world-famous LAX sign at the entrance on the north-east side of Century Drive.",How to Visit Los Angeles International (LAX) Airport," With planes having a layover after coming in from overseas and Hawaii, it's quite normal to see people inside the terminal at all times.;
,, With some bus-lines arriving at the airport, especially from rental-car agencies which are off-site (and most of these off-site locations being corporate locations for companies), these buses can be very effective.

, Even places that are 40 minutes away by car, may be able to hire another service which can assist you to get you to the right location at the airport.

, One level (upper) is set up just for arrivals, and the other level (lower) is set up for departures including the ticketing and baggage of items, ticketing and baggage.

, With so many airlines coming in and going out, they definitely do need all that room.

,, Follow the signs on the arrivals level outside the building. Each ""zone"" will be marked with several sections, whether that's for ""car rental shuttles"" or ""hotel shuttles"" or ""taxis"" or the like, it'll all just ""flow"".

Prepare to draft your agreement.,
Define the information you want to keep confidential.,
List all information that will be excluded.,
Explain the obligations of the person who receives your confidential information.,
State how long the agreement will remain in effect.,
Include any miscellaneous provisions.,
Get signatures from anyone working with you.",How to Protect Intellectual Property Rights1," A non-disclosure agreement enables you to share your intellectual property with others while still keeping it secret until you're ready to launch it publicly.


Once signed, if someone discloses information covered under the agreement, you can sue them for damages.If you have trade secrets or other information that you need to share with someone to do business with them, a non-disclosure agreement can ensure that they only use your information for the reasons you authorize and don't tell anyone else about it.For example, if you have invented a new tool and need to find manufacturers, you will have to reveal details about your tool so they can provide estimates on the cost of manufacture. You can use a non-disclosure agreement to make sure they don't steal your idea and make their own tool that copies yours.
Non-disclosure agreements also can protect sensitive information that may not be eligible for copyright, trademark, or patent protection.For example, you may have information such as client lists that give you a competitive advantage in your industry. Although that information wouldn't meet the qualifications for protection under U.S. intellectual property law, a non-disclosure agreement can keep it safe.While you can draft a general agreement for multiple uses, the same agreement may not work in every context. For example, if you are a small business owner you may have one agreement for your employees and another agreement for other businesses such as manufacturers or distributors.
Your agreement may be one-way or mutual, depending on who is receiving the information.For example, you may need a one-way agreement for employees who likely won't be sharing their own confidential information through the course of their employment. However, you may want a mutual agreement if you are working with an advertising firm to develop a marketing strategy, since the firm also will be sharing its intellectual property with you.;
, Your agreement should outline specifically the types of information you expect the other person to keep confidential.


Your description should be broad enough to encompass entire categories of information or ideas, but not so broad or vague that it's difficult to determine if any particular document or item should be kept confidential.For example, if you are a smartphone application developer, your agreement might state that all programming code, infrastructure, and design are confidential.
In the event of a breach, specifics typically are easier to prove than general categories; however, you don't want to accidentally exclude something by leaving it off the list. Ideally, you should have a general category, and then provide as many examples of things covered by that category as you can following the words ""including, but not limited to.""
This section of your agreement may run several paragraphs or even several pages, depending on the context of the confidential relationship and the amount of information you're sharing with the person., Some information, such as information the other person already knew before working with you, cannot be included in a non-disclosure agreement.Since exclusions basically are established by state law, you may need to do a little research to determine exactly what information must be specifically excluded from the agreement.Generally, you must exclude information that is common knowledge in your field. You also can't cover any information that the person already knew, or learns from another source.If you have questions or concerns about whether you must exclude certain information, you should consult an attorney before you have anyone sign your agreement.

, Non-disclosure agreements typically include a general statement that the person who receives the information covered by the agreement must keep it in confidence and limit its use.If you want to require any particular actions related to your information, they should be included in this section. For example, you may want to restrict the copying of confidential information, or not allow confidential materials to be removed from your office.

, You must choose if you want the agreement to last for a period of time or until a specific date.


This portion of your agreement also should state the date the agreement will go into effect. If you intend the agreement to go into effect on the date it's signed, simply state that. However, if you have the person sign the agreement in advance, the start date should be included in the agreement itself.
Five years is a common time period for non-disclosure agreements, although you can make your agreement last longer or even indefinitely.You don't have to list a specific period of time. Depending on the information covered by the agreement, certain events may render confidentiality irrelevant.For example, if you are seeking funding to develop an invention, you may have potential investors sign a non-disclosure agreement so you can reveal enough detail about the invention that they can decide whether they want to invest. That agreement may last for a specific period of time, or until you file a non-provisional patent application (at which point information about the invention would become publicly searchable)., Most agreements close with a number of miscellaneous provisions discussing the consequences of breach of the agreement.


These provisions are often referred to as ""boilerplate"" because they apply to any sort of agreement. Generally, they concern which state's law applies if the agreement is breached, how damages will be determined, and whether attorney's fees will be included.If you have a copy of an agreement you used for a different purpose, you may be able to simply copy the miscellaneous provisions from that contract.

, Before you reveal any of your protected intellectual property, have them review and sign your non-disclosure agreement.


Once you both have signed the agreement, it becomes legally binding and a confidential relationship is created for the agreement's term."
"
Check your arrival and departure terminals.,
Look at the layout of the airport.,
Allow time for security if leaving T1, 2, or 3.,
Walk between T4–8 and TBIT without leaving security.,
Estimate walking times.,
Take an airport shuttle.,
Check for live shuttle updates.,
Find the American Eagle Regional Terminal.,
Ask about rechecking your bags.,
Allow time for security when rechecking bags.,
Go through customs and border control when arriving on an international flight.,
Add up total transfer time.,
Make backup plans for a tight connection.",How to Switch Flights in LAX," If you're not sure which terminals you'll be using, look up your airline on the list below this map. If that doesn't answer your question, call your airline's customer service number and ask.


Do not assume your international flight uses the International Terminal (TBIT). It could arrive or depart at any terminal used by that airline.;
, You can plan your route using this map, or follow these tips:


Terminals 1 to 3 are on the north side.
Terminals 4 through 8 are on the south side.
Tom Bradley International Terminal is at the west end of the airport, between terminals 3 and 4.
You can cross between the north and south sides only on the lower arrivals level.

, You cannot leave these terminals without exiting secure areas. This means you will need to pass security again, which can take anywhere from 5 to 45 minutes depending on the terminal and time of day. Look up a security wait estimate by entering LAX along with your arrival time and day of the week at whatsbusy.com.


For real time updates the day of your flight, check MyTSA. If there is a long line for your departure terminal, it may be faster to enter security at a nearby terminal with an airside connection to yours.

, These terminals are connected ""airside,"" meaning you can transfer between them without having to enter security again. To do this, use the walkways:


TBIT and Terminal 4 are connected by a walkway.
Terminals 4 through 6 are connected by tunnels near the terminal center.
Terminals 6 through 8 are connected by walkways near the terminal exit.If you arrived on an international flight, you will still need to go through security. However, there is a security check in the walkway between TBIT and T4, which is often faster than leaving TBIT and passing security at another terminal., This map allows for a slower walking pace than the official site, so using it will give you a margin of safety. Here's a summary if you can't load the page:5 minutes for each step on this route: T1 → T2 → T3 → International → T4.
8 to 10 minutes for each of these steps: T4 → T5 → T6 → T7 → T8.
5 minutes to cross between the north and south side (roughly between T1 and T7, or T3 and T5).

, Free shuttles between terminals depart every ten to fifteen minutes at all times. Walk to the front of the terminal and look for blue signs with the letters ""LAX"" and a picture of a bus. The stops are labeled ""LAX Shuttle & Airline Connections.""You will have to leave the secure area to take this shuttle, which means another security check at your departure terminal.


The shuttle travels counter-clockwise around the airport, moving from terminals 1 to 3, then to Tom Bradley International Terminal, then through terminals 4 to 8, then back to 1. There are about 2 to 4 minutes between stops, depending on traffic.
All shuttles are wheelchair accessible., Visit http://www.ridelax.com/ to view a live map of all airport shuttles, or to download it as a phone app. This includes additional shuttles that do not make all terminal stops, which could save you a couple minutes.


You cannot use the Green line (G) unless you have a Los Angeles TAP card.Make sure to check whether the shuttle leaves from the lower arrivals level or the upper departures level.

, This small, remote terminal is only reachable by bus from Terminals 4 (Gate 44 is actually a bus stop) or 6 (near Gate 60). Add at least 30 minutes to your transfer time if you need to go between this terminal and the main airport, as there are often long lines. This terminal is only used for some (not all) domestic American Airline and Alaskan Airline flights.

, Airline staff will usually transfer your checked baggage for you, so you do not need to pick it up until your final destination. This isn't always true, though, so ask about this when you first check your bags. Typically, you will only need to pick up your bags and recheck them during these types of transfers:


If you are arriving on an international flight, you will need to pick up your bags and take them through customs.
If you booked the two legs of your flight separately, you probably need to pick up your bags and recheck them with your departing airline.
If you booked the two legs at the same time but the tickets list two different airlines, you probably don't need to recheck, but make sure to ask.

, The baggage connection is located outside the secure area. If you need to pick up your bags, you cannot take advantage of the walkways between Terminals 4–8 and TBIT that allow you to transfer without security.


The amount of time this takes varies depending on the time and day of the week. Check whatsbusy.com for an estimate.

, All passengers arriving from another country will need to pick up their bags, then go through customs and border control. Allow at least 45 minutes for this process. Wait times of 60 to 90 minutes are not unheard of.For a more accurate estimate of wait times, check http://awt.cbp.gov/ for days and times that match your trip.
Security usually takes longer for people traveling on a non-American passport.
To get through this as fast as possible, have your documents ready and fill out your customs form on the plane.

, Now you have the information you need to estimate your transfer time. As a general rule, 60 to 90 minutes should be enough for a transfer between domestic flights that doesn't require leaving security. Two hours is more reasonable for domestic transfers that require leaving security and rechecking, and three hours is a good idea if arriving from another country.


Extra time is always a good idea. 23% of flights arriving in LAX are late.You can look up your specific flight number on flight stats websites to see your flight's record of delays.

, If it's not clear whether you'll be able to make the connection, talk to the airlines you booked the tickets with. If you bought the tickets at the same time and the airline you arrive on is late, the airline should help you find another flight. If you bought the tickets separately, you will likely need to buy a new departure ticket if you miss the transfer. Find out when the next flight to your destination is in advance and let the people at your final destination know there's a chance you'll be late.


If you're worried about the transfer time, try to get a seat near the front exit of the plane. If you're stuck at the back, try asking a passenger at the front to switch with you before descent so you can make your connection.

Determine what is covered by copyright.,
Fill out your registration application.,
File your registration application.,
Deposit your registered work.,
Monitor against infringement.",How to Protect Intellectual Property Rights2," Any original text, audio, or visual work has copyright protection from the moment you put it into a tangible form.


Generally, your copyright gives you the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, display, and perform your work publicly. You also can enter into an agreement with someone else to do any of those things for you.However, if someone does any of those things without your consent, they have infringed your copyright and you have the right to sue them for damages. You also can get an injunction – a court order that requires the infringer to stop copying or using your work.Copyright protects the words, sounds, or images themselves, but not the ideas they embody or the processes they describe.For example, if you create a training video for your employees, you could register your copyright in that video. If someone copied your video and put it on the internet, that would constitute copyright infringement. However, it would not be copyright infringement if another business owner created his own training video, even if it discussed similar processes.
Computer programs can be protected by copyright as literary works, but the copyright protects the code sequences themselves – think of the code as a language like English, but read by computers rather than people – not the program's functions or processes. Application processes or systems can be protected by a patent.You also should keep in mind that copyright generally doesn't protect single words, names, mottos or short phrases. If you have a brief phrase you use in connection with your business, you may be able to trademark it, but copyright would not apply., You will need to disclose information about yourself and your copyrighted work.


Registration basically is a legal formality, since your work is protected by copyright from the moment you create it. However, you must have a registered copyright to file an infringement suit in federal court.If you're filing online, you will be asked some brief questions about the work you're filing before you proceed. Once you start your application, you must enter information such as the type of work, the title of the work, whether and when it has been published, and the names of the authors of the work., The U.S. Copyright Office allows registration to be done either online, or by mailing in a paper application.


Filing online provides a number of benefits, including faster processing time and a lower filing fee.If you file online, you only have to pay either $35 or $55 to file your application. The lower rate applies to registration of a single work by one author.When filing online, you can save your application whenever you want and return to it later. Your application will only be submitted after you've paid the filing fee and clicked the button to submit your work.If you'd prefer to file paper forms, you can download them from the Copyright Office website. You must include a filing fee of $85 with your paper application. Some types of copyrights such as serial registrations or works by multiple authors may have a higher filing fee.Processing will take approximately eight months if you file your application online, and can take up to 13 months if you mail in a paper application. If you file online, you have the additional benefit of being able to check the status of your application whenever you want., To complete registration, you must deposit copies of your work.


If you file your application online, you may be able to upload electronic copies of your work directly into the system.If your work has been published in the United States, you are required to send two physical copies for use by the Library of Congress within three months of publication. This deposit is separate from the registration deposit requirements, but you can use the same copies to satisfy both requirements in some circumstances. Failure to make the Library of Congress deposit doesn't affect the status of your registration, but it can lead to fines or other penalties., Although the Copyright Office registers copyrights, it does not enforce them. It is your responsibility to detect and go after infringing uses of your work.


Copyright protection endures for the life of the author plus 70 years. If you file your copyright and list a corporate entity as the author, protection will last 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.If you own a website or blog where you publish your work, there are applications available that will scan the internet for copies of your work.Some of these services may charge a fee, so you should compare them so you can choose the maximum amount of protection that will fit your budget.
If you find someone infringing your work, take action immediately. Find out the name and contact information of the infringer and send them a letter letting them know that you have a registered copyright in the work and their use is infringing.You can ask them to cease and desist their infringing use, but you also may want to give them the opportunity to work out an agreement with you to license the work.

Determine whether your name or logo is eligible for trademark protection.,
Decide whether to apply for a state or federal trademark.,
Conduct a trademark search.,
Fill out your trademark registration application.,
File your application.,
Work with the examining attorney.,
Conduct regular audits.",How to Protect Intellectual Property Rights3," You can keep others from using words or images that you use to identify your business or work.


Trademarks typically protect brand names or logos used on products or affiliated with particular service providers – they don't protect the products themselves.For example, if you invented a new tool, you would get a patent for your tool design, and a trademark for the brand name of your company or the logo that appears on the tool's packaging when it is sold to consumers.

, Depending on the scope of your business, you may not need or even qualify for federal trademark protection.


Generally, you must use (or intend to use) your mark in interstate commerce to qualify for federal trademark protection. State trademarks only protect usage within that state., Before you apply to register your trademark, you must make sure someone else isn't already using a mark that is the same or similar.


If you want a federal trademark, you can use the electronic search system on the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's website. This database includes registered trademarks as well as pending applications and abandoned marks.States also have their own trademark databases for state registrations. Typically you can find these on the secretary of state's website.If you need to search the federal database as well as one or more states, you might consider using a screening service such as trademark.com, which will search multiple databases for you for a fee., The application includes information about your business and the words or image you want to protect.


You must decide what format you'll use for your trademark and the goods and services to which the mark will apply. Federal trademarks have specific commercial classes, and you must register your mark in the classes that apply. Keep in mind you'll have to pay an additional fee if you want to register your mark in multiple classes.If you're filing a federal trademark application, you also must decide whether you want to file your application on the basis of use or intent to use. If you've not yet begun operations, you would file based on intent to use, which requires filling out additional forms and paying an extra fee.Many states only offer trademark registration based on use and don't recognize a trademark based on an intent to use it in the future., Once you've completed your application, you must file it with the appropriate agency and pay any associated application fees.


State trademark registration typically requires a minimal fee compared to federal trademark registration, with a much simpler application process.To file for federal trademark registration, you must pay a minimum of $375 in processing fees to register in a single commercial class. You'll pay additional fees if you intend to use your trademark in other classes or industries.You can file your federal application electronically on the USPTO's website. Once filed, the pending application becomes a matter of public record and will appear in the USPTO's public database., If you've applied to register a federal trademark, your application will be reviewed by an attorney who works for the USPTO.The attorney may issue a letter requesting additional information or revisions to your application before it can be approved. If you don't respond to the letter within six months, the USPTO will mark your application abandoned and you'll have to start over if you still want federal trademark protection.If the examining attorney decides to approve your application, the USPTO will publish notice of the mark in its official gazette. Other people or businesses have 30 days to file opposition to your mark. Assuming there is no opposition, the USPTO will issue your registration certificate., Protect your trademark's status and keep its protection active by regularly monitoring the way it is used.


Audits review the legal and marketing context of your trademarks and verify that they are being used correctly in any advertising or product packaging. You also should verify that the appropriate symbols or trademark notices are being used.You also must maintain your mark by filing maintenance documents periodically and paying fees to keep it active. If you miss these deadlines, your trademark protection will expire and you'll have to file a new application."

Determine your eligibility for patent protection.,
Define and categorize your invention.,
Conduct a patent search.,
Fill out a provisional patent application.,
File your provisional patent application.,
Consult an attorney regarding a non-provisional patent.",How to Protect Intellectual Property Rights4," Patents are available to protect the rights of inventors who create useful items or processes that are distinct and significant developments.If you've invented something, you may have difficulty finding a manufacturer who is willing to sign a non-disclosure agreement before he sees your invention. Filing a provisional patent application protects your invention so you don't have to worry about someone stealing your invention.Provisional patents are not examined and don't require you to disclose any potentially similar patents already in existence. The provisional patent is designed in part to give you a 12-month period to evaluate the viability of your invention and whether it can be patented., The USPTO issues three types of patents, with utility patents being the most common.Utility patents include machines or tools as well as processes or methods such as computer applications or assembly methods. You can get a provisional patent for a utility patent, which allows you to use the phrase ""patent pending"" in connection to your invention., Although you aren't required to disclose similar patented inventions on a provisional application, a preliminary search can help you determine whether filing a provisional application is justified.


A provisional patent gives you an earlier filing date, which may be important later on if someone else has an invention similar to yours. If your patent was filed first, you have rights to the patent over anyone who comes later.However, if someone else has already filed a patent similar to yours, you may not be entitled to patent protection for your invention.
Provisional patent applications are not examined, so any conflicting patents in existence would only come into play if and when you filed your full patent., Your provisional application must include a written description of your invention along with the names of all the inventors.


Your application must include text and drawings that describe and depict your invention. Unlike a full patent application, the provisional application can be written in plain English.While typically you must use an attorney or registered patent agent to assist you in completing a full patent application, you should be able to file a provisional patent application on your own.Your application also must include a cover sheet that lists the name and place of residence of the inventor, the title of the invention, and contact information., Once you've completed your application, you can use the electronic filing system to submit your application to the USPTO.


Provisional patents have a lower filing fee than non-provisional patents. While non-provisional patents may cost thousands of dollars, you can get a provisional patent for under a hundred dollars.If you prefer to file your application by mail, you can send your paper application along with the filing fee to Commissioner for Patents, P.O. Box 1450, Alexandria, VA 22313-1450., The USPTO recommends you use a registered patent attorney to complete your non-provisional application.


Your provisional application establishes your effective filing date for your non-provisional patent – however, you lose this date if you don't file a non-provisional application within 12 months.Essentially, the provisional patent buys you time so you can evaluate whether you want to file a non-provisional patent. If you decide to go for full patent protection, the application will be time-consuming and expensive to create.

Choose the line with the fewest security agents.,
Pick a line far from the terminal.,
Check for alternate lines.",How to Spend Less Time in Security Lines at the Airport1," Before getting into a security line, scan all available lines and choose the one with fewer security agents in it. Seeing numerous agents working in a line often means that a new agent is being trained. During training, agents are likely to scrutinize baggage more closely or do detailed, drawn out searches for demonstration., To reduce waiting time, choose a line that is far from the terminal. The more remote a line is, the more likely it is to be sparsely populated. While this will require you to walk a bit more, it will likely also mean a smaller lineup to wait in., If you want to reduce your waiting time in line, ask an airport official (e.g. a gate attendant or security agent) for assistance. Some large airports have security lines in different locations that lead to the same place. Ask an airport employee for directions to any alternate lines that you can go to."
"
Choose a suitable time to go to the airport.,
Be prepared to pay more for food for the day.,
Plan for different observational activities.,
Check off interesting planes.,
People watch.,
Go window shopping.,
Look at the boarding and arrival signs.,
Have a snack.,
Ride the travelators, lifts (elevators) and escalators.,
Take advantage of the view.,
Have the children ask questions of the security dog handlers.,
Take the train, bus, or car home again.",How to Spend an Afternoon at the Airport with Your Children," A weekend can be a great time to visit. Go at a time that you can get a good place to park. This might mean a morning rather than an afternoon, but that's fine too. Or take the airport shuttle, train, or other public transport and save yourself the hassle of driving and parking. This is as much a part of the learning experience as the visit itself.;
, This is balanced out by the fact that you don't have to pay any entrance fees or ride fees, so it all evens out. You could take your own food but that would spoil the fun of trying what there is on offer at the airport.

, Depending on your children's interests, there are a variety of possible things to do:


Watch the planes taking off and landing. Find a good window that provides ample view of this activity. A good half hour or more can be spent watching this happen, especially in busier airports.






Watch the passengers boarding. If it is possible to see the passengers go on at the airport you are visiting, it can be fun for kids to watch them. They can even wave if they want to. If they can see the plane that the passengers are boarding, they can watch for passengers sitting at their seats.






Watch the aircraft maintenance. This part can fascinate mechanically-minded children for ages, even hours. There are so many things that can be done to a plane when it is undergoing its checks that children can spend a lot of time guessing what is happening and seeing the activity from start to finish.






Watch the bags go across the tarmac and onto a plane; or watch bags being unloaded. This fascinates children, especially to see the conveyors taking luggage up and the strong baggage handlers throwing luggage in and moving it about.






Watch the plane food being loaded. This will happen from a catering truck and can be a fun thing to see.






Watch the aviation security people driving and walking around the plane areas.






Watch the planes being towed backwards to take them to the runways or hangars. This often involves people walking with the plane as well and is an endless source of fascination for children.







, Look for the most interesting, colourful and unusual plane designs. Look for planes from different airlines and check them off on a list for the children to compare later.

, Sit down and see what people are doing. Things to look for include:


Passengers checking in at the ticket counters. Do they have bags, surfboards, skateboards, funny-shaped parcels, or no bags at all?






Passengers in a hurry. Can your children spot people who are running late for their plane?






Passengers lugging heavy baggage.






Passengers stuck in long queues and their reactions to the waiting.






Passengers catching 40 winks while they wait for a plane - what other activities do people do to pass the time while waiting?






Passengers lining up to board planes.






Passengers and their families saying hello and goodbye - this can be an interesting activity for children to learn about human emotions when meeting and departing. In an exercise of empathy, have children guess why people might be travelling - for business, for a holiday, for a sports event as a team, for a conference, for reuniting with family members for a special or sad occasion etc.







, Unless you plan to buy something at higher than usual prices, just look in the shops. It can be really interesting to see how your region or country is portrayed in airport shops, where a lot of shops target their displays at tourists buying last-minute mementos of their visit to your region or country. Your children can note what sorts of things are sold in airport shops; ask them questions about why they think such things are for sale and who would be likely to buy them - locals, people from across the country, or people from overseas?

, See if the children can guess the destinations from the codes. Ask them to tell you whether those destinations would hot or cold at the time of year that you are there if you are in an international terminal.

, Every intrepid observer needs refuelling. Buy some snacks and drinks at a café that looks interesting and affordable. Make sure there is a comfortable place to sit. Don't feel guilty spending more on the drinks and food than usual; this is normal for airports and as already said, you should have factored this into your trip as the ""expense"". Alternatively, take your food but still buy drinks. Many airport cafés are not as fussy about people eating food from elsewhere as most eating places, probably because they often share seating space with other places due to space restrictions, or they are just too busy to notice anyway.

, The travelators in particular hold a lot of mystique and joy for children. Many lifts can be interesting too if they are glass fronted and provide good views over the airport space.

, Go up high if you can and look down over the airport and across the runways as far as the eye can see. This can be a good thing to do in busy airports, to watch the flurry of activity below.

, If the dog handlers are not busy and look approachable, ask them if they mind your children asking them a few questions about their dogs. If they oblige, your children will enjoy asking questions about what the dogs do, if the dogs have found anything interesting and how long the dogs are able to do their job each day, or even how many years. Do not let the children touch the dogs unless the handlers say that it is OK to do so.

, After a few hours, it will be time to return home. Don't stay all day, or even for too long, or you and the children will be overwhelmed by all the activity, bustle, noise, and bright lights. Have questions prepared to ask them about the visit on the way home.

Have your identification and boarding pass in hand.,
Loosen or remove items of clothing.,
Pack liquids carefully.",How to Spend Less Time in Security Lines at the Airport2," To avoid delays or complications, make sure to have your boarding pass and photo I.D. in hand when you get into the security line. It is best to be absolutely sure that you have both before reaching security in the event that one is missing or stuck at the bottom of your bag. In the U.S., acceptable forms of photo identification to use at the airport include:A valid driver’s license
U.S. passport
Permanent resident card
U.S. military I.D.
Border crossing card
DHS trusted traveller card (e.g. Global Entry or NEXUS)

, To save time at the front of the line, loosen your belt and shoelaces so that you can remove them quickly to put into a bin at the X ray machine. Taking time to do this at the security check will slow down the process for yourself, and for those waiting behind you. If you are wearing a jacket or sweater, remove it before you reach the front of the line. , If you are bringing liquids on the plane in the U.S. (e.g. cough syrup or makeup remover), make sure that they are in containers smaller than 3.4 oz. (100 ml), in keeping with the TSA's regulations. Place liquids in a resealable bag no more than a quart (1.75 ml) large. Make sure that the bag is packed near the top of your carry-on so that you can quickly remove it to put into a bin at the security check."

Choose a low demand flight time.,
Don’t check your luggage.,
Fly premium class.",How to Spend Less Time in Security Lines at the Airport3," To avoid long wait times at the airport, schedule your flight for a low demand time, which might also save you money. Weekends are usually the busiest time for airports, so book a weekday flight if possible. Flights leaving between 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. are likely to be the least populated, making for a smoother, quicker airport experience., Checking your luggage at the airport will mean waiting in an extra line, as well as waiting around a carousel to retrieve your luggage after your flight. It will also cost you extra with most airlines and maybe cause problems you don’t need (e.g. the airline misplacing your luggage). Pack light and do your best to fit everything you need into your carry-on bags. , If you have the money to splurge, buy premium class plane tickets for your trip. With many airlines, buying first class or business seats means moving through security checks quickly and boarding earlier than other travellers. For instance, with American Airlines, Priority Access, business class and first class passengers are granted access to expedited security check lines as part of their perks.These perks are often also available to frequent flyers.

Apply for a TSA pre-check membership.,
Apply for Global Entry.,
Use an online or mobile check-in app.",How to Spend Less Time in Security Lines at the Airport4," If you are a U.S. citizen, speed up your time in airport lines by applying for a TSA pre-check membership, which allows you to go through security without removing shoes, belts, light jackets, or laptops. Apply online at https://www.tsa.gov/precheck, then make an appointment for an in-person background check at one of the hundreds of enrollment centers in the country. The 5 year membership costs $85 and is honored at over 180 U.S. airports.

, If you are a frequent international traveller, apply for Global Entry, a program for low risk travellers who wish to go through U.S. Customs and Border Protection checkpoints at a faster pace upon arrival in the country. Visit https://goes-app.cbp.dhs.gov/goes/jsp/login.jsp to create a Global Online Enrollment System account, then complete your application. A vigorous screening process will follow, including an in-person interview at a Global Entry enrollment center.


Visit the U.S. Customs and Border protection website at https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry/enrollment-centers to find an enrollment center near you.
A non-refundable $100 application fee applies, payable by credit card or through an electronic bank transfer.

, Visit your airline’s website to see if they have an app available that allows you to check in from home and sidestep the lineup. For instance, the United Airlines app (available for Apple, Android, and Windows Phone 8) allows travellers to check in up to 24 hours in advance of their flight.Some airlines (e.g. EasyJet) will allow you to check in up to 28 days in advance of your travel date."

Don't ignore the Metro!The Metro is undoubtedly the best way to travel around the city, with Metro stops within metres of every main attraction, for example, Passeig de Gràcia Metro station is directly outside the Casa Batlló.,
Don't fear being a tourist!,
Don't feel the need to stick to the centre!,
Try not to only eat in restaurants!,
Experience Barcelona's night-life!,
Where to go?,
Get yourself a map!,
Want to go to the beach?",How to Make the Most of a Week in Barcelona," It is also the cheapest method of transport — a 10 trip ticket over any number of days (T-10) costs €9.95, and a single ticket costs €1.40. The Metro system is efficient, clean, air-conditioned and punctual, and there are trains running almost always. However, if sweaty, crowded metros aren't your taste, try the bus system, which uses the same ticket and pricing system, so you can easily combine metro, tram, train, ferrocarril, and metro journeys, meaning that you can get anywhere within the city with little effort.;
, Okay, it is expensive, but the tourist buses are one of the easiest ways to see the city. However, try to use this service on the first day of your trip, as it will allow you to explore the city on foot, and with the bus ticket, you get money off vouchers, maps, and advice to get the most out of Barcelona.

, Barcelona is a huge city, but most people don't venture far out of the centre. How about heading up to the typically Spanish Plaza Sarria, or seeing Gaudí's fountain in Las Jardines de la Ciutadella?

, Often it's cheaper to head to a supermarket, buy some bread, cheese ham, fruit, and have a picnic in one of BCN's many parks or gardens. If the weather's not on your side though, many privately owned restaurants offer a menú del dia with which, for a set price (typically €5–€12), you can choose from certain starters, mains, desserts and a drink. Well worth the money!

, Barcelona has the greatest number of clubs and bars per capita than any other city in the entire world, and so you are never stuck for choice!

, Any visitor to Barcelona must see: La Sagrada Familia (Metro: Sagrada Familia, L5), Casa Batlló (Passeig de Gràcia, L2, 3 and 4), Casa Mila (Diagonal, L3 and 5), Las Jardines de la Ciutadella (Ciutadella I Vila Olimpica, L4), La Boqueria (Liceu, L3), Park Guell (Lesseps, L3 or Alfons X, L4).

, Just walk and walk, go down streets that take your fancy, and if you get lost, look on the map, and find the nearest Metro station. Simple!

, Avoid Barceloneta, as it gets very busy in the summer, and the locals favour quieter out-of-city beaches, such as Sitges. Beautiful Sitges is easy to get to, being just 35 minutes away by train from either Barcelona Sants or Passeig de Gràcia.

, The animals that you should look out for include the water vole, the common lizard, the cuckoo and a range of butterflies in season.

, Waldridge Fell has lowland heath, woodland, wetland/bog and grassland flora.

, The site ranger will be able to tell you more about the maintenance and care of the park, such as removal of invasive species of plants, which is an ongoing process.

Remain calm.,
Offer to pay someone.,
Ask for a written statement of your rights.",How to React if You Get Bumped from a Flight1," Fighting and/or arguing with the airline's flight attendants and employees will not improve your situation, especially if you are on the plane. If you start to become frustrated, take a few deep breaths and visualize something calming like the ocean or a waterfall. Once you are calm, proceed to the gate agent and discuss your concerns there.Remember that airlines reserve the right to bump you off a flight.;
, Do this if you are desperate to get to your destination on time. Announce to the other passengers that you will offer them compensation for their plane ticket. Keep in mind that you must have a significant amount of cash on-hand for this to work.For example, you can offer passengers double or triple the amount they paid for their one-way ticket.

, As a passenger you are entitled to this. The written statement should outline the airline’s overbooking policy, the reasons for why you were bumped, and the types of compensation you are entitled to.Airlines use check-in time, booking class, and the amount paid for the ticket when deciding who to bump.

"
"
Speak with the gate agent.,
Confirm your flight.,
Ask for a check or cash reimbursement.,
Ask for food, hotel, and transportation vouchers.",How to React if You Get Bumped from a Flight2," The gate agent is usually the person who will re-book your flight and offer you compensation if you qualify for it. You may also be redirected to a customer service counter to receive your compensation and to re-book your flight.You can also call the airline’s 1-800 number. However, be aware that it may take awhile for you to re-book your flight and receive compensation if you do this.

, This is usually done automatically when your flight is re-booked. However, make sure to confirm the new flight with the gate agent. Also make sure your itinerary is updated if you are taking a later flight.If there is another seat on a similar flight, make sure it is a confirmed seat as opposed to a standby seat. If it is a standby seat, you may end up stranded.
Inquire about how your checked-in luggage will be handled or transferred.

, If you qualify for compensation, make sure to ask for it in the form of a check or cash as opposed to a voucher or a free flight. While it may be tempting to accept vouchers and free flights, they are often subjected to restrictions and limitations.The amount of compensation you receive depends on the length of the delay, the amount you paid for the ticket, and the person that makes the alternative travel arrangements.
Be aware that being bumped due to safety-related balance or weight concerns, or because the airline switched to a smaller plane, will disqualify you from compensation.

, Passengers who have a long layover or who have to spend the night due to a flight change are entitled to hotel and transportation vouchers. Even if you will only be stuck at the airport for a few hours, make sure to ask what type of vouchers you qualify for like food vouchers."
"
Avoid peak travel seasons and days.,
Arrive and check-in early.,
Find an airline you like and stick with them.",How to React if You Get Bumped from a Flight3," Passengers flying during peak seasons, like Christmas and Thanksgiving, are more likely to get bumped than passengers who travel during down seasons. Because more people travel on the weekend, avoid traveling on these days to reduce your chance of being bumped from a flight.Passengers flying early in the morning are less likely to get bumped as well.

, Passengers with late check-in times are usually the ones to get bumped first. Therefore, arrive at the airport early so you can check-in before the deadline. Make sure to call and ask the airline what constitutes check-in.Today, some airlines allow you to check-in in advance online. If this is possible, make sure to do this to avoid getting bumped because of a late check-in time.

, If an airline has treated you well over the years and you have never been bumped involuntarily, then it is unlikely to happen in the future. Plus, passengers who are frequent customers of an airline are less likely to be bumped from a flight.You can even sign up for the airline’s frequent flyer program to save some money on future flights.

Just in case your bag gets picked up by someone else by accident, they can call you.







, Usually, the less you have, the easier it'll be to keep track of.

, Because, if your suitcases are ever stolen, your worry can do down because you have important stuff with you.

, For once, this kind of attention isn't necessary, because, you may attract thieves or robbers. Also, don't take a valuable object and flaunt it in front of the people. It's not safe to do so.

, Who knows? That stranger could be a thief! Try not to judge people with their looks or speech.

Follow through this open and airy area until you notice the TSA lines.,
Place all your baggage on the belt, including any and all metal items and jackets.,
Walk up to and into the full-body scanners.,
Continue walking on the path.,
Be sure to check the gate boards right outside the monorail to ensure you are traveling to the gates area containing your specific gate.

Look up at the TV displays at the gate to ensure that your plane (flight number) is still available to be boarded from that exact gate.",How to Navigate from the Terminals to the Boarding Gate at Orlando International Airport (MCO)," Pick up your tickets from the ticketing agents, if you don't have them just yet, or if your smartphone isn't able to provide to you, or if you don't have access to these tickets. You'll need them to pass through the TSA lines later on.;
, You'll be on the third level of the airport. This area will have several display monitors that tell you your gate assignment for your flight, if the flight's information has changed since your tickets were printed, or some other factor changed the flight pattern or flight gate any.

, The TSA lines tend to be very long here, but if you have all your stuff handy and out so you don't have to reach in, you can get through. Listen to the TSA agents, as you walk through the aisles. These aisles will get you to the checked baggage lanes.

, Be sure to include your sneakers/shoes, phones, wallets, anything that is loose, as TSA requires it here. Even gum containers will be needed to be X-rayed.


Although belts don't tend to trigger problems, be sure your belt comes off.
Place any loose items into a plastic square bin that is found off the edge of the rolling racks before the items X-ray machines.

, These body scanners are of the newest variety. Walk into them and turn to your right. Look at the picture.

Most people pass through the machine without much interruption.


These newest scanners began the 100% screening were installed and 2007 following a firearms and marijuana smuggling case was discovered at this airport., Look at the large numbered signs above your head that lead you to the monorail/shuttle-to-gates. Once you start to see several square-tube like items with a circular plastic piece (that may or may not have a fluorescent light that designates these transportation devices), make sure that the alleyway sends you to the gate containing your flight.

,, With the exception being the ends of each monorail car, there are no seats in the monorail. Everybody must stand. Be prepared for a few-minute shuttle to the gates area.


Don't go too far down the alleyway, if you'd like to ride going forward and be able to sit. The best place to sit (and almost never crowded) is the seat at the very back of the monorail. The other monorail cars will tend to be crowded and almost always will have no seats going in the forward direction or no seats whatsoever.
Exit from the monorail car through the doors that open, once the monorail stops. The doors that open should be the opposite sided ones than the ones you entered through the last time.

, Find your gate and sit down.

, Most often no other changes are needed, as most flights don't change gates that often. But be prepared in the event that your flight does change gates

Learn the current airport security rules are.,
Get a bag or backpack, preferably with lots of pockets, that you are willing to take on the plane.,
Make a list of liquids and gels you cannot lose and must have for the first night or week of travel.,
Do not bring any liquids/gels that are larger than 3oz.",How to Pack for Airport Security," The TSA website (www.tsa.gov) is a great source of information.;
, If you want to take a purse, make sure it can fit in your bag/backpack.

, This will save the stress of packing the liquids the night before your departure.

, This saves you from getting your things thrown out. Airport Security is tough, and will toss it out.

Enter through the airport's entrance doors.,
Check in at the check-in desk, and set your baggage (if you have any) down on the scale nearby.,
Weave around the security check in lines until you get to the ID check-in station.,
Place your onboard checked baggage as well as any keys, phones, or anything metal in small bins/containers the TSA agent should hand you (upon your request).,
Walk through the medal detector, or for full-body scanners, walk and stop on the body scanner for it to X-ray you.,
Pick up your things from the conveyor belt and place back on your shoes, socks (certain instances), place back your phones and personal accessories, place your laptop back into it's carrying case (unless the TSA agent needs to second check the device which sometimes needs to be done if they suspect something may be hiding inside it).

,
Look at your ticket.,
Shoot straight for your boarding gate.,
Sit down at your final boarding gate, or, if the plane is already boarding, board the airplane.",How to Navigate International Airports," Most times the doors will automatically open and you'll be able to enter through without lifting a finger, while other times you'll have to open them with your hand on a handle.;
, Let the employee know how many pieces of baggage you have, as rules have changed how many pieces each passenger may carry with them onboard the aircraft. Realize that only the luggage pieces should be checked in at this desk at this time.


While you are this desk, most often times, international airports will have a place where you can print your boarding passes or ask the check-in person to print them for you (if you don't own a smartphone or don't have access to a printer). Printing these boarding passes are a part of their job, when asked by the traveler.

, The security agent will need to see your boarding ticket and photo ID. The two names on each item must match the other item. If they don't, the FAA will stop you from boarding until either form has been corrected. For those carrying mobile boarding passes on their phone, you must place your phone down onto the podium where they will scan for the chip holding this pass (which should only take a matter of two seconds).

, Make sure all your belts, keys, jackets, coats, shoes/sneakers, mobile phones are taken off and placed in the bin. If you are carrying a laptop in a bag, you must take this out of the bag and place this item in it's own separate bin that can travel along the conveyor belt. (TSA Pre-Check (which is a paid yearly service) travelers do not need to follow this advice of removing extra pieces, but they can if they feel up to doing so.)


Unless otherwise asked by the agent, you may leave your socks on now when walking through the next few processes, however, shoes/sneakers must be off.

, While most international airports have switched to body scanners (body scanners do have a smaller rate of error), there are still a few international airports that still have medal-detectors in place and you must be able to follow those directions instead.


For those wearing medical devices such as heart implants or certain other machines, you must be able to have the security agent pat you down instead with their 'magic wand' from head to toe.
Be careful of following through a full body scanner. They can be triggered by excess amounts of water, such as when a person is sweating profusely. As long as there's a reason to the place the person is sweating, you could be okay with walking through the rest after the body scan.
Follow all prompts as the TSA agent asks you. Certain machines will have certain methods you must abide by to get you through the machine while following their special rules.







,, While most mobile passes have your most recent updated boarding passes, printed boarding passes don't have that luxury and will mention the boarding gate the last time it was known to have been updated at the time you checked in for your flight. Knowing this information is crucial to knowing where to go to find your plane that will lift you off to your determined location. Look around for monitors that mention the new location of your boarding gate (if any changes at all, have occurred).

, Walk quickly but don't run; don't stop and dawdle. Try not to stop at walking-path shops unless all other guests can quickly get around you and anybody nearby. Use the moving sidewalk to your advantage, if the gate is far away and the gate isn't directly next to the sidewalk (where you'd have to get out before the sidewalk ends) by either walking along it, running with your bags on it, jogging or forever moving with it to get you to the gate quicker. If you have extra time, you may walk from the security checkpoint area, but most often people tend to run to their gate as quickly as possible.

, The gate agent will ask you for your boarding pass; have them scan it. If you are carrying a mobile boarding pass, most often, you'll need to turn on the device and open up the app carrying your pass on it, until the flight data barcode/QR code is shown.


For those operating mobile phone apps for your boarding pass, you'll be operating your phone to show the boarding pass to the pedestal before the gate leading you to the plane.
Sometimes, you'll need to increase the brightness of your phone up to maximum brightness to ensure the scanner can properly read the barcode.
Almost all iPhones have a pass app on it. Download the pass to Passbook and use this item instead of the app. The passbook passes are better known to the airline industry than the airline's own app. Plus, these passes have all the data you'll need without scrolling the pass up and down on the screen to ensure the entire code is scannable all at once.
Some Android phones have similar pass apps that you can use. Use them when available. Some Samsung phones themselves also have their own pass system that is available for an airplane flight from an international airport.

If you are in a rush, and don't have time to park, tell your friend, or whoever it may be, in advance, to meet you at the arrivals pick-up area at their terminal.,
Exit the airport.",How to Pick Someone up at Boston's Logan International Airport," Be sure to stay well-informed if anything changes. Know their estimated time of arrival (E.T.A.), the terminal they will be arriving in, their airline, and if possible, the gate at which they will deplane. Knowing this information ahead of time will facilitate picking them up.;
, Online map sites such as Google Maps, Yahoo Maps, MapQuest, or Windows Live Local tend to confuse more than help. If you know your general location and how to get to the major highways around you, point your browser to the Logan International Airport Web page at http://www.massport.com/logan/. Then click on ""Getting to and from Logan"" on the right side of the page. Follow the directions.

, Make sure to give yourself a lot of extra time to get there, since Boston is notorious for its horrible rush-hour traffic. It is usually better to arrive a little before the person gets in, so you can help them get their luggage and so they won't wander around if they can't find you.

, Pay careful attention to the signs, especially as you get closer to the airport. The signs near the airport can be especially confusing. Be sure know what terminal you are going to, because if you miss your exit, you will have a hard time finding your way back to it. Also, beware that there may be some detours, so being alert and possibly having a helper assist you in navigating is a good idea.

, If you are waiting for too long (more than a minute or two) in the arrivals pick-up area, the airport police will ask you to leave (even during late-night and early-morning hours). Locating someone in an arrival area takes time and few phone calls, and can be an absolute nightmare.

, Some terminals, such as B, have their own parking garages, which provide fast and easy access to the terminal. If you're not sure or the terminal (such as C) does not have its own garage, park in central parking. In the road that circles the airport, there will be signs and a turnoff for central Parking. When you see the turnoff, turn off and follow the road (and signs) until you enter the Central parking garage. The bottom floors are usually full, closed off for another reason, or extremely crowded, so your best bet is to head higher up. When you arrive at a desirable floor, follow the overhead signs that point to the terminal you will be picking someone up at. Follow those signs to the terminal entrance (or to the entrance to a pedestrian bridge to your terminal) and then find the nearest parking to it.

, Be sure to take your parking ticket with you.

, If their cell phone is off, they are probably still on the plane. It is best to pre-arrange a meeting place, such as the baggage claim, or at the gate.

, Be sure to pay for parking on the way out at the ExitExpress pay stations. It will speed up your departure. Find your car, get in, and follow the signs to the parking garage exit.

, Tell them to be there promptly. When you are at the airport, follow the signs to the arrivals area of their terminal. When you get there, park by the curb and look around for them. Call them if possible and let them know where you are and what car you are in. If they are still getting luggage or are delayed getting outside, wait until your are asked to leave by the police. Then, leave the arrivals area and follow the signs to the main road. When you get back onto the main road, stay on it until the turnoff for the arrivals area again. Then repeat this step if they are still not there. Pay close attention to the signs. Stay on the main road and only turn off where you are supposed to.

, Follow the overhead signs to the highway that you came in on. Beware that you may have to pay a toll on some roads.

Mosey along the windowsill line after you get past the TSA lines, most often at the gate side of the people mover.,
People-watch other passengers pass through security/TSA lines on the terminal side of the people mover after you yourself pass through to see just what other types of people are passing back and forth.,
Stop by the chapel in the terminals.",How to Kill Time at Orlando International Airport1," Walking and staring at the windowsill watching planes go by can pass some time while keeping abreast of what's going on in this world at this airport. Watch to see what planes take off and land prior to your airplane's boarding process. Make guesses as to where planes are coming from and going, and see how many different airlines you can identify.;
, Don't get too chatty at this point; some passengers are hoping to get to the gates in an orderly fashion and don't want to be talked to for too long., Pray to the ""person above"" (Him) and for at least a safe travel with your family. You may need to look around the airport to find it, but there is a chapel on each side of the terminals of the airport."
"
Ride the shuttle train from the terminal to the gates several times, back and forth, if you have gotten past the security/TSA checkpoint.,
Get your children and yourself ready for the plane-ride.,
Communicate with your friends through a phone call or through a text message.",How to Kill Time at Orlando International Airport2," With five minute transport times between gate to terminal and terminal to gate, back and forth, this can be a real time-waster, but can be a necessity that can make time go by if you have multiple minutes and have done everything you can do on this list already. Admire the area around the station, and enjoy the train ride.

, If it's warm or you overdressed, take off an extra layer of clothes. If it got cold at the gates or in the terminal, put on another layer of clothes. If you are heading back from a trip to Walt Disney World and are still wearing a Magic Band or similar and aren't planning to take another trip there soon, take off your magic band and pack it away. MagicBands+ can become mementos of your trip until you take another one to the Walt Disney World area.


Pack or unpack a sweatshirt and music player (MP3 or CD player such as an iPod or other device) in preparation for boarding the plane for the long journey to the next (or final) location. Make some final changes to your daily ensemble. For example, if you were vacationing at a Disney resort and have a MyMagic+ band that you used in Walt Disney World, take it off and stow it in your carry-on luggage, as you won't be needing it anymore. If your kids are upset about this, explain that they can keep them as a souvenir, but they don't need to wear one at the airport and risk losing it.
Reorganize your carry-on luggage or personal items you were able to cart through the TSA stopping point. Place those items you'll want to access during the flight (such as a book, sweatshirt, and iPod) on top or in your side pockets so that you'll be able to reach them quickly when you want them. Also leave accessible any items you'll need only when you arrive at your destination in hidden spots out of the way of lurkers who may look your way, such as your car or house keys if you are flying back home. Though most people have good intentions, there are a few who might have different plans that you want to be aware of.







, Although this airport no longer has payphones you can use, cellphones are often the only form of communication to friends who aren't nearby. Tell a friend about your vacation or to relay messages to them before you get to them, or make plans for when you arrive back at home. Having a great conversation with a friend can be a fantastic way to kill a lot of time when you have nothing else to do."

Listen to some tunes on your portable music devices.,
Get to know the people sitting down near you at the gate or in the waiting area.,
Stop by and take some pictures (or a few selfies) with some of the artwork or porcelain characters along the way.,
Purchase food at some of the concession stands and sit-down restaurants on the gates side of the airport nearest your airlines' gates.,
Take care of the necessary ""pit stops"" along the way of life.,
Shop and browse through the stores in the airport.,
Read a book, newspaper or other form of reading materials you may have handy.,
Use a wireless device to access the Internet.,
Play cards or other quiet games.,
Nap or daydream for a few minutes or until boarding time arrives.",How to Kill Time at Orlando International Airport3," Entertain yourself with a portable MP3 player, Walkman, or iPod. Radio signals from nearby radio stations hold their quality really well inside this airport, and tapes, CDs, or music that you've downloaded are even better. Jam out to the latest hits. You can even start dancing if you aren't afraid of others catching on and dancing along with you (if you decide to make mention of where the song is when you sing it aloud)!, Make a few new friends when you talk to others awaiting at the gate alongside you. Ask them about their travels and where they are planning to travel to next (or what their final destination is - if they are comfortable chatting with you) as well as their lives at home - but make sure you're not intruding. If someone seems uncomfortable talking to you, walk away to another location as this person may not feel like talking to you.

, At or near some of the gates, you'll have some areas where you can take pictures with the porcelain replicas of the characters. This proves to be a pivotal spot where families coming into the area hoping to see the Orlando often stop and take pictures, but if you are flying back out, stop by and take the same pictures., Each wing of the gates side will have some form of food. Grab a snack in one of the few restaurants or restaurant take-out booths, or sit down for a full meal, if you have time. Although airport food can be pricey and is not usually considered the best quality food out there, this can be a great way to pass the time before your flight and enjoy the last meal of your vacation.

, Use the restrooms. Although most ""pit stops"" only take a few minutes, they can relieve several minutes of boredom inside this airport. This is a great thing to do before you get on your plane, as the restrooms in this airport are much more spacious, comfortable, and well-stocked than those on the plane. If you're traveling with infants or small children, encourage them to use the restroom too and change any of your children's diapers if necessary.

Make sure to allow enough time to use the restrooms before boarding, as long lines can make a trip to the restroom take longer than expected.

, Browse to see what great - and sometimes even cheap - stuff most of the merchants have for you to buy. Even if you have no intent to purchase their stuff, browsing around can still pass some of the time. Each wing of the gates has something, and even some areas of some of the gates have wall areas where newsstands are where newspapers can be purchased without a problem. Sometimes there will be souvenir shops where that last souvenir can be purchased that you almost forgot to send will be located, or where that last postcard you forgot to send to your aunt or uncle (or any other person including yourself at home) can be bought and sent.


There are plenty of restaurants, newsstands, bookstores, and souvenir shops selling Orlando-themed items, so look through the stores for something you like, or simply to entertain yourself while waiting for your plane.

, If you've just started the book, try and read it. If you're halfway through a book, try to finish it. Since this is a busier airport and requires the minimum 2 hour wait time (though if you are well organized you can easily get through in about an hour to hour and a half), what better thing to do in a longer time than finish off that novel that you waited so long to finish that you just couldn't fully get through on the plane that got you there in the first place.


Whether you're reading your book in hard copy or on an e-reader such as a Kindle or Nook, this is always a great option. Portable, quiet, and endlessly entertaining, reading can help you get the most out of the time you have to kill while waiting for your flight to board

, With free Wi-Fi at this airport, feel free to use any device that can connect to the Internet through Wi-Fi. Most iPhones, Android phones and Microsoft phones have Wi-Fi capability, as well as most computers have built-in Wi-Fi detectors you can use. Do not plan to find any Ethernet areas. But be careful of those devices that offer a personal hotspot, as those separate signals may interfere with the free Wi-Fi and you may end up losing your connection.


Do some work. If you brought any work with you, either on paper or on your laptop, finish up any of your remaining work you need to complete as there might be a deadline you will have to deal with. If you're traveling internationally, preparation before the flight is a great time to fill out all necessary customs or immigration forms. But be careful, as some lurkers may like to look overtop, and you wouldn't want any confidential paperwork to be shown to those you don't know.






Make sure that your remaining flight or flights are still on schedule. If your airline offers you a website, check their website with your flight details or if you're flying nonstop to your final destination, find your flight information on a screen above the gate. They will often say either ""on time"" or the time of boarding. If you have one or more connecting flights, ask an airline agent at one of the booths about the status of those connecting flights about the details of that portion of the trip to make sure they're on time. (If they're delayed, having this information early will help you make alternate plans if necessary so that your trip can seem to act accordingly well.







, Whether the games are for one person or for a group of people, these games can include Solitaire, 500 Rummy, Go Fish, War, Uno, Tic-Tac-Toe, Dots or any game, this can really give you some time to kill some time at this airport. However, make sure to keep the noise to a minimum, as you don't want to disturb the other passengers.


You can also use portable gaming devices such as portable PlayStations, Nintendo DS (or Nintendo DSIs) or similar to play games at this airport and pass the time efficiently.

, Make sure that a nearby person will be reliable to let you know when it's time to board the plane. You can nap and/or daydream to pass some of the time as you wait for your flight. This is a great option if you have a long journey or are flying an overnight flight, as you'll need all the rest you can get."

Use a journal.",How to Handle Long Layovers at an Airport," Look at it as a positive experience, one that allows you to meet new people and see new things.;
, However, if your travel plans are flexible, think about scheduling a layover long enough to give you time to visit and shop in the city itself, perhaps a few hours.

, Find out if there are restaurants, shops, or other activities. Some have theatres, museums, gyms, or play areas for the kids; these usually are found in large cities. Check out the airport website for information. If there's a map, print it and mark what you want to see when you get there.


While you're on the airport website, see if there is any service that allows you to deposit your baggage for the duration of your layover. Many airports offer such a service, and it is helpful not to have to haul around the rest of the baggage for your trip, especially if you are leaving the airport.

, Before leaving, find out how long it will take to see specific attractions. Many airports are connected by direct trains or buses, so you can avoid expensive cab fares.

, Most airlines have VIP clubs at major airports where you can enjoy a relaxing, luxurious environment complete with food and drink. VIP clubs also offer services needed for an ""office away from the office."" Membership can run as much as several hundred dollars a year, so unless you travel a great deal, this probably will not be worth it. If you are a frequent flyer member, inquire about getting a day pass, usually for a nominal fee.

, If you plan on getting some work done, bring your computer and other necessary supplies. If, however, you plan on working out, bring gym shorts and a t-shirt. Be prepared for whatever activities that interest you. Minimize your carry-on luggage as it will only weigh you down. Aside from that, you might have a problem with security, exiting the airport as well as returning.

, You do not want to miss your flight. Physically locate your next flight’s gate. This way you will be familiar with getting around the airport and will know if you have a long distance to cover. See if a light rail or shuttle is available, as most large airports these days make it very easy to get from one flight's gate to the other.

, You might be able to get an earlier or later flight if there are seats available, at no extra cost.

, Kids get restless and can make the delay almost unbearable. Bring along a coloring book, or video game that will keep them occupied.

, This will ensure that you will not have to pay an overpriced amount for a book or magazine at the airport book store. It also means you're not limited to the selection at the airport.

, Just washing your hands and face can wake you up and make you feel a lot better.

, If you are between one long flight and another, walk around the airport and restore circulation to your legs. Many airports include public exhibits. Otherwise, you can window-shop, read regional billboards, watch airplanes, or simply look around. Get some fresh air if you can. Exercise will help you relax and provide you with an energy boost so you can get through the rest of your trip.

, Most airports have restaurants and snack bars, even inside security. A meal will give you energy, and it will taste better and likely cost less on the ground than it would in the air. It's wise to keep hydrated when you're flying somewhere, too.

, Airports have lots of people to watch. Have a seat in a public area and see what other travelers are doing.



Talk to people, but only if they seem open to it. A good chat will make time fly, and you might even make lasting connections.

, Bring your laptop with you as some airports offer free wireless Internet throughout. This is the time to put the finishing touches on the presentation you have to make when you arrive at your destination.

, This way if there are gate or time changes, you will still be able to make your flight.


Allow additional time upon your return if you must re-enter through airport security.

, Pick up a blank journal from one of the many bookstores and document your journey, jot down some business concepts, design a building, write down your regrets, write a book, explain your philosophy of life. Keeping a journal is very therapeutic and time consuming!

, If your aircraft is equipped with an in-flight entertainment system, try and locate something akin to a 'Destination Information' clip. If you can't find one in the entertainment system, try searching in the in-flight magazine.

, When deplaning, do not flock to the first restroom you see, if you can help it. Chances are that your fellow passengers will flock to that specific restroom as well, making it extremely crowded. For less of a crowd, try the second or third one you come across.

, Once you've located it, stay near your gate. If your connecting flight isn't on a display board yet, ask a service representative from your airline. In some airports, they'll be waiting for you as you deplane - this is likely to happen if your layover is more than six hours.

, If planning to take a snooze, arrange sleeping shifts with your travel companions, if you have any. Otherwise, keep your bags, etc. under your chair so that a thief would have to move your legs to get to your belongings. Always double-check that you have all of your valuables after going through a crowd.

Remove the necessary items from your carry-on as soon as you get to the belt.,
Make removing your shoes easy.,
Remove all necessary clothing and accessories from your body.,
Stay calm before your flight.,
Don't be afraid of the security guards.,
Step through the metal detector after an employee of the airport has waved you through.,
Try not to be noticeably stressed out.,
Tell the security guards that security checks make you nervous.,
Collect your belongings and put them away.",How to Go Through Airport Security Smoothly," First, pack only what you need to survive; second, what you need to do first; and third, what you need to do last. If you question anything you're packing, then don't pack it. You'd be better safe than sorry. Remember that you can most likely buy it from where you're going. If not, and you don't need it to survive, then don't worry about it.;
, Before you get to the airport, take the necessary precautions to make your experience as simple as possible.


Wear practical shoes. Slip-on shoes will be easier to remove quickly. Of course, make sure they are comfortable enough for standing in long security lines. If you're under 13, you can wear any types of shoes, as long they don't set off the metal detector.
Avoid metallic clothing or accessories, as you will have to remove these before going through a metal detector. The same applies to metal items in your pockets.
Package liquids and gels appropriately. All liquids in your carry-on bag must be in bottles of three ounces or less, and all these bottles must then be placed in a clear, quart-size, zip-style plastic bag. There are a few exceptions to this rule, including milk for infants and liquid medications, but be sure to check before you pack anything.
Pack your belongings in an organized way, so that if there is a problem, they can open your bag, check things out, and move on.
Avoid contraband. Check beforehand to make sure that anything you will bring along, whether in your checked luggage or your carry-on, is allowed on the plane. Otherwise, you may be forced to throw these items away or even face questioning and/or prosecution.

, The line, although long at times, can move quickly, and seasoned travelers can get irritated with anyone that holds up the line digging for the necessary papers.

, It pays to see what other passengers forget.

, Keep your boarding pass in your pocket, as it will be screened again, but put your ID back into your bag to keep it secure.

, Place these items, along with your carry-on, directly on the belt or in the provided bins. Most airports require that you remove any plastic bags full of liquids and any laptops from your carry-on bag, but be sure to follow instructions. If you have completed a ""TSA PRE CHECK"", then don't remove your 311s from your bag or your laptop from its case.

, The TSA requires passengers to remove their shoes when passing through the metal detector. There is not much room to squat down. People will try to pass around you, and benches are inconveniently far from your bags. Wear shoes that you can slip off without bending down or undo your laces before getting in line and tuck them into your shoe. This way, you will be able to slip them off easily to be placed on the X-ray belt. If you're under 13, keep your shoes on while walking through the metal detector, unless they have metal on them. Also, if you're over 75, you can your shoes on. Keep your shoes on if you have completed a TSA PRE CHECK.

, Take off any metal objects, as well as jackets and hats, depending on the airport. If you're under 13, over 75, or in TSA PRE CHECK, leave your jackets on unless if they have metal.

, Don't think about work, bills, or anything that could stress you out. Think about the adventure you're about to have or just had, and how long you're going to remember it for.

, Be polite and respectful, and do as you're told. Remember, if you don't have anything illegal on you, you're good. The security guards are there for your safety, not to scare you. If you don't have TSA PRE CHECK or anything that is ""faster"" than a regular line, you will have to take your shoes off and wait a little longer. This is nothing to stress about; it just adds to the safety of your flight.

, If you are selected for additional screening, comply immediately and politely. Tell security if you have any piercings or surgical implants, or any metal in or on your body that you can't remove. Remember to take off all jewelry that is metallic and lay it in the component bins that will be traveling into the X-ray machine.


Also, for kids under 13 who need extra screening, it's unlikely that they will get patted down. They're more likely to get multiple passes through the metal detector or technology and have their hand swabbed.
If you're 75 or older, you also get a second pass through the metal detector.

, This makes you look suspicious like you have something to hide. In your head, tell yourself ""I have nothing to hide"" repeatedly.

, It's okay to be nervous for a serious TSA check. They will most likely try to help you in any way you need or reassure you. They are people too, and you aren't the first person to be stressed by security.

, Making sure you have everything you need. Leave the security area quickly, making way for other passengers.

You should collect a map of the facility at the entrance or print one off Online to see where you are and where you are going. Airports are notorious for bewildered faces and stressful last-minute marathons to board and check-in.


If you prepare yourself prior to getting to the airport by familiarizing yourself with the company you're flying with, the terminal and times; you will save yourself half the trouble and you will be able to venture through the airport calm and composed.;
, There are many positive ramifications when it comes to arriving on-time to an airport. You are able to comprise yourself, know what you are doing and be equipped. Being punctual and prepared are two very vital steps to exhibiting a poised demeanor and conforming to the practice expected in and around the airport facility.

, It does take up a lot of room and looks very awkward to carry. Fend for a light and tightly packed bag with only the essentials you will need on the flight. It's merely a way to take up as little space as possible, and allow others to have some room.


Plus, you won't have too many belongings to picket while you are walking around.
If you have scales at home, weigh all your luggage prior to arrival so that you have some estimation of how much you have and how much you are allowed on, going by what your check-in documents disclose.

, It is surprising how many people don't understand the premise of forming a single file line. It is morally civil and systematic to wait in a line at the point that you started from, knowing that the people in-front of you have waited longer. At no point should you push-in or jump ahead of the line. Seen as you should be early, wait patiently and you'll eventually reach the check-in counter.

, It's important while waiting in-line to have your Identification documents and other relevant papers ready, this will save the time of ruffling around in your luggage and taking up other peoples time in-line. You will be seen as a primed if you have everything you need ready to go.

, Sometimes in environments that are highly stressful, people can sometimes parade a big show called "" I don't know what I'm doing"". At this time they involve people around them and this can be seen as gauche and insolent. No matter how polite you may be, avoid involving others and asking them impromptu questions. Rather, stick to yourself in a dignified nature.


For example; You may be highly stressed at the security check-point with bags and bags of belongings and things dropping everywhere. You are involving people around you because they would feel an innate burden to help you pick it all up. If you were prepared and only had a comprised satchel of all your needs, you wouldn't require the assistance of others and would be able to glide through security smoothly.
Respecting personal space comes under making an environment for other people comfortable and well-flowing. By being the composed person in line ready to help someone if they need it, rather than being that person, your respectful demeanor and polite civility won't go unnoticed.

, While passing through security screening you may be asked to do various instructions or even be chosen to be tested with drug and bomb examinations. During these times, it's important to relax and be patient, understanding and cooperative. Seen as you will be punctual, there's no reason to feel pressured by time constraints.

, As indicated earlier carrying bags of stuff that need to be submitted at security can be time consuming and just plain extensive. It's important that you can glide in and out of security and be fully aware of everything you are carrying on you to save the time of explaining, deliberating and waiting for whether you can keep that bottle of 'whatever'.

, You've probably seen airport shows where people who have been overseas, forget to declare or choose not to declare items that can cause significant discrepancies to a federation or country. If you do have items that would be of interest to security personal, you need to make sure that you affirm the items to save you, the company and authorities the time it takes to screen you thoroughly.


Remember that security personal aren't entirely worried about the flight you need to catch in ten minutes, they are more interested in methodically checking you. If you have brought something that causes 'warning bells' and you knew it, you have caused yourself some uncomfortable minutes to writhe.

, It's important that if at any time you at the airport and you need to use the bathroom, you carry your belongings with you into the toilet or if you aren't by yourself, that you get someone to mind them for you. Note that an airport is a public space, and there are many opportunities for thieves to target vulnerable people who forget this telling principle.

, If there is a line, wait patiently. Whether you are a Gentlemen or a Lady, always offer a senior citizen, disabled or pregnant women for females, a cubical before yourself. You will most likely be showered with appropriate veneration by the individual or even other patrons.


Remember that good decorum facilitates the idea of a composed behavior that accommodates for the comfortable environment of others around you that intern results in you being highly revered in a situation and makes you feel responsible.

, It should go without saying but many people do purposely forget. You may want to touch as little as possible while visiting a public restroom but at the bare minimum have your own hand sanitizer to use. It stops the spread of diseases like Hepatitis A, and the common Cold and Flu.

, Sometimes you might be spoken to spontaneously by other patrons and it's important to listen and answer to the best of your ability. While answering and speaking to people, you don't need to be to thick-skinned and snap back a response. It's highly likely that you will never see this individual ever again. If asked where certain places are or what the time is, help the person reach the answer they seek and then be on your way.


This shows that you are welcoming and approachable. Find the comfortable median between being a push-over and conceited. Finding the middle digit will show that you are a well rounded person. You won't be used, but you won't be cruel.

, It's important to be smart when speaking to other people, because as harsh as it sounds, everyone is guilty unless proven otherwise. With today's technology and refined pick-pocketing tactics, by the time you arrive and board your bank account can be emptied or identity could be stolen. The gangs that run these assignments are professional and seasoned criminals that target large scale airports with one focus in mind. It's important to be mindful of people around you and where their hands and eyes are. See the 'Warnings' for important tips in regards to criminal activity.

, If someone asks you where you are from or other questions that have personal connotations to them, you can kindly decline answering them. Also keep passports and documents hidden well when sitting near or around people, It only takes someone 2 to 3 quick questions or glances, to search you up on a very handy database for a criminal called; Facebook.

, Whether you are travelling by family, couples or alone. It's important to practice using inside voices to avoid disturbing others around you. If you speak in a calm tone, it's a matter of fact that you will approach a stressful situation with a clear mind and a purer ability to reason.

, It may sound like a childish instruction but the important premise of keeping your hands to yourself while visiting shops and such, go a long way. It diverts you from handling something that might break, drop and who knows what else. Aim to only grab and carry things that you are certain to purchase in these shops.

, Remember to use your magic words ""Please"" and ""Thank-you"", it is standard decorum, however sometimes people do forget when they are out of their comfort zones.

, Avoid consuming foods that may result in unforeseen bowel movements. You will most likely feel terribly uncomfortable while you wait in the terminal or during the flight; and in some cases, make the passengers in close proximity feel that way too. Rather than drink copious amounts of water prior to the flight, take regular small sips to ration out the likelihood of you needing to use the lavatory, depending on the duration of your flight.

, Sounds are a great way to experience an electronic device. However, pings, clicks and swipes do get irksome after a while and can intrude on the people around you. Everyone has their own music tastes as well, so even though blaring Michael Jackson is your norm at home, in an airport people want to stop-over or wait, in peace.

, One of the hardest thing's for a parent is to teach a child to behave in public spaces. However, it isn't an impossible task, and it's important to do so prior to visiting an airport, let alone a plane! Children are usually the main fault when it comes to proper composure and etiquette in an airport.


Strange environments may be stressful or exciting for children however as a parent it is vastly important to insure that your child is where you can see them at all times. Inform your child if they are old enough about everything you are doing to keep them up to date with the trip. It saves the constant questioning and interrupting as to where and what they are doing next.
Remember to reward the child for well-esteemed behavior and discipline them for noncooperation. You should never discipline your child in public places, let alone an airport. It does put others around you on edge and humiliates the child and can result in them having adverse social ramifications later in life.
For example you can promise your child that when you get to the hotel or accommodation, they will be rewarded a treat if their behavior is constantly compliant throughout the ordeal. If they were not, let them know they won't be getting a treat and instead losing a privilege (No iPad or iPod for one day of the vacation).
If you have an infant, insure you escape to quiet areas of an airport to settle the child down. There are usually family rooms that you can resort to rather than interrupting people around you with screaming and crying.

, Rather than dumping all your belongings down and taking up an entire seating arrangement, try to keep your belongings by your side and allow for people to sit. As the boarding time draws imminent, more people will arrive and the terminal will fill up rapidly.

, If at any point in your visit you get lost, you loose something or you're just totally bewildered; you can find a help desk to get some clarity. Remember to also notify an airport officer if you break something and there is dangerous glass or chemicals. If you or a child (if you have one) vomits or misses the bathroom, it's common decorum to tell someone so that they can clean up the mess.


Don't think that you're judged or dwell on the humiliation, airport officials deal with this every-day.
If you do miss your flight, it gets canceled or you can't find your gate and they are boarding, you need to be able to familiarize yourself with the airports uniform or the closest help desk to get the latest information so that you can dodge stress attacks.
If you do see an individual participating in reckless behavior, causing a hazard to you or someones else, you need to be able to contact airport security. Security in an airport is one of the highest trained in the world. Note down the particular event and key thing's or clothing the person or group was wearing. It's important to describe people in a frank and honest way. Describing people in situations like criminal activity is understandably not a time for perfect political correctness; "" They were of a Caucasian decent with long scraggly hair"" is plausible.

, Sometimes in international airports you may get the occasional superstar that steals the attention of almost everyone. It's important to be calm and not act ridiculously by chasing, screaming or carrying on. If you do have the opportunity to see a personage in the flesh at the airport, it's important to treat them with respect. If they are someone you admire, it's fine to ask for a quick signature; but comprehend that their schedule is far more rigid than yours, and in most cases you may be on holidays but they are actually at work. They may have flown for many hours, they are probably tired and maybe a little not in the mood for their number one fan.


Keep your distance when getting close to the entourage. It's more than likely that the paparazzi will be more focused on getting their million dollar snap than avoiding a collision with you.
Hold yourself from running at the celebrity, their body guards are tarnished for their unsympathetic and in some cases, brutal defense techniques.

, If you have the rare opportunity to fly first class in luxury, you will most likely have the privilege of residing in the First Class lounge at the airport. This is a place where you can socialize with other people and share the destination you are going, and listen to others.

, These people are highly trained and equipped with well-esteemed communicating and facilitating skills. They will be able to help you each step of the way from checking -in, to boarding. Be courteous and respectful and avoid being too demanding when requesting various things.


It's seen to be a great quality if you are able to remember your Concierge or Host's name. They will remember yours, so show them your erudition by recalling theirs.

, Don't forget to smile and show you are having an enjoyable time, because you will! It is most likely that you will be seated on the plane first through a separate boarding platform, so remember to smile at people who board the plane from economy as they pass you. This will show you aren't to preppy and that you acquire a mannerly nature.

, Sometimes when the boarding call is announced, many passengers think it's appropriate to jump up and get inline first. Relax and remember that your seat is reserved for you. The plane still needs to board special needs, children and first class passengers before the line even budges. If you are in economy, it's important to exercise patients and wait in-line. You will eventually get seated.

, To save the time of the airline, other people and yourself, it's important to have your ticket ready to go and not at the bottom of your carry on luggage.

, It's a good idea to say ""thank-you"" and respond clearly and warmly if and when the flight attendant welcomes you on board. Try reading their name badge and when they say something like "" Good-Morning Mr Smith, Welcome aboard; Your seat is 4 rows down on the left"", reply with something like "" Thank-you for your help Gloria, I hope to see you during the flight sometime"", rather than the common "" Thanks"" or in some cases nothing at all.

The permitted size of carry-on bags varies from airline to airline. Check the requirements for the airline with which you will travel to learn how big your carry-on bag can be.Remember that certain items are only permissible when packed in a checked bag.;
, TSA, or Transportation Security Administration and other national bodies have guidelines for a variety of items, ranging from foods and liquids to weapons. Consider what items you need to pack that might be prohibited or restricted:Food items
Liquids, such as bath products
Sporting goods
Tools
Self defense items
Sharp objects.

, There are not many things that TSA and other relevant organizations completely prohibits, compared to the number of things that are allowed. However, many items are only permitted when they are packed in your checked bag. Research your questionable items and learn if they are only permissible when checked.


Most liquids and some food items, like gravies and sauces or sometimes even ketchup, must be 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) or less in order to be allowed in a carry-on bag. The rules may be different for necessities such as medicine, but there still are restraints for that., While you may be inclined to pack several different outfits and pairs of shoes, consider packing only a few basic essentials and pack tighter by pairing them different ways.If you want to limit your packing to a carry-on only, then you have a limited amount of space. On the other hand, while you have more space in a checked bag, you will be charged more if it is overweight.


Additionally, overpacking your carry-on or checked bag might result in it not fitting into the airline-approved measurements, in which case you might have to remove items from your bag to put into another bag or leave it at the airport.Checked bag fees start at $25 for one checked bag at most US airlines and go up from there, with increases for multiple checked bags and bags that are overweight., Because liquids and aerosols have the potential to explode due to the changing air pressure of air travel, TSA and other relevant organizations have special regulations about them.


All liquid items that are 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) or smaller can go in your carry-on, and they must be packed in one 1-quart bag. Each traveler is only permitted to have one of these bags.Items that are larger that 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) can be packed in a checked bag. They do not have to be enclosed in a zip-top bag, but it is recommended in order to protect your other packed belongings.
Medications and nourishment items for infants and children are exempt from these rules., One of the easiest ways to save space in your luggage is to change how you pack your clothing. Instead of folding your clothing and stacking it, roll it up so that it takes up less space.Rolling your clothing not only saves space but also reduces wrinkles in clothes.

, Start packing your bag by putting all of the heaviest items on the bottom, such as shoes. Then, start layering your rolled clothes on top, starting with the heaviest or largest rolled items, like sweaters or jeans, and moving to the lightest items.Packing your items in this way prevents your clothes from being further compressed and wrinkled by being buried under heavier items.
Put toiletries and other light items on top so that they are easily accessible for removing at the security checkpoint.

, If you are packing boots or shoes, you can pack small clothing items, like undergarments, inside them. This saves packing space for other items, but only do this with items that you do not mind getting wrinkled.

, When taking both a carry-on item and a checked bag, consider putting a change of clothes in your carry-on, just in case your checked bag does not make it to your destination.This way, you have at least one additional set of clothing to wear until you receive your checked bag.
It would also be helpful to include some key toiletry items, like a toothbrush, toothpaste, and deodorant, as long as they meet the 3.4 fluid-ounce (100.6 ml) requirement.

, If you are using a suitcase, either a small one for a carry-on or a large one for a checked bag, avoid putting bulky items in the outer zipper pockets. Doing so causes the bag to become overstuffed, causing it to no longer fit airline size requirements.Put magazines, thin books, or other slim items in these pockets.

, TSA checks all luggage, and they ask that it not be locked so that they can easily access it. If you lock it, they may damage your luggage trying to get it open. TSA is not liable when this happens.TSA does have approved locks that they can open with their own tools, including Safe Skies and Travel Sentry.

, Airlines now allow travelers to check in for their flights and secure their seats online up to 24 hours in advance. You can do this via airline apps on smartphones or on their websites.


Checking in online ahead of time also saves you time in getting to the airport, because you can head straight to security and skip the check-in lines upon arrival.

, If you check in early, you can print or access your boarding pass through your airline's mobile app. Be sure to print it out or take a screenshot of it on your smartphone, in case you have no service in the airport to access the mobile app.


If you check in at the airport, then airline agents will provide you with your boarding pass at that time.

, Identification is required for adult travelers who are 18 and older. Children under the age of 18 are not required to have identification when they are traveling with an adult companion. You must have a valid form of identification, including but not limited to:U.S. driver's license
U.S. passport
U.S. passport card
U.S. military ID
Permanent resident card
Government-issued passport
Border crossing card.

, Be aware of what time your flight is supposed to depart and what time boarding is supposed to begin. Plan to be at the airport with enough time to get through security and make it to your gate on time.


Airlines recommend that you arrive 30-45 minutes prior to departure for domestic flights, depending on whether you have to check any baggage. For international flights, it is recommended that you arrive at least two hours prior to departure to allow time for completing international requirements.Accommodate for extra time if you have to drive yourself and park in long-term parking. You will have extra time for traveling from the parking lot to the terminal via the airport shuttle.
If your airport is large and extremely busy, take that into consideration and arrive early, just to be sure. Also think about what day of the week you are traveling. Weekends are usually busy travel times, which means the airport and security checkpoint might be busier.

, You will need your boarding pass and a form of identification, and when you reach the screening checkpoint, you will need to have certain items easily accessible to put through screening. Keep them at the top of your carry-on so that you do not have to dig through it to find them.


Liquids and aerosols in the quart-sized bag
Technology devices
Medically necessary medications and liquids
Nourishment items for infants and children.

, When going through security, you have to remove a variety of items—or not wear them at all—in order to pass the screening.You will put these in their own containers to pass through the X-ray machine, and then you can proceed through the metal detector.


Shoes
Coats, jackets, and sweaters
Belts
Coins
Cell phones
Jewelry.

, If you do have liquid medications or breast milk, formula, or juice for an infant or child, you need to alert the TSA or other officers so that it can be screened properly.


Let the TSA officer or other representative know that you have medically necessary liquids or medications when you are going through the screening. If you also need items such as ice packs, syringes, pumps, and IV bags, notify the officer about those, as well. It is helpful to have them labeled for easy screening. Keep all of these items separate from other liquids, like bath and hygiene products. Any ice packs or frozen gel packs that are necessary for your medication must be frozen solid at the security checkpoint. You do have the option to not have your medication screened by X-ray or to not have it opened, but in that case, other screening measures will have to be taken.If you have nourishment items for an infant or child, you are also allowed to bring them in excess of 3.4 fluid ounces (100.6 ml) in a carry-on item, and they can be in a zip-top bag larger than one quart. However, they must be separate from other liquids that you are checking through security. Alert the officer that you have these items so that they can be screened correctly. The officer may want to X-ray or open your breast milk, formula, or juice, but you can deny that if you would like to. In that case, other screening measures will have to be taken. Ice packs and frozen gel packs will need to be frozen solid at the time you go through security. Other items such as canned, jarred, and processed baby food are permitted, as well as liquid-filled teethers, but they will also have to be screened., Once you are through security, use the signs in the airport to help you find your gate. It is best to go straight there in order to avoid missing your flight and to make sure that you know where it is.


After you have found your gate, you can go to the restroom, get something to eat, or shop, if you have time.

, Make the boarding process faster for yourself and everyone else by keeping any items that you anticipate you will want during the flight in the carry-on item that you will put under the seat in front of you. This will save you from digging through your carry-on item before sitting down and holding up the boarding process., After getting through security, you can go to the restaurants and shops in your terminal to buy drinks. You can also pack TSA-approved snacks in your carry-on to avoid buying them from vendors in the terminal.


Being prepared with snacks and drinks will help tide you over until you get to your destination, because although flights still do beverage service, many short haul flights no longer offer food or snacks. When they do offer meals, you normally have to pay for them.
An alternative is to eat at one of the airport restaurants. These are usually overpriced, but if you have a long time to wait or will have a long time before you can get your next meal, it is a good idea to eat at a restaurant.

, It can be hard to find places to charge your technology in airports. Many other people are trying to do the same thing, so finding power outlets is tricky.


Once you are on your plane, you will be asked to power off your electronic devices or put them in Airplane Mode. Be sure to do this to avoid interference with airline signals. Remember that you cannot access any apps that require cellular data or Wi-Fi when your smartphone or other device is in Airplane Mode.
Many airlines now offer Wi-Fi on flights, but it is almost always for a fee. Determine whether it is worth the money to access Wi-Fi on the flight. For example, if you are taking a business trip and have work to do while you travel, it will likely be worthwhile. If your trip is for pleasure, though, and you have no real need for using Wi-Fi other than entertainment, it might not be worth the price.

, To pass time on layovers and during travel, bring books, crossword puzzles, word searches, or other types of entertainment. You can read by yourself, read to one of your travel companions, or work on the puzzles with travel companions.

, Either while you are traveling or while you wait in the airport for your flight, you can take a nap. Airports and airplanes are not the most comfortable places to sleep, but if you have an extremely early flight, overnight flight, or long travel day, it is a great time to get some rest., Once your plane has reached a certain altitude, your flight attendants will announce that approved electronic devices can be used. If you would like to use your technology, you can watch a movie or a TV show to pass the time.


Some airplanes have small TV screens in the backs of the headrests, so you can watch what is on those TVs. Keep in mind that you usually have to pay extra to access more desirable channels, instead of watching their infomercial channels or a map of your travel.

Consider the time of which you will be traveling.,
As your kids and you are walking through the aisle to find your seats, remind them to keep their bags low to the ground and in front of them so they don't trip up some unnoticed passenger right onto the ground.,
As you are waiting for the plane to take off, let your kids immerse themselves in the booklets or safety card.,
As the plane takes off, make sure they have their seat belts fastened.,
As the plane gets higher, the cabin pressure will start to affect your younger passengers ears.,
If your kids are going to the bathroom or just exercising, teach them not to grab on passengers' chairs.,
The most common reason a child gets rowdy is because of jet lag.,
Another reason a child gets rowdy, is because of boredom.",How to Teach Your Children to Practice Airplane Etiquette," Most kids are too rowdy when it is daytime because of jet lag and time differences in different time zones. Before you leave, consider the time zone in the country you are traveling to and the time when you will be traveling. The most easiest time to travel is during nighttime when the kids are exhausted from waiting in the airport and want a nap for an hour or two, and can prevent jet lag. It's not fun to have jet lag and your kids are more likely to be rowdy and upset.;

, If they are old enough, teach them how to fasten their seat belts and unfasten them by themselves.

, This will be alarming for kids, especially toddlers and those who are first traveling by air. Pack some sweets or chewing gum for them to suck on, or if they are old enough, teach them to pinch their nose and blow without any air coming out from the mouth or nose.

, This is disturbing and rude to some passengers. Instead have an older sibling or parent to escort them or have them copy what the flight attendants do. Get them to grab luggage compartments above them, if they are tall enough.

, Once the plane has taken off, encourage the child to sleep. Pack the cuddly teddy bear she sleeps with or her ""sleepy blanket"" to help her sleep. If your child has a history of sleeping problems (insomnia, night terrors etc.) consult your child's doctor for a medication to take before sleeping or if she is known to bed wet pack an extra pair of clothes and a blanket.

, Pack in your child's backpack, a new toy, a couple of games, her Nintendo, a couple of books, some color pencils and paper, her journal, a personal DVD player and a couple of movies or, even better, her laptop. The more things she has to get occupied with, the least likely she is going to act up.

Think about the situation logically.,
When you feel nervous, tell yourself calmly that planes are safe.,
Make yourself as comfortable in your seat as possible.,
Just because you’re on the airplane doesn’t mean your mind has to be.,
Relieve your stress with simple exercises if you feel that your emotions are just too out of control or that you can’t concentrate on anything else.,
Once you're in the air and feel a little better (like after you’ve done some relaxation exercises), distract yourself!,
Pretend that you love flying.,
Talk to someone.,
Sleeping is a good option for flights.,
The biggest thing is to distract your mind and control your stress when it reaches a high point.",How to Relieve Flying Anxiety," Even though your emotions might feel powerful, take a step back and look at the big picture.


Airplanes are a very safe mode of transportation.You have a much higher chance of getting injured or killed driving on the free-way (or even sitting in your own home) than flying in an airplane.By the data, there is a 99.99999771% chance that your flight will arrive without trouble.Lots of people are scared to fly, but the fact is, the chances of anything going wrong in an aircraft are virtually zero. If you don’t believe it, do some research yourself and find out!;
, Also try to think about your destination and how much fun it will be. If you hear or feel something that confuses you ask your flight attendant. Most likely he/she will have a very logical explanation and will reassure you that nothing is wrong. For example, many people dislike turbulence. However, turbulence is nothing to fear. It is the plane's way of coping with changing air flows. The pilots aren't fighting to stay in control of the plane and a wing will NOT break off.


Try getting a pen and writing down all of the reasons why you're feeling anxious. Go through it in your head thinking carefully about each fear. Ask yourself 'why am I scared of this?' ' what will happen?' And any other questions like that. Think positive. Talk to someone about some of the fears. See if that helps.

, It's hard not to feel stressed when you're too cold or sore from the hard seat.


Be sure to bring along a small throw blanket, a pillow, a shawl, slippers, a sweatshirt or whatever will make you comfy while traveling.
Close your window cover or ask your neighbor to if you don't like heights.
Wear a hat. It is scientifically proven that the simple act of wearing a cozy hat can relieve mental insecurity and make you feel more at ease.Bring something that makes you happy or comforts you. This might include a favorite small plush animal or maybe some kind of comfort food to indulge yourself in.

, Sometimes, though, just the noise of the engines is enough to stir someone up. Bring an mp3 player or iPod with quiet, calming music or nature sounds; you can get many free apps for iPods for this.


Close your eyes, pull up your blanket, and try this easy technique:

Hold your body still and breathe deeply. Listen closely to the nature sounds that you have on. Release (relax) your muscles and imagine you are wherever your sounds are (maybe on the beach or in a rainforest). Concentrate as much as possible on this. It might be a little hard at first but whenever an outside thought pops into your mind, push it out and keep focused that peaceful place in your mind.



, Bring along a small squeeze ball or stuffed animal to discretely squeeze as hard as you can. Just keep squeezing and squeezing and eventually you will have released a good deal of energy. This will help alleviate tension.


You can also try this: Starting with your feet, and moving up your whole body, tense and squeeze all the muscles in your body as hard as possible. Hold this as long as you can and then gently and slowly, from head to toe, release all you tension and completely relax every muscle in your body. Take a few slow sips of water, take a few deep breaths and repeat if necessary. This should help. Basically, when you feel that you can’t control your anxiety, do some simple in seat exercises that will drain excess energy.

, Watch a movie, read a good book or magazine, listen to music, eat, play a game, talk to someone, go on your laptop, do a craft project or a crossword puzzle--anything to keep you busy. Even if you don’t like reading, audio books are calming, soothing and distracting.

, play this game:


Put a big smile on your face. Sit back in your chair and try to display the utmost confidence. When the attendant comes by ask what time the flight will be arriving. Pull out an activity and start to do it. Whatever you do don't act nervous! This in it of itself will make you feel to much better.

, This can make you feel much better. if you're traveling with someone start up a perfectly normal conversation about your destination, a movie you saw, etc. If there is a stranger next to you who doesn't seem busy, say ""hi"" and introduce yourself. Even if you don't really talk they will appreciate that you're being friendly.

, See How to Sleep on a Plane for more info.

, If you try to do these things, you should be fine. Remember, flying makes everyone at least a little nervous, but, if you follow these techniques, you'll be there before you know it!

,
Go online.",How to Purchase Consolidator Airline Tickets," If price is your number-one priority, booking consolidator airplane tickets can save you money.;
, A travel agent is the best way to purchase tickets from a reputable consolidator. Travel agents who deal with consolidator tickets will have a list of consolidators they work with on a consistent basis so they know who is reputable and who is not. Although they may add a slight mark-up to the ticket, the price you pay will be less than anywhere else you purchase the tickets. Plus, if you have a problem with flight delays or cancellations, you have a person to contact.

,, Although many travel sites advertise that they sell wholesale fares, only a few of them actually do. Each of these sites have a large selection of consolidator tickets and they handle the customer service on behalf of the consolidator so you have an advocate in case of a problem. If you use an online consolidator make sure you can contact the company off the Internet, in case of emergencies.

Use a quick trick to reduce stomach upset.,
Ask for an aisle seat.,
Shift position.,
Turn on the ventilation nozzle.,
Use an air sickness bag.",How to Survive an Upset Stomach on an Airplane1," Are you close to throwing up in the air? There are some small measures you can take that might help you feel better fast.


Put pressure on the inside of your wrist. Press down, gently but firmly, with your fingers about two fingertip widths above your hand’s bottom.Suck on hard candy to keep your saliva going. This will help reduce the feeling of a sick stomach in many cases.
Ask for lemons. They will settle an upset stomach. The flight attendants might have some on their beverage trolley. Suck on the lemon wedges.;
, It’s easier to rush to the bathroom if you’re sitting next to the aisle. If you’re a queasy flyer, request one!


To reduce motion sickness, focus your eyes on a distant fixed point. Keep your mind occupied. Do a Crossword puzzle or play a game on your computer.
Take a long, deep breath through your nose, and then slowly breathe out. Take advantage of times that the seatbelt sign goes off, and take a bathroom break. This might help relieve some of your stomach stress.
Ask to sit near the plane’s wing, where it’s most stable or back by the bathroom so you're close. Be aware that the back of a plane is the bumpiest, usually. You're more likely to get sick to your stomach in the back., Don’t stay crouched in the same position. Give your body some relief by moving as much as you can!


You will want to stretch somehow, either by walking to the bathroom or while sitting in your seat.
Massaging the abdomen can also lower pain from gas. Do this gently.Try to shift position in your seat every half hour if you can’t get up. You can do this by crossing your legs, leaning forward, or putting your feet on your carry-on bag.

, This is the small nozzle you can turn on above you to direct air towards your face.


The gush of fresher air might make you feel somewhat better. Move your seat back and recline if you are allowed to do so.
Look at the sky out the window, if you have a window seat, with your head slightly tilted back. Focus on the horizon.If your upset stomach is caused by anxiety, try to calm down by listening to calming music or by sleeping.
Try to stay warm by requesting a blanket to at least cover your legs. Reading can increase motion sickness., They are there for a reason! Even if you’re not sure you’re going to throw up, it’s a good idea to have one ready.


You can usually find air sickness bags in the back of the chair in front of you. You might want to hold two of them near you.
If you can’t find one, ask the flight attendant. Letting the flight attendant know you’re feeling sick can also be a good idea in general. They may let you move to a seat closer to the toilet.Don’t feel embarrassed. Studies have shown that people have more flatulence and also bloating while flying, and that doesn’t account for the fact that some people just get nervous in the air, making it worse."
"
Drink a lot of water.,
Avoid alcohol and caffeine.,
Take supplements.",How to Survive an Upset Stomach on an Airplane2," You want to avoid carbonated drinks like sodas because they can cause bloating and cramping. Instead, stay hydrated by regularly drinking water.


In addition, carbonated drinks have a diuretic effect. Instead, drink water. It will also help if your stomach is upset on the flight. Take regular sips of the water, rather than downing it all at once.
Drink water 24 to 48 hours before your trip too at regular intervals.It’s a good idea to drink at least 8 ounces of water for each hour that you’re in the air. Take a water bottle on the plane; there’s no ban on it, generally., Drinking either one of these before you fly or during the flight could make you feel sicker.


Alcohol could lead to a sick stomach. It can also make it harder to fall asleep after you wake up.
Instead, in addition to water, choose beverages that have a lot of electrolytes, such as those in tomato or fruit juice. Other beverages can also help hydrate you.
In addition, try not to drink alcohol the night before you fly. Having a hangover is going to make an upset stomach much more likely.

, There are many different supplements that can help ease or prevent an upset stomach.


Use magnesium to destress. This is a muscle relaxant, and some people add it to herbal tea.Other sources of magnesium include organic cereal and cacao nibs. Digestive enzymes can also help you on board.

Avoid certain foods before you fly.,
Do eat something.,
Bring medicine.",How to Survive an Upset Stomach on an Airplane3," It’s easier to reduce the chances you will get a sick stomach on an airplane in the first place. .


Airports don’t have a lot of great food options, but downing a fast-food meal before flying is a recipe for an upset stomach on board.Better choices are natural foods, like carrots and nuts. It’s harder to digest foods full of salt and saturated fat while flying. Avoid eating food that causes gas and bloating, such as fried foods, but also avoid foods like baked beans, cauliflower, and onions.
Avoid anything you have an intolerance for; for example, if you’re lactose intolerant, avoid dairy. , If you fly on an empty stomach, you might feel sick to it. Try to eat something but make it something bland.Snack on pretzels. Bring some along, although most airlines offer them while you’re on board. If you're feeling sick, ask the flight attendant for some crackers.Strive to eat foods that are higher in protein, such as a peanut butter sandwich, meat, or fish. These will fill your stomach and settle it.
If you didn’t bring any food along, don’t reject the airline meal completely. Nibble on fruit or crackers, at least.

, Just in case, bring along some Pepto Bismol when you fly. That way, if your stomach is feeling sick, you’ll be prepared.


Remember that Pepto Bismol comes in chewable form, which is obviously a better choice on a plane than a liquid bottle. You could also purchase motion sickness bands. These bands work because they have a small knob on the inside that applies constant pressure to reduce nausea.
Take an over the counter medicine like Gas-X or other Anti-Gas pills if you’re worried you’re going to get a sick stomach in the air. It’s not recommended to fly if you’ve recently had stomach surgery.Be aware if you have chronic intestinal inflammation that some studies have found that travel can lead to bouts of it, partly due to the lack of oxygen in an airplane."

Keep your movements slow and smooth, and make sure your back is neutral and your feet are flat on the floor.
To stretch your shoulders, reach your left arm in front of you and wrap your right hand around your left elbow. Slowly pull your left arm to your right, across your chest. Hold the stretch for about 15 seconds, then slowly release. Repeat with your other arm. Since this stretch requires a little bit of room, wait until you debark the plane to do it.

, Your hips and thighs can get tight and stiff after sitting in your seat for a long period of time. You can do this stretch in the airport after the flight, or in the aisle of the aircraft – just make sure you don't kick anybody.Put one hand on a wall or the back of a seat for balance. With your other hand, reach back and grab the ankle on the same side of your body, pulling your foot up toward your body. Your knee should be facing down towards the floor.
Make sure you are standing straight with good posture and your shoulders back. Engage your core and breathe from your belly, expanding your chest as you inhale and collapsing it as you push the air out.
Hold the stretch for a few seconds, breathing deeply. Then release your foot and slowly lower it to the ground before repeating the stretch with the opposite leg.

, Child's pose is a common yoga pose used to ground and calm yourself mentally and physically. It also provides a good stretch for your hips, back, shoulders, and chest.You may want to move to an area where you have privacy. If you're not in your hotel room, try to find a secluded corner in the airport where there isn't much foot traffic and you won't have to worry about anyone stepping on you or tripping over you.
Kneel on the floor with your knees in front of you and slightly spread. As you inhale, stretch forward slowly, hinging at the hips and reaching over your knees. If you can comfortably rest your forehead on the floor, do so – otherwise, bend forward only as far as is comfortable.

, You can do the Figure 4 pose from a standing position, or lying on your back next to a wall. The standing position allows you to practice your balance and concentration, but after a long flight you may find the reclining position more stable.To do a standing Figure 4 pose, start standing with your feet just touching and lower your hips into chair pose.

Get up periodically during the flight.,
Make sure your back and neck are adequately supported.,
Twist in your seat.,
Ease lower back pain with the malasana pose.",How to Stretch After a Long Flight2," The best thing you can do for your back and legs is to get up and walk around every hour or so when you're on a long flight. This will improve your circulation and keep you from getting stiff sitting in the same position.Even with the best posture, sitting for long periods of time puts a lot of stress on the spine. Look over the cabin and see if there's room where you can pace or do some quick stretches periodically. Otherwise you can just walk up and down the aisle.
If you're at higher risk for deep vein thrombosis, you want to get up and walk around the cabin every 15 or 20 minutes on flights lasting three hours or more.People who have had DVTs in the past are at an even higher risk of getting one again.

, Particularly on long flights, airplane seats can put significant stress on your back and neck if you're not sitting correctly. Bring along travel pillows to support your back and neck, especially if you plan to spend part of the flight sleeping.You can buy an inexpensive travel pillow before you leave at most discount or department stores. If you wait until you get to the airport, you'll pay significantly more for it.
When sitting in your seat, your knees should be at right angles when your feet are flat on the floor. This alleviates some of the pressure on your spine. If yours are not, see if you can get a pillow or a blanket to put under your knees to correct the angle.

, A simple seated twist can relax your spine on long flights, helping to prevent back pain and stiffness. You may not have room to do this on particularly crowded flights, unless you take advantage of a moment when someone in your row has gotten up.To perform the seated twist, simply grab the seat's armrest with both hands and gently twist your torso to the side toward your hands.
As you twist, keep your hips and lower body facing forward, twisting only your back. Your back should be flat and neutral.
Hold the twist, breathing deeply, then slowly release and repeat the motion on the other side. Don't twist any further than is comfortable, and don't try to force your body to twist more deeply than is natural.

, The malasana pose is another yoga pose that works well to stretch your hips and legs, as well as ease the tension in your lower back following a long flight. This also is a good grounding pose if you need to calm yourself after the anxiety of travel.You can do this pose anywhere, just make sure you're out of the way where people won't trip over you.
Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, your toes turned out slightly. Lower your hips into a squat, then go further, bending your legs so that your knees are pointed toward the ceiling and your calves touch the backs of your thighs.
You can brace your upper arms on the insides of your knees and bring your palms together in front of your chest, remaining upright, and breathe deeply.

Stretch and roll your ankles.,
Extend your legs into the aisle.,
Do calf raises.,
Prop your legs up against a wall.,
Lift your knees and feet periodically.,
Try the knee-to-chest stretch.",How to Stretch After a Long Flight3," While seated on the flight, you should move your feet and ankles frequently to improve circulation in your legs and feet. This also will ease swelling in your feet and ankles, which is common on long flights.To stretch your ankles, sit upright in your seat with both of your feet flat on the floor. Flex your ankles and raise your toes toward your shins, then bring them back down. Then lift your heels, keeping your toes on the floor. You should do this several times during your flight. You also can do this exercise in the airport while resting between flights.
Ankle circles are another way to get blood flowing to your feet. Lift one foot off the floor slightly, then roll your foot around as though you were drawing a circle with your toes. Do this a couple of times, then switch directions and do it a few more times. Repeat the same movement with your other foot.

, If you're lucky enough to have an aisle seat, you have an opportunity to stretch out your stiff legs mid-flight to improve circulation into your legs and feet. From another seat, you may be able to move into the aisle or the rear of the plane and do a similar exercise.To do leg extensions, all you have to do is lift your foot up and extend your leg straight out. In a seated position, maintain good posture and raise up slightly so that the back of your thigh isn't touching the seat.
If you're doing this while standing in the aisle or the back of the plane, make sure you have something to hold to keep your balance, and that you have enough room to extend your leg without tripping or kicking anyone.

, This exercise stretches your calves and gets the blood flowing to your lower legs and down to your feet. Since you must be standing to do this exercise, it may be best to wait until after the plane lands and you're in an airport.Stand with your feet about hip-width apart. Inhale and rise to your tiptoes, maintaining good posture.
Hold that position for a few seconds, then slowly lower down to your flat feet. Make sure you lower in a controlled movement – don't simply drop your heels.
For an added stretch, you can do this exercise off the edge of a stair. Put the balls of your feet on the stair and your heels off the edge. Lower your heels below the level of the stair, then raise them up. Make sure you have something to hold onto for balance.

, After a long flight, you may find that your feet, ankles, and calves are swollen. This inverted yoga pose gets the blood flowing in your lower legs again, as well as gently stretching your legs and lower back.It is very important to do this after a long flight.


Lay on your back on the floor with your hips close to the wall. Press your feet up on the wall and slowly walk them up until your legs are extended straight and your calves are leaning against the wall.
You may have to adjust your body so that this is comfortable, or put a pillow or rolled blanket under your hips to cushion them. You don't want your buttocks to be pressed up against the wall.
Relax your upper body and let your arms fall out to your sides. You can stay in this pose as long as you like, breathing deeply.
When you're ready to get back up, bend your knees and press the soles of your feet flat against the wall for a breath before getting out of the pose.

, Lifting your knees and feet every few minutes during a long flight is key to keep the blood flowing in your legs and help prevent deep vein thrombosis, as well as swollen ankles and calves.To lift your knees, sit up straight in your seat with your feet flat on the floor in front of you. Tense your quadriceps muscles in your thighs to raise your legs an inch or two off the seat. Hold that position for a few seconds, breathing deeply, then slowly release.
Also with your feet flat on the floor in front of you, do alternating toe raises and heel raises. This not only helps relieve tension and stress, but also gets the blood flowing down to your feet and keeps it from pooling in your legs.

, The knee-to-chest stretch is one recommended by airline crews to best get blood flowing to your legs and help prevent deep vein thrombosis. This is a simple exercise that you can do in your seat throughout the flight.Sit up straight in your seat with both feet flat on the floor. Lean forward slightly, hinging at the hips, and fold your hands together behind your left knee.
Pull your left knee up to your chest as far as it will comfortably go, and hold it there for 15 seconds, then slowly release. Be careful not to force your knee further – this stretch should not hurt. Don't bounce or pulse during this stretch.
Once you've released the left knee, come back up to center and clasp your hands behind your right knee to repeat the same motion.

However, many airfare search engines are actually owned or operated by major airlines, meaning unbiased searches are off the menu. Rather than sticking to search engines you see advertised on television, look for search engines that hunt down the cheapest fares among large airlines and small ones alike.


Try out matrix.itasoftware.com. This website was developed by MIT in the 90’s and works by searching other airfare search engines. Flight inception? Maybe. But definitely one of the best means of finding cheap flights.Use skyscanner.net. This neat website searches all airlines, big and small, and allows you to look for the cheapest rates out of your local, rather than getting bogged down with specifics. Meaning, if you know you want to go on vacation but aren’t too picky about where, this website will provide the cheapest flights to everywhere in the world from the nearest airports to you.
Momondo.com is a great option for searching airlines for cheap international flights. Rather than getting stuck paying high prices for large international carriers, this site will provide even the smallest international carriers in its search options.;
, This is a very simple and effective trick to find cheap flights. Sometimes flights from local airport to your destination can be quite expensive while, on the contrary, flights from nearby airports can be really cheap. For example, international flights from Seattle are quite cheap when compared to international flights from Vancouver and the distance between the two cities is only 234 km (about a two and half hour drive). So driving or taking a bus to the nearby airport is sometimes a good way to get to your destination cheaply.

, Although airfare search engines are great, what they don’t tell you is that some airlines reserve their best deals for people who visit their sites specifically. Search for a list of large and local carriers in your area, and then search each of their sites specifically for the best deals. When coupons, discounts, or sales are offered, they will typically only be advertised on each specific carrier’s site and will run for only 1-3 days.

, Spamming your email or message inbox on your phone doesn’t seem like the most organized way to get a deal, but travel alerts often offer amazing prices you wouldn’t otherwise be aware of. If your favorite airlines or airfare search engine offers travel alerts sent to your phone or email, sign yourself up! You won’t regret the few seconds it takes to delete those extra unwanted messages when you get the ones worth several hundred dollars worth of savings.


Airfarewatchdog.com is a website run by people (not a computer) who search for the best deals and send them to your email. You can add specific search criteria via their site as well, allowing only deals pertaining to certain locations or times to be sent to your inbox.
Flightfox.com is run by travel agents who individually search and hand-pick the best deals to be sent to you. This service requires a 29$ startup fee, but the site claims it will be fully refunded if you aren’t pleased with your results., You may feel silly adding an airline to your “liked” pages on Facebook or following them on Twitter, but the benefit of doing so is the special offers you’ll receive. Airlines want to reward regular customers and encourage them to continue flying with them, so they will often advertise special low rates and discounts via social media sites only. Follow as many airlines as you can for the best chances of getting a sweet deal., Turns out, there is a best time to search for flights. After several studies of domestic (to the US) air carriers, it has been determined that the best time to search for flights is around 3:00pm Eastern time on a Tuesday. Why? Around this time is when airlines release their discounted flight options, and look to fill up last-minute flights for the upcoming weekend. Therefore, save your flight searching for a mid-afternoon break on the nearest upcoming Tuesday., Ok, 3:00pm on a Tuesday afternoon, got it. That’s not all though; searching a specific number of days from your flight is also necessary for getting the lowest price. Search at the earliest 3 months before your flight, and at the latest 18 days before your flight. It has been determined that the best deals are posted for flights about 6 weeks prior to their takeoff, so aim for about a month and a half before your trip to search for plane tickets.

, Looking for flights on single airlines may be the easiest, but you may have better results if you look into flying on multiple airlines. Try taking one airline to your destination, and a separate one from. Or, include a layover with another airline mid-flight. Breaking up your trip and splitting it between carriers is likely to save you money, which is worth the extra time and hassle it will cost you., You need your flight, a hotel, and a shuttle to and from each? Rather than spending time organizing each item separately, save money and time by booking them together. Although it may seem like a good way to spend more money, studies show that you actually save money by booking multiple travel items at once in a package deal.

, If you’re a frequent flier, chances are you’ve gathered quite a load of frequent flier miles. These miles are redeemable for, as they suggest, free miles on an airplane to a destination of your choice. Sign up for a frequent flier card via your favorite carrier, or keep track of your miles with an air miles program. With enough saved up, you may even get a free flight!

, That’s right, student discounts go beyond the movie theater and football games these days. Sites like statravel.com focus on finding flights at a discounted rate for students only. Don’t let the high prices of textbooks and tuition prevent you from travelling any longer; keep up with student discounted flights and head off on your adventures whenever you’d like."

Fly out on the right day.,
Fly out at the right time.,
Stick to economy.,
Keep your dates flexible.,
Indirect flights are the way to go.,
Look into neighboring airports.,
Don’t be afraid of the little guy.,
Look into alternative routes.",How to Get Cheap Flights2," Sure, leaving on a Friday promptly after work or heading on vacation on a Sunday after a relaxing weekend might be ideal, but it turns out these are the absolute worst times to fly. High air traffic on these days means that airlines jack up the prices. Plan your flights so that you depart on a Wednesday if possible, followed by a Tuesday or a Saturday. Mid week departures are the slowest, so carriers know they will have to accept lower costs in order to fill their seats.

, As with most of these search related parameters, turns out what we want the least is what makes the cheapest flight. The earlier your leave on a flight, the cheaper it will be. Red eye flights (in the middle of the night) are by far the cheapest, followed directly by early morning flights. Although you might luck out on a rare evening steal, typically the later in the day you depart, the more expensive your ticket will be.

, Possibly the most obvious way to save money on a ticket is to simply sacrifice the desire for creature comforts. You can save hundreds of dollars by flying in 4th or 5th class, rather than opting for 1st or 2nd with any airline. Although leg room and the dinner menu might be lacking, your wallet will thank you for the hefty amount of money you will have saved.

, Many airlines have specific requirements for a minimum and maximum total number of days to be spent in a location in order to get the best deal. For the cheapest flights, stay for a minimum of 2 nights and a maximum of 30. Try to stay at your destination over a weekend, as flights that bookend a Saturday night are cheaper than those that lack a Saturday stay.

, Although layovers can be a hassle - especially if you have several of them - flying indirectly to your location decreases the total cost of your flight. Direct flights are in high demand, and are therefore made more expensive by airlines. Keep at least one layover open as an option, and prepare to save more money by considering multiple layovers for a single flight.

, The nearest major airport is a mere 20 minutes from your house, but several smaller airports are located within an hour’s drive. Rather than relying on the nearest or largest airport only, look into neighboring airports as well. These smaller airports aren’t controlled as heavily by large airline carriers, and have more ability to adjust their tickets and offer lower prices. Spend a few extra dollars to drive to an airport further away, and you may save several hundred on your flight bill., It’s easy, and sometimes perceived as safer, to rely on large airlines as the sole means of air transportation. Instead of only considering large airlines, consider using small budget carriers. These small, area-specific airlines may offer lower prices as an incentive to choose them over the big guys. Do a search of budget carriers in your area or destination and see if they also offer lower prices.

, Slightly different than flying indirectly with layovers, if you aren’t in a time crunch consider taking alternative routes to your destination. If you can get a cheaper flight flying from Seattle to Boston, and then from Boston to London, then book two separate flights. Breaking up your travel will lengthen the amount of time you have to spend journeying to your destination, but it could be one of the best ways to manage saving money."

Narrow down the most affordable times of the year to travel to Italy.,
Run an Internet search for airfare providers.,
Monitor as many sites as you can on a daily basis.,
Look into the possibility of a connecting flight.,
Keep an eye on smaller carriers.",How to Fly to Italy Cost Effectively1," When it comes to airfare, travelers would be wise to consider flying during off-peak tourist seasons. Flights booked from June to early September will almost assuredly result in the highest prices and most crowded trips. April, May, September, October, and the 10 days before Christmas are known as “shoulder season,” where good deals can be had but prices remain high. Flying during low season—November to mid-December and Christmas Day to the end of March—will yield the most inexpensive flights with plenty of seats available.;
, The majority of air travel bookings are conducted online, with dozens of reputable sites to choose from. Stick to the most well-known booking sites, as they tend to have the most user-friendly interfaces and regularly offer seat sales other sites cannot match.

, Flight prices can fluctuate greatly from one day to the next, and some sites will offer seat sales on short notice. By being diligent with your search, you can land a cheap seat to Italy before anyone else finds out. It might also help to create accounts with each site and request to be put on the recipient list for daily emails, nearly all of which highlight seat sales or other promotions.

, Flying directly into Italy may not fit into your budget, but a trip to a neighboring airport might work better. Taking an initial flight to London, Dublin, Frankfurt, Munich, or Paris and then traveling from any of those cities into Italy may be a more cost-effective way of achieving your goal. It likely won’t matter if you must travel during peak season, but during other times of year you should find success.

, While Delta, British Airways, Qantas, United, or American Airlines are among the largest carriers in the world, they won’t necessarily have the best deals available to international destinations. Smaller carriers, such as Meridiana, operate flights from the continental US to Italy and may end up being less expensive than the bigger carriers.

Join an airline rewards program.",How to Fly Standby," Airlines like American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta have different policies regarding standby passengers. These policies reflect fees, treatment of checked luggage, and more. As a result, you should take a minute to read your airline's policies.;
, If your initial goal is to fly standby, you should try to buy the cheapest ticket possible to your final destination. Without a ticket, you won’t be able to clear security and won’t have the ability to take advantage of a last-minute standby opportunity.

Buy a ticket from the specific airline you want to travel on or from discount travel websites like Travelocity, Priceline, Expedia, or Kayak.
Having a ticket to the destination you want to go to is important, as many airlines will not allow you to fly standby unless you're already going to that destination.

, Remember that flying standby is not guaranteed. Thus, you need to be smart about the ticket you purchase. If you won't want to use it, you shouldn't buy it. This is because there is a very good chance you won't be able to get a standby ticket., If you or someone you know works for a given airline, you may be to use a “buddy pass.” This pass will allow you to show up to a gate without purchasing a ticket. Generally, buddy passes are the only way you’ll be able to get through security and to a gate without a ticket.Airlines provide a set number of buddy passes to their employees every year.
Buddy passes may enable users to purchase tickets at a steep discount – sometimes between 30% and 60%.
Depending on the airline, buddy passes may allow the user to check two bags.

, If you’re considering traveling standby ahead of time, you should probably call the airline and let them know. In some cases, airlines will be able to put you on a standby list., In most cases, you should plan to arrive at the airport at least two hours before the flight you want to fly standby on. If the airport is particularly busy, or there have been many flight cancellations, you may want to arrive even earlier. This way, you may be able to get on the standby list for more than one flight.

Your chances of getting a standby seat are much higher on earlier flights – so arrive as early in the morning as you possibly can.

, After you’ve cleared security and arrived at the gate of the flight you want to be on, you should approach the airline representatives at the gate desk and introduce yourself. Let them know that you’re booked for a later flight want to fly standby on their flight. If you’re not already on a standby list, they may be able to put you on one.

Be as polite as possible. Remember, the airline representative is not responsible for flight cancellations or any other issues.

, While you may want to give up as boarding is winding down, you should stay at the gate until the airplane’s door is closed and the flight taxis away from the jetway. This is important, as the flight crew might determine new seat availability at the very last minute.

, If you’re selected as a standby flyer, you will likely have to pay a fee for the privilege. Fees vary by airline, and can range from $25 to $100. However, your fee may be waived if you’re a preferred flyer with that specific airline.

You may also have to pay a fee if you check a piece of luggage.

, Depending on the airline and specific circumstances, your chances of getting a standby seat may be higher if you do not need to check baggage. This is because standby seats are often filled at the very last minute, and there may not be time to check your baggage.


In addition, if an airline does check your baggage, it may be checked on a different flight to your destination.

, When it comes to traveling standby, you’ll have to build in a decent amount of flexibility into your travel plans. Without flexibility, you won’t be able to take advantage of the major benefits of flying standby. As a result, expect the unexpected when flying standby.

Inform anyone that might be expecting you at your destination that you could be early or late.
Make sure connecting flights or other transportation options are scheduled appropriately.
Cancel or postpone hotel accommodations if you’ll be delayed overnight., While it is possible to travel standby with a group, it is very hard to do so. This is because there are usually only a couple of standby seats available on a given plane. If you are traveling standby with a group, your group might get broken up and may be put onto two or more different planes., If you plan to travel standby, try to fly at times when fewer people are flying. This is because the more people flying, the less seats will be available on given flights. In addition, more people flying means more competition for the few standby seats that may be available.Don’t plan to fly standby on holiday weekends, major holidays, or during specific events (like the Super Bowl or Olympics).

, Many airlines will give preferential treatment to members of their rewards programs. Such perks include being moved to the front of the list of standby flyers, paying a smaller fee to fly standby, or getting a free upgrade. Thus, consider joining a rewards program if you plan to fly standby in the future."

Find government fares.",How to Get Military Discount On Flights," Each airline offers a different discount program for military personnel. In order to take advantage of these discounts and find the airline with the best deal, you have to search each airline individually, either by phone or by using a special search engine tool.


A search engine specifically designed for military members looking for discount travel can be found at Militarytravel.com. This will save you the time it would take to contact each airline individually.The discount is usually in a percentage off your ticket price, or as a dollars-off amount.;
, To get some military discounts, individual airlines will require you to create an account. These accounts are usually free, but they help the airline keep track of who is accessing which discounts. Not all airlines require you to sign up for programs, however, so pay attention when you are viewing the discount or talking on the phone to an airline representative.


For example, United Airlines offers a Veterans Advantage Program. Members of the military and their families get a 5 percent discount on flights as well as other benefits. You need to enroll to get savings.Keep in mind that most of these discounts and programs have restrictions about both where you board the plane and its final destination, usually that you have to board in the US.

, Once you have narrowed down which airlines offer military discounts and how much you are likely to receive off with each one, you can ask if you can combine discounts. For example, if you are a member of a frequent flyer program, you can inquire if your military discount would interfere with use of those points.


You can also try to find tickets that are on sale, such as destination packages, and see if you can tack on the military discount.

, Talk to a travel agent who specializes in military travel. A travel agent will know about discounts that are available and can find you the most affordable flights available. Keep in mind, however, that a travel agent does charge a fee for the time they spend researching.


Travel agents are more worthwhile when you need a trip to be set up with an itinerary and booked rooms and restaurants, especially if you are flying with a large group., Space Available Flights, or Space A flights, are also known as “military hops” because you are “hopping” on a military flight when you are on leave. Active and retired members of the military can fly for free when there are empty seats available on a flight. Their dependents are also eligible., Since September 11, 2001, and the Twin Tower attacks, Space A seats have become difficult to locate even for military personnel. As such, you have to do a lot of digging and calling around to find one. There is no online search engine dedicated to finding Space A flights, so it might be matter of who you know and keeping an ear out.

, Since Space A seats are for Department of Defense airplanes (DoD) only, no commercial airlines offer them. You can find schedules of flights by contacting individual military bases to help you find Space A flights, but to keep America safe in the face of increased terrorist activity, flight schedules are no longer published online., As the name suggests, you have to wait for a seat to become available to sit in a Space A seat. This means that you must remain extremely flexible once you find a flight. You may need to camp out at the airport or military base for a while.

, To aid your efforts in finding a Space A seat, aim to fly at unpopular travel times. For example, flights leaving at 5:30 a.m. are a better bet than those that depart at 10:00 a.m. because mid-morning is a much more comfortable time to travel than having to get up early or stay up very late.

, You also want to consider that finding your own discounts can be cheaper than using military discounts. If an airline will only allow you to use one or the other, and the discount that is not military-based is better, you should use the alternative. For example, some airlines require that you only use frequent flyer miles if you aren’t combining other discounts.


If you have a lot of frequent flyer miles, can’t find a Space A seat, and the military discount is low, it is probably in your best interest to use the miles.

, Most airlines offer commercial flight sales at different times of year, such as vacation packages or rates that go down during off-peak hours. Shop around and compare these deals with the military discounts that you have access to. You may not be able to combine the discounts, but it is wise to make sure you use the one that saves you more money.


Before going with one discount or the other, make sure that you can’t combine them by calling the airline directly, or reviewing the FAQ page on their website.

, There is another type of discount that goes unadvertised with most airlines: government fares. These fares area negotiated by the government to leverage cheaper seats for government personnel. These seats are usually for business use only.These seats are often available to military personnel on leave.
These seats do not charge you for changing the flight times.
Keep in mind that usually there is only one airline that has these seats for each individual route.

Check the website of the miles provider you use to confirm how many bonus miles you have.,
Check with your preferred airline to determine how many miles you require for your flight.,
If you are short, look into “mixing and matching.” Some airlines allow passengers to cash in their miles and pay a discounted rate for the remaining “distance” required to reach their destination.,
Cash in your miles.",How to Fly to Italy Cost Effectively2," A quick search using an ID number, login/password, or similar unique identifier can tell you how many miles you’ve accumulated.

, Airlines vary on how many miles they require per flight. The time of year you decide to fly will also factor into the miles cost of the trip. Peak season travel may require as many as 20 percent more miles than traveling during low season.

, As an alternate option, some miles distributors will permit members to purchase additional miles, thereby allowing them to make up the difference between the miles they have and the miles they need., Speak to either your miles provider or your airline to cash in your miles for a ticket. Even having a fraction of the miles required to make your trip will result in savings you otherwise would not have enjoyed.

An agent can set you up with other people who are looking to make a similar trip, thereby facilitating the process more quickly than having to do the legwork yourself.

, Even though the agent can help you find other passengers, you can still help move things along by locating others who would be willing to join you on the flight. The more passengers you can recruit, the lower the cost of the charter will be.

, Make sure you have the proper identification, as you will likely face customs and border inspection upon your arrival in Italy.

Check how many points you need.,
Find the price of the ticket.,
Check how much you’re paying for the extra miles.,
Subtract the cost of the extra miles from the ticket price.For example, your ticket costs $500 and you paid $100 for the extra miles.,
Divide by the number of miles you’ve saved.,
Avoid buying miles if the redemption rate is too low.,
Buy miles when special deals are offered.,
Wait.,
Transfer your miles or points.,
Spend at a mileage mall.,
Switch to a different program.",How to Know if Airline Miles Are Worth Buying," You might have some miles already saved but fall short of what you need to buy a ticket. For example, you might need 15,000 points to get a ticket. You have 10,000 points already, so you’re 5,000 short. Should you buy the 5,000 points?


To find out, you’ll want to identify how much your current miles saved will be worth. This is called the “redemption rate.”;
, Identify what the ticket costs, because you’ll need this information as part of your calculation.Imagine, for example, that the ticket costs $500.

, You need this information as part of your calculation as well.For example, you might need to buy an additional 5,000 points in order to get the ticket. Let’s say the points cost $100 to get.

, You subtract $100 from $500 and get $400.

, In our example, you’ve already saved 10,000 miles. Divide $400 by the number of miles you have saved. This works out to a redemption rate of 0.4 cents per mile—which is a terrible deal.If the redemption rate is only two to three cents a mile, then you basically aren’t getting ahead at all. Airlines generally sell miles at 3 cents per mile. However, the value of the mile is roughly 1.2 cents., It’s a good idea to buy extra airline miles if the redemption rate is at least 10 cents a mile.For example, imagine if the ticket was worth $2,000 instead of $500. If everything else was the same, your saved miles would be worth 15 cents a mile, which is an excellent deal.


If your redemption rate falls between three and ten cents, then it’s up to you whether to buy miles. Consider alternatives first.

, Most airlines have specials where you can earn bonus miles. For example, you’ll buy 60,000 miles and then get 50% (or even 100%) more. Look for these specials, since they reduce the amount you pay per mile.Remember to buy with your rewards credit card. This way, you’ll earn rewards on your credit card as well., Many airlines have eliminated the expiration date on miles and points, so there’s no rush to buy extra miles if you are a little short.Instead, you can continue to accrue miles until you have enough for a ticket.


If you are an infrequent flyer, then things might be different. For example, you might be planning on only one trip for the next ten years. In this situation, you might want to buy whatever miles are necessary to purchase a ticket.

, Your credit card might let you transfer your points to a different card. If you do, you might be able to top off a different reward balance, which is probably a better deal than buying miles., Most airlines partner with retailers, and you can earn points or miles when you shop. If you’re short a few thousand miles, do more shopping at a mileage mall. If necessary, you can start holiday shopping early to rack up miles., The purpose of a loyalty program is to help you save money. If all you do is spend more money to get rewards, then the program probably isn’t for you. Shop around to see if you can find a better one."

Sign up for updates.",How to Find a Cheap Flight from the US to London," Compare major websites for the rates, like Priceline, HotGuzzi.com, Travelocity etc. Note that some sites will show you separate prices for departing and returning flights. So at first they might look cheap. If Site A shows you $550 instead Site B showing $1000 on the first page, sure you would think Site A is cheaper. But remember that $550 you saw was only for departing flight. When you go for choosing Returning flight, there is another $550, so now your total is $1100. Site B comes out cheaper as it showed you final prices for both flights.;
, Flights are cheapest in January and most expensive in July and August. If you keep an eye out for specials you can often find $200 flights from the east coast and $300 flights from the west coast in January, round trip. At the peak of summer, it's often hard to find it for less than $1000 even if you do everything right.

, Don't wait until the last minute, as fares really go up. However, they also can be higher if you try to book too far in advance. Try to arrange it a couple of months before flying.

, It's cheaper to fly on Tuesday or Wednesday than any other days of the week. Booking both your outward and return journeys on one of these days can save you $100 or more when booking a flight.

, Several airlines fly into London Gatwick, and recently two new airlines have started flying from New York and DC to London Stansted.

, Non-US airlines can have significantly cheaper flights, which are made even less expensive with the exchange rate between the Canadian and US dollars (though at the moment, the exchange rate is nearly 1:1, so it's not much of a difference as it once was).

, This is pretty obvious, but there are many websites that will allow you to compare fares.

, Most US carriers require 50,000 miles (80,000 km) for a round trip to London. A penny a mile is a pretty fair price to pay your friends. So if the flights you find are significantly higher than $500, this could be a real win-win for both of you. Keep in mind that it can be hard to find frequent flier seats at the last minute, so book early, and make sure there's a seat for you before you rely on this.

, If you're a student, consider searching the web for ""student travel"" and you should find some decent student-focused travel agencies that usually offer flights from NY to London for $250 roundtrip over the summer.

, If you are flexible on timing, are traveling alone, and don't need to take much luggage, consider courier flights. You'll be expected to dress reasonably smartly, pick up a small package at the airport, and hand it over to an agent at the airport in London - in return you'll get a very cheap fare.

, Many large online booking services offer email or SMS updates should rates decrease or meet your price requirements for flights to a specific location. Do your homework on which sites offer this. Make sure you cancel the subscription after your flight unless you want to continue receiving advertisements.

Fly mid-week.,
Check different times of the day.,
Fly on the holidays.,
Use travel search sites.",How to Choose the Least Expensive Days to Fly," Book your flight on a Tuesday, Wednesday, or Thursday. Since most travelers need to fly on or directly preceding/following the weekend, you can save even hundreds of dollars in some cases by arranging a less crowded, less expensive midweek flight.;
, Browse travel websites, your airline's website, or competing airline websites for the day you've decided on departing. Ticket prices often vary by hour of day - sometimes morning flights are less expensive than afternoon flights, or vice versa.

, Booking your flight on a holiday itself, such as Christmas or Thanksgiving, can surprisingly yield much bigger savings than the day before or after. This is because most people want to get to their destination before the holiday, and will often opt to pay more for an earlier flight.

, These can help you compare airfare by date, time, airline, cabin preference, etc.

Shop around.,
Search airline sites individually.",How to Find a Low Airfare1," Don’t assume that all online travel agencies have the same fares. They don’t. Especially on international fares, one of these online travel agencies could have a fare several hundreds dollars less or higher than another. It is not uncommon for one site to have tickets that aren't even available on another site. Check all the online agencies, and use multi-site search engines.


For example, in one search test, Travelocity was selling seats to London on Virgin for $400-$470 round-trip, taxes included, from east and west coast cities, even for peak summer travel. Those fares were only available on Travelocity, not Orbitz or Expedia (they weren’t even available on Virgin’s own site).;
, Increasingly, some airlines have “private” sales, reserving their very best fares for their own sites. With the exception of Southwest, which sells fares on its own site exclusively, most of the airlines that do this are smaller domestic airlines or large international carriers, but even Delta has done it, and not just for last minute weekend fares.


Alaska, Air New Zealand, Malaysia, Frontier, Qantas, Singapore, SAS, Varig and others are using this strategy.
Low cost carriers like USA3000 and Allegiant Air usually don’t share their fare data with third-party sites at all, although Jetblue fares are included in Travelocity, Cheapair.com and Kayak searches now, and USA3000 fares in Sidestep.

"
"
Try a flexible fare search.,
Combine weekend fares.",How to Find a Low Airfare2," If you’re at all flexible, you can sometimes save hundreds by adjusting your travel dates, often by just a day or two.


Travelocity has one of the most useful flexible date search options in the industry because it searches 330 days ahead; although it no longer includes international flights (of course, it’s limited, as all many online agencies are, by its exclusion of Southwest and several small domestic carriers such as USA3000 and Allegiant Air). To use this feature, simply click on the “Flexible dates” button just below the “to” and “from” boxes on the flight search engine (check these step by step instructions if you’re unsure how this works).
Try Travelocity's Asian affiliate Zuji.com . This contains international flexible searches listed in US dollars (they also show business and first class flexible date results).
Cheapair.com has a flexible search that also goes out 330 days but it charges $10 per booking vs. Travelocity's $5.
Orbitz has a limited flexible date function that searches a span of only 30 days (click on “Flexible dates”).
Expedia does flexible search only between a few dozen major US cities (click on “My travel dates are flexible”).
Sidestep.com and the other major sites have no flexible search capability. Increasingly, individual airline sites are improving their flexible date search functions.
American, AerLingus, Air New Zealand, Spirit, and USA3000 all have decent ones and Southwest and US Airways have good ones.

, Last minute weekend fares are often great deals, but most people don’t realize that they can construct itineraries by combining two of these fares. Let’s say you want to fly from Boston to San Antonio next weekend, and you’ve signed up for all the weekly newsletters alerting you of these deals but there’s no Boston/San Antonio deals listed. However, if there’s a Boston to Atlanta fare for $128 round-trip, and an Atlanta to San Antonio fare for $108 round-trip, then there is indeed a Boston/San Antonio fare as well. Just buy two separate fares (Travelocity and some other sites do a good job of combining weekend fares in this manner). You can even combine such fares on two different airlines, but make sure you leave enough time in between connecting flights in case there’s a delay.

Sign up for Ding fares and Frontier’s fare alerts.",How to Find a Low Airfare3," Southwest offers daily “Ding” deals that pop up on your computer (announced by an audible “ding”, thus the name) that can save a few bucks off their already low fares at http://www.southwest.com/ding. Frontier Airlines has begun sending out similar fares by email. In both cases, the fares expire the same day they’re announced but they’re often good for travel far into the future. Frontier doesn't list its excellent weekend fares anywhere but on their own site at flyfrontier.com.

"
"
Buy hotel air packages.",How to Find a Low Airfare4," It’s often cheaper to buy an air/hotel package rather than airfare alone. By “cheaper”, this means that the total package with hotel is often less than the airfare without the hotel component.


Site59.com is the online leader in this field. Travelocity owns Site59, so you’ll often see “TotalTrip” options on Travelocity just above the airfare-only search results. Don’t ignore these deals! Usually, they work best only if there are two of you traveling, since the hotels are based on double occupancy. They’re especially useful for last minute travel.
Tour operators and your local travel agent also sell packages that might save you money, although not necessarily on last minute deals.

Know when to look.,
Check fares often.",How to Find a Low Airfare5," Some of the best ""blooper"" fares and other low fares show up on Saturday mornings. Here are the best theories as to why this is so:


Airlines can only change fares once a day (around 5 PM) on Saturday and Sunday. So, if you're an airline fare analyst, and you're trying to sneak one over your competition, you'll do it with the last fare change on Friday night, which appears in Travelocity, Orbitz, etc. around 1 or 2 AM on Saturday morning. Your competition can't match your sale fares until the 5 PM Saturday update (those fares appear in Travelocity around 8 or 9 PM that night).
Airfare analysts work under a great deal of pressure, and when they feeling this way, they are they most likely to enter a fare typo into their computer systems. The most likely time for this is probably on Friday night, after a long hard week, with the 10 PM fare update (after all, they're human, they've had a hard week, and mistakes do happen). And these 10 PM fare mistakes stick around until the 5 PM Saturday update, so you have all day Saturday to snag them.

, Because airfares fluctuate like the stock market, you need to check them every day, sometimes two or three times a day, if you’re serious about saving money. Airlines can update domestic fares three times a day during the week (at 10 AM, 12.30 PM, and 8 PM EST), and once on Saturday and Sunday at 5 PM EST (international fares are updated just once a day).


And another little tip: be sure to clear the “cookies” on your internet browser (on Explorer you do this under the “tools” menu and “internet options” sub menu). Why do this? If a fare changes between two separate searches done over time on the same route, some fare search engines may return the results you viewed earlier rather than the new, lower results.

"
"
Combine two separate fares rather than buying one fare.",How to Find a Low Airfare6," Say you’re flying from New York to Eleuthera in the Bahamas. Check on one of the big sites like Expedia or Orbitz for a single fare (for example, JFK to Governor’s Harbor, Bahamas) and then do two separate searches (JFK to Nassau and Nassau to Governor’s Harbor). Since JetBlue flies JFK/Nassau you’ll want to check JetBlue.com separately). Chances are, the two-fare strategy will save you a lot of cash. This fare trick also works for flights to Europe (fly into London or Manchester, UK on one fare and then hop on a discount European airline to reach your final destination) and Asia. To search route possibilities on these discounters, check out the Airfarewatchdog route maps page.


Note, however, that this approach is quite a gamble that only pays off if you manage to make your connecting flight on time. If you don't, it's your problem as opposed to the airlines', to provide hotel accommodation and a new connecting flight. Even in a best-case scenario, you'll need extra layover time to be able to claim and recheck your luggage.

Use an online travel agency.,
Compare your results to a supplier website.,
Try a metasearch engine.,
Use various search tools.",How to Find Cheap Flights Online1," Online travel agencies (OTA) are online booking resources that allow you to conveniently compare airline offerings in one central location just by entering your travel dates and destination.Most OTA's have access to the flight inventory from various airlines which provides a way to view numerous flight options in one location. Because of the large volume of business conducted by the OTA’s they are able to offer you the ability to search for flights without charging you a fee.One of the major benefits of OTAs is that the traveler is often exposed to more options than they knew they had, such as different flights, different routes, or different locations.
Perks include low rates on last minute tickets as well as packaged deals that include drastically reduced rates on hotel or car rentals.It’s important to consider all of your needs and all of your savings options when considering using an OTA.
You should never pay more for a ticket on an OTA site than you would from the airline’s direct website. In fact, many airlines guarantee the lowest rate possible.
Popular OTA sites include makemytrip.com, Expedia.com, and Booking.com.;
, A supplier website is a website that is owned directly by the airline, such as American Airlines or Delta. The decrease in use of OTAs over the past few years has seen a resurgence in people booking flights directly through the airline website. The primary advantage is cost, with more airlines offering special packages or resort credits that are otherwise not offered on third-party sites.Many airlines have spent millions of dollars updating their websites to allow for customization of flight options such as priority boarding or Wi-Fi access. However, these luxuries are often offered at an additional cost.
One of the drawbacks to utilizing a supplier website is that comparing prices can be time consuming and cumbersome.

, Metasearch engines are search engines that pull indices (or the databases of relevant sites) from many search engines such as Google or Bing.This allows the traveler to access a variety of information regarding airlines, flights, and costs all in one central location. The user can then take advantage of any specials, sales, or promotions being offered by an airline. The traveler is routed to the airline website when they are prepared to book their flight.


Popular metasearch engines include Google Flight Search, Hipmunk, and Hopper.One disadvantage is that not all airlines (especially smaller ones) are part of the metasearch engine’s database. For example, Southwest Airlines has opted out of having their prices displayed on such search engines.Another disadvantage is that certain airlines pay to have their information listed at the top of the page, so sometimes the information provided by a metasearch engine may appear biased.

, Though it may be time consuming, it may be worth it to compare prices among OTAs, airline websites, and metasearch engines. By comparing each search, you’ll be able to see if any provider is adding additional fees or if a provider is offering a special promotion.


This works well if your travel plans (date/time) are firm. Otherwise, you could get overwhelmed by all of the options presented.

Buy tickets on an airline that will refund the difference if a fare goes down.",How to Find a Low Airfare7," Let’s say you’ve done your best to find the lowest fare, and then the day after purchase your non-refundable fare goes down $100. Sure, if you ask for it you can get a refund for the difference, providing of course that you don't change the times or dates of your flights (and the only thing that changed was the price); but it’s a little-known fact that some airlines will charge you a “service” or “administrative” fee as high as $100 for domestic fares or from $200-$300 on international ones, wiping out any savings. United, however, will give you the entire fare difference without extracting a fee, as will JetBlue as long as you accept the reimbursement in the form of a voucher good for future travel. Northwest charges just $25, for both domestic and international fares. American and Delta extract the $100-$300 fees; Southwest gives you cash back without charging a fee. Even on these less generous airlines, however, there have been plenty of instances where a polite entreaty will get you a full fare difference refund without the penalties, so it’s worth a try.

Call the company directly.,
Ask the AirAsia representative for your booking information.,
Change or cancel your flight over the phone.,
Write down the information.",How to Check AirAsia Bookings2," AirAsia operates multiple call centers across Asia, Australia and Europe with agents standing by to provide information and answer traveler questions. Visit the AirAsia website or run a search for the company to get the phone number for the nearest call center.AirAsia representatives come from diverse cultural backgrounds and are often fluent in English in order to serve their Western customer base.

, Agents are prepared to share flight and account details for customers in need of assistance. Ask the agent for the information you need.


You might be expected to provide your flight number and/or proof of identity before information can be given over the phone.

, Let the representative you’re speaking to know about any changes or cancellations that need to be made. The airline can make these adjustments for you right over the phone, in most cases.Ask the agent to confirm the status of your booked flight to make sure that there are no surprises once it comes time to depart.

, Take notes on important flight details like flight number, departure time, gate number and seating assignment so that you won’t have to check your bookings repeatedly, unless it’s to make a necessary change.

Search using incognito or private browsing.,
Book your flight 6-8 weeks in advance.,
Use flight points.,
Search for discounts.",How to Find Cheap Flights Online2," When you visit a website to check flight prices, the information is transmitted to the airline website in the form of a cookie. If a particular flight is repeatedly searched, sites will increase the price of the flight to scare you into booking a flight. Use private browsing to avoid a hike in price.If using Google Chrome or Safari, enable incognito by hitting Command (Control if using a PC), Shift, “N.”
For Firefox or Explorer, active private browsing by hitting Command (Control if using a PC), Shift, “P.”
Start with a clean slate for each flight search by closing out the incognito window. Your cookies reset each time your incognito window is closed.

, The best window for booking a flight is 6-8 weeks before your departure. If booking during peak seasons, purchase your flight about 3 months in advance. Avoid booking too early because airlines will often lower fares based on lack of demand. Likewise, avoid purchasing tickets too late because fares typically rise as the departure date approaches.International flights differ slightly. They typically open up for sale about 335 days prior to departure and the price remains relatively the same for a few months. The price slowly begins to increase until about the 90 day mark when prices jump rapidly.Research has found that Tuesday around midnight is the cheapest time to purchase your ticket, with the average savings being about 6%. However, it’s only applicable to 1.6% of the US market.
The “always book at midnight” advice is a myth. Prices actually increase on days that fall later in the week.
Avoid booking later at night and later in the week when the price of tickets has been known to increase. This spike in cost is most likely due to airlines’ sales weeks ending right before the weekend.

, Sign up for an airline rewards program that allows you to collect points and rewards as you travel. You can cash in your rewards for free flights, free upgrades, and free companion tickets. Even if you don’t fly often, you can earn rewards by shopping at partner stores, watching for special offers, or getting a credit card which offers rewards.US based airlines usually partner with other international carriers. For example, a flight on Singapore Airlines could earn you rewards with United Airlines because they are partners.
Airlines partner with major companies to offer rewards based on dollars spent. Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, and Target offer anywhere from 2-4 points per dollar spent and even offer bonuses for monthly totals.
Newsletters often advertise special offers that aren’t noted on an airline’s website. For example, you may earn points just by installing a search tool bar or double points by flying a particular route.
Some credit cards offer travel rewards already. If not, try applying for a travel rewards credit card. Instead of paying cash for bills and other expenses, charge everything to the card to receive rewards for paying bills as usual.

, Take advantage of discounts offered by clubs or organizations of which you may be a member. For example, there are many discounts codes for students. Never be afraid to ask an agent if discounts are available or to use search engines to find promotional (promo) codes.Mailing lists are a great way to get “members only” benefits. Because cheap flight deals are usually only advertised for 24 hours, mailing lists help to ensure that you will be aware of all specials.

Pick the cheapest day to fly.,
Try a budget airline.,
Take alternative routes.,
Be flexible on your destination.",How to Find Cheap Flights Online3," Airline ticket prices vary based on the day of the week, time of the year, and approaching holidays. If your arrival and departure dates aren’t rigid, try flying out during the middle of the week versus weekends. Additionally, try to book early morning or late night flights which are typically much cheaper because few prefer to travel during these times.Even one day of travel can make a difference. Sometimes the cost of an extra night in a hotel is cheaper than the difference in the cost of flights.
Sites like Skyscanner allow you to get a quick visual of prices for the entire month so you can search for the cheapest during any given month., A few years ago, if you wanted to travel between continents you were forced to choose a “major” airline like Delta or American Airlines. The last few years have seen the emergence of budget airlines that offer long-haul routes between continents. In America, there are only a few budget airlines, but in Europe and Asia there are many (the competition has helped to keep prices low). Try budget companies such as WOW air or Air Asia X to find rates as low as $30 one way.These airlines tend to offer fewer perks but what you save in price can more than make up for the lack of extras.
Be very careful to avoid fees. This is how these smaller airlines make money so be sure to follow the rules to avoid gigantic fees.

, There are many so many budget airlines around the world that sometimes it’s more economical to take a low-cost flight to a nearby city, and then take a budget flight to your destination. For example, instead of choosing a direct flight to Amsterdam, try taking a cheaper flight to London, and an even cheaper budget flight from London to Amsterdam.This option does take more work than others as you have to review many different routes and airlines.
Additionally, this option can increase your total travel time, but many believe the savings are worth it.

, This option only works for travelers who are looking to go “anywhere but home.” If you are open to various destinations, you can choose a country or city based on great deals. There are always airline deals on wonderful and exotic destinations around the world; if you’re flexible about your destination, you can always score a great deal.Kayak and Google Flights have features that will show you the cheapest routes and fares based on your airport of departure.

Determine your destinations.,
Determine how many people are going.,
Work out your travel time frame.,
Collect traveler information before you book.",How to Buy Bulk Airline Tickets1," Before you can book bulk tickets, you need to know which cities you will be traveling between. This might be the same two cities on a regular basis if you travel for business, or it might be multiple cities at different times if you’re booking a one-time trip for a large group.


For example, if you travel for business you might need 10 flights between Boston and St. Louis to cover your air travel for 3 months.
If you’re planning a large group trip, you might need a flight between JFK airport, Paris, London, and back to JFK for 30 people.
Consider this information carefully and have it easily accessible when you’re ready to book.;
, If you’re booking business travel for yourself, you know you only need to arrange air travel for one. If you’re booking for a large group, you need to have a final number of travelers before you book.


If you’re booking group travel, you’ll need to know this final number a considerable amount of time before you plan to travel, usually several months.

, You’ll need to know what the time frame is for your travel. If you’re booking business travel, you’ll probably have a regular travel schedule, with set dates each week (or every few weeks). If you’re booking for a group, this might be slightly more flexible, but you’ll need to know roughly how long you plan to spend in each location.


For example, if you’re traveling for business, you might know that you leave Boston every second Tuesday for St. Louis, and that you’ll return from St. Louis the following Friday.
If you’re booking group travel, you might know that you’re leaving JFK for Paris in late May, spending approximately 10 days in Paris before leaving for London, and then spending four days in London before returning to JFK.
If you have any flexibility in your travel dates, you should have this information easily accessible when you’re ready to book.

, Before you can book air travel for other travelers, make sure you have everyone’s information. This includes full legal names, addresses, and birthdays.


Double check the spelling of names if you are booking for others – the names on their tickets must match the names exactly on the IDs they use (driver’s license or passport, etc) for them to be able to travel.

Find a consolidator.,
Check their reputation.,
Check restrictions on bookings.,
Don’t be afraid to ask questions.,
Use a major credit card to book.,
Confirm your reservation with the airline.,
Get a record locator number from the consolidator.",How to Buy Bulk Airline Tickets2," Consolidators are companies that buy bulk plane tickets at wholesale prices directly from airlines, and then sell them at greatly reduced rates to others. Using a consolidator will likely get you a better rate than you could on your own through an airline or travel website.


Some examples of consolidators are: 1-800-FlyEurope, Airfare.com, AirfarePlanet.com, AirlineConsolidator.com, AirTreks, BargainTravel.com, CheapTickets, Economytravel.com, Globester, and TFI Tours.
You can also look for consolidators in the travel section of most major Sunday newspapers.
Consolidators are different than discount airlines – they do not actually own planes, they just have access to deeply discounted tickets.Some travel websites, like Travelocity and Expedia, sometimes offer consolidator fares on certain flights, but they are not actually consolidators. Generally, such websites only offer published fares. Consolidators, on the other hand, offer fares that are not published, and are worked out between the consolidator and the airline., Consolidators pop up and fold quite frequently, so you need to check the reputation of the consolidator that you use. Check to see if they belong to a consolidator trade organization.


Look for membership in organizations like the United States Air Consolidators Association (USACA), American Society of Travel Agents (ASTA), or the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA).You should also check to see if anyone has reported the consolidator you’ve chosen to the Better Business Bureau (BBB). The consolidator should have good BBB reports and scores., When using a consolidator, check what restrictions there are on tickets you purchase through them. When you book with a consolidator, you usually can’t use frequent flyer miles to pay for your ticket. Additionally, the tickets are probably nontransferable and nonrefundable., Make sure you ask plenty of questions while you're purchasing your tickets. Different consolidators have different policies, so you want to make sure you get all the details specific to your consolidator. You can either do this by calling the consolidator's customer service phone number and booking over the phone or using the website's chat box, although calling customer service will probably be faster.


For example, find out if the consolidator has an emergency number to call in case of problems with your travel. Ask what happens if you miss your flights – the original flight or any connections. You should also ask if there are any fees associated with purchasing through them, on top of the price of the ticket.

, If you can, use a major credit card to book your travel through a consolidator. This can be a personal or business credit card. Using a major credit card gives you recourse if you don’t get a valid ticket because you can deny payment to the consolidator through your credit card company., Before you pay for your ticket through the consolidator, contact the airline and make sure they have your reservation in process. This way you know the consolidator is doing what they’re supposed to be doing on their end. You should also check with the airline again after you pay., Once you’ve booked your travel with the consolidator, ask for a record locator number (this might also be a confirmation number). This gives you proof that you booked your tickets through the consolidator and gives you a reference number in case you need to contact the consolidator later."

Purchase a commuter book.,
Look for flat rate tickets.,
Call the airline group reservation desk directly.,
Reserve your flight at the right time.",How to Buy Bulk Airline Tickets3," Some airlines offer what’s called a commuter book (or, alternatively, airpass memberships). Commuter books are books of coupons (usually 10) that can each be redeemed for one one-way flight between two specific airports on that airline. You pay one set amount for the book and can then use the coupons to book flights any time in the future. These are an especially good option if you know you'll need to be traveling frequently between the same places but aren't sure of exact dates yet.The price of the commuter books varies depending on where you’re flying from and to, so it’s best to shop around before you choose one. If you usually fly in one area of the country, look for commuter books through regional, rather than national, airlines.
Once you're ready to book your flight, you'll input your traveler information and seat preference like you would when making any other flight reservation, but instead of putting in credit card information to pay, you'll enter the code off of one of the coupons in your book. Keep in mind that you may have to pay extra for things like flight insurance.

, Some airlines provide flat rate tickets for a limited time. Purchasing a flat rate ticket allows you to buy one ticket that you can use as frequently as you want within a certain time frame. These tickets are more expensive than a regular one-way or round-trip ticket, but it can work out to be much cheaper than booking multiple individual round trips.


Make sure you double check the details of any flat rate tickets you're interested in purchasing: you might be restricted in the airports you can use or the cities you can fly to.
With a flat rate ticket, the booking process works the same way as any other booking, but you would enter the information from your flat rate ticket instead of your credit card information.
There are now third-party apps and subscription services, like OneGo, that allow you to purchase a flight subscription for a set amount per month and give you the freedom to book with more than one airline. These are a great option for very frequent business travelers.

, If you’re booking large group travel, call the airline’s group reservation desk directly. Their representatives have considerable experience booking air travel for large groups, and they can help guide you through it.


Before you decide on one airline, call a few different group reservation desks to compare prices as well as flight details. It might work out that you can get a better rate or better flights if you book the different legs of your flights on different airlines.When you're ready to book a group flight directly through an airline, make sure you have all of the travelers' information in front of you: their full legal names, the type of ID they'll be using, their addresses, and their birthdates. The airline's group reservation agent will need this information to reserve your block of seats and issue boarding passes for all of the members of your group.

, If you’re booking for a group, you want to reserve your flights approximately 8 to 10 months before your planned departure. Airlines release individual seats for specific flights up to a year in advance, but they don’t release groups seats until later.Airlines release group seats at slightly different times, so check the specific timeframe for group seats with your airline.

You can also look up reviews of travel agents on the Consumer Affairs website or the Better Business Bureau.

, Whether you’re booking business flight for yourself or group travel for others, it's best to meet with your travel agent for the first time in person.. This gives you the chance to meet the agent, discuss your specific travel needs, and have a longer conversation than the phone or email allow.

, Make sure you ask your travel agents plenty of questions to clarify the details of your trip. You should know if there are there fees on top of the price of the ticket and if there is a help hotline you can call if your travel plans are disrupted.


You should also ask your travel agent the best way to communicate with them – do they prefer the phone or email? This is particularly important if you need to contact them while you travel., After you’ve met with your travel agent, create a schedule with the due dates for each of the phases of your trip. This includes knowing when you need to have all of the traveler information to the agent, when they need copies of passports/IDs, and when down payments and final payments are due."

Plan in advance and sign up for email alerts about low-fare deals.,
Know the best time in advance to book tickets.,
Know when airfare prices are typically the lowest.,
Use aggregator sites to search for fares.,
Clear out your cache and cookies in between airline searches, especially on different days or weeks.,
For advanced airfare sleuths, consider piecing together flights by hand with cost-saving characteristics.,

After you purchase your ticket, don't unsubscribe from those email alerts!,Airlines keep coming up with promotional fares for their low selling flights.So In case the destination for which the low fare is offered suits you, the airline can send you an email alert during the promotion.It is also advisable to sign up with the airline websites as well",How to Buy Cheap Airline Tickets," To ensure you get the best deals, you should know at least 3 months in advance that you want to take a trip somewhere. If you have a specific destination in mind, sign up for a low-fare alert from Yapta or AirfareWatchdog. Make sure you include nearby departure and arrival airports when you sign up -- you might get more emails, but it'll be well-worth the savings in cost.


If you don't have a specific destination in mind, sign up for email alerts about the cheapest tickets from a particular departure airport (and any nearby airports). AirfareWatchdog also organizes the best prices for flights from a particular city and to a particular city, so you can prepare the most cost-effective, multi-destination itinerary.
AirfareWatchdog has real people, not computers, vet deals they hear about to ensure that the sales to which they alert customers are actually worthwhile.;
, According to studies cited by The New York Times, international flights have been the cheapest 3-5 months in advance, but there is variation among different regions.Domestic flights are a bit trickier to pin-point, but it's a good idea to start searching 3-4 months in advance and see if they get any cheaper week after week -- there have been studies indicating a 6-weeks-in-advance sweet spot for domestic flight booking., Airlines generally release sales for specific routes Monday night because they want travel agencies to catch wind of sales early in the week.Deals are then matched by competitors Tuesday morning. Therefore, your best shot at these deals is by searching for flights Tuesday and Wednesday afternoon or evening.


Keep in mind that fares will be highest on the weekend. Airlines know that's the most convenient time for people to think about vacation plans, so they markup their prices then. Sales released early in the week are also gone by the weekend. Moreover, airlines don't manage their inventory as much on the weekend because they have fewer staffers on hand -- so if a few tickets sell for a specific route, prices will automatically jump higher because computer algorithms perceive an increased demand.It's a good idea to do a cursory search for specific routes of interest on several days of the week (including weekends) at least a before you are planning to book, so you have an idea of how much the tickets cost. That way, you can identify a sale when it appears.

, There are simply too many different airline and travel websites for you to make individual queries in each one, so use Software by Google. It not only aggregates dozens of airline and travel websites to give you the best price, but it also has a low-fare calendar so you can see which are the cheapest days to travel in a 30-day period. You can also easily include nearby airports in your search.


Not every airline/travel website is included in ITA Software, so you may want to visit favorite airlines separately. Also, if you know that a certain airline operates out of a particular destination or specializes in certain routes (e.g., Southwest for flights in the western U.S., Hawaiian Air for flights in the Asia-Pacific, etc.), you may want to make those searches separately to make sure you're not missing the best deals.

AirfareWatchdog allows you to make searches at individual sites with just a few clicks. Search for a flight, and a box will pop up asking you which sites you'd like to visit. Each logo or link you click on will open the search in a new window.
According to FareCompare, the cheapest day to fly is Wednesday, followed by Tuesday and Saturday. Friday and Sunday are the most expensive -- naturally, as many seek weekend getaways. But this can vary among destinations and months, so use a low-fare calendar to be sure you're getting the best price.

, Otherwise, old prices will sometimes display in lieu of new ones, and you may miss out on the best price.

, Here are several methods to consider:


Instead of searching for round-trip tickets, search for two one-way tickets separately. Sometimes purchasing separate tickets on unaffiliated carriers will save you money.
Search for red-eye flights and other unpopular times. Because of supply and demand, it is going to be more expensive to fly during a convenient time like 10 a.m. than in the middle of the night at 11 p.m.
Shop as though you are from another country if flying from one international location to another international location. You may save even more by not purchasing in your home country. For example, let's say you are an American and you want to fly from Thailand to Vancouver, Canada. Your best bet to search for prices in Thailand, not the US, as this fare is best priced from that market. US booking engines typically give a higher price.
If traveling around the holidays, know it is generally cheaper to fly on the holiday itself. People generally want to relax on holidays, and not deal with the hassles of air travel, so tickets are sometimes cheaper then.

,


To find a consolidator that works best for you, research the Sunday travel sections of newspapers in big U.S. cities that have a huge population of the country you want to visit. For example, if you want to travel to Israel, New York Sunday newspapers will probably be your best bet. The Israeli population is big in NY and you will find plenty of consolidators advertising to this community for travel to Israel.
Note that buying through a consolidator may make it difficult or impossible for you to change plans once you have booked your ticket.

, Continue watching those prices just in case they drop significantly below what you paid. If that happens, use Yapta to help you get a refund from your airline.

,  If the airport is very large, it may have several terminals with a number of different check-in desks. There should be a list at every entrance, but if there isn't, you can ask an airport attendant. Every airline has its own travel check in desks. The name of the airline is displayed behind the counters, however the counters may not always be open when you arrive. 


If you're not checking bags and have already printed your boarding pass, you can skip this step and go straight to security.

You will also have to take any laptops or small containers of liquids and gels out of your bags and pass them through the scanner in a tray provided.

, This is in case of delays getting to the airport, checking in, or clearing security.

, Get in line and wait until you are asked to come forward. There is usually a bin that allows you to see if your luggage is small enough to go on the plane or if you have to check it. Also, keep in mind you may only have one piece of luggage and one smaller carry-on item. Have your ID on hand.

, If your luggage to check, place it on the nook in the counter when asked to. The agent will tag it, and either will place it on the conveyor belt behind the counter, or tell you to carry it over to a scanner. If not, tell her you have nothing to check. In either case, she will then hand you your boarding pass unless you printed it online. If you do not have bags to check and checked in online, you can skip this step entirely.

, You will meet a security worker who will check your boarding pass and ID and send you forward (make sure you have a proper ID this varies depending on your state).


You will then wait in line to get to an x-ray machine and metal detector. You will put all of your bags, metallic objects and shoes on the conveyor belt to be scanned. If you have a Ziploc bag of liquids in your bag, remove it to be screened on its own. If you have any objects that would show up on the x-ray as a box, such as a laptop, tablet or video game system, remove it and send it through separately. Take off any jackets or sweatshirts, as those need to be screened as well.
Remove all metal objects, including keys, jewelry, belts, etc. Then, remove your shoes and place them on the belt. If you get confused just ask a security worker politely.

, Replace anything you may have removed from your bag, put your shoes on and leave the security checkpoint.

, Gate numbers are indicators of areas where you will board the plane. The airline agent may have told you your gate number, it might be on your boarding pass, or you can find departure monitors in the area which will have a list of flights and gate numbers. Find your gate, which will be indicated by signs with numbers on them. These are very visible so do not worry.

, Make sure you bring 2 portable chargers that are fully charged because your flight can be delayed by as much as a few hours and in larger airport's wall outlets are taken up fast.

, As you approach the Jetway, you will hand them your boarding pass. It will be scanned and returned to you. Sometimes, the gate agent may tear off and keep a portion of it.

, If you have a smaller bag you'd like to hold onto, simply slide it under the seat in front of you so the area around your feet is clear.

Be advised of the road hazards that may happen.,

Take an Amtrak's Northeast Corridor train or the MARC's (Maryland Area Regional Commuter) Penn Line from BWI Airport to Washington's Union Station.,
Hire a cab to take you the distance from BWI Airport to Washington DC.",How to Get from Baltimore Washington International Airport (BWI) to Washington DC," Between the massive tie-ups near the airport and in DC, getting there could get interesting.;
, From the airport's location on local roads, take Interstate 95 South to the Capitol Beltway. Follow the signs to where 95 and 495 connect (towards Richmond) (If you take Interstate 495 direct, you'll end up with major traffic jams during most weekdays and even most weekends continuing into most evenings.) Follow signs until you reach Interstate 395. Take Interstate 395 into the city. Interstate 395 will terminate as local roads in DC, so be careful of the slowing speed conditions.


Rental cars directly on airport property are sparse. However, if you walk over to the train station, you'll see that there are two Hertz-Rent a Car locations directly around the BWI Airport train station location down ""Amtrak Way"", but walking the path is dangerous since most of that is a separate Interstate (195) that brings you into the city. Call up some cab companies to take you to the Airport.

, At Union Station, you're in Washington DC, but at the Northeast corner of the district.


Amtrak Acela trains don't make stops at Baltimore Airport, but they do run express through this station onwards southbound to Washington-Union Station or northbound to Baltimore-Penn Station.
The Washington Metro makes stops at numerous places around the city, into some places in Maryland and even several places in Virginia. Look for a Metro location nearby the location you'd like to visit and travel from the Metro inside Union Station to that location when you arrive.

All paper Metro maps tell the reader that all memorials aren't directly connected to the Metro, but the Metro can bring them nearby. There are busses however that can bring readers closer to the memorial areas.



, It may be costly, but if nothing else can help get you from one to the other, the cab will be your only other way out.

Consider any problems that your child may have.,
Contact the airport ahead of time.,
Talk to your child about airport security.,
Explain that additional screenings might happen.,
Pack comfort objects in easily-accessible areas.,
Bring plenty of things to do in the airport and airplane.,
Pack sensory items for a hypersensitive child.",How to Get a Special Needs Child Through Airport Security1," Every disability is different, so of course, every disabled child will have different problems. Your child may have a physical disability and require some help getting through security, or they may have a developmental disability such as autism and be hypersensitive to noises and being touched. Make a list of the issues your child might have when getting through airport security. For example, if your child was distracted or overwhelmed, would they be the type to either wander or run away, or would they have a meltdown if put into an uncomfortable situation?


If your child is old enough to understand what's happening and is aware of what problems they already have, try asking them what they think would cause them trouble at the airport. A child with sensory issues, for example, may say that they'd become overwhelmed by all the new stimulus and end up having severe trouble getting through security on their own.
If you've traveled long distances with your child before, even if it wasn't by plane, consider any issues your child had in the past. For example, if you went on a long car trip with your child and stopped somewhere for a break, did they get upset by all the people there?;
, Some travelers with disabilities find it useful to notify the airport, so that they can arrange any assistance ahead of time. This step is optional, and can depend on the type of your child's disability. If you do contact the airport, though, try to contact them at least 72 hours beforehand., If they know what will happen, they are more likely to stay calm and be comfortable with the process. Library books, social stories, movies, and personal anecdotes can help describe the process.


Try to find child-friendly material that has photos or illustrations of airport security. That way, they can visualize what they will experience.

, Sometimes, people get randomly selected to go through additional security. Tell them how it works, so that if it happens, they know that it's normal and okay.

, Try placing them at the top of a backpack or bag, or in a separate pocket of a personal bag. Non-liquid snacks, such as pretzels or crackers, should also be easy to reach. Consider stim toys as well.


Any comfort objects will need to be scanned. They may need to let it go through the scanner, or the personnel may let them carry it with them, depending on the object. If it goes through the scanner with your bags, explain that the comfort object is having an adventure in the tunnel, and they'll come out the other side soon.

, Arriving early will help, so you may be waiting at the terminal for some time. Consider coloring books, phone games, picture books, chapter books, videos, and more. Make sure that the activity isn't something noisy that would disturb others, though; leave extremely loud toys at home if possible, and lower the volume on a child's electronic toys or give them headphones to plug into that toy.


Download several movies or videos onto a tablet on the day before. Start early, in case they download slowly.
Older children may be able to entertain themselves with laptops. There are also adult coloring books they can use.
Bring chargers for any devices. Some waiting areas have charging stations, so you might be able to charge electronics before your flight.

, Earplugs, sunglasses, headphones (noise-canceling or otherwise), hoodies, weighted lap pads, and stim toys can help with an overwhelming environment. Encourage your child to be proactive and stim a lot; it's better to be overly cautious than have a screaming meltdown or shutdown.


Encourage your child to avoid disruptive stims at the airport. Make sure they understand that things like flapping, rocking, and so forth are okay, but that it might be better to avoid louder or more movement-oriented stims such as echolalia, spinning, or pacing. Stimming in and of itself isn't bad for your child to do, but it's important to avoid disrupting other people or slowing down their process of getting through security when doing so.

Arrive at the airport early.,
Expect your child's abilities to waver.,
Keep your child in the loop.,
Consider taking the family through the special needs TSA line.,
Make sure your child is occupied in lines.,
Alert the TSA officers of your child's disability.,
Understand that your child may have to go through additional screening.,
Make sure child has list of any medications, and a letter signed by a doctor.,
Carry a necklace with an I.D.,
Make it clear who is looking after the child.",How to Get a Special Needs Child Through Airport Security2," You do not want to be rushing through every airport procedure; this is likely to upset your child, and stress you out. A general rule of most airports is that you should allow yourself at least two hours to get through security; depending on your child, you may want to arrive earlier than that.


Make sure your child has things to do during the ride there. Some airports, such as LAX, can take a long time to commute to. You don't want a bored child sitting in the car while you're driving.

, With the stress and crowds, your child may have a hard time, and not be as capable as they usually are.Your child may move more slowly, struggle with skills like talking or self-calming, and temporarily ""revert"" to younger behavior (especially if they have a developmental disability).


Be patient, and accommodate your child's extra needs. Remember, this is temporary, and they'll go back to normal once they can unwind. They aren't doing it on purpose.
Be especially careful if your child is epileptic and is prone to seizures. Sometimes, the stress and excitement of the airport can cause your child to have a seizure., Since airports are likely new to your child, it's important to make sure your child understands what's going on. Explain each step as it comes up.


Preparing a picture schedule may be useful.

, Many airports have a short line for passengers with disabilities, so there is less waiting involved. Also, it makes it clear that your family might need some extra patience and assistance.

, Oftentimes, you'll need to wait in long lines to get to airport security, unless you're able to access a security pre-check line. If you can't use a pre-check line, you're going to need to make sure that your child doesn't get bored, overstimulated, or wander off while waiting.

, Once you've arrived at airport security, it's important to let the TSA officers know that you are traveling with a disabled child, especially if it's not immediately obvious (e.g. your child is physically disabled, but doesn't use a wheelchair or walking device). Talk to the TSA officers that are there and discuss how to best help your child through airport security. Some examples of disability accommodation are:Children with intellectual and developmental disabilities (autism, Down Syndrome, etc.) can be permitted to stay with the person or people they're traveling with, rather than getting separated.
Blind or visually impaired children can be assisted through security.
Deaf and hard of hearing children do not have to remove hearing aids or cochlear implants, and can proceed through security like normal.
Physically disabled children that require a device to move around will not be removed from their device. For example, if your child is in a wheelchair, TSA agents will not lift the child out of their chair to get them through security.
A child with a prosthetic limb can get a private screening of their prosthetic if necessary, or have the prosthetic removed and put through the X-ray machine. However, you should only remove the prosthetic if your child is okay with it.
In the case of any disabled child, you may be permitted to carry your child through security if it will make the process easier on your child. However, this may only be feasible with smaller, lighter children.
Be sure to let the agents know if your child has a special device for their disability that may set off the metal detector.

, Sometimes, things don't go as planned, and your child will need to undergo more screening. This can include a pat-down, which can be very upsetting to some disabled children. If you're permitted to, stay with your child during the process, and ask the TSA agent to warn your child of anything they're going to do in language that's possible for your child to understand.

, Put this list with child's medications in a small tote bag with a zipper, in the same bag. The medications must also be in a plastic ziplock sealed bag.


Medications are often not questioned if they are in pill form.

, tag or medical bracelet around the child and have them wear that so it is visible for the attendant to see. This can help cut out all the unnecessary verbal explanations about your child. You can also inform the officers, but the less the better when it comes to airline officials.


If they have a shirt about their disability, like ""Autistic Cutie!"" or ""Diva with Down Syndrome,"" have them wear it.
Script a quick explanation, such as ""My daughter has Down Syndrome and can be frightened in crowds and new situations. Holding her bunny helps keep her calm.""

, If there are several adults in the group, you don't want each person to think that someone else is looking after the child. It can help to explicitly assign someone to the child for each leg of the trip.


One teen or adult should walk at the back of the group, to make sure that no one lags too far behind and gets lost.

, Ride the AirTrain from one building to another. Although it may take a bit of time to go from one terminal to another, if you have some extra allotted time and your connecting flight isn't on a terminal on the other side of the airport, this may save you a few minutes of time.

, The first thing you’ll need to do when you arrive at the airport is to locate your airline. Airports are divided into terminals, and different airlines are housed in different terminals. There are also different terminals for arrivals and departures. You will need to go to the departure terminal for your airline. You can find out what terminal your airline is in by looking online, calling the airport or by asking one of the employees at the airport.


If you are taking mass transportation or having someone drop you off at the airport, make sure you let them know what airline you are flying so they drop you at the correct building.

, Depending on what you’ve packed, you may need to check a bag or two. Most airlines will allow you one carry-on bag, in addition to one hand-held bag (like a laptop case or a purse.)If you are planning to check bags, go immediately to the counter for your designated airline.


If you are not checking a bag, skip this step and proceed straight to check in.
Travelers are allowed to check up to two bags, but there is a weight and size limit on those bags. Check with your airline to see what those weight restrictions are.
Be careful not to over-pack, as going over the weight limit for checked baggage may result in fees of over $75.00., In order to board your plane, you’ll need a boarding pass. If you’ve chosen to check your bags, give your airline attendant your identification and they’ll be able to print out your boarding pass for you. If you’re not checking your bags, you can still go to the attendant for help, or you can choose an easier and faster option.


Some airlines also offer kiosks for self-check in. To use these, all you’ll need is a credit card. Use the credit card to identify yourself and then follow the instructions on the kiosk to print out your boarding pass.Some airlines also give you the option of checking in electronically. If this is the case, you will receive an e-mail 24 hours before your scheduled departure. Follow the instructions in the e-mail to check in for your flight.
Print out a copy of your boarding pass to take with you to the airport. If you have a smartphone, you can open the boarding pass with your phone and use your phone as your boarding pass.

, In order to go through security successfully, you will need to remove your shoes, jacket and belt. If you are wearing any metallic jewelry or accessories, remove these as well, as these will also set off the metal detectors.If you are over the age of 75 or under the age of 13 you will not be asked to remove your shoes also you shouldn't have to remove your shoes if your are TSA PRE CHECK.Check your pockets! Take out keys or anything else made of metal that might set off the metal detector.
Try to remove your excess clothing while you are still waiting. The security line moves very quickly at the end and it’s best to be as prepared as possible. Avoid wearing sneakers with laces or any footwear that is difficult to remove in a hurry.
Once you have made it through security, clear the area and get dressed. Most airports have a designated bench or seating area so you aren’t clogging up the security line as you compose yourself.

, If you are traveling with a laptop, take it out of your packed bag and place it on the conveyor belt to be scanned. Smaller electronic items, like phones, Kindles or small gaming systems will not have to be removed from your bag in order to be scanned. If you are part of TSA Pre-Check, you do not need to remove your laptop from your bag.Make sure to check your pockets to ensure you have not accidentally left your cellphone or iPod inside., If you are planning to pack liquids or gels in your carry-on, they will need to be removed from your bag at security. All liquids traveling with you need to be less than 3 fluid ounces and you will only be able to carry 3. Hence, they call it the 3-3-3 rule. If you bring containers of liquids larger than 3 fluid ounces, they may be taken from you and confiscated by TSA.Members of TSA Pre-Check do not need to remove liquids or gels from their bags.If you have any open bottles (like a water bottle or soda) you will be asked at this point to throw them out. You will be able to buy additional drinks after going through security.
It is generally easiest to keep all your travel cosmetics in one gallon-sized Ziploc bag. That way, when you have to remove them for security, you don’t have to hunt down each individual bottle. Travel sized cosmetics can be purchased at most pharmacies.Do not pack restricted items in your bag. It goes without saying that you will not be allowed to take anything dangerous on to the plane. But there are also non-dangerous items that you cannot pack in your carry-on. For the full list of items you can safely take on a plane, check the TSA website, as it is frequently updated., Once you have successfully made it through security, it’s time to find your plane. Check your boarding pass to see which gate your plane is departing from. Double-check this information on the departure boards that are just outside every security checkpoint. Once you have confirmed your gate number, head over in that direction.


Make sure, before you leave the security area, that you have everything you need. You don’t want to accidentally leave a laptop or jacket behind.
If you’re having trouble locating your gate, ask an airport employee for assistance.

, Many airlines no longer serve food on their flights. If you’re taking a long flight or traveling during a meal, buy some food and drink to take with you on the plane. Try to be considerate of your fellow travelers and don’t get anything too messy or smelly (like tuna or eggs.)

, Once you’ve located your food and your gate, all that’s left to do is wait. If your flight is running late or is delayed for weather or technical difficulties, you may be waiting awhile. Pack something to help you pass the time and stay close to your gate area so you’ll be within earshot when it’s time to board.

Look for low-salt or unsalted chips and nuts.,
Buy fruit or yogurt.,
Get a hummus grab-and-go pack.,
Stock up on granola or protein bars.",How to Choose Healthy Airport Snacks1," You don't want to consume too much salt at an airport, because the sodium could cause problems with dehydration on your flight, but that doesn't mean you can't have a crunchy snack.Crackers are a decent option, and the fiber of whole grain crackers will keep you full on your flight.
If you want potato or vegetable chips, look for an option that's unsalted or lightly salted with sea salt.
Pistachios are a good option if you want nuts, with lower fat and calories than most other nuts and plenty of fiber to help you feel full. However, they are a little messy, so you may not want to get them if you want something you can eat on the plane.
Almonds are another good nut option that will give you a good helping of healthy fats as well as a protein boost.;
, In almost any airport, you can find fresh fruit and yogurt fairly easily at self-serve snack bars or news kiosks. Make sure the yogurt has a resealable lid, and get a small plastic bag to dispose of any fruit leftovers such as an apple core or a banana peel.Apples have fiber to keep you feeling full, as well as plenty of antioxidants. Bananas, which have high potassium and vitamin B6, are another good choice — especially for long flights.
Try to avoid messy fruits, such as oranges, especially if you plan to take it on the plane with you.

, The newsstands and snack bars located all over airports typically stock these healthy snacks, which will give you savory flavor as well as a healthy boost of protein from the chickpeas.Chickpeas also are low in fat, and this snack has relatively few calories and likely won't cause any digestive issues that could turn your flight into a nightmare.
Hummus is thick enough not to spill easily if you want to take it on the plane with you, and many of these packages are designed to be resealable if you don't eat it all at once.

, Granola and protein bars are a fixture at most airport newsstands and snack bars, and can easily be tossed in your carry-on bag for convenience. Get more than one in case of delays.Look for bars with natural ingredients and stay away from those that have added sugar or are loaded with preservatives.
Keep in mind that some granola bars that are sweet or coated in chocolate can have as much fat and calories as a candy bar.

"
Put nuts and dried fruit in your carry-on.,
Bring a single-serving snack tray.,
Make your own salad or sandwich for longer flights.,
Add a few tea bags to your carry-on.",How to Choose Healthy Airport Snacks2," Nuts and dried fruit are just fine to take through airport security, and you shouldn't have to worry too much about them getting crushed as long as you store them in hard-sided containers rather than bringing a bag.Dividing these snacks into individual portion sizes means you'll have a smaller container and won't have to worry about over-eating.
Make sure you choose unsalted nuts. Too much salt can lead to dehydration, especially on long flights.

, Small, single-serving containers of vegetables, cheeses, and fresh fruit typically will go through security okay. You may want to check airport restrictions, especially on international flights.A small bento-style box works well for this and well keep your food separated. Choose vegetables in a variety of colors.
Keep in mind that you won't be able to carry on liquids or gel-like substances, which means you won't be able to pack sauces or dressings for dipping. However, you may be able to pick up hummus at the airport, or buy an individual packet of dressing at a snack or salad bar.
You can bring along small individual packets of nut butters, which meet security restrictions at U.S. airports and many others around the globe.

, If you don't care for airline food and don't want to hassle with airport restaurants, you can always make your own lunch or dinner and take it with you, provided your ingredients are allowed through the security checkpoint.Keep in mind that whatever you bring needs to be able to hold up well being stored at room temperature. Depending on the length of your flight, leafy green salads and certain types of sandwiches may not be the best choice.
Pitas and wraps travel well, and you don't have to worry about them getting smushed in your carry-on.
Grain-based salads with quinoa, barley, or brown rice work well at room temperature, as well as lentil or bean salads. You can try to find salad dressing at the airport, or buy a sealed individual packet less than two ounces and put it in your liquids bag with any toiletries you have in your carry-on.

, Tea bags are typically fine to take through security checkpoints, and that way you won't have to pay for a drink at the airport — just get a cup of hot water and you're good to go.Choose teas that work well with your flight pattern and travel plans. For example, if you're taking a red-eye flight overnight, you might want to include a couple of bags of chamomile tea. Chamomile also works well if you need to calm pre-flight jitters.
If you're going on a long flight to somewhere with a significant time difference, you may want to include a zinger tea or others that will give you an even burst of energy when you reach your destination until you can adjust to the time difference.

"
"
Scope out menus in advance.,
Get your dressing on the side.,
Buy water to stay hydrated.,
Limit your alcohol consumption.",How to Choose Healthy Airport Snacks3," There are many restaurants in airports that offer healthy selections if you need to eat a full meal. Reviewing restaurants close to your gate or terminal in advance can help you save time.Most restaurants make their menus available online. You also may be able to find information about the restaurants in the airport by looking in the flight magazine available on the airplane.
While you typically won't be able to find out specific nutritional information, you can get a sense of what's available and find the healthiest restaurant.
Try to aim for a restaurant that has several menu options you think would work, in case the full menu isn't available when you arrive. Look for steamed or sautéed vegetables, and lean meat that is steamed, broiled, baked, or grilled. Avoid fried foods.
If a meal is going to be served on your flight, call the airline in advance if you have specific dietary needs that you want accommodated. For example, if you're on a gluten-free diet, you can let the airline know that you need a gluten-free meal option.

, If you decide to go with a salad, request that the restaurant serve any dressing separately so you can control the amount you use. The same is true for other sauces, such as on pasta dishes.Avoid thick, creamy sauces and dressings, which typically have more fat and calories. Heavy and creamy sauces also may cause digestive problems or bloating, which will be extremely uncomfortable when you're on an airplane.
If you're planning on taking your meal on the plane with you, make sure the dressings or sauces are in a closed container so you won't have to worry about making a mess.

, Airline cabins are extremely dry, which can lead to dehydration. If you get dehydrated, especially on longer flights, you may end up with headaches, fatigue, and painful muscle cramps.Avoid dehydration by buying a large bottle of water once you pass through security. Drink water regularly — don't wait until you feel thirsty. You may want more than one bottle for long flights.
You also can bring your own (empty) water bottle to fill up before you get on the plane. Many airports have water fountains designed to refill water bottles.

, A single glass of wine or a light beer typically is fine, but drinking too much at the airport (or on the plane) can increase your appetite and lower your inhibitions. This is a recipe for ruining your diet.A single liquor drink also is okay, provided you have it straight or over ice. Stay away from sugary mixers. If you must mix your liquor with something use club soda, which is sugar free and won't add significant calories to your drink.
Keep in mind that alcohol can affect you differently at altitude, which is another reason to limit your intake, even on longer flights and when you don't have to worry about driving a car once you reach your destination.

Start by laying out all the things that you would put in your purse, work bag, tote bag, or school bag.,

If there's a zipper inside your bag that big enough, put important things like your passport and boarding passes in that pocket.,

Put your book-like items in first.,

Pack the main part of your bag.,

After you fit everything in your bag, take out things that you don't need.,

If there's a front pocket with the keychain and pencil holders, stick a pencil and a pen in there, just in case.,

Put things like lip balm, a mini lotion, sunscreen, and eye drops in the front pocket.,

Now you're ready for your trip!",How to Pack Your Handcarry Bag," Lay out all the other things you'll need on the plane like gum, maybe a book, and other things like that.
, That way you will know they are always in the zipper, and you won't have to grope through your bag fearing it was stolen., That way when you're holding your bag, it won't be all bumpy in the back. Then, start fitting your items in., Things like cameras, iPods, and cell phones should be in the main part of your bag. You might put your cell phone on an outside pocket if you're traveling in your country. But if you're going out of the country, there's no point in having your cell phone handy., If the bag feels quite light with only the things you need, that's great!, Hook a few hairbands to the keychain. On the plane, your hair will get frizzy and annoying. To avoid claustrophobic feelings :p, you might want to put your hair up and out of your face., If there isn't a front pocket, put all those things into a little pouch and stick it in your main pocket., Bon voyage!"

Pack something electronic.,

Pack gum/lollipops/Starbursts.",How to Pack a Child's Plane Activity Kit," You will need this when the plane is taking off and landing, as electronics will not be allowed. Books are a staple, as well as small crafts (ex. thread bracelets, coloring books)=;
, If the airline you are traveling on gives free snacks, you may not need to. However, candy is sold all around the airport, and packing it means you don't have to pay outrageous airport prices for it. Unlike going to the movie theatre, this isn't even against the rules.


Pick clean snacks. This isn't the time to be finishing off your leftover chicken wings.

, Music is a good distraction, and, especially important for red-eye flights, an excellent way to help your child fall asleep. On nearly all planes you will not have wifi, so be sure there are some games downloaded that don't need the internet.


Be sure to remember headphones, but if you don't have them, most aircraft sell them.
Make sure it isn't noisy enough to disturb other passengers.

, If the ride is long a pillow and blanket will really help, or your child may wish to bring a stuffed animal.


Whatever you bring should be washable. Airplanes are not the cleanest of places, and Mr Stuffins probably shouldn't be going directly from one to being pressed up against your child's face in their bed.

, Airplanes can be cold.

, Because of the size of their ear canals, changes in pressure affect small children even more than adults. Save it for when you are landing, and then give it to them. It will force them to swallow and help the descent be less painful.

",How to Make the Best of a Long Haul Flight (Youth)," Even within the same section, some seats are better than others. For instance, you may want to sit far from the lavatory because of the smell and the noise.;
, Just sitting there will drive you crazy. Pack a carry on bag with some in-seat entertainment items. These items do not have to occupy you the entire flight. Most long haul flights are overnight, so chances are you will sleep. Anyway, pack a carry-on. This carry on bag can be: a small roll-on bag, a duffel bag, a backpack, or a messenger bag. Make sure whatever you bring is small enough to fit in the overhead bins or under your seat. Fill the bag with small items that will keep you occupied. Some of these items may be:


Electronics: iPod, tablet, phone, computer, DS, portable DVD player, etc. If you use an electronic device that is capable of communication, you must put it on airplane mode (unless you are connecting to in-flight WiFi). If you want to use an iPod or DVD player, make sure you load good music and movies to pass the time. Always have headphones with you.
Books: Don't get library books because you may lose them. Buy a book, bring books from home, or download eBooks. Books are a great way to pass time on planes, as long as you don't get motion sickness.
Puzzle Books: Sudoku, crossword puzzles, word searches, logic puzzles, or other puzzles. The jumbo-books with multiple types of puzzles are preferred, because you have a variety.
Paper and pens/pencil: you can draw or write. Consider writing in a journal while you are on an airplane. If you like to draw, you may want to bring other tools such as erasers or rulers.
Schoolwork or something else productive. You probably won't want to be working, but the flight is a good time because it won't be taking away from other fun time.
Magazines: make sure they are new and up-to-date. This is similar to books. If you have a pen, you can draw on the faces of people you don't like and do the puzzles or quizzes in the magazine.

, Although airplane food is provided on long haul flights, you will definitely want more than that, and if you are a picky eater, this is a must. Do not rely on buying snacks on the plane, because these are expensive and limited. Pack dry, non-messy, foods such as chips and popcorn. Keep in mind that liquids are not allowed through airport security, so you will have to buy water after you get past the security checkpoint. Some good airplane snacks are:


Popcorn
Chips
Granola Bars
Raisins

, Although this may be difficult, there are many things you can do to make it easier. You can:


Bring noise-cancelling headphones. These are expensive, but if you can, it is worth it.






Recline your seat as far as you can. Be mindful, if the person behind you has long legs, make sure they are comfortable before you recline.






Bring a neck pillow. They are extremely comfortable and make a big difference.






Get a window seat so you don't have to constantly get up to let people out. However, only do this if you won't be getting up often yourself. This will be annoying to the people near you.






Use an eye mask- they don't always turn off the lights in the cabin






Bring a blanket if it fits in your carry-on. Make sure it is light but warm. Although some airlines provide blankets, they are often unclean and not very warm.







, Many planes are equipped with video screens On some planes, these screens have games, movies, music, or even live T.V. Before your flight, try to find out what on-board entertainment your flight is equipped with.

,


Loose, cotton, light clothing is the best option.
Wear fuzzy socks. These will keep your feet warm, because chances are you will take your shoes off.

, Only do this if you really need to. Otherwise, you will be a nuisance. Use these opportunities to go to the bathroom. Important: only use the bathroom on the plane if you absolutely must! They are unsanitary and disgusting. Use the bathroom in the airport just before you get on the flight, even if you don't think you need to. If you must use the bathroom in the air, be sure to put paper on the board, lock the door, and only go when there is no turbulence and the pilot allowed you to move.

, Some airlines have a video that provides some stretches to help you stay comfortable. Some stretches you can do are:


Ankle rolls






Point and flex you toes






Tense and loosen your muscles systematically






Neck rolls






Arch your back







, You don't have to buy anything, but browse through the magazine. Who would you buy what for? What do you want? This will kill some time.

, This may sound stupid, but within your mind, there are hours of entertainment. Wonder, imagine, ponder, think! This can fill the space of hours.

, Use these before going to sleep and when you feel unclean. These items include:


Deodorant. This is just a pleasantry for your plane-mates
Mouthwash. You won't want a ""yucky"" taste in your mouth
Toothbrush and toothpaste: brush your teeth in the airplane bathroom. Don't use the water to wet the brush, though.
Hairbrush and hair ties (if you have long hair). This way you can tie it back if you get hot.
Hand sanitizer: planes are unsanitary.
Moisturizer: The air on the plane is really dry, and you don't want to have dry skin because it is itchy and sometimes painful.
Eye drops: this is especially important if you have contacts. If not, still bring them. Your eyes may become dry and painful, and you will want these.

, I know, this may sound revolutionary, but try making conversation with your parents. If this is too difficult, try your siblings. As a final resort, attempt to talk to the people around you. Only do this if they seem to be as bored as you, and seem friendly. Make sure not to give away personal information, as you do not know them. You can use conversation starter cards for ideas of what to talk about.

, Read up on things you are interested in.

, This will prevent some serious medical complications.

, You are stuck on the plane and there is nothing you can do about it.

Consider using ear plugs.,
Let your child cry it out and then try to distract her.",How to Keep Your Child's Ears from Popping While on a Plane," Before getting on the plane, explain to older children about ear popping. If children have an expectation that something will occur, it won’t shock them as much when it occurs.;
, If your child has severely blocked Eustachian tubes or is very congested, your doctor might recommend delaying the flight.


If your child is congested and you can’t delay the flight, it is still safe for your child to fly. Monitor their condition and give them extra fluids and age-appropriate medicine (such as infant pain reliever or children’s ibuprofen) to make them as comfortable as possible.

, Be sure to check with your child’s doctor before administering ibuprofen. Follow the dosage instructions on the box.


Children younger than six months shouldn’t take ibuprofen without consulting a doctor, but they should be safe to take infant ibuprofen-free pain medicine.
Older babies and toddlers can take the recommended dosage based on their age and weight on the package., Drinking water also loosens nasal mucus, which is one of the reasons ear tubes get clogged and painful.


Have your child start drinking water or juice before getting on the airplane so his tubes are clear before takeoff.

, Having something that will help to distract your child may keep her from crying as much.


For younger children, bring your child’s favorite toy, but make sure that it does not make noise that will disturb other passengers.
For older children, bring a tablet on which your child can watch a movie or play games. Bring headphones so that the noise from the tablet does not bother people sitting around you.

, Ear popping is caused by the change in pressure between what we are used to on the ground and the different pressure in the air. It is most common during takeoff and landing. The Eustachian tube in the ear tries to regulate pressure between the eardrums, but because children have smaller Eustachian tubes, their risk of ear popping and pain are slightly higher.Strain on the ear tubes can cause pain, but it typically only lasts a few minutes. However, children with colds or ear infections may have clogged ear tubes, which makes it difficult to regulate pressure and can make the entire flight quite painful.

, Having something in your mouth increases swallowing and alleviates ear pain from pressure changes. For younger babies, have them suck on a pacifier or drink a bottle during takeoff and landing. Older children can drink water or eat chewy snacks like fruit snacks or gummy candy.The chewing and sucking is what really helps alleviate ear pressure, so give your kids something that will take them a while to chew.

, Sleeping causes people to swallow less, which allows pain to build. When you child is awake they can be distracted by other activities to help them swallow and remain calm.

, This method works best for older children. Encourage them to yawn during takeoff and landing. Stretching the jaw helps remove inner-ear pressure., This is done by closing the mouth while pinching the nose closed. Then, your child should try to gently blow through her nostrils; this should help to equalize the air pressure in her ears., Most children will pull at their ears if they are experiencing painful ear pressure.

, This also helps lessen ear discomfort and clogging since it made out of silicone rubber and has a filter that helps equalize changes in air pressure.


Make sure that you check the package for product details, as there earplugs specifically designed for children, and others that are designed for adults.

, If your child, especially a baby or toddler, is crying and distressed because of ear pain, talk to them in a calm voice, sing a song, or play with a toy to distract them from the pain.If nothing else, remember that crying is actually an effective way to balance inner and outer ear pressure and will alleviate some of the pain.

, Use the restroom at the airport before getting on the plane. Don't consume an excessive amount of fluid before getting on the plane, and avoid diuretic drinks such as coffee or alcohol. If you suffer from nausea or vomiting on planes (usually called airsickness), get a doctor to prescribe you an airsickness medication (if needed). This way, you won't need to use the airplane toilet excessively.


Obviously, if you're on a long flight, it's impossible to completely avoid the airplane toilet, so this isn't your sole option.

, If the noise of the toilet flushing frightens you, just use the toilet quickly, but don't flush it yet. Wash your hands, unlock the door, and then flush the toilet and get out of the restroom.


For those who don't like flushing toilets because of the germs on the button, put something over your finger (e.g. a paper towel) when pressing the button, so you don't need to wash your hands again. Alternatively, use hand sanitizer afterwards (if some is available to you).

Consider socializing with other children.",How to Keep a Toddler Busy on an Airplane," Toddlers ask a million questions, and it will help if you are prepared to answer your child’s questions about air travel at his or her level. Consider learning about the parts of the plane, for example, and how high and fast it flies – you’ll be able to explain all this to your toddler during the flight.;
, Before you fly, tell your child what will happen on the plane and how you want him or her to behave. Children are calmer and happier when they know what to expect.


If your child has never been on an airplane before, consider getting a children’s book about flying. This strategy will help you explain your expectations in advance, and once it’s time for the actual flight, your child will find the situation more familiar (and perhaps less frightening).

, Children tend to be nervous, grouchy, and easily upset when they are too tired. Plan for a full night’s rest before your flight, even if that means adjusting your toddler’s usual bedtime.


You might be tempted to time the flight so that your child is sleepy when you board, but this strategy can backfire. The excitement of the airplane may keep your toddler awake, and then he or she will be overly tired (and probably very cranky).

, Hunger also makes toddlers cranky. Some flights do serve meals and snacks, but it’s best not to rely on whatever the airline might provide. Bring some easily transportable foods that you know your child will like.


Dry cereal, granola bars, string cheese, applesauce cups, bananas, and nuts appeal to most children and are easy to throw in a carry-on bag. If healthy eating is important to you, there’s no reason to resort to cookies or potato chips.

, Books, small toys, crayons, and stuffed animals are easily stowed in a carry-on bag and will come in handy on the flight.

, In addition to well-loved favorites, it’s a good strategy to buy or borrow a few new toys for your child to discover on the plane. Happy surprises can go a long way to making a toddler content and cooperative.

, If your child still wears diapers, make sure he or she is freshly changed before the flight; if your child is out of diapers, use the restroom right before boarding. This will minimize the number of times you’ll have to deal with these issues on the plane.

, The books, toys, games, or stuffed animals that you packed are likely to keep your child occupied, at least for a little while.


Consider taking these items out one at a time to maximize the length of time your child will be happily occupied. You can read a book together first, then take out a toy to play with, then bring out a stuffed animal to cuddle with, and so on.
Your toddler will be happier – and the time will pass more quickly – if you play with these books and toys together. Don’t just hand your son or daughter some crayons! Spend some time coloring together or teaching your child how to draw something new – maybe an airplane!

, Use whatever materials are available – foil, paper, plastic cups, whatever – to create new toys and distractions for your child.

, If you have your laptop, you can pull up some cartoons or educational programs for your child to watch; if you have your MP3 player, you can let your child listen to some music.


If you are going to use electronics, be courteous and have your child wear headphones to avoid disturbing other passengers.

, Get out some of the snacks that you’ve packed in your carry-on luggage, and offer them one at a time to your child. Snacks will keep toddlers temporarily happy and occupied.


Do not overdo the snacks, especially if you think your toddler might be susceptible to motion sickness. You don’t want to make him or her sick.

, If you are seated near another toddler, let the children play together. They can exchange toys or just talk; either way, the flight is likely to pass more quickly.

Get a good night’s sleep.,
Strike up a conversation with a fellow passenger.,
Plan ahead.",How to Handle Air Rage1," Being tired is often the straw that breaks the camel’s back in a stressful situation. Being tired and grumpy on top of experiencing the stress and anxiety that flying brings can make you experience rage you wouldn’t normally otherwise. Getting a good night’s sleep before your flight, especially if it takes off in the early morning, can stop you from seeing red.


Improve your own sleeping habits by increasing the comfort in your bedroom at home. Use blackout curtains, lower the temperature, and ensure that your mattress is comfortable and supportive. Turn off electronic devices at least 30 minutes before bed to fall asleep easier.If you’re taking an overnight flight, try to bring the comforts of home with you on the plane. Place ear plugs, a sleeping mask, and a comfy blanket into your carry-on bag, and wear them when you are trying to sleep. Doing so may make the rest of your night more enjoyable.;
, Sometimes, just talking with someone can help to quell your feelings of rage. Chances are, the person sitting near you might welcome a distraction as well. Instead of flying off the handle, start talking to someone around you about something positive. Choose a general topic that you think might be of interest to both of you. Doing so will make you feel better and could prevent air rage.


For example, you could ask the person about the purpose of their visit to your destination city and share your reason for the flight as well. Try saying something like, “Hi. My name is Rick. What’s yours?” “So, are you traveling for business or pleasure?” and “What are your plans for your visit?” After getting to know each other, this could lead to other conversation topics, such as hobbies, pets, family, etc.
Opening up a line of discussion in this way will likely make the person laugh and feel comfortable with you. Then, you may have the chance to talk off your stress and feel better in the end., Part of the reason people get so stressed when flying is because something they weren’t prepared for occurs. Delayed flights, lost luggage, a lack of rental cars, and long check-in lines can start your trip out on the wrong foot. By taking care of what you can before you step into the airport and arming yourself with as much information as possible, you may be able to avoid the extra stress.


Do what you can to avoid having to deal with employees by checking in online and using a kiosk for your luggage. Also, signing up to receive text updates about your flight status and booking your rental car ahead of time can leave you feeling prepared and confident about what lies ahead."

Acknowledge and accept your discomfort.,
Ask for help.,
Listen to music.,
Count and breathe deeply.,
Examine the consequences.",How to Handle Air Rage2," It is normal to feel fear and frustration. If you are feeling, angry, anxious, restless or something else, give yourself a moment to acknowledge how you are feeling.

Say comforting things to yourself like, ""It is okay that I am nervous,"" and ""I can cope and manage my feelings.""

, If the child behind you is kicking your chair constantly, or the person in front of you is being loud and obnoxious, ask the flight attendant to say something to encourage them to stop. Part of a flight attendant’s job is to keep everyone on the flight comfortable. This can include attempting to stop a few rowdy passengers from ruining the flight for everyone else.


Approach the subject quietly and politely. Simply tell the flight attendant that you are unable to enjoy your flight because there are a few people who are being loud or acting inappropriately, and ask if they would mind encouraging them to stop. Chances are the flight attendant will take swift action and hopefully the passengers will heed their advice., One of the best things about flying is that you are able to distract yourself. Listening to music can not only take your mind off of what is going on around you, but it can help you to calm down. Put on your headphones, close your eyes, and try to get your mind off of what is angering you.


Select your music wisely. While you may love an explosive beat or a fast-paced song, listening to it may get you pumped up even more. You may want to opt for slow and calming music to help you relax., Slowing down and counting to 10 when you’re angry may seem like a cliché, but it actually works. Additionally, taking deep breaths can help to calm your mind and decrease your rage. Although these exercises may not remove the situation at hand, they can help you handle it better.Breathing tends to quicken and become shallow when you are stressed. Making a conscious effort to breathe slowly and deeply can help to reduce your anxiety.
To breathe deeply, take a long, deep breath in through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and then exhale through your mouth. Repeat this exercise several times to help calm yourself. You can also try saying the word relax to yourself silently as you exhale.

, Antics on a plane don’t just end in the air. If the passengers or staff feel threatened by you, they may call the police, who will meet you upon landing. You could face charges or get arrested for your actions. Before you allow your stress and anger to take over, think about what may happen if you do."
